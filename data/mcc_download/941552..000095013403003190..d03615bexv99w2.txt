herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the Lessor and the
Lessee hereby agree as follows:

and overhauled in substantially the same manner as required under this Lease
without in any way discriminating against such airframe.

         "ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATE ENGINE" means a General Electric CF6-50E2 engine
or an engine of the same or another manufacturer of equivalent or greater

an operating lease and returned to the lessor) which is in effect on the date of
calculation and has a remaining term of one year or more on the date such
aircraft was intended to be used in connection with such ACMI Contract (subject
to cancellation terms, which may include the right to cancel on six months
notice). When making any calculation on a Pro Forma Basis, effect shall be given
to the acquisition of an ACMI Contracted Aircraft by adding to the appropriate

Leases on such date), then such excess amounts shall be paid by the Agent to the
Lessor at its above-referenced office.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
any date on which a payment of Rent becomes due and payable is not a Business
Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day;
provided, however, that if any date on which a payment of Rent becomes due is
not a Business Day and is a day of the month after which no further Business Day
occurs in such month, then the payment of Rent shall be made on the next
preceding Business Day. No interest shall accrue on the amount of any payment
made on the Business Day next succeeding the regularly scheduled Basic Rent
Payment Date, if such payment is made on such next succeeding Business Day
because the original date of payment was not a Business Day (it being understood
that the amount of Basic Rent includes Rent for such day).

                  (e)      Minimum Rent. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding,

                  (i)      each installment of Basic Rent, whether or not such
         installment has been adjusted pursuant to Section 3(b), together with
         all prior Basic Rent due and payable on such date and all accrued
         interest thereon shall be, under all circumstances and in any event, in
         an amount at least sufficient for the Lessor to pay in full principal
         and interest on the Loans relating to the Aircraft required to be paid
         by the Lessor on or within five Business Days of the due date of such
         installment of Basic Rent; and

                  (ii)     payments of Stipulated Loss Value shall be, under any
         circumstances and in any event, in an amount that (when taken together
         with any other Basic Rent due and payable in connection therewith) is
         at least equal to, as of the date of payment, the sum of the aggregate
         unpaid principal of and accrued interest on the Loans relating to the
         Aircraft and all other unpaid Obligations of the Lessor (other than
         principal and interest on Loans relating to other aircraft or spare
         engines and after taking into account all other payments of Stipulated
         Loss Value pursuant to the other Leases on such date).

                  (f)      Prepayment of Rent Payments:

                  (i)      In the event that the Lessor is at any time required
         to repay Loans relating to the Aircraft pursuant to Section 2.4C(ii) of
         the Credit Agreement, the Lessor shall notify the Lessee of such
         required prepayment and the Lessee shall immediately prepay an amount
         of Basic Rent equal to the amount of such required prepayment less any
         required payments of the Loans relating to the Aircraft actually made
         by the Lessor from



                                      -23-
<PAGE>
         Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds (as each such term is
         defined in the Credit Agreement) received directly by the Lessor.

                  (ii)     The Lessee shall also be permitted to prepay Basic
         Rent voluntarily at any time and from time to time, without premium or
         penalty, upon not less than three Business Days' prior written or
         telephonic notice to the Lessor and the Agent.

                  (iii)    In the event of any prepayment pursuant to this
         Section 3(f), the schedules of Basic Rent and Stipulated Loss Value
         shall be adjusted so as to preserve the after tax yield and after tax
         cash flows of the Lessor and, to the extent consistent therewith, to
         minimize the net present value of Basic Rent payments. All such
         computations shall be made on the basis of the same assumptions and the
         method of computations employed in the original calculations of Basic
         Rent and Stipulated Loss Values (except to the extent that such
         assumptions have been changed as a result of such prepayment or any
         prior such adjustment). At the Lessee's written request, independent
         public accountants mutually selected by the Lessor and the Lessee shall
         confirm the required adjustments. The final determination of any
         adjustment hereunder shall be set forth in amendments to this Lease,
         executed and delivered by the Lessor, the Lessee and consented to by
         the Agent. The reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the verifying
         accounting firm shall be paid by the Lessee.

                  Anything contained in the foregoing to the contrary
         notwithstanding, after giving effect to the foregoing adjustments, the
         revised Basic Rent and Stipulated Loss Values shall permit the Lessee
         to comply with Section 3(e) hereof.

                  SECTION 4. Certain Representations and Warranties. THE LESSEE
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, AS BETWEEN THE LESSOR AND THE LESSEE (A) THE
AIRFRAME AND EACH ENGINE ARE OF A SIZE, DESIGN, CAPACITY AND MANUFACTURE
SELECTED BY AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE LESSEE AND THE LESSEE TAKES THE SAME "AS IS,"
(B) THE LESSEE IS SATISFIED THAT THE AIRFRAME AND EACH ENGINE ARE SUITABLE FOR
ITS PURPOSES, (C) THE LESSOR IS NOT A MANUFACTURER OR A DEALER IN PROPERTY OF
SUCH KIND, AND (D) NEITHER THE LESSOR NOR THE AGENT NOR ANY LENDER MAKES, HAS
MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, AND EACH WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMED, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE,
AIRWORTHINESS, VALUE, CONDITION, DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR USE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY PART THEREOF, AS TO THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE
ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK, COPYRIGHT OR OTHER
PROPRIETARY RIGHT, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF OBLIGATIONS BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY IN
TORT, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY PART THEREOF, except that the Lessor
covenants that it will not, through its own actions or inactions, in such
capacity, interfere in the Lessee's quiet enjoyment of the Aircraft unless this
Lease shall have been declared or deemed to have been declared in default
pursuant to Section 17 hereof. None of the provisions of this Section 4 or any
other provision of this Lease shall be deemed to amend, modify or otherwise
affect the representations, warranties or other obligations



                                      -24-
<PAGE>
(express or implied) of any manufacturer, any affiliate thereof, any
subcontractor or supplier of any manufacturer or any affiliate thereof, with
respect to the Airframe, Engines or any Parts, or to release the manufacturer,
any affiliate thereof, or any such subcontractor or supplier from any such
representation, warranty or obligation. Unless a Default or Lease Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessor agrees to make
available to the Lessee such rights as the Lessor may have under any warranty
with respect to the Aircraft made by the manufacturer or any affiliate thereof
or any of its subcontractors or suppliers and any other claims against the
manufacturer or any affiliate thereof, or any such subcontractor or supplier
with respect to the Aircraft, all pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of any applicable purchase agreements or warranty agreements.

                  SECTION 5. Lessee's Representations and Warranties. In order
to induce the Lessor to enter into this Lease and the Agent and the Lenders to
make the Loans under the Credit Agreement, the Lessee represents and warrants to
the Lessor, the Agent and each Lender on the date of this Lease that the
following statements are true, correct and complete:

(a)      ORGANIZATION, POWERS, QUALIFICATION, GOOD STANDING, BUSINESS AND
         SUBSIDIARIES.

         (i)      ORGANIZATION AND POWERS. The Lessee is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Lessee has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and
operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, to enter into this Lease and the other Transaction
Documents and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

         (ii)     QUALIFICATION AND GOOD STANDING. The Lessee is qualified to do
business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its assets are located

had and will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (iii)    SUBSIDIARIES. All of the Subsidiaries of the Lessee as of the
Initial Borrowing Date are identified on Schedule 5(a)(iii) annexed hereto. The
capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries of the Lessee identified in Schedule
5(a)(iii) annexed hereto (as so supplemented) is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and none of such capital stock constitutes
Margin Stock. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Lessee identified in Schedule
5(a)(iii) annexed hereto is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation
set forth therein, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, and is qualified to do business and in good standing
in every jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary to
carry out its business and operations, in each case except where failure to be
so qualified or in good standing or a lack of such corporate power and authority
has not had and will not have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 5(a)(iii)
annexed hereto correctly sets forth the ownership interest of the Lessee and
each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of the Lessee identified
therein.

         (i)      AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Lease and the other Transaction Documents have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Lessee
or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

         (ii)     NO CONFLICT. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Lessee or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, of this Lease and the other

Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries or any order, judgment or decree of any court
or other agency of government binding on the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) conflict with in any material respect, result in a material breach of or
constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under
any material Contractual Obligation of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
any Liens created under this Lease or any of the other Transaction Documents in
favor of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders), or (iv) require any approval of
stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person under any Contractual
Obligation of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such approvals
or consents as will be obtained on or before the Initial Borrowing Date and
disclosed in writing to the Lessor and the Lenders.

         (iii)    GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Lessee and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, of this Lease and the
other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Lease and the other Transaction Documents do not and will
not require any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or
other action to, with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority
or regulatory body that has not been obtained or made on or prior to the date
required to be obtained or made.

         (iv)     BINDING OBLIGATION. This Lease and each of the other
Transaction Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Lessee and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to the extent that it is a party thereto, and
is the legally valid and binding obligation of each such Person, enforceable
against each such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles
relating to enforceability.

(c)      FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         (A)      The Lessee has heretofore delivered to the Lessor, the Agent
and the Lenders, the following financial statements and information: the audited
consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries
as at December 31, 1999, and the related consolidated and consolidating
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Lessee and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended. All such statements were prepared
in conformity with GAAP and fairly present the financial position (on a
consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities
described in such financial statements as at the respective dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows (on a consolidated and, where
applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities described therein for each of
the periods



                                      -26-
<PAGE>
then ended, subject, in the case of any such unaudited financial statements, to
changes resulting from audit and normal year-end adjustments. Neither the Lessee
nor any of its Subsidiaries has (and will not, following the Initial Borrowing
Date, have) any Contingent Obligation, contingent liability or liability for
taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that is not
reflected in the foregoing financial statements or the notes thereto and which
in any such case is material in relation to the business, operations,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the
Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries.

         (B)      Except as fully disclosed in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 5(c)(A), there were as of the Initial Borrowing
Date no liabilities or obligations with respect to the Lessee and its
Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to be material to the Lessee and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As of the Initial Borrowing Date, the Lessee does not know of
any basis for the assertion against it of any liability or obligation of any
nature whatsoever that is not fully disclosed in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 5(c)(A) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to the Lessee and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(d)      NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE; NO RESTRICTED JUNIOR PAYMENTS.

         Since December 31, 1999, no event or change has occurred that has
caused or evidences, either in any case or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Since December 31, 1999, neither the Lessee nor any of its Subsidiaries
has directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum
or property for, any Restricted Junior Payment or agreed to do so, except as
permitted by subsection 7(e) hereunder.

(e)      TITLE TO PROPERTIES, LIENS.

         The Lessee and its Subsidiaries have (i) good, sufficient and legal
title to (in the case of fee interests in real property), (ii) valid leasehold
interests in (in the case of leasehold interests in real or personal property),
or (iii) good title to (in the case of all other personal property), all of the
properties and assets reflected in the financial statements referred to in
subsection 5(c) or in the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to
subsection 6(a), in each case except for assets disposed of since the date of
such financial statements in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise
permitted under subsection 7(g). Except as permitted by this Lease, all such
properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

(f)      LITIGATION, ADVERSE FACTS.

         There are no actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations or governmental
investigations (whether or not purportedly on behalf of the Lessee or any of its
Subsidiaries) at law or in equity or in admiralty or before or by any federal,
state, municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau,
agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, pending or, to the knowledge of
the Lessee, threatened against or affecting the Lessee or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Lessee nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i)
in violation of any applicable laws that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
subject to or in default with



                                      -27-
<PAGE>
respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules or
regulations of any court or any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(g)      PAYMENT OF TAXES.

         Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6(c), all tax returns and
reports of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by any of them
have been timely filed, and all taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental
charges upon the Lessee and its Subsidiaries and upon their respective
properties, assets, income, businesses and franchises that are due and payable
have been paid when due and payable. The Lessee does not know of any proposed
tax assessment against the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries that is not being
actively contested by the Lessee or such Subsidiary in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings; provided, that such reserves or other appropriate
provisions, if any, for liabilities for taxes as shall be required in conformity
with GAAP shall have been made or provided in the financial statements of the
Lessee. There are no agreements with respect to taxes between the Lessee and any
tax agency or authority.

(h)      PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS.

         Neither the Lessee nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any of its Contractual Obligations, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(i)      GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

         Neither the Lessee nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the
Interstate Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or under any other
federal or state statute or regulation that may limit its ability to incur
Indebtedness or that may otherwise render all or any portion of its obligations
under the Transaction Documents unenforceable.

(j)      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         The Lessee maintains a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code and a medical benefit plan. The Lessee's 401(k)
Plan has no unfunded liabilities in excess of $10,000,000, and the Lessee is in
compliance with all applicable provisions and requirements of ERISA and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan and has performed all of its obligations under such
Employee Benefit Plan in all material respects. The Lessee has no Employee
Benefit Plans, other than its 401(k) Plan, the medical benefit plan, and the
plan described in Section 7(b)(iv). The Lessee has no ERISA Affiliates that
sponsor, maintain, contribute to or are liable with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plans.



                                      -28-

(k)      CERTAIN FEES.

         No broker's or finder's fee or commission will be payable with respect
to this Lease or any other Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(l)      ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

         (i)      All facilities and operations of the Lessee and its
Subsidiaries are, and have been to the best of the Lessee's knowledge, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws.

         (ii)     There are no, and have been no, conditions, occurrences, or
Hazardous Materials Activity, (a) arising at any facilities owned or operated by
the Lessee or (b) arising in connection with the operations of the Lessee or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the transportation of Hazardous Materials), which
conditions, occurrences or Hazardous Materials Activity could reasonably be
expected to form the basis of an Environmental Claim against the Lessee and
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (iii)    To the best of the Lessee's knowledge, there are no pending or
threatened Environmental Claims against the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries,
and neither the Lessee nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notices, inquiries, or requests for information with respect to any
Environmental Claims.

(m)      EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

         There is no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(n)      SOLVENCY.

         The Lessee and each of its Subsidiaries is and, upon the incurrence of
any obligations by the Lessee under the Leases, will be, after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, Solvent.

(o)      DISCLOSURE.

         No representation or warranty of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries
contained in this Lease or any other Transaction Document or in any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to the Lessor, the Agent or
the Lenders by or on behalf of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Lease and the other
Transaction Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact (known to the Lessee, in the case of any document not
furnished by it) necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were
made. Any projections and pro forma financial information contained in such
materials are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the
Lessee to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lessor, the
Agent and the Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be
viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by
any such projections may differ from the



                                      -29-
<PAGE>
projected results. There are no facts known (or which should upon the reasonable
exercise of diligence be known) to the Lessee (other than matters of a general
economic nature) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and that have not been disclosed
herein or in such other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Lessor, the Agent and the Lenders for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(p)      REGISTRATION AND FILING; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE.

         (1)      Except for the registration of this Lease and the Lease
Supplement with the FAA and the filing of a financing statement under the
Uniform Commercial Code in Colorado, it is not necessary or advisable under
Colorado law or the law of the State of New York in order to ensure the
validity, effectiveness or enforceability of this Lease or to protect the rights
of the Lessor in the Aircraft or any part thereof that any other instrument be

law or the law of the State of New York, the rights of the Lessor in the
Aircraft will have priority in all respects over the claims of all creditors of
the Lessee other than certain claims by landlords of hangars, materialmen,
mechanics and warehousemen in respect of the Aircraft that have priority under
Colorado law.

         (2)      The Lessee's chief executive office (as that term is defined
in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in Colorado) is located
at 538 Commons Drive, Golden, Colorado 80401, and the records of the Lessee

         condition of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries as at the dates indicated

and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at all times preserve and keep in
full force and effect its corporate existence and all rights and franchises
material to its business; provided, however, that the corporate existence of any
such Subsidiary may be terminated if such termination is in the interests of the
Lessee and its Subsidiaries and is not materially disadvantageous to the Lessor
or to any assignee



                                      -34-
<PAGE>
of the Lease. The Lessee will at all times maintain its corporate existence as a
United States Citizen.

(c)      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS; TAX CONSOLIDATION.

         (i)      The Lessee will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, pay all
taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon it or any of its
properties or assets or in respect of any of its income, businesses or
franchises before any penalty, fine or interest accrues thereon, and all claims
(including, without limitation, claims for labor, services, materials and
supplies) for sums that have become due and payable and that by law have or may
become a Lien upon any of its properties or assets, prior to the time when any
penalty fine or interest shall be incurred with respect thereto; provided, that
no such charge or claim need be paid if being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and if such
reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, with respect to any liability
for taxes, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made
therefor in the financial statements of the Lessee.

         (ii)     The Lessee will not, and will not permit any of its

to be maintained in good repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, all material properties used or useful in the business of the
Lessee and its Subsidiaries and from time to time will make or cause to be made
all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements thereof. The Lessee will
maintain or cause to be maintained, with insurers of recognized responsibility
and reputation, insurance with respect to its properties and business and the
properties and businesses of its Subsidiaries against loss or damage (including,
without limitation, flood insurance, if necessary or advisable) of the kinds
customarily carried or maintained under similar circumstances by corporations
engaged in similar businesses.

(e)      INSPECTION; LENDER MEETING.

         The Lessee will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, permit any
authorized representatives designated by the Lessor, the Agent or any Lender to
visit and inspect any of the properties of the Lessee or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Aircraft or any part thereof and any Engine, and its
and their financial and accounting records, and, with the permission of the
Lessee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to make copies and take
extracts therefrom, and to discuss its and their affairs, finances and accounts
with its and their officers and independent public accountants (provided, that
the Lessee may, if it so chooses, be present at or participate in any such
discussion), all upon reasonable notice and at such reasonable times during
normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested, provided, so
long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, that
such inspection is not disruptive to the Lessee's business, as reasonably
determined by the Lessee. The cost of any such inspection shall be borne by the
Lessee if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if the Lessee is
thereby shown to be in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder, and
otherwise by the



                                      -35-
<PAGE>
party making the inspection. Neither the Lessor, the Agent nor any Lender shall
have any obligation to make any inspection. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Lessor (or its authorized representative) may attend any Airframe maintenance
visit, APU shop visit, landing gear shop visit or Engine shop visit. The Lessee
shall provide the Lessor not less than twenty days' prior written notice of any
such scheduled visit; provided, that if a scheduled visit is to occur less than
twenty days after the scheduling thereof, the Lessee shall provide written
notice of such scheduled visit promptly upon the scheduling thereof. Without in
any way limiting the foregoing, the Lessee will, upon the request of the Lessor
or the Agent, participate in a meeting of the Agent and the Lenders once during
each fiscal year to be held at the Lessee's corporate offices (or such other
location as may be agreed to by the Lessee, the Lessor and the Agent) at such
time as may be agreed to by the Lessee, the Lessor and the Agent.

(f)      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC.

         The Lessee will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the
requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any
governmental authority (including, without limitation, Environmental Laws),
noncompliance with which could reasonably be expected to cause a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent the Lessee from performing its obligations hereunder.
The Lessee shall not conduct, and shall not permit the conduct of, any Hazardous
Materials Activity at any facility or at any other location that could
reasonably be expected to form the basis of an Environmental Claim against the
Lessee and that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(g)      LESSEE'S REMEDIAL ACTION REGARDING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

         The Lessee will promptly take, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
promptly to take, any and all necessary remedial action in connection with the
presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation or Release of any Hazardous
Materials on, under or about any facility in order to comply with all applicable
Environmental Laws and Governmental Authorizations. In the event that the Lessee
or any of its Subsidiaries undertakes any remedial action with respect to any
Hazardous Materials on, under or about any facility, the Lessee or such
Subsidiary will conduct and complete such remedial action in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws, and in accordance with the policies, orders and
directives of all federal, state and local governmental authorities except when,
and only to the extent that, the Lessee's or such Subsidiary's liability for
such presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation or discharge of any
Hazardous Materials is being contested in good faith by the Lessee or such
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease,
the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may engage in the transportation of Hazardous
Materials in the ordinary course of business so long as such is conducted in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, and all other applicable
laws, policies, orders, directives and regulations.

(h)      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         The Lessee will not establish or permit to be established any Employee
Benefit Plans for the Lessee or any of its employees and will not permit any
ERISA Affiliate to establish any Employee Benefit Plan that, in either case,
could reasonably be expected to result in a liability for the Lessee, under
Title IV of ERISA or the minimum funding standards of Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, in excess of $20 million.



                                      -36-

(i)      CORPORATE SEPARATENESS.

         The Lessee will take all such action as is necessary to keep its
operations separate and apart from those of the Holding Company or any of its
Affiliates, including, without limitation, ensuring that all customary corporate
formalities, including the maintenance of separate corporate records and
documents and holding regular meetings, are followed. Any financial statements
distributed to any creditors of the Lessee shall clearly establish the corporate
separateness of the Lessee from the Holding Company and each of the Holding
Company's other Subsidiaries. The Lessee shall not take any action or conduct
its affairs in a manner that is likely to result in the corporate existence of
the Lessee on the one hand and of the Holding Company or any Subsidiary of the
Holding Company on the other hand being disregarded, or in the assets and
liabilities of the Holding Company or any Subsidiary of the Holding Company
being substantively consolidated with those of the Lessee in a bankruptcy,
reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.

                  SECTION 7. Lessee's Negative Covenants. The Lessee covenants
and agrees that, so long as any amounts remain owing under this Lease, the
Lessee shall perform, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to perform, all
covenants in this Section 7.

(a)      INDEBTEDNESS.

         The Lessee shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to create, incur, assume or guaranty, or otherwise
become or remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to, any
Indebtedness, except that:

                  (1)      the Lessee may become and remain liable with respect
         to the obligations under the Amended Aircraft Credit Facility;

                  (2)      the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may become and remain
         liable with respect to Contingent Obligations permitted by subsection
         7(d) and, upon any matured obligations actually arising pursuant
         thereto, the Indebtedness corresponding to the Contingent Obligations
         so extinguished;

                  (3)      the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may become and remain
         liable with respect to Indebtedness in respect of Capital Leases;
         provided, that such Capital Leases are permitted under the terms of
         subsection 7(i);

                  (4)      the Lessee and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, may
         remain liable with respect to Indebtedness described in Schedule
         7(a)(4) annexed hereto;

                  (5)      the Lessee may become and remain liable with respect
         to Permitted Extension Indebtedness, provided that, with respect to any
         transaction in which Permitted Extension Indebtedness is incurred with
         respect to any Financed Aircraft, the cash proceeds from such Permitted
         Extension Indebtedness are sufficient to repay in full the Indebtedness
         associated with such Financed Aircraft;

                  (6)      so long as no Default or Lease Event of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom and the
         Lessee delivers an Officers' Certificate to



                                      -37-
<PAGE>
         the Lessor, the Agent and the Lenders, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Lessor and the Agent, confirming that, on a Pro
         Forma Basis after giving effect to such incurrence of Indebtedness, (i)
         the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (less Cash and Cash Equivalents
         held by the Lessee in excess of $25 million) as of the last day of the
         most recently ended fiscal quarter (the "Determination Date") plus
         seven times Consolidated Rental Payments for the four fiscal quarter
         period ending on such Determination Date to Consolidated Adjusted
         EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Payments for the four fiscal quarter
         period ending on such Determination Date does not exceed the ratio set
         forth in subsection 7(f)(ii) for the fiscal quarter in which such
         Indebtedness is to be incurred, (ii) the ratio of Consolidated Adjusted

         becomes a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Lessee or (ii) such Person is

could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any
Material Agreement to be amended or otherwise modified in any manner with
respect to any provision providing material representations and warranties to
the Lessee, indemnification rights to the Lessee, or limiting the Lessee's
remedies or rights upon the other party to such agreements failing to perform.

(i)      RESTRICTION ON LEASES.

notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee shall not enter into any New Aircraft
Lease unless (A) the Lessee has delivered to the Agent an originally executed
officer's certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, stating
that the terms of the New Aircraft Lease Documents relating to such New Aircraft
Lease are not less favorable to the Lessee in any material respect than the
terms described in the Boeing Term Sheet and (B) the term of such New Aircraft
Lease does not expire prior to the first anniversary of the Final Maturity Date,
and; provided further, that the Lessee shall not agree to any amendment to such

         The Lessee shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, become or remain liable as lessee or as a guarantor or

such lease; provided, that the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may become and remain

(including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any holder of 10% or more of any
class of equity Securities of the Lessee or with any Affiliate of the Lessee or
of any such holder, on terms that are less favorable to the Lessee or that
Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that might be obtained at the time
from Persons who are not such holders or Affiliates; provided, that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) reasonable and customary fees paid
to and indemnification of members of the Boards of Directors of the Lessee and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) reasonable and customary salaries, bonuses and other
compensation paid to and indemnification of employees of the Lessee or any of

not, directly or indirectly, enter into any leases of aircraft to or from GSS,
the TNT Entity, or any holder of 10% or more of any class of equity Securities
of the Lessee or with any Affiliate of the Lessee or of any such holder or of
GSS or the TNT Entity (any such lease, a "Specified Lease") unless such lease is
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor and the Agent. In
addition, the Lessee shall not enter into any amendment, consent, waiver,
supplement, or other modification with respect to a Specified Lease that could
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse in any respect to the Lessee,
the Lessor, the Agent, or the Lenders without the prior written consent of the
Lessor and the Agent (which consent shall be given or withheld by the Agent in
its sole discretion within ten Business Days after such proposed amendment,
consent, waiver, supplement, or other modification has been received by the
Lessor and the Agent together with any related documents reasonably requested by
the Lessor or the Agent). In any event, the Lessee shall provide the Lessor and
the Agent with a copy of any amendment, consent, waiver, supplement, or other
modification with respect to any Specified Lease within fifteen Business Days
after the execution thereof.

         In the event that the Lessee enters into any Specified Lease, the
Lessee shall deliver an originally executed officer's certificate, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Lessor and the Agent, stating that such Specified
Lease is on terms no less favorable to the Lessee than those that could have
been obtained in an arm's-length transaction with unrelated third parties.
Promptly upon receipt by the Lessee of any fairness opinion required under the
Senior Note Documents, the Lessee shall deliver a copy of such opinion to the
Lessor and the Agent.

(l)      DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARY STOCK.

         The Lessee shall not:

                  (1)      directly or indirectly sell, assign, pledge or
         otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of capital stock or other
         equity Securities of any of its Subsidiaries, except to qualify
         directors if required by applicable law or to a wholly-owned Subsidiary
         of the Lessee; or

                  (2)      permit any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly
         to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares
         of capital stock or other equity Securities of any of its Subsidiaries
         (including such Subsidiary), except to the Lessee, another wholly-owned
         Subsidiary of the Lessee, or to qualify directors if required by
         applicable law.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessor shall be permitted to issue
preferred stock in an amount not to exceed $100,000 to a third party.

(m)      CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

         From and after the Initial Borrowing Date, the Lessee shall not, and

the businesses engaged in by the Lessee and its Subsidiaries on the Initial
Borrowing Date and similar or related businesses.

change its chief executive office without giving 30 days' prior written notice
to the Lessor and the Agent.

(o)      HOLDING COMPANY.

         The Lessee shall not permit the Holding Company to create, incur,
assume or guarantee, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable
with respect to, any Contingent Obligation (other than the Holdings Guaranties,
the Amended Aircraft Credit Facility Guaranty, the guaranties of Polar Air's
obligations under the Polar Leases, so long as the terms of such Polar Leases
are not less favorable to Polar Air in all material respects than the terms in
effect on the date of the Credit Agreement Third Amendment, and the guaranty of
any future lease or sublease of a 747-400 aircraft bearing manufacturer's serial
number 30812, so long as the terms of such lease or sublease are not less
favorable to Polar Air in all material respects than the terms described in the
Polar Term Sheet) or Indebtedness (other than the GE Capital Loans and the GSS
Pledge) and will not engage in any business or activity or own any assets other
than (i)(x) holding the capital stock of the Lessee, GSS, and any Subsidiaries
of the Holding Company and performing its obligations incidental thereto, (y)
investing an amount not to exceed $2,000,000 in GSS and performing its
obligations incidental thereto, and (z) investing an amount not to exceed
$500,000 in the aggregate at any time outstanding in Equitime, a business
organization to be formed to provide insurance to airlines, or in a similar
entity formed for the same purpose, and performing its obligations incidental
thereto, (ii) employing certain management employees and pilots and performing
its obligations incidental thereto, (iii) paying general administrative costs
and expenses in the ordinary course of business, and (iv) such other activities
as may be consented to from time to time by Requisite Lenders under the Credit
Agreement.

                  SECTION 8. Return of the Aircraft

                  (a)      Condition Upon Return. Unless the Aircraft has been
sold pursuant to Section 21, if at any time the Lessee shall return the Aircraft
to the Lessor hereunder, the Lessee, at its own expense, will return the
Aircraft to the Lessor at a location specified by the Lessor to the Lessee in
writing. At the time of such return, (i) the Lessee will cause the Aircraft to
be in compliance with the maintenance covenants contained in this Lease and (ii)
the Airframe will be fully equipped with the Engines installed thereon.

                  At the time of such return, such Airframe and Engines (A)
shall have an airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration
and shall be in full compliance with the provisions of Federal Aviation
Regulations, Part 121 (or successor regulation), and shall be in material
compliance with all applicable FAA noise, corrosion, environmental and aging
aircraft requirements, (B) shall be free and clear of all Liens and (C) in the
case of the Aircraft, shall be in a full freighter configuration and in as good
condition as when originally delivered to the Lessee, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and otherwise in the condition required to be maintained under the
Lessee's FAA-approved maintenance plan; and in all such cases the Aircraft shall
not have been discriminated against as compared to other aircraft owned or
leased by the Lessee whether by reason of its leased status or otherwise in
maintenance, use, operation or in any other manner whatsoever.



                                      -51-
<PAGE>
                  (b)      Overhaul and Repair. The Airframe, Engines and all
Parts shall have been, and shall be properly documented to have been, repaired
or overhauled by certified repair stations acceptable to the FAA.

                  (c)      Repairs. The Lessee shall ensure that all repairs
performed since the Initial Borrowing Date on the Aircraft are eligible to
receive approval by the FAA (or its designee), if so required. All such repairs
shall be accompanied by all data and documentation necessary to substantiate
their certification, approval and methods of compliance, as required.

                  (d)      Modifications. All modifications performed since the
Initial Borrowing Date that deviate from the certified configuration and that
are still in existence on the Aircraft shall have approval or certification by
the FAA (or its designee) or certification if required. All such modifications
shall be accompanied by complete data and documentation necessary to
substantiate their certification and approval and methods of compliance.

                  (e)      Airworthiness Directives. All FAA Airworthiness
Directives and amendments or changes to the Federal Aviation Regulations
applicable to the Airframe, Engines (or Acceptable Alternate Engines) or Parts,
as well as all mandatory service bulletins applicable to any of the foregoing,
shall have been accomplished by terminating action in compliance with the
issuing agency's or the manufacturer's specific instructions, as the case may
be, taking into account, any waiver, deferral or deviation from such directives,
regulations or bulletins.

                  (f)      Return of the Engines. In the event that an
Acceptable Alternate Engine shall be delivered with the returned Airframe, the
Lessee, concurrently with such delivery, will, at no cost to the Lessor,
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Lessor a full warranty (as to title)
bill of sale with respect to each such Acceptable Alternate Engine, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor (together with an opinion of
counsel to the effect that such full warranty bill of sale has been duly
authorized and delivered and is enforceable in accordance with its terms and
that such Acceptable Alternate Engines are free and clear of all Liens) against
receipt from the Lessor of a bill of sale evidencing the transfer, without
recourse or warranty by the Lessor to the Lessee or its designee of all of the
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any Engine not installed on the
Airframe at the time of the return of the Airframe.

                  (g)      Deferred Maintenance. There shall be no open,
outstanding or deferred maintenance items, scheduled or unscheduled, against the
Aircraft including those identified in pre-delivery inspections or test flights.

                  (h)      Corrosion Treatment. At the time of return, the
Aircraft shall have been maintained by cleaning and treating all mild and
moderate corrosion and correcting of all severe or exfoliate corrosion in
accordance with the Lessee's approved maintenance program or manufacturer's
structural repair manual.

                  (i)      Manuals. Upon the return of the Aircraft upon any
termination of this Lease, the Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Lessor all logs, manuals and data and maintenance, inspection, modification
and overhaul records and similar records required to be maintained with respect
to the Aircraft and Parts under FAA rules and the Aircraft maintenance program
(the "Technical Records"). If any such logs, manuals, records or other data are
missing, incomplete or otherwise not in accordance with FAA standards applicable
to



                                      -52-

the Lessee, the Lessee shall re-accomplish the maintenance tasks necessary to
produce such records in accordance with its approved maintenance program prior
to delivery of the Aircraft or otherwise perform all necessary acts (without
regard to any applicable waivers or deferrals) to obtain such records in a
manner satisfactory to the FAA and the Lessor.

                  (j)      Storage Upon Return. If, at least 15 days prior to
termination of this Lease at the end of the Term or pursuant to Section 17, the
Lessee receives from the Lessor a written request for storage of the Aircraft
upon its return hereunder, the Lessee will provide the Lessor, or cause the
Lessor to be provided, with storage facilities for the Aircraft at the Lessee's
risk and at the Lessee's expense for a period not exceeding 30 days, and
thereafter at the Lessor's risk and at the Lessor's cost for insurance,
maintenance and the Lessee's out-of-pocket expenses for such storage for a
period not exceeding 90 days (provided, that if such termination occurs as a
result of a Lease Event of Default hereunder, such storage shall be at the cost
of the Lessee), commencing on the date when the Aircraft is returned
substantially in the condition required under this Section 8, at a location in
the continental United States selected by the Lessee and used by the Lessee as a
location for the long-term parking or storage of aircraft.

                  (k)      Severable Parts. At any time that the Aircraft is to
be returned to the Lessor, the Lessee shall, at the Lessor's request, advise the
Lessor of the nature and condition of all severable nonproprietary Parts (other
than Parts otherwise required by Sections 10 or 11 to be maintained on the
Aircraft) owned by the Lessee have been used by the Lessee during the prior six
months and that the Lessee has or intends to remove from the Aircraft in
accordance with Section 11 hereof. The Lessor may, at its option, upon 30 days
notice to the Lessee, purchase any or all of such nonproprietary Parts from the
Lessee upon the expiration of the Term at their fair market value.

                  (l)      Survival. The obligations of the Lessee to comply
with the terms of this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or other
termination of this Lease.

                  (m)      Deregistration and Export. At such time as the Lessee
is obligated to redeliver the Aircraft to the Lessor pursuant to this Lease, the
Lessee shall at its expense upon the request of the Lessor:

                  (i)      promptly take all such steps (not including procuring
         the discharge of any Lessor's Liens) as may be necessary to cancel the
         existing registration of the Aircraft (subject to the Lessor giving, or
         procuring that any mortgagee of the Aircraft gives, such notices and/or
         required consents to the cancellation of such registration) and obtain
         and deliver to the Lessor all certificates relating to the Aircraft
         required by applicable law on any transfer of or alteration to the
         registration thereof;

                  (ii)     provide to the Lessor all assistance as the Lessor
         may reasonably request so as to enable the Lessor to obtain any
         documents (including, without limitation, any export certificate of
         airworthiness) required by applicable law in relation to the export of
         the Aircraft from the state of registration or such other country in
         which the Aircraft is for the time being located and shall re-assign or
         otherwise confirm to the Lessor the benefit of any indemnities or
         warranties available to the Lessee from the manufacturer or any other
         supplier or manufacturer of the Airframe, Engines or any Part; and



                                      -53-
<PAGE>
                  (iii)    provide to the Lessor such assistance with respect to
         information and documentation as the Lessor may reasonably require so
         as to enable the Aircraft to be registered and certified as to
         airworthiness under any applicable laws and/or regulations of any
         country other than the state of registration; provided, that the Lessor
         shall reimburse, the Lessee for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
         incurred in providing such assistance.

                  SECTION 9. Liens. The Lessee will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien, on or with respect to the
Aircraft, title thereto or any interest therein, except the lien of the Aircraft
Chattel Mortgage and Permitted Encumbrances. The Lessee will promptly, at its
own expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge any such
Lien not excepted above if the same shall arise at any time.

                  SECTION 10. Registration, Maintenance and Operation;
Possession and Subleases; Insignia.

                  (a)      Maintenance and Operation. The Lessee, at its own
cost and expense, until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, (i)
will be a "citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 40102(15) of
Title 49 of the United States Code and will be an air carrier certificated under
Sections 401 and 609 of the Federal Aviation Act and hold all necessary air
carrier operating certificates; (ii) will cause ownership of the Aircraft to be
duly registered and remain duly registered with the FAA in the name of the
Lessor in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act and otherwise registered
under all applicable laws of the United States so as to be eligible to operate
in commercial air service under the Federal Aviation Act; and (iii) will
service, repair, inspect, test, maintain and overhaul the Airframe and each
Engine, install replacement equipment and parts on the Airframe and each Engine
and maintain the Technical Records (A) so as to keep the Airframe and each
Engine in such operating condition as may be required to permit the Airframe and
each Engine to be utilized in commercial operations in the United States, (B) so
as to enable the airworthiness certification of the Airframe to be maintained in
good standing at all times under the Federal Aviation Act, except when aircraft
of the same type, model or series as the Airframe (powered by engines of the
same type as those with which the Airframe shall be equipped at the time of
grounding) registered in the United States have been grounded by the FAA;
provided, however, that if, following its issuance, the United States FAA
airworthiness certificate of the Aircraft shall be withdrawn, then, subject to
the provisions of Section 13 hereof, so long as the Lessee is diligently taking
or causing to be taken all necessary action promptly to correct the condition
that caused such withdrawal, no Lease Event of Default shall arise from such
withdrawal, (C) in accordance with the Lessee's FAA-approved maintenance,
inspection and maintenance control programs, and in the same manner and with the
same care used by the Lessee with respect to the same or similar aircraft and
engines owned or operated by the Lessee so as to keep the same in as good
operating condition as when originally leased hereunder, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, which practices shall at all times be at or above the standard of the
industry in the United States for prudent maintenance of similar equipment, (D)
in such manner as may be necessary to maintain in full force all warranties of
the manufacturers thereof, and (E) to enable the Lessee to deliver the Aircraft
to the Lessor in accordance with Section 8. The Lessee shall maintain all
records, logs and other materials that may be required to permit the Airframe
and each Engine to be so utilized.



                                      -54-
<PAGE>
                  The Lessee will comply in all material respects with all
airworthiness directives, mandatory notes or modifications or similar
requirements affecting the same (including those issued by the manufacturer or
supplier) in such condition so as to comply with this Lease and the rules and
regulations of the FAA from time to time in force and applicable to the Aircraft
and Engines. Neither the Airframe nor any Engine will be maintained, used or
operated in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or order of any
government or governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign),
or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration
relating to the Airframe or such Engine issued by any such authority, and in the
event that such laws, rules, regulations or orders require alteration of the
Airframe or any Engine, the Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will conform
thereto or obtain conformance therewith and will maintain the same in proper
operating condition under such laws, rules, regulations and orders, provided,
however, that the Lessee may, in good faith (after having delivered to the
Lessor and the Agent an Officers' Certificate stating the facts with respect
thereto), contest the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation
or order in any reasonable manner that does not, in the Lessor's and the Agent's
opinion (in their sole discretion), adversely affect the interests of the
Lessor, the Agent or any Lender.

                  The Lessee covenants and agrees with the Lessor that, the
better to ensure the availability of the benefits of Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Lessee shall not object to any motion, petition or
application filed by the Lessor with any bankruptcy court having jurisdiction
over the Lessee, solely as to the portion thereof that seeks, and to the extent
that such motion, petition or application seeks, a determination that such
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code applies to the lease of the Aircraft
hereunder. In the event that Section 1110 is amended, or if it is repealed and
another statute is enacted in lieu thereof, the Lessor and the Lessee (at the
Lessee's expense) agree to amend this Lease and take such other action not
inconsistent with this Lease as the Lessor reasonably deems necessary so as to
afford to the Lessor the rights and benefits as such amended or substituted
statute confers upon owners, lessors and conditional vendors of aircraft
similarly situated to the Lessor.

                  The Lessee will not operate, use or locate the Airframe or any
Engine, (I) in any area in which any insurance required to be maintained
pursuant to Section 14 shall not be at the time in full force and effect, or in
any area excluded from coverage by an insurance policy in effect with respect to
the Airframe or such Engine, except in the case of a requisition for use by the
United States of America, and then only if the Lessee obtains indemnity in lieu
of such insurance from the United States of America against the risks and in the
amounts required by said Section covering such area, or (II) in any recognized
or threatened area of hostilities unless the Airframe or such Engine is operated
or used under contract with the Government of the United States of America under
which contract that Government assumes liabilities for any damages, loss,
destruction or failure to return possession of the Airframe or such Engine at
the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to
property of others.

                  The Lessee shall not use the Aircraft nor suffer it to be used
in any manner or for any purpose excepted from any of the insurance on or in
respect of the Aircraft or for the purpose of carriage of goods of any
description excepted from such insurance nor do, or permit to be done, anything
which, or omit to do anything the omission of which, may invalidate any of such
insurance.

                  (b)      Possession. The Lessee will not, without the prior
written consent of the Agent and the Lessor, sell, assign, lease or otherwise in
any manner deliver, transfer or relinquish possession or control of, or transfer
the right, title or interest of the Lessee in, the Airframe or any Engine except
that, unless a Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Lessee may, without the prior written consent of the Agent and
the Lessor, take the following actions so long as the actions to be taken shall
not deprive the Agent of the first priority Lien under the Aircraft Chattel
Mortgage in the assets subject thereto and so long as the actions to be taken
shall not deprive the Lessor of the protections of Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Aircraft and shall not deprive the Agent of
the protections of Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the
Aircraft as assignee of the Lessee's rights under this Lease pursuant to the
Aircraft Chattel Mortgage:

                  (i)      transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine
         other than by lease to the United States of America or any
         instrumentality thereof pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
         (as administered pursuant to Executive Order 12656, or any substitute
         order) or any similar or substitute programs;

                  (ii)     transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to
         the manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or any
         other organization for service, repairs, maintenance or overhaul or, to
         the extent permitted by Section 11 hereof, for alterations or
         modifications;

                  (iii)    subject any Engine to normal interchange or pooling
         agreements or arrangements of the type customary in the United States
         airline industry and entered into by the Lessee in the ordinary course
         of business that do not contemplate or require the transfer of title
         to, use for the remainder of its useful life, or registration of the
         Airframe or title to or use for the remainder of its useful life of
         such Engine; provided, however, that if the Lessee's title to or use
         for the remainder of its useful life of the Airframe or any Engine
         shall be divested under any such agreement or arrangement, such
         divesture shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to the
         Airframe or such Engine and the Lessee shall comply with Section 13 in
         respect thereof;

                  (iv)     install an Engine on an airframe that is owned by the
         Lessee free and clear of all Liens except (A) those permitted under
         clauses (i) or (ii) of the definition of Permitted Encumbrances in the
         Credit Agreement, (B) those that apply only to the engines (other than
         the Engines), appliances, parts, instruments, appurtenances,
         accessories, furnishings and other equipment (other than Parts)
         installed on such airframe (but not to the airframe as an entirety),
         and (C) the rights of any Domestic Air Carrier, under normal
         interchange agreements that are customary in the airline industry and
         do not contemplate or require the transfer of title to such airframe or
         the engines installed thereon;

                  (v)      install an Engine on an airframe leased to the Lessee
         or owned by the Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other security
         agreement, provided that: (A) such airframe is free and clear of all
         Liens, except for the rights of the parties to the lease or conditional
         sale or other security agreement covering such airframe and except for
         Liens of the type permitted by clause (iv) above; and (B) the Agent and
         the Lessor shall have received from the lessor, conditional vendor or
         secured party and each of the purchasers,



                                      -56-
<PAGE>
         mortgagees and encumbrancers of such lessor, conditional vendor or
         secured party of such airframe a written agreement (which may be the
         lease, conditional sale agreement or mortgage covering such airframe),
         whereby such lessor, conditional vendor or secured party and each of
         the purchasers, mortgagees and encumbrancers of such lessor,
         conditional vendor or secured party expressly and effectively agrees
         that neither it nor its successors and assigns will acquire or claim
         any right, title or interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine
         being installed on such airframe at any time when such Engine is
         subject to the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage;

                  (vi)     install an Engine on an airframe owned by the Lessee,
         leased by the Lessee or owned by the Lessee subject to a conditional
         sale or other security agreement under circumstances where neither
         clause (iv) nor clause (v) above is applicable; provided, that any
         divesture of title to such Engine resulting from such installation
         shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and
         the Lessee shall comply with Section 13 in respect thereof;

                  (vii)    enter into an ACMI Contract or wet lease for the
         Airframe and the Engines or engines installed thereon with any third
         party pursuant to which the Lessee has operational control of the
         Airframe and any Engines installed thereon, such operation to be
         performed solely by individuals under the operational control of the
         Lessee possessing all current certificates and licenses that would be
         required under the applicable laws of the United States for the
         performance by such employees of similar functions within the United
         States; provided, that the Lessee's obligations hereunder shall
         continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such ACMI
         Contract or wet lease;

                  (viii)   enter into a lease (other than pursuant to paragraph
         (vii) above) of the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed
         thereon, so long as (A) either (i) (x) the lessee under such lease, at
         the time such lease is entered into, holds an air carrier operating
         certificate issued pursuant to Chapter 447 of Title 49 of the United
         States Code for aircraft capable of carrying ten or more individuals or
         6,000 pounds or more of cargo, (y) the Lessee and the lessee under such
         lease have expressed in writing (either in such lease or in a
         substantially contemporaneous writing) that such lease is intended to
         be treated as a lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (z) the
         Lessee has obtained an opinion, addressed to the Lessee, the Lessor,
         the Agent, and the Lenders, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to each of the Lessor and the Agent, stating that the
         Lessee is entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
         Code with respect to the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed
         thereon, or (ii) the Lessee obtains the prior written consent of both
         the Lessor and the Agent, which consent may be withheld by either of
         the Lessor or the Agent in its sole discretion, and which consent (x)
         may be conditioned on receipt of opinions in form and substance
         satisfactory to each of the Lessor and the Agent in its sole discretion
         from counsel of the same domicile as the lessee of such lease, which
         counsel must be satisfactory to each of the Lessor and the Agent in its
         sole discretion and (y) may be conditioned on such other conditions as
         either the Lessor or the Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine,
         (B) such lease (i) shall not have a term (including, without
         limitation, any option to renew or extend) in excess of sixty months,
         (ii) shall require rental payments to be made at least quarterly, and
         (iii) shall otherwise be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
         to the Agent



                                      -57-
<PAGE>
         (including, without limitation, with regard to the identity of the
         lessee), (C) the Lessee shall grant a first priority security interest
         in such lease to the Lessor to secure its obligations hereunder, shall
         take all necessary action to ensure that such security interest is
         fully perfected pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
         each of the Lessor and the Agent, and shall deliver an opinion
         addressed to the Lessor and the Agent to the effect that the Lessor
         holds a fully perfected first priority security interest in such lease,
         and as to such other matters as the Lessor or the Agent may reasonably
         request, which opinion shall be in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to each of the Lessor and the Agent, from counsel
         reasonably satisfactory to each of the Lessor and the Agent, (D) the
         Lessor shall grant a first priority security interest in its interest
         in such lease to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, and their
         respective successors and assigns, to secure the Secured Obligations
         (as defined in the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage), shall take all necessary
         action to ensure that such security interest is fully perfected
         pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, and
         shall deliver an opinion addressed to the Agent to the effect that the
         Agent holds a fully perfected first priority security interest in the
         Lessor's interest in such lease, and as to such other matters as the
         Agent may reasonably request, which opinion shall be in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, from counsel reasonably
         satisfactory to the Agent, and (E) the Lessee shall not enter into any
         amendment, consent, waiver, supplement, or other modification with
         respect to such lease that could reasonably be expected to be
         materially adverse in any respect to the Lessee, the Lessor, or the
         Lenders without the prior written consent of the Agent, which consent
         shall be given or withheld by the Agent in its sole discretion within
         ten Business Days of receipt by the Agent of the proposed amendment,
         consent, waiver, supplement, or other modification and any related
         documents reasonably requested by the Agent; provided, that the
         Lessee's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect
         notwithstanding any such lease; and

                  (ix)     sell the Aircraft in accordance with Section 6.6(ii)
         of the Credit Agreement or replace the Airframe or any Engine in
         accordance with Section 9.21 of the Credit Agreement;

provided, however, that the rights of any transferee (other than with respect to
any transactions referred to in paragraph (ix) above) who receives possession of
the Airframe or any Engine permitted by the terms hereof shall be made subject
and subordinate to, and any lease permitted by this Section 10(b) shall be made
expressly subject and subordinate to, the Lease and the lien and security
interest of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage and all of the Agent's rights
thereunder and the Lessee shall remain primarily liable hereunder for the
performance of all the terms of the Lease to the same extent as if such transfer
had not occurred, and any such instrument of transfer shall include appropriate
provisions for the maintenance and insurance of the Airframe or such Engine, and
any such instrument of transfer shall expressly prohibit any further transfer of
the Airframe or such Engine or any assignment of the rights thereunder; and
provided further, that no such lease, pooling arrangement or other transfer or
relinquishment of the possession of the Airframe or any Engine shall in any way
discharge or diminish any of the Lessee's obligations to the Lessor hereunder.

                  (c)      Insignia. The Lessee shall, at its own cost and
expense, cause the Airframe and each Engine to be legibly marked (in a
reasonably prominent location, which in the



                                      -58-
<PAGE>
case of the Airframe shall be adjacent to the airworthiness certificate) with
such a plate, disk, or other marking of customary size, and bearing the legend
"Owned by Atlas Freighter Leasing III, Inc., and Mortgaged to Bankers Trust
Company, as the Agent" or such other legend, as shall in the opinion of the
Lessor and the Agent be appropriate or desirable to evidence the fact that it is
subject to the ownership of the Lessor and the lien and security interest
created by the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage. The Lessee shall not remove or deface,
or permit to be removed or defaced, any such plate, disk, or other marking or
the identifying manufacturer's serial number, and, in the event of such removal
or defacement, shall promptly cause such plate, disk, or other marking or serial
number to be promptly replaced. Except as provided above, the Lessee shall not
allow the name of any person, association or corporation to be placed on the
Airframe or any Engine as a designation that might be interpreted as a claim of
ownership or of any security interest therein, except that the Lessee or any
permitted lessee may place its customary colors and insignia or the insignia of
the manufacturer on the Airframe or any Engine.

                  (d)      Holding Out. The Lessee agrees that it will not at
any time represent or hold out the Lessor, the Agent, any Lender or any
Affiliate of any of them (and will use its best efforts to ensure that none of
the Lessor, the Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any of them is not at any
time represented or held out) as being in any way connected or associated with
any operation of the Airframe, any Engine or any Part or any other operations or
carriage undertaken by the Lessee.

                  (e)      No Pledging of Credit. The Lessee is not authorized
to, and agrees that it will not purport to, pledge the credit of the Lessor, any
Lender or the Agent for any maintenance, service, repairs, or overhauls of,
modifications to, or changes or alterations in, the Airframe, any Engine or any
Part, or for any other purpose whatsoever.

                  (f)      Title. Title to the Aircraft shall remain vested in
the Lessor subject to the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage and any assignments, charges
or other disposals that the Lessor may make in accordance with this Lease. The
Lessee shall not do or knowingly permit to be done anything that would
jeopardize the rights of the Lessor as owner of, or the rights of any Lender in,
the Aircraft and shall cause to be taken all actions necessary or reasonably
requested by the Lessor to prevent the rights of the Lessor and the Lenders in
the Aircraft from being jeopardized. The Lessee shall not hold itself out to any
third party as the owner of the Aircraft or any part of it, and when any third
party inquires as to ownership of the Aircraft or any Engine or any part
thereof, it will make clear to such third party that title to the same is held
by the Lessor and that the Aircraft is mortgaged to the Lenders. Without
limiting the foregoing, if at any time subsequent to the initial registration of
the Aircraft, any filing, recording or act is necessary or reasonably requested
by the Lessor to perfect, protect and preserve the rights and interests of the
Lessor in the Aircraft and the rights and interests of any Lender under the
Aircraft Chattel Mortgage, the Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will procure
that such filings, recordings and acts are done pursuant to applicable laws. At
the reasonable request of the Lessor, the Lessee shall furnish to the Lessor an
opinion of counsel or other evidence satisfactory to the Lessor of each such
filing, recordation and act. The Lessor will reimburse the Lessee for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in complying with its obligations
under this Section 10(f) insofar as they relate to any Lender; provided, that,
to the extent that such expenses relate to (i) any reregistration of the
Aircraft under Section 8 or any sublease of the Aircraft, (ii) any Event of



                                      -59-
<PAGE>
Default or (iii) any substitution of Parts or Engines pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Lessor shall not be obligated to reimburse the Lessee for such
increase in expense.

                  (g)      Information and Records. The Lessee shall:

                  (i)      promptly furnish to the Lessor all such information
         as the Lessor may from time to time reasonably request regarding the
         Aircraft, any Engine or any part thereof, its use, location and
         condition;

                  (ii)     keep, or procure that there are kept, the Technical
         Records and shall keep as part thereof accurate, complete and current
         records of all flights made by the Aircraft, of all Flight Hours and
         Cycles of the Airframe, each Engine, the APU, the landing gear and the
         Parts, and of all maintenance and repairs carried out on the Aircraft
         and each Engine and every Part;

                  (iii)    procure that the Technical Records shall be kept and
         maintained in English and in such manner, form and location as the FAA
         and any applicable law may from time to time require and shall disclose
         the location of all Engines and Parts not installed on the Aircraft,
         which Technical Records, unless otherwise required by applicable law,
         shall be the property of the Lessor;

                  (iv)     make the Technical Records available to the Lessor
         (or any authorized representative of the Lessor) for examination during
         normal business hours (or at such other time as the Lessee and the
         Lessor shall mutually agree) upon giving reasonable written notice,
         provided that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and
         be continuing, such examination does not impede the normal commercial
         operation of the Aircraft, and provided further that the cost of any
         such inspection shall be borne by the Lessee if the Lessee is thereby
         shown to be in breach of its material obligations hereunder, and
         otherwise by the party making the inspection; and

                  (v)      promptly on, but in no event later than three
         Business Days after, becoming aware of the same, notify the Lessor of:
         (I) any Total Loss with respect to the Aircraft or any Engine, (II) any
         loss, theft, damage or destruction to the Aircraft or any Engine or any
         part thereof if the potential cost of repairs or replacement may exceed
         $5,000,000, (III) any loss, arrest, hijacking, confiscation, seizure,
         requisitioning, impounding, taking in execution, detention or
         forfeiture of the Aircraft or any part thereof and (IV) any event in
         respect of the Aircraft that might reasonably be expected to involve
         the Lessor, the Lessee, the Agent or any Lender in any loss or
         liability.

                  SECTION 11. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise provided in Section 11(d), the
Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts, which may
from time to time be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
any Engine and which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen,
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered
unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, in the ordinary course of
maintenance, service, repair or testing, the Lessee at its own cost and expense
may remove any



                                      -60-
<PAGE>
Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated,
damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use; provided, that,
except as otherwise provided in Section 11(d), the Lessee at its own cost and
expense shall replace such Parts as promptly as practicable. All replacement
Parts shall be owned by the Lessor free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted
Encumbrances and for pooling arrangements to the extent permitted by Section
11(b)), and shall be in as good operating condition as, and shall have a value
and utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming that such parts were
in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.

                  All Parts at any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine
shall remain the property of the Lessor and shall remain subject to the lien and
security interest of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage, no matter where located,
until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by parts that have been
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and that
meet the requirements for replacement parts specified above. Immediately upon
any replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or any Engine as above provided, without further act, (A) title to such
replacement Part shall vest in and such replacement part shall become the
property of the Lessor and shall become subject to this Lease and the lien and
security interest of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage and shall be deemed part of
the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes hereof to the same extent as the
property originally comprising, or installed on, such Airframe or such Engine,
and (B) title to the replaced part shall no longer be the property of the Lessor
and shall thereupon become free and clear of all rights of the Lessor hereunder
and all rights derivative of the Lessor's and shall no longer be deemed a Part
hereunder.

                  (b)      Any Part removed from the Airframe or any Engine as
provided in Section 11(a) may be subjected by the Lessee to a normal pooling
arrangement of the type customary in the airline industry entered into by the
Lessee in the ordinary course of its business and entered into with Domestic Air
Carriers that are not the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar
proceeding, voluntary or involuntary; provided, that the Part replacing such
removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe
or such Engine in accordance with Section 11(a) as promptly as possible after
the removal of such removed part. In addition, any replacement Part when
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine in
accordance with Section 11(a) may be owned by any third party subject to such a
pooling arrangement, provided that the Lessee, at its expense, as promptly
thereafter as possible, either (A) causes such replacement Part to become
property of the Lessor and subject to the lien and security interest of the
Aircraft Chattel Mortgage in accordance with Section 11(a) free and clear of all
Liens (except Permitted Encumbrances and the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage relating
to the Aircraft) or (B) replaces such replacement Part by incorporating or
installing in or attaching to the Airframe or such Engine a further replacement
Part owned by the Lessee which shall become the property of the Lessor subject
to the lien and security interest of the mortgage free and clear of all Liens
(except Permitted Encumbrances and the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage relating to the
Aircraft).

                  (c)      The Lessee, at its own cost and expense, shall make
or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in and additions to the
Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the
standards of the FAA or other governmental authority having jurisdiction;
provided, that the Lessee may, in good faith, contest the validity or



                                      -61-
<PAGE>
application of any such standard in any reasonable manner that shall not
adversely affect the Lessor's or the Agent's respective interests. The Lessee
also agrees, at its own cost and expense, to make or cause to be made such
alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe and the Engines
as may be required from time to time to meet the standards or requirements of
any directive issued by a manufacturer relating to the Airframe or any Engine.
In addition, so long as no Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Lessee, at its own cost and expense, may from time to
time make such alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe
and any Engine as the Lessee may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its
business, provided that no such alteration, modification or addition diminishes
the value or utility or impairs the condition or airworthiness of the Airframe
or such Engine below the value, utility, condition or airworthiness thereof
immediately prior to such alteration, modification or addition, assuming that
the Airframe or such Engine were then in the condition and airworthiness
required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease.

                  (d)      All Parts incorporated or installed in or attached to
or added to the Airframe or any Engine as the result of such alteration,
modification or addition shall, without further act, become the property of, and
title to such parts shall vest in the Lessor and shall be subject to the lien
and security interest of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage; provided, that, so long
as no Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Lessee may remove and not replace any such Part if it (A) is in addition to,
and not in replacement of or in substitution for, any Part incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine on the date hereof, or
any Part in replacement of or substitution for any such Part, (B) is not
required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the Airframe
or such Engine pursuant to the terms of Section 10(a) hereof or any other
provision of this Lease or the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage and (C) can be removed
from the Airframe or such Engine without diminishing or impairing the value,
utility or airworthiness that the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such
time had such alteration, modification or addition not occurred, assuming that
the Airframe or such Engine was otherwise in the condition required by this
Lease and the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage. Upon the removal by the Lessee of any
such Part, as above provided, title thereto shall, without further act, be free
and clear of the interests of the Lessor and all rights derivative of the
Lessor's and such Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

                  (e)      In no event shall the Lessor bear any liability or
cost whatsoever for (i) any alteration or modification of, or addition to, the
Airframe or any Engine, (ii) any grounding of the Aircraft, (iii) suspension of
certification of the Aircraft, or (iv) loss of revenue suffered by the Lessee
for any reason whatsoever.

                  SECTION 12. Indemnities. (a) The Lessee will pay, and hereby
indemnifies, on an after-tax basis, the Lessor and its assignees, if any, from
and against, any and all fees and taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or
withholdings, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon (any of the
foregoing for the purposes of this Section 12 being called a "Tax"), that may
from time to time be imposed on or asserted against the Lessor and its
assignees, if any, or the Airframe or any Engine or any part thereof or interest
therein by any federal, state or local government or other taxing authority in
the United States or by any foreign government or subdivision thereof or by any
foreign taxing authority in connection with, relating to or resulting from: (i)
the Airframe or any Engine or any part thereof or interest therein, (ii) the
manufacture, purchase, ownership, mortgaging, lease, sublease, use, storage,
maintenance, sale or other dis-



                                      -62-
<PAGE>
position of the Airframe or any Engine, (iii) any rentals or other earnings
therefor or arising therefrom or the income or other proceeds received with
respect thereto, or (iv) this Lease or the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage; provided,
however, that there shall be excluded from any indemnification under this
Section 12(a) any Lessor Tax unless the payment of any such Tax shall be a
condition to the enforceability of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage or the
perfection of the lien thereof or unless proceedings shall have been commenced
to foreclose any lien that may have attached as security for such Tax, nothing
in this Section shall require the payment of any Tax so long as and to the
extent that the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate
legal proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and the Lessee
shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

                  (b)      The Lessee agrees to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless the Lessor, the Agent and each Lender, and the officers, directors,
partners, employees, agents and affiliates of the Lessor, the Agent and each
Lender, (collectively called the "INDEMNITEES") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any
such Indemnitee shall be designated as a party or a potential party thereto),
whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal,
state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including, without
limitation, securities and commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations and
Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable or other cause or on contract or
otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such
Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of this Lease or the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, the Lenders' agreement to make the Loans to the
Lessor or the use or intended use of the proceeds of any of the Loans)
(collectively called the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, that the Lessee
shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities arise
solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. To the
extent that the undertaking to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set
forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of
any law or public policy, the Lessee shall contribute the maximum portion that
it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or any
of them.

                  SECTION 13. Event of Loss. (a) If an Event of Loss shall occur
with respect to an Airframe or an Engine, the Lessee will promptly notify the
Lessor and the Agent thereof in writing (in any event within five (5) days of
such occurrence) and will, not later than 180 days after the occurrence of such
Event of Loss, convey or cause to be conveyed to the Lessor, free of all Liens
(other than Permitted Encumbrances) title to an Acceptable Alternate Airframe or
Acceptable Alternate Engine, as the case may be. Prior to or at the time of any
such conveyance, the Lessee, at its own expense, will, as conditions to such
transfer, (i) furnish the Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale,
from a person and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor,
with respect to such Acceptable Alternate Airframe or Acceptable Alternate
Engine, (ii) cause a Lease Supplement to be filed for recording pursuant to
Title 49 of the United



                                      -63-
<PAGE>
States Code, as amended, (iii) furnish the Lessor with such evidence of the
Lessee's title to such Acceptable Alternate Airframe or Acceptable Alternate
Engine and of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 14 hereof with
respect to such Acceptable Alternate Airframe or Acceptable Alternate Engine as
the Lessor may reasonably request, (iv) furnish the Lessor with an opinion of
the Lessee's counsel to the effect that title to such Acceptable Alternate
Airframe or Acceptable Alternate Engine has been duly conveyed to the Lessor
free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Encumbrances and the Lessor and the
Agent continue to have 1110 protection with respect to such Aircraft. Upon
satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, the Lessor shall transfer to or at the
direction of the Lessee without recourse or warranty all of the Lessor's right,
title and interest, if any, in and to (A) the Airframe or Engine with respect to
which such Event of Loss occurred and furnish to or at the direction of the
Lessee, at the Lessee's expense, a bill of sale without warranty other than to
the absence of a Lessor Lien in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Lessee, evidencing such transfer and (B) all claims, if any, against third
parties, for damage to or loss of the Airframe or Engine subject to such Event
of Loss, and such Airframe or Engine shall thereupon cease to be an Airframe or
Engine leased hereunder. The Lessee shall cooperate with the Lessor and take all
such actions as shall be requested by the Lessor so that the Lessor complies
with Section 4(f) of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage. For all purposes hereof,
each such Acceptable Alternate Airframe or Acceptable Alternate Engine shall,
after such conveyance, be deemed part of the property leased hereunder, and
shall be deemed an "Airframe" or "Engine," as the case may be. No Event of Loss
under the circumstance contemplated by the terms of this paragraph (a) shall
result in any reduction in Basic Rent or any other obligation of the Lessee
hereunder.

                  (b)      With respect to the Airframe or any Engine, as
between the Lessor and the Lessee, any payments on account of an Event of Loss
(other than insurance proceeds or other payments the application of which is
provided for in Section 14 below) received from any governmental authority or
other person shall be applied as follows:

                  (A)      if such payments are received with respect to an
         Event of Loss to an Airframe or Engine that has been or is being
         replaced by the Lessee pursuant to the terms hereof, so long as there
         shall exist no Default or Lease Event of Default, such payment shall be
         paid over to or retained by the Lessee upon satisfaction of the
         conditions for replacement contained in paragraph (a) above and until
         such time shall be held by the Lessor as security for the obligations
         of the Lessee under the Lease; and

                  (B)      if such payments are received with respect to an
         Event of Loss with respect to which no replacement is being effected,
         so much of such payments as shall not exceed (A) the Stipulated Loss
         Value as of the date of payment plus (B) all unpaid Supplemental Rent
         due through the date of payment, plus (C) all unpaid Basic Rent for the
         period ending on the date of payment shall be paid by the Lessee to the
         Lessor and following the foregoing application, the balance, if any, of
         such payments shall be distributed between the Lessee and the Lessor as
         their respective interests may appear;

                  (c)      In the event of a requisition for use by the United
States Government of the Airframe or any Engine, the Lessee shall promptly
notify the Lessor and the Agent of such requisition and all of the Lessee's
obligations under the Lease shall continue to the same extent as if such
requisition had not occurred. Any payments received by the Lessor or the Lessee
from



                                      -64-
<PAGE>
the United States Government for the use of the Airframe or such Engine, to the
extent allocable to the Term, shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Lessee.

                  (d)      Any amount referred to in this Section 13 that is
payable to or retained by the Lessee shall not be paid to the Lessee or retained
by the Lessee, if at the time of such payment or retention any Default or Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be held by or
paid over to the Lessor as security for the obligations of the Lessee under the
Lease and shall be applied against the Lessee's obligations hereunder as and
when due. At such time as there shall not be continuing any such Default or
Lease Event of Default, such amount shall be paid to the Lessee to the extent
not previously applied in accordance with the preceding sentence.

                  SECTION 14. Insurance. (a) The Lessee will at all times carry
and maintain on or with respect to the Aircraft, at its own cost and expense,
public liability (including, without limitation, contractual liability, cargo
liability, passenger legal liability, bodily injury and product liability, but
excluding manufacturer's product liability) and property damage insurance with
insurers of recognized responsibility and reputation in amounts, of the type and
covering the risks customarily carried with respect to similar aircraft by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business and similarly situated with
the Lessee but in no event in an amount less than $500,000,000 per occurrence
(which shall include war risk, governmental confiscation and expropriation and
allied perils coverage). During any period when the Aircraft is on the ground
and not in operation, the Lessee may carry or cause to be carried, in lieu of
insurance required by this Section, insurance otherwise conforming with the
provisions of this Section except that the amounts of coverage shall not be
required to exceed the amounts of comprehensive airline liability insurance, and
the scope of risk covered and type of insurance shall be the same, as are
customarily carried with respect to similar aircraft on the ground by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business and similarly situated with
the Lessee. Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this Section 14
and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement of any such policies
(A) shall be amended to name the Agent, the Lenders and the Lessor and their
respective shareholders, directors, officers, members, partners, servants,
employees and agents as additional named insureds, (B) shall be primary without
right of contribution from any other insurance that is carried by the Lessee,
(C) shall expressly provide that all provisions thereof, except the limits of
the liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there were a separate
policy covering each insured, and (D) shall provide that the insurer shall waive
any right of subrogation against the Agent, the Lenders and the Lessor.

                  (b)      The Lessee will at all times carry and maintain with
insurers of recognized responsibility and reputation on or with respect to the
Aircraft, at its own cost and expense, aircraft ground and flight all-risk hull
insurance as well as fire and extended coverage insurance on the Engines and
other equipment while removed from the Airframe, which shall include war risk,
governmental confiscation and expropriation (other than by the United States
Government) and allied perils (if and to the extent that the same shall be
maintained by the Lessee with respect to similar aircraft owned or operated by
the Lessee on the same routes or if the Aircraft or another aircraft is operated
on routes where the custom is for Domestic Air Carriers similarly situated with
the Lessee flying comparable routes with similar aircraft to carry such
insurance, of the type usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or
similar business and similarly situated with the Lessee) including (A) strikes,
riots, civil commotions or labor disturbances, (B) any malicious act or act of
sabotage and (C) hijacking (air piracy) or any unlawful seizure or



                                      -65-
<PAGE>
wrongful exercise of control of the Aircraft or crew in flight (including any
attempt at such seizure or control) made by any person or persons aboard the
Aircraft or another aircraft acting without the consent of the insured;
provided, that such insurance (including any self-insurance to the extent
permitted below) shall at all times be for an agreed value not less than the
greater of the Stipulated Loss Value as of the closest Stipulated Loss
Determinate Date and $50,000,000. During any period when the Aircraft is on the
ground and not in operation, the Lessee may carry or cause to be carried, in
lieu of the insurance required by this Section, insurance otherwise conforming
hereto except that the scope of risk covered and type of insurance shall be the
same as are from time to time customarily carried with respect to similar
aircraft by corporations engaged in the same or similar business and similarly
situated with the Lessee for aircraft on the ground in an amount at least equal
to the applicable amount provided above. All such insurance shall name the
Agent, the Lenders and the Lessor as additional insureds and loss payees to the
extent that their interest may appear and shall provide that any loss to the
Airframe or an Engine in excess of $2,000,000 (and, if a Default or Lease Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, any such loss) shall be payable to
the Lessor and to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders; and shall be primary
without right of contribution from any other insurance that is carried by the
Lessor or the Agent with respect to its interest therein. In the event that the
Lessee arranges separate insurances to cover the all-risk hull insurance and the
war and perils hull insurance, the Lessee shall ensure that the insurers
subscribing to such insurances shall agree to a 50/50 claims funding arrangement
in the event of any dispute as to which insurance is applicable.

                  The Lessee may self-insure, by way of deductible or equivalent
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured against
pursuant to this Section 14(b) in such reasonable amounts as are then applicable
to other similar aircraft or spare engines in the Lessee's fleet that are of a
value comparable to the Aircraft, and as are not substantially greater than
amounts self-insured by corporations engaged in the same or similar business and
similarly situated with the Lessee; provided, however, that the Lessee may not
self-insure in an amount in excess of $1,000,000 without the prior written
consent of the Lessor and the Agent.

                  (c)      Any policies of insurance required pursuant to either
paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above shall: (A) be amended to name the Lessor,
the Agent and the Lenders as additional named insureds, but without the Lessor,
the Agent or the Lenders being thereby liable for premiums (and the insurance
companies waiving their right with respect thereto), (B) provide that in respect
of the interest of (x) the Lessor or (y) the Agent or the Lenders in such
policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of (x)
the Lessee or (y) the Lessee or the Lessor, respectively, and shall insure the
interests of the Agent and the Lenders regardless of any breach or violation by
the Lessee, the Lessor or any Person (other than the Agent) of any warranty,
declaration, condition or exclusion from coverage contained in such policies,
(C) provide that if such insurance is cancelled, or if any material change is
made in the coverage that affects the interest of the Lessor, the Agent or any
Lender, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such
cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to the Lessor, the Agent
or any Lender for thirty (30) days (seven (7) days, or such shorter or longer
period as may from time to time be customarily available in the industry, in the
case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Agent and
the Lessor of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or
lapse, (D) be in full force and effect throughout any geographical areas at any
time traversed by the Aircraft and shall be payable in U.S. dollars, (E) waive
any right of the insurers to any setoff or counterclaim or any other deduction,
whether by



                                      -66-
<PAGE>
attachment or otherwise in respect of any liability of the Lessee, the Lessor or
the Agent except in respect of outstanding premium due for the Aircraft, (F)
waive all rights of subrogation against the Lessor and the Agent and (G) include
a year 2000 date recognition writeback.

                  (d)      In the case of a lease or contract with the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof in respect of the Airframe or
any Engine, a valid agreement by the United States or such agency or
instrumentality to indemnify the Lessee against the same risks against which the
Lessee is required hereunder to insure shall be considered adequate insurance
with respect to the Airframe or such Engine to the extent of the risks and in
the amounts that are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

                  (e)      On or prior to the date hereof, and annually
thereafter on or prior to January 31, the Lessee will furnish to the Lessor and
the Agent (A) a report signed by a firm of independent aircraft insurance
brokers, appointed by the Lessee and not objected to by the Lessor or the Agent,
describing in reasonable detail acceptable to the Lessor and the Agent the
insurance then carried and maintained on or with respect to the Aircraft and the
Engines and stating that in the opinion of such firm such insurance complies
with the terms of this Section 14 and is adequate to protect the interests of
the Lessee, the Lessor and the Agent, and (B) certificates of the insurer or
insurers evidencing the insurance covered by the report. The Lessee will cause
such brokers to advise the Agent in writing (x) promptly of any default in the
payment of any premium and of any other act or omission on the part of the
Lessee of which such firm has knowledge and that might invalidate or render
unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on the Aircraft or any Engine
and (y) at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration or termination date,
or date of effectiveness of any material change, of any insurance carried and
maintained on the Aircraft hereunder.

                  (f)      All insurance payments and other payments received by
the Agent, the Lessor or the Lessee from insurance referred to in paragraph (b)
above shall be, if received by the Lessor or the Lessee, immediately paid to the
Agent, as agent for itself and the Lessor and shall be paid to the Lessee upon
compliance by the Lessee with the terms of Section 13, provided that no Default
or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                  (g)      The Lessee shall not create or permit to exist any
Lien over the insurances required by this Lease, or its interest therein, save
as constituted by this Lease and the Credit Agreement.

                  (h)      If at any time the Lessee fails to maintain in full
force and effect insurances in compliance with any provision of this Article 14,
the Lessor shall be entitled but not bound (without prejudice to any other
rights that it may have or acquire under this Lease by reason of such failure)
(i) to pay any premiums due or to effect or maintain insurances satisfactory to
the Lessor or otherwise remedy such failure in such manner as the Lessor
considers appropriate, and the Lessee shall immediately reimburse the Lessor in
full for any amount so expended by the Lessor and/or (ii) at any time while such
failure is continuing, to require the Aircraft to remain at any airport, or to
proceed to and remain at any airport designated by the Lessor, the Agent or the
Lenders, until such failure is remedied.

                  (i)      Nothing in this Section 14 shall prohibit the Agent,
or any Lender or the Lessor from obtaining insurance with respect to the
Aircraft for its own account. The Lessee



                                      -67-
<PAGE>
may, at its own expense, carry insurance with respect to its interest in the
Aircraft in amounts in excess of that required to be maintained by this Section
14. No insurance maintained by the Agent, the Lessor or any Lender shall prevent
the Lessee from carrying the insurance required or permitted by this Section.
Proceeds of any such insurance carried by the Lessee, the Agent or any Lender
shall be paid as provided in the insurance policy relating thereto and no such
Person shall have any duty to obtain any such insurance.

                  (j)      To the extent any of the Aircraft or Engines or any
component thereof are leased or under contract to the United States or any
agency or instrumentality thereof pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program or a similar program, the Lessee shall take such actions as the Agent
may reasonably request to ensure that the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,
(i) is a loss payee under any insurance policy or indemnity granted to the
Lessee or any of its affiliates by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and/or (ii) has a perfected security interest in the
proceeds of any payments made by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof pursuant to any such insurance policy or indemnity.

                  SECTION 15. Assignment. Except as permitted in accordance with
Section 10, the Lessee will not, without the prior written consent of the
Lessor, assign any of its rights hereunder or in the Aircraft. The Lessor agrees
that it will not assign or convey its right, title or interest in or to this
Lease or the Aircraft except in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Subject to
the foregoing, the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Lessor and the Lessee and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the direct benefit of, and
shall also be enforceable by, the Agent and the Lenders, and their respective
successors, as assignees of the Lessor.

                  SECTION 16. Events of Default. Each of the following events
shall constitute a Lease Event of Default (whether any such event shall be
voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of law or
pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) and
each such Lease Event of Default shall continue so long as, but only as long as,
it shall not have been remedied:

                  (a)      the Lessee shall fail to pay any installment of Rent,
         Stipulated Loss Value or any other amounts owing pursuant to this Lease
         within 5 days after the due date thereof;

                  (b)      the Lessee shall fail (i) to comply in any material
         respect with the maintenance standards or (ii) to procure insurance
         coverage as prescribed herein or (iii) to operate the Aircraft or any
         Engine at a time or in a place where insurance described in Article 14
         shall not be in effect;

                  (c)      there shall exist a Lease Event of Default under, and
         as defined in, any other Lease or the Lessee or Holdings shall fail to
         perform or observe any other covenant or condition set forth in this
         Lease or any other Transaction Document, which failure shall remain
         unremedied for a period of 10 Business Days after written notice from
         the Lessor or the Agent, unless action has been taken within 15
         Business Days to remedy such breach and such action is being diligently
         pursued, provided such breach is capable of being remedied;



                                      -68-
<PAGE>
                  (d)      any representation or warranty of the Lessee or
         Holdings in any Transaction Document or in any certificate furnished
         pursuant to any Transaction Document is found to be incorrect in any
         material respect at the time it was made and such breach shall remain
         unremedied for a period of 15 Business Days after written notice
         thereof;

                  (e)      (i) a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall
         enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the Lessee or any of
         its Subsidiaries in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or
         under any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or
         hereafter in effect, which decree or order is not stayed; or any other
         similar relief shall be granted under any applicable federal or state
         law, or (ii) an involuntary case shall be commenced against the Lessee
         or any of its Subsidiaries under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in
         effect; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the
         premises for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, sequestrator,
         trustee, custodian or other officer having similar powers over the
         Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries, or over all or a substantial part of
         its property, shall have been entered; or there shall have occurred the
         appointment of an interim receiver, trustee or other custodian of the
         Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries; or a warrant of attachment,
         execution or similar process shall have been issued against any
         substantial part of the property of the Lessee or any of its
         subsidiaries, and any such event described in this clause (ii) shall
         continue for 60 days unless dismissed, bonded or discharged;

                  (f)      (i) the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
         an order for relief entered with respect to it or commence a voluntary
         case under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable
         bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
         shall consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary
         case, or to the conversion of an involuntary case to a voluntary case,
         under any such law, or shall consent to the appointment of or taking
         possession by a receiver, trustee or other custodian for all or a
         substantial part of its property; or the Lessee or any of its
         Subsidiaries shall make any assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
         (ii) the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries shall be unable, or shall
         fail generally, or shall admit in writing its inability, to pay its
         debts as such debts become due; or the Board of Directors of the Lessee
         or any of its Subsidiaries (or any committee thereof) shall adopt any
         resolution or otherwise authorize any action to approve any of the
         actions referred to in clause (i) above or this clause (ii);

                  (g)      any order, judgment or decree shall be entered
         against the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries decreeing the dissolution
         or split up of the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries and such order
         shall remain undischarged or unstayed for a period in excess of 30
         days;

                  (h)      registration of the Aircraft is canceled and is not
         cured within 15 Business Days;

                  (i)      the Aircraft is arrested or detained in exercise of
         any lien and the Lessee does not procure the release of the Aircraft
         within 15 business days;

                  (j)      there shall have occurred an Event of Default under
         the Amended Aircraft Credit Facility (whether or not such Event of
         Default is thereafter waived by the requisite lenders);



                                      -69-
<PAGE>
                  (k)      the Lessee shall not be a Certificated Air Carrier
         within the meaning of Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended;

                  (l)      the Lessee or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to
         pay when due following applicable grace periods (a) any principal of or
         interest on any Indebtedness in an individual principal amount of $5
         million or more or any items of Indebtedness with an aggregate
         principal amount of $10 million or more or (b) any Contingent
         Obligation in an individual principal amount of $5 million or more or
         any Contingent Obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $10
         million or more, in each case beyond the end of any grace period
         provided therefor; or (ii) there shall exist a breach by the Lessee or
         any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any other material term of (a)
         any evidence of any Indebtedness in an individual principal amount of
         $5 million or more or any items of Indebtedness with an aggregate
         principal amount of $10 million or more or any Contingent Obligation in
         an individual principal amount of $5 million or more or any Contingent
         Obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $10 million or more
         or (b) any loan agreement, mortgage, indenture or other agreement
         relating to such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation(s), if the
         effect of such breach or default is to cause, or to permit the holder
         or holders of that Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation(s) (or a
         trustee on behalf of such holder or holders) to cause, that
         Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation(s) to become or be declared due
         and payable prior to its stated maturity or the stated maturity of any
         underlying obligations, as the case may be (upon the giving or
         receiving of notice, lapse of time, both, or otherwise);

                  (m)      any money judgment, writ or warrant of attachment or
         similar process involving (i) in any individual case an amount in
         excess of $5 million or (ii) in the aggregate at any time an amount in
         excess of $10 million (in either case not adequately covered by
         insurance as to which a solvent and unaffiliated insurance company has
         acknowledged coverage) shall be entered or filed against the Lessee or
         any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and shall
         remain undischarged, unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of 60
         days (or in any event later than five days prior to the date of any
         proposed sale thereunder);

                  (n)      (i) (a) Permitted Holders shall cease to own
         beneficially and control shares of capital stock of the Lessee
         representing at least 30% of the combined voting power of all
         Securities of the Lessee entitled to vote in the election of directors,
         other than Securities having such power only by reason of the happening
         of a contingency, or (b) any Person or any two or more Persons acting
         in concert (in any such case, excluding Permitted Holders) shall have
         acquired beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the
         Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act), directly or
         indirectly, of Securities of the Lessee (or other Securities
         convertible into such Securities) representing 20% or more of the
         combined voting power of all Securities of the Lessee entitled to vote
         in the election of directors, other than Securities having such power
         only by reason of the happening of a contingency, or (c) the Board of
         Directors of the Lessee shall not consist of a majority of Continuing
         Directors or (ii) a "Change of Control" shall occur under any of the
         Pass Through Trust Documents, any of the Senior Note Documents or any
         other Material Agreement (as in effect on the date of such occurrence);
         provided, however, that, following the consummation of the Holding
         Company



                                      -70-
<PAGE>
         Reorganization, references in clause (i) above to the Lessee shall be
         deemed to be references to the Holding Company, and, after the
         consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, it shall also be a
         Lease Event of Default if, at any time, the Holding Company ceases to
         have direct beneficial ownership and control of 100% of the outstanding
         capital stock of the Lessee, as well as any Securities of the Lessee
         (other than capital stock) entitled to vote in the election of
         directors, or if, at any time, the Holding Company grants a Lien with
         respect to the capital stock of the Lessee; provided further, however,
         that a "Lease Event of Default" under clause (ii) above arising as a
         result of the Holding Company Reorganization shall not constitute a
         "Lease Event of Default;" provided further, however, that, in the event
         that Permitted Holders cease to own 30% of the combined voting power of
         all Securities of the Lessee (or the Holding Company, as the case may
         be) because of the issuance of Securities of the Lessee, or the Holding
         Company, as the case may be, (as opposed to the Permitted Holders
         selling Securities), then the failure to maintain the 30% ownership
         level shall not constitute a Lease Event of Default unless the
         Permitted Holders shall cease to own shares of capital stock
         constituting 25% of the combined voting power of all Securities of the
         Lessee (or the Holding Company, as the case may be);

                  (o)      if any consent, authorization, license or approval
         of, or registration with or declaration to any governmental entity
         required by the Lessee to authorize, or required by the Lessee in
         connection with, the execution, delivery, validity, enforceability or
         admissibility in evidence of this Lease or any other Transaction
         Document or the performance by the Lessee of its obligations hereunder
         or thereunder is modified in a manner unacceptable to the Lessor or is
         withheld, or is revoked, suspended, canceled, withdrawn or terminated
         or expires and is not renewed, or otherwise ceases to be in full force
         and effect and the Lessor reasonably determines that such modification,
         withholding revocation, suspension, cancellation, withdrawal,
         termination or non-renewal or cessation may significantly prejudice its
         rights under or in connection with this Lease, may have a material
         adverse effect on the Lessee's ability to perform its obligations
         hereunder or jeopardize the respective interests of the Lessor or any
         Lender in the Aircraft or may give rise to criminal liability of or the
         Lessor;

                  (p)      if any event occurs, circumstance arises or
         proceeding is taken with respect to the Lessee in any jurisdiction to
         which the Lessee is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to
         any of the events mentioned in Sections 16(e) or (f);

                  (q)      if the Lessee suspends or ceases or threatens to
         suspend or cease to carry on its business;

                  (r)      if the Lessee disposes, threatens to dispose or takes
         any action to dispose of all or a material part of its assets, whether
         by one or a series of transactions, related or not, and such disposal
         or action will have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform
         its obligations under this Lease or any other Transaction Document;

                  (s)      if the existence, validity, enforceability or
         priority of the rights of the Lessor in respect of the Aircraft
         hereunder, or the rights of any Lender, as mortgagee, of the Aircraft
         or the Lender as assignee of the insurances are challenged by the
         Lessee or any other person claiming through the Lessee;

                                      -71-
<PAGE>
                  (t)      if the Lessee sells or executes any bill of sale
         affecting the Aircraft or any interest therein or agrees or purposes to
         do any of the same, or contests in any legal proceedings the Lessor's
         ownership of the Aircraft;

                  (u)      if any governmental authority shall have condemned,
         seized or appropriated all or substantially all of the property of the
         Lessee; or

                  (v)      if the Lessee becomes obligated to make any "change
         of control" put payments in connection with the Holding Company
         Reorganization that, when aggregated with all payments made under
         Section 7(e)(6), exceed $75,000,000 or if, after giving effect to such
         "change of control" put payments, (A) the Lessee shall have less than
         $150,000,000 in Cash or Cash Equivalents on its balance sheet or (B)
         its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis as if
         the proposed payment had been consummated on the last day of the most
         recent four fiscal quarter period) shall exceed the lower of 4.25:1.00
         or the ratio to be met in accordance with Section 7(f)(ii) for the
         immediately succeeding fiscal quarter end.

                  SECTION 17. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Lease Event
of Default and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing,
the Lessor may, at its option, declare, by written notice to the Lessee, this
Lease to be in default, except that upon the occurrence of a Lease Event of
Default referred to in clauses (e), (f) or (g) of Section 16, this Lease shall
be deemed declared in default without any further act or notice, and at any time
thereafter, the Lessor may do one or more of the following with respect to all
or any part of the Aircraft, Airframe and any or all of the Engines as the
Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect:

                  (a)      upon the written demand of the Lessor and at the
         Lessee's expense, promptly return the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine
         as the Lessor may so demand to the Lessor or its order in the manner
         and condition required by, and otherwise in accordance with all the
         provisions of, Section 8 hereof as if such Airframe or Engine were
         being returned at the end of the Term, or the Lessor, at its option,
         may enter upon the premises where all or any part of the Aircraft,
         Airframe or any Engine is located and take immediate possession of and
         remove the same by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without
         liability accruing to the Lessor for or by reason of such entry or
         taking of possession or removal, whether for the restoration of damage
         to property caused by such action or otherwise; provided, that if the
         Lessee shall for any reason fail to execute and deliver instruments
         deemed necessary or advisable by the Lessor to obtain possession of the
         Aircraft, Airframe and Engines, the Lessor shall be entitled, in a
         proceeding (which proceeding may be done on an ex parte basis without
         notice to the Lessee), to a preliminary injunction granting the Lessor
         the right to possess the Aircraft without having to post a bond or
         provide any other type of security and to a final judgment for specific
         performance, conferring the right to immediate possession upon the
         Lessor and requiring the Lessee to execute and deliver such instruments
         to the Lessor;

                  (b)      sell the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine at public
         or private sale, as the Lessor may determine, or otherwise dispose of,
         hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep idle the Aircraft, Airframe
         or any Engine as the Lessor, in its sole discretion, may determine, all
         free and clear of any rights of the Lessee, except as hereinafter set
         forth in



                                      -72-
<PAGE>
         this Section 17, and without any duty to account to the Lessee with
         respect to such action or inaction;

                  (c)      whether or not the Lessor shall have exercised, or
         shall thereafter at any time exercise, any of its rights under
         paragraph (a) or (b) above with respect to the Aircraft, the Lessor, by
         written notice to the Lessee specifying a payment date, may demand that
         the Lessee pay to the Lessor, and the Lessee shall pay the Lessor, on
         the payment date so specified, any Basic Rent due on or before the
         payment date so specified plus, as liquidated damages for loss of a
         bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of the installments of Basic Rent
         for the Aircraft due after the date specified in such notice if any),
         an amount equal to the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft computed
         as of the immediately preceding Stipulated Loss Determination Date,
         together with interest, if any, at the Past Due Rate on the amount of
         such Basic Rent and Stipulated Loss Value from the Stipulated Loss
         Determination Date as of which Stipulated Loss Value is computed until
         the date of actual payment; and upon such payment of liquidated damages
         and all Supplemental Rent then due and payable by the Lessee hereunder,
         the Lessor shall transfer (without any representation, recourse or
         warranty whatsoever) the Aircraft to the Lessee and the Lessor shall
         execute and deliver such documents evidencing such transfer and take
         such further action as the Lessee shall reasonably request to effect
         such transfer;

                  (d)      in the event that the Lessor, pursuant to paragraph
         (b) above, shall have sold the Aircraft, the Lessor, in lieu of
         exercising its rights under paragraph (c) above with respect to such
         Aircraft, may, if it shall so elect, demand that the Lessee pay the
         Lessor, and the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the date of such
         sale, any accrued rent with respect to the Aircraft due on or prior to
         such date plus, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as
         a penalty, the amount of any deficiency between the net proceeds of
         such sale (after deduction of all reasonable costs of sale) and the
         Stipulated Loss Value of such Aircraft, computed as of the date of such
         sale together with interest, if any, on the amount of such deficiency,
         at the Past Due Rate, from the date of such sale to the date of actual
         payment of such amount;

                  (e)      the Lessor may terminate or cancel this Lease or
         proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the terms hereof or to
         recover damages for breach hereof; and

                  (f)      the Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy
         which may be available to it under applicable law.

                  In addition, the Lessee shall be liable, except as otherwise
provided above, without duplication of amounts payable hereunder, for any and
all unpaid Rent due hereunder before, after or during the exercise of any of the
foregoing remedies and for all reasonable legal fees and other costs and
expenses incurred by the Lessor and the Agent and any Lender (including
reasonable allocated time charges of internal counsel for the Lender) in
connection with the Lease Event of Default, the exercise of remedies and the
return of the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with the terms of Section 8
hereof or in placing such Airframe or Engine (which for purposes hereof, shall
include, without limitation, all logs, manuals and data and inspection,
maintenance, modification and overhaul and similar records with respect thereto)
in the condition and airworthiness required by such Section. The Lessee hereby
acknowledges that it shall be directly liable for such costs and expenses to any
Person designated by the Lessor, the



                                      -73-
<PAGE>
Agent or any Lender (as the case may be) to provide services in connection with
or to effect the return of the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with the
terms of Section 8 hereof or in placing such Airframe or Engine (which for
purposes hereof shall include, without limitation, such logs, manuals and
records) in the condition and airworthiness required by such Section.

                  At any sale of the Aircraft or any part thereof pursuant to
this Section 17, the Lessor or the Agent or any Lender may bid for and purchase
such property. The Lessor agrees to give the Lessee at least 10 days' written
notice of the date fixed for any public sale of any Airframe or Engine or of the
date on or after which will occur the execution of any contract providing for
any private sale. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no remedy
referred to in this Section 17 is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to above or otherwise
available to the Lessor at law or in equity or otherwise; and the exercise or
beginning of exercise by the Lessor of any one or more of such remedies shall
not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Lessor of any or all of
such other remedies. No waiver by the Lessor of any Lease Event of Default shall
in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Lease
Event of Default. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Lessee hereby
waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise that may
require the Lessor to sell, lease, or otherwise use the Aircraft, Airframe or
any Engine or any part thereof in mitigation of the Lessor's damages as set
forth in this Section 17 or that may otherwise limit or modify any of the
Lessor's rights and remedies in this Section 17.

                  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 17, so long as any Loan relating to the Aircraft or other Obligations
(other than principal and interest on Loans relating to other aircraft or spare
engines) are outstanding under the Credit Agreement, all rights of the Lessor
under this Section 17 shall be exercised only by the Agent as assignee of the
Lessor's rights under this Lease pursuant to the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage.

                  SECTION 18. Lessee's Cooperation Concerning Certain Matters.
(a) Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each Lease Supplement from time
to time required by the terms hereof and upon the execution and delivery of any
amendment to this Lease, the Lessee (at its expense), unless such supplement or
amendment relates solely to the assignment of all or any portion of the Lessor's
interest hereunder, will cause such Lease Supplement (and, in the case of the
initial Lease Supplement, this Lease as well) or amendment to be duly filed and
recorded, and maintained of record, in accordance with the applicable laws of
the government of registry of the Aircraft. In addition, the Lessee at its
expense will promptly and duly execute and deliver to the Lessor and the Agent
such further documents and take such further action as the Lessor and the Agent
may from time to time reasonably request in order more effectively to carry out
the intent and purpose of this Lease and the other Transaction Documents and to
establish and protect the rights and remedies created or intended to be created
in favor of the Lessor and the Agent hereunder and under the other Transaction
Documents, including, without limitation, if requested by the Lessor and the
Agent, the execution and delivery of supplements or amendments hereto, at the
expense of the Lessee, each in recordable form, and all financing statements and
continuation statements, and all similar notices required by applicable law at
all times to be kept recorded and filed in such manner and such places as the
Lessor and the Agent may reasonably request.

<PAGE>
                  (b)      The Lessee agrees at its own expense to furnish to
         the Lessor and the Agent promptly after execution and delivery of any
         supplement and amendment hereto, an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
         the Lessor and the Agent (which may include the Lessee's general
         counsel) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such supplement
         or amendment to the Lease (or a financing statement, continuation
         statement or similar notice thereof if and to the extent permitted or
         required by applicable law) has been properly recorded or filed for
         record in all public offices in which such recording or filing is
         necessary to protect the right, title and interest of the Lessor
         hereunder and the Agent under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 19. Notices. All notices required under the terms and
provisions hereof shall be in writing (including telex, facsimile or similar
writing) and shall be effective (a) if given by facsimile device, when
transmitted and the appropriate confirmation received, (b) if given by certified
mail, three Business Days after being deposited in the United States mail, with
appropriate postage prepaid, (c) if given by telex, upon receipt by the party
transmitting the telex of such party's answerback code at the end of such telex
(receipt of confirmation in writing not being necessary to the effectiveness of
any telex) and (d) if given by overnight service or other means, when received

         address as the Lessor shall from time to time designate in writing to
         the Lessee, with a copy to the Agent at 130 Liberty Street, New York,
         New York 10006, Attention: Marguerite Sutton.

                  SECTION 20. Net Lease, True Lease, etc. (a) The Lessee's
obligations to pay Rent and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right that the Lessee may have against the Lessor,
the Agent, the Lenders, any manufacturer, any supplier or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever, (ii) any defect in the title, airworthiness, eligibility
for registration under Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended, or other
applicable law, condition, design, compliance with specifications, operation or
fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, the Aircraft, or
any theft, interference, interruption or cessation in or prohibition of the use
or possession thereof by the Lessee or any sublessee for any reason whatsoever,
including, without limitation, any such interference, interruption, cessation or
prohibition resulting from the act of any governmental authority or any other
Person, (iii) any Liens, encumbrances or rights of any other Person with respect
to the Aircraft, (iv) the invalidity or unenforceability or lack of due
authorization or other infirmity of this Lease or any other Transaction Document
or document or instrument executed pursuant hereto or thereto, or any lack of
right, power or authority of the Lessor or the Lessee or any other party to any
other Transaction Document to enter into this Lease or any other Transaction
Document or any such document or instrument, (v) any loss of or damage to the
Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or any Part, (vi) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceedings by or against the Lessee or any other
Person, or (vii) any failure, breach or delay by the Lessor or any other Person
in performing or complying with any term of this Lease or any other cause
whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, any present



                                      -75-
<PAGE>
or future law notwithstanding, it being the intention of the parties that all
Rent payable by the Lessee hereunder shall continue to be payable in all events
in the manner and at the times provided herein. Such Rent shall not be subject
to any abatement and the payments thereof shall not be subject to any setoff or
any reduction for any reason whatsoever, including any present or future claims
of the Lessee against the Lessor or any other Person under this Lease or
otherwise. The Lessee hereby waives, and hereby agrees to waive at any future
time at the request of the Lessor, to the full extent now or then permitted by
applicable law, any and all rights that it may now have or that at any time
hereafter may be conferred upon it, by statute or otherwise, to terminate,
cancel, quit or surrender this Lease except in accordance with the express terms
hereof. Each payment of Rent made by the Lessee to the Lessor shall be final as
to the Lessor and the Lessee. The Lessee will not seek to recover all or any
part of any such payment of Rent from the Lessor for any reason whatsoever.

                  (b)      It is the intention of the parties that the Lessor
         and the Agent, as assignee of the Lessor's right under this Lease
         pursuant to the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage, shall be entitled to the
         benefits of 11 U.S.C. Section 1110 or any analogous section of the
         Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time to time with respect to
         the right to repossess the Airframe, Engines and Parts as provided
         herein, and in any circumstances where more than one construction of
         the terms and conditions of this Lease is possible, a construction that
         would preserve such benefits shall control over any construction that
         would not preserve such benefits or would render them doubtful. To the
         extent consistent with the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 1110 or any
         analogous section of the federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time
         to time, it is hereby expressly agreed, that notwithstanding any other
         provisions of the federal bankruptcy law, as amended from time to time,
         any right of the Lessor and the Agent, as assignee of the Lessor under
         the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage, to take possession of the Aircraft in
         compliance with the provisions of this Lease shall not be affected by
         the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 362 or Section 363, as amended from
         time to time, or any analogous provisions of any superseding statute or
         any power of the bankruptcy court to enjoin such taking of possession.

                  (c)      The Lessor and the Lessee hereby agree that this
         Lease, including any modifications, supplements and amendments thereto,
         is intended to be treated as a lease for purposes of the Internal
         Revenue Code, and neither the Lessor nor the Lessee shall file any tax
         returns in a manner or take any other action or position inconsistent
         with the foregoing or with the Lessor's ownership of the Aircraft.
         Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as conveying to the
         Lessee any right, title or interest in the Aircraft except as a Lessee
         only. The Aircraft shall at all times during the term of this Lease be
         the sole and exclusive property of the Lessor.

                  SECTION 21. Purchase Option.

                  (a)      Purchase Option. So long as no Lease Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the Lessee shall have the option to purchase the
Aircraft at the end of the Term for a purchase price equal to the higher of the
Fair Market Sales Value (assuming that the Aircraft are in the condition
required by the Lease) as of such date and Stipulated Loss Value plus all
accrued Rent and all Supplemental Rent then due. Upon the payment by the Lessee
of the full of such amounts, the Lessor shall convey to the Lessee all right,
title and interest of the Lessor in and to the Aircraft on an "as-is, where is"
basis, without recourse or warranty.



                                      -76-
<PAGE>
                  (b)      Notice of Purchase. In order to exercise any purchase
         option under Section 21, the Lessee shall be required to give not less
         than 90 days (but not more than 360 days) irrevocable prior written
         notice to the Lessor. The Lessee will give the Lessor prior written
         irrevocable notice not less than 90 days (but not more than 360 days)
         before the expiration of the Term of its determination to return the
         Aircraft and not exercise any purchase option under this Section 21. If
         the Lessee fails to give notice as required herein, the Lessee will be
         deemed to have elected to return the Aircraft to the Lessor.

                  SECTION 22. Lessor's Right to Perform for Lessee. If the
Lessee fails to make any payment of Rent required to be made by it hereunder or
fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, then the
Lessor may itself make such payment or perform or comply with such agreement but
shall not be obligated hereunder to do so, and the amount of such payment and
the amount of the reasonable expenses of the Lessor incurred in connection with
such payment or the performance of or compliance with such agreement, as the
case may be, together with interest thereon at the Past Due Rate, shall be
deemed Supplemental Rent, payable by the Lessee upon demand.

                  SECTION 23. Miscellaneous. (a) Any provision of this Lease
that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. No term or
provision of this Lease may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,
but only by an instrument in writing signed by the Lessor, the Lessee and the
Agent. This Lease shall constitute an agreement of lease, and nothing contained
herein shall be construed as conveying to the Lessee any right, title or
interest in the Aircraft except as a lessee only. Neither the Lessee nor any
Affiliate of the Lessee will file any tax returns in a manner inconsistent with
the foregoing fact or with the Lessor's ownership of the Aircraft or with the
parties' agreement that this Lease be treated as a tax lease for purposes of the
Internal Revenue Code. The section and paragraph headings in this Lease and the
table of contents are for convenience of reference only and shall not modify,
define, expand or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof and all reference
herein to numbered sections, unless otherwise indicated, are to sections of this
Lease. THIS LEASE HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL IN ALL
RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. EACH OF
THE LESSEE AND THE LESSOR HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER
ARISING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO,
OR CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER AND WHETHER ARISING OR ASSERTED
BEFORE OR AFTER THE DATE HEREOF OR BEFORE OR AFTER THE PAYMENT, OBSERVANCE OR
PERFORMANCE OF THE LESSEE'S OR THE LESSOR'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS LEASE OR ANY
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT. This Lease may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same instrument.

<PAGE>
                  (b)      This Lease, together with the agreements, instruments
         and other documents required to be executed and delivered in connection
         herewith, supersedes all prior agreements and understanding of the
         parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, except
         any agreements referred to herein.

                  (c)      The time stipulated in this Lease for all payments
         and notices by the Lessee to the Lessor and for the performance of the
         Lessee's other obligations under this Lease will be of the essence of
         this Lease.

                  SECTION 24. Security for Lessor's Obligations. In order to
secure the obligations, the Lessor has agreed in the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage,
among other things, to assign to the Agent this Lease and the Lease Supplements
and to mortgage in favor of the Agent the Aircraft, subject to the reservations
and conditions therein set forth. All rights of the Lessor hereunder are subject
to the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage and the Lessor and the Lessee agree that so
long as the lien of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage has not been discharged in
accordance with its terms, (i) all payments hereunder shall be made to the Agent
for the benefit of Lenders to the extent of the Lenders' interest in such
payments, (ii) all notices from or to the Lessor shall be copied to the Agent
and (iii) the Lessee shall not take any actions that the Lessor would be
prohibited from taking under the terms of the Aircraft Chattel Mortgage. The
Lessee hereby acknowledges due notice of, and consents to, such assignment and
to the creation of such mortgage and security interest. To the extent, if any,
that this Lease and any Lease Supplement constitutes chattel paper (as such term
is in effect in any applicable jurisdiction), no security interest in this Lease
or any Lease Supplement may be created through the transfer or possession of any
counterpart other than the original executed counterpart containing the receipt
therefor executed by the Agent on the signature page hereof or thereof.

SUCH TERM IS IN EFFECT IN ANY APPLICABLE JURISDICTION), NO SECURITY INTEREST IN
THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT MAY BE CREATED THROUGH THE TRANSFER OR POSSESSION OF ANY
COUNTERPART OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART CONTAINING THE RECEIPT
THEREFOR EXECUTED BY THE AGENT ON THE SIGNATURE PAGE HEREOF.

                                                                          Page 2

vice in title, condition, design, operation or fitness for use; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein or in the Lease shall in any way diminish
or otherwise affect any right the Lessee or the Lessor may have with respect to
the Aircraft against the manufacturer, any affiliate thereof, or any
subcontractor or supplier of the manufacturer or any affiliate thereof, under
any purchase agreement or otherwise.

                  4.       All of the terms and provisions of the Lease are
hereby incorporated by reference in this Lease Supplement to the same extent as
