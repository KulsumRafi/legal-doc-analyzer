amount of their Allowed Claims. The Liquidating Trust Agreement shall provide
that the Bank Group Claims represented by the Class A Trust Units will be paid
in full, with interest, before any Distributions are made to the holders of any
other Claims or Class of Claims or Liquidating Trust Units, except for Allowed
Administrative Claims, Allowed Priority Tax Claims, and Allowed Priority Claims,
if any. Interest on the Bank Group Claims will accrue and be paid, if paid, on
the Allowed amount of such Claims as of the Petition Date and at the applicable
non-default contract rate specified in the Credit Agreement. In addition to the
foregoing, the Bank Group (or the Bank Group Agent, as the case may be) will
retain the Bank Group Liens. The Bank Group Claims are impaired and, thus, each
holder of the Bank Group Claim is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

      4.3 Class 2(a): Other Secured Claims. At the sole option of the Debtors or
the Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be, on the later of (x) the Effective
Date, or (y) for Claims


                                       11
<PAGE>

in Class 2(a) that were Disputed Claims and have become Allowed Secured Claims,
as soon thereafter as is practicable, such Allowed Secured Claims shall: (i) be
Reinstated; or (ii) receive the Collateral securing such Allowed Secured Claim;
or (iii) receive Cash in an amount, not to exceed the Allowed amount of such
Claim or equal to the proceeds actually realized from the sale of any Collateral
securing such Claim, less the actual costs and expenses of disposing of such
Collateral; or (iv) receive such other treatment as may be agreed upon by the
Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be, and the holder of an
Allowed Secured Claim. In the event that the Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee
elects, pursuant to option (ii) above, to distribute to the holder of an Allowed
Secured Claim, the Collateral securing such Allowed Secured Claim, the holder of
such Allowed Secured Claim shall bear all expenses relating to the transfer of
possession and rights in the Collateral, including, but not limited to, storage
expenses. Holders of Allowed claims in Class 2(a) are not impaired and, thus,
each such holder is not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan in its
capacity as a holder of such Claim.

      4.4 Class 3: General Unsecured Claims. On the Effective Date, each holder
of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim in Class 3 shall be issued Class B
Liquidating Trust Units in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidating
Trust Agreement in the amount of each holder's Allowed General Unsecured Claim.
Class 3 Claims shall include the Debenture Claims, which shall be deemed Allowed
Claims as of the Petition Date in the aggregate amount of $71,412,251.59 on
account of principal and accrued, but unpaid, interest through the Petition
Date. The Liquidating Trust Agreement shall provide that Allowed General
Unsecured Claims represented by the Class B Trust Units will be paid in full,
with interest, prior to the payment of any amounts to the holder of the LMI
Interest represented by Class C Trust Units, but only after full payment of the
Bank Group Claims in accordance with Section 4.2 of this Plan and the
Liquidating Trust Agreement. Interest on Allowed General Unsecured Claims will
accrue and be paid, if paid, on the Allowed amount of such Claims as of the
Petition Date and at the applicable non-default rate specified in any valid
contract upon which such Allowed General Unsecured Claim is or was based or, if
no rate is specified or no such contract exists, at the federal judgment rate as
of the Petition Date. Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Class 3 are
impaired and are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

      4.5 Class 4: LMI Interest. On the Effective Date, the holder of the LMI
Interest shall be issued Class C Liquidating Trust Units in accordance with the
provisions of the Liquidating Trust Agreement in an amount equal to the stated
liquidation value of the LMI Interest. The Liquidating Trust Agreement shall
provide that the LMI Interest represented by the Class C Trust Units will be
paid only after the Bank Group Claims and all Allowed General Unsecured Claims
have been paid in full and proper reserve for any Disputed Claims has been made
in accordance with this Article 4 and the Liquidating Trust Agreement. As of the
Effective Date, all dividends on or relating to the LMI Interest shall cease to
accrue and shall not be issued or paid by the issuance of Liquidating Trust
Units or in any other manner or form. The LMI Interest is impaired and, thus,
the holder of the LMI Interest is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan
in its capacity as a holder of such Interest.

      4.6 Class 5: HIGI Interests. Holders of HIGI Interests shall receive no
property under the Plan and the HIGI Interests shall be cancelled on and as of
the Effective Date. The holders of the HIGI Interests are impaired and, for
purposes of the Plan, each holder of a HIGI


                                       12
<PAGE>

Interest is conclusively presumed to have rejected the Plan and is not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                             IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAN

      5.1 The Liquidating Trust.

            (a) Establishment of the Trust. On the Effective Date, the Debtors,
on their own behalf and on behalf of holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed
Interests in Classes 2 through 4 (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the
"Trust Holders") shall execute the Liquidating Trust Agreement and shall take
all other steps necessary to establish the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating
Trust Agreement shall contain provisions customary to trust agreements utilized
in comparable circumstances, including, but not limited to, any and all
provisions necessary to ensure the treatment of the Liquidating Trust as a
liquidating trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

            (b) Issuance of New HIGI Stock and Transfer of Other Trust Assets.
On the Effective Date, the Debtors shall issue the New HIGI Stock and transfer
(as described in Section 5.1(c) below) all of their right, title and interest in
and to all other Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust, free and clear of any
lien, Claim or Interest in such property of any other Person except for the Bank
Group Liens or as otherwise provided for in this Plan or the Liquidating Trust
Agreement. Title to all Trust Assets shall vest in the Liquidating Trust on the
Effective Date. The Debtors or such other Persons that may have possession or
control of such Trust Assets shall transfer possession or control of such Trust
Assets to the Liquidating Trustee and shall execute documents or instruments
necessary to effectuate such transfers.

            (c) Transfer for the Benefit of Trust Holders. The transfer of the
Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust shall be made for the benefit of the Trust
Holders, whether the Claims of Trust Holders are Allowed on or after the
Effective Date of the Plan. In this regard, the Trust Assets will be transferred
to the Trust Holders to be held by the Debtors on their behalf. Immediately
thereafter, on behalf of the Trust Holders, the Debtors shall transfer the Trust
Assets to the Liquidating Trust in exchange for the Liquidating Trust Units,
which units shall be distributed by the Liquidating Trustee to the Trust Holders
in exchange for their Allowed Claims or Interests in accordance with Article 4
hereof and the Liquidating Trust Agreement. Upon the transfer of the Trust
Assets, the Liquidating Trustee shall succeed to all of the Debtors' right,
title and interest in the Trust Assets and the Debtors will have no further
interest in or with respect to the Trust Assets or the Liquidating Trust. For
all United States federal income tax purposes, all parties (including, without
limitation, the Debtors, the Liquidating Trustee, and the Trust Holders) shall
treat the transfer of Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust described in Section
1.2 of the Liquidating Trust Agreement and herein (and any subsequent transfers
of Assets) as a transfer to the Trust Holders followed by a transfer by such
Trust Holders to the Liquidating Trust, and the beneficiaries of the Liquidating
Trust shall be treated as the grantors and owners thereof.

            (d) Purpose of the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust shall be
established for the sole purpose of liquidating the Trust Assets, in accordance
with Treasury


                                       13
<PAGE>

Regulation section 301.7701-4(d), with no objective to continue or engage in the
conduct of a trade or business, except to the extent reasonably necessary to,
and consistent with, the liquidating purpose of the Liquidating Trust. Subject
to definitive guidance from the IRS, all parties shall treat the Liquidating
Trust as a liquidating trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

            (e) Valuation of Trust Assets. From time to time as necessary, the
Liquidating Trustee shall in good faith determine the fair market value of the
Trust Assets and any other Assets transferred to the Liquidating Trust and
thereafter apprise the Trust Advisory Board and the Trust Holders of Record in
writing regarding such valuation. Any such valuation shall be used consistently
by all parties (including, without limitation, the Debtors, the Liquidating
Trustee and the Trust Holders) for all purposes, including United States federal
income tax purposes.

            (f) Termination. The Liquidating Trust will terminate on the earlier
of (a) thirty (30) days after the full and final Distribution of the Trust
Assets or proceeds thereof in accordance with the terms of the Liquidating Trust
Agreement and this Plan, and (b) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective
Date; provided, however, that within six months of the fifth (5th) anniversary
of the Effective Date, the Court, upon a motion by the Liquidating Trustee or
any party in interest, may extend the term of the Liquidating Trust for an
additional term of not more than five (5) years if it is necessary for the
liquidation of the Trust Assets. Multiple extensions may be obtained so long as
Court approval is obtained within six months of the beginning of each such
extended term. The Liquidating Trustee shall seek all necessary extensions the
term of the Liquidating Trust in order to fully implement this Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liquidating Trustee shall not unduly prolong
the duration of the Liquidating Trust and shall at all times endeavor to
resolve, settle or otherwise dispose of all property and Claims that constitute
Trust Assets and to effect the full and final Distribution of the Trust Assets
to the Trust Holders in accordance with the terms hereof and the Liquidating
Trust Agreement and thereafter terminate the Liquidating Trust as soon as
practicable.

      5.2 Liquidating Trustee and Trust Advisory Board.

            (a) Appointment. Stephen L. Kibblehouse shall be appointed as the
Liquidating Trustee and shall hold such position until his removal, resignation
or death. There shall also be appointed a Trust Advisory Board composed of the
Liquidating Trustee and a maximum of four (4) other individual persons
designated by the Trust Holders as set forth in the Liquidating Trust Agreement.
In the event that the Trust Advisory Board is not formed or ceases to exist for
any reason, all references in the Liquidating Trust Agreement to required
approval or other action of such Trust Advisory Board shall be of no force or
effect or shall be deemed to be references to the Liquidating Trustee, as
appropriate.

            (b) Action by Trust Advisory Board. The Trust Advisory Board will
direct the actions of Liquidating Trustee in the exercise of the authority
granted to the Liquidating Trustee under the Liquidating Trust Agreement and
this Plan. Unless otherwise specified in the Liquidating Trust Agreement, any
action taken or direction given by the Trust Advisory Board shall be taken or
given by a majority of the members of the Trust Advisory Board. The Liquidating
Trust shall not and shall not be authorized to enter into any agreement or


                                       14
<PAGE>

consummate any transaction involving the sale of the stock, assets, operations
or business of any Surviving Debtor Entity or Insurance Company Subsidiary
unless at least eighty percent (80%) of the members then comprising the Trust
Advisory Board have voted in favor of any such sale. The Trust Advisory Board
shall be authorized to adopt by-laws consistent with this Plan and the
Liquidating Trust Agreement to govern its activities.

      5.3 Issuance of Liquidating Trust Units and Applicability of Securities
Laws.

            (a) Stated Value and Accrued Interest. The stated value of each
Liquidating Trust Unit shall be one dollar. Interest accruing on or with respect
to a Claim or Class of Claims shall accrue on the basis of one Liquidating Trust
Unit for every dollar of interest accrued. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Plan, only whole numbers of Liquidating Trust Units shall be issued and
all Claims, and any interest accruing on Claim, shall be rounded to the nearest
dollar.

            (b) Issuance by Book Entry. All Liquidating Trust Units shall be
uncertificated and issued to Trust Holders by book entry only in the register
maintained by the Liquidating Trustee. The Liquidating Trustee shall not be
required to send any notice to Trust Holders upon the issuance of the
Liquidating Trust Units or the updating of any book entries on account of
accrued interest on Claims or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
request made to the Liquidating Trustee in writing by a Trust Holder, the
Liquidating Trustee shall confirm the amount and class of Liquidating Trust
Units then issued in the name of such Trust Holder.

            (c) Securities Laws. Under section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
issuance of Liquidating Trust Units shall be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state and local laws requiring
registration of securities. The Liquidating Trustee will not attempt to register
the Liquidating Trust Units under any state or federal securities law at any
time, and the Liquidating Trustee, with the advice of counsel, will take such
action (including, without limitation, any action described in Section 5.3(d)
below) as it deems necessary to ensure that the Liquidating Trust will not at
any time be required to comply with the registration and reporting requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended or any other state or local law requiring the registration
of securities.

            (d) Transfer of Liquidating Trust Units. The Liquidating Trust Units
shall be transferable by the Trust Holders upon and after issuance, however,
neither the Liquidating Trustee nor the Trust Advisory Board will at any time
shall seek to have the Liquidating Trust Units listed on any exchange or on the
over-the-counter market after the Effective Date. The Liquidating Trustee, with
the advice and consent of the Trust Advisory Board, may at any time establish
procedures governing the transfer of Liquidating Trust Units, including, without
limitation, the imposition of fees in such amounts as may be deemed necessary or
appropriate in relation to the costs of maintaining the register of Trust
Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment, pledge, mortgage, sale,
transfer or other disposition (as used in this Section 5.3(d), a "Transfer") of
any Liquidating Trust Units shall be permitted until the proposed transferor has
delivered to the Liquidating Trustee at the proposed transferor's sole expense a
written opinion satisfactory to the Liquidating Trustee from legal counsel
satisfactory to the


                                       15
<PAGE>

Liquidating Trustee providing, and the Liquidating Trustee has concluded, that
such Transfer would not (i) result in a violation of, or require registration of
the Liquidating Trust Units under, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
any state securities laws; (ii) result in a violation of, or require the
Liquidating Trust to register as an investment company under, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended; (iii) result in a violation of, or require the
Liquidating Trust to make any filings or obtain approvals or qualifications
under, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended; (iv) result in a violation
of any other law, rule or regulation by the Liquidating Trust or any Trust
Holder; (v) result in the Liquidating Trust being subjected to any additional
regulatory requirements or restrictions; (vi) cause an "ownership change" within
the meaning of section 382 of the IRC within two years following the Effective
Date; (vii) if the Liquidating Trust is deemed to be a partnership for United
States federal income tax purposes, result in the treatment of the Liquidating
Trust as a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of section 7704 of
the IRC and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; or (viii) result or
potentially result in any adverse tax or other consequences to the Liquidating
Trust, the assets held by it, or the Debtors. Any purported Transfer in
violation of the foregoing will not be registered on the register maintained by
the Liquidating Trustee. The Liquidating Trustee shall provide the proposed
transferor with any and all information necessary to enable such proposed
transferor to provide the opinion required by this Section 5.3(d).

      5.4 Surviving Debtor Entities and Insurance Company Subsidiaries.

            (a) Corporate Structure. Through the Liquidating Trust's position as
direct or indirect equity owner of each of the Surviving Debtor Entities, the
Liquidating Trustee shall cause the Surviving Debtor Entities to act
consistently with the purposes and provisions of the Liquidating Trust and the
Liquidating Trust Agreement. The Liquidating Trustee may authorize and direct
the merger, consolidation, dissolution of or other restructuring transaction
with respect to any of the Surviving Debtor Entities to the extent deemed
necessary and appropriate by the Liquidating Trustee and Trust Advisory Board.
Through the Liquidating Trust's position as direct or indirect equity owner of
each of the Insurance Company Subsidiaries, the Liquidating Trustee shall cause
the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to act consistently with the purposes and
provisions of the Liquidating Trust and the Liquidating Trust Agreement and, in
addition, any and all supervisory orders, protective orders or other
requirements of the State Departments of Insurance. Subject to any and all
consents, conditions, or requirements of the State Departments of Insurance, the
Liquidating Trustee and Trust Advisory Board may authorize and direct the
merger, consolidation, dissolution of or other restructuring transaction with
respect to any of the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the extent deemed
necessary and appropriate by the Liquidating Trustee and Trust Advisory Board.

            (b) Liquidating Trustee as Director. Subject to the requirements of
other applicable law or the State Departments of Insurance, the Liquidating
Trustee may serve or continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of
any Surviving Debtor Entity or Insurance Company Subsidiary.

            (c) Regulatory Authority of State Departments of Insurance. Nothing
in this Plan attempts to limit the authority or ability of the State Departments
of Insurance to regulate the businesses, operations or activities of the
Insurance Company Subsidiaries.

                                       16

      5.5 Distribution Provisions.

            (a) Annual Distributions from the Liquidating Trust. On each Annual
Distribution Date, the Liquidating Trust shall distribute all Available Cash
from the Liquidating Trust to the Trust Holders (or the relevant Paying Agent,
as the case may be), after making reserve for Disputed Claims as provided for in
Section 5.8(b) below; provided, however, that the Liquidating Trustee shall not
be required to distribute Available Cash on each Annual Distribution Date if the
aggregate Distribution on such date would not exceed $10,000 in value.

            (b) Quarterly Distributions from the Liquidating Trust. On each
Quarterly Distribution Date, the Liquidating Trust shall distribute all
Available Cash from the Liquidating Trust to the Trust Holders (or the relevant
Paying Agent, as the case may be), after making reserve for Disputed Claims as
provided for in Section 5.8(b) below; provided, however, that the Liquidating
Trustee shall not be required to distribute Available Cash on each Quarterly
Distribution Date if the aggregate Distribution on such date would not exceed
$300,000 in value.

            (c) Distributions from HIGI and HIGI Subsidiaries. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Liquidating Trustee shall cause HIGI and HIGI shall cause
each other Surviving Debtor Entity and, to the extent permitted by the
applicable State Departments of Insurance, the Liquidating Trustee and each
Surviving Debtor Entity shall cause each Insurance Company Subsidiary to
distribute to the Liquidating Trust on or before each Distribution Date (or such
earlier time as required to be included in the Distribution by the Liquidating
Trust on such Distribution Date) all of the Cash of HIGI and each such HIGI
Subsidiary, less (i) any amounts required or which may be required for the
payment of taxes, (ii) subject to Trust Advisory Board approval, any other
reasonable and necessary expenses of HIGI and each such HIGI Subsidiary, and
(iii) such other amounts as are determined necessary by the Trust Advisory Board
to cover anticipated future expenses of the Liquidating Trust. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, HIGI and the HIGI Subsidiaries need not, and the Liquidating
Trustee shall not direct HIGI or the HIGI Subsidiaries to, distribute Cash in
amounts which fall below certain minimum thresholds established by the Trust
Advisory Board and the Liquidating Trustee from time to time.

            (d) Manner of Payment of Distributions. All Distributions to Trust
Holders from the Liquidating Trust shall be made according to the priorities set
forth in Article 4, payable only to Trust Holders of Record and, as to each such
Trust Holder within a Class then entitled to payment, in amounts equal to such
Trust Holders' Ratable Share of the Distribution. All Distributions to Trust
Holders from the Liquidating Trust shall be payable in Cash by wire transfer,
check, or such other method as the Liquidating Trustee deems appropriate under
the circumstances. The Liquidating Trustee shall withhold from the Distribution
of any Trust Holder any amount which the Liquidating Trustee determines to be
required by any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority, or by any
other law, regulation, rule, ruling, directive or other governmental
requirement.

            (e) Distributions on Non-Business Days. Any payment or Distribution
due on a day other than a Business Day shall be made, without interest, on the
next Business Day.

            (f) No Distribution Pending Allowance. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Plan, no Cash or other property shall be distributed, and no
Liquidating Trust Units shall

                                       17
<PAGE>
be issued, under this Plan on account of any Disputed Claim or Interest, unless
and until such Claim or Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Interest.

            (g) No Distribution in Excess of Allowed Amounts. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Plan or the Liquidating Trust
Agreement, no holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest shall receive Distributions
of a value which exceed the Allowed amount of such Claim or Interest as of the
Petition Date, plus any accrued interest provided for in this Plan. The
foregoing shall not limit holders of Disputed Claims from receiving accrued
interest as provided in this Plan, if such holders' Disputed Claims become
Allowed. In the event that the Allowed Claims and Interests of all Trust Holders
shall have been paid in full in accordance with this Plan and the Liquidating
Trust Agreement, all excess or subsequent Distributions, and any Unclaimed
Distributions which become excess Distributions, shall be made to the Clerk of
the Bankruptcy Court for distribution to creditors who shall make their claims
upon the Clerk in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3011 and section 347(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code (notwithstanding the usual inapplicability of such provisions in
chapter 11 bankruptcy cases). Upon full and final tender of such Distributions
to the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court, the Liquidating Trustee, the Trust
Advisory Board and each of their respective employees, representatives and
agents shall be fully discharged and released from any claims of any Person to
such Distributions.

            (h) De Minimis Distributions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Plan or the Liquidating Trust Agreement, the
Liquidating Trustee shall not be required to distribute Cash to the holder of an
Allowed Claim or Interest if the amount of Cash to be distributed on account of
such Claim is less than $25. Any holder of an Allowed Claim on account of which
the amount of Cash to be distributed is less than $25 shall have such Claim
discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting any such Claim against the
Debtors, the Liquidating Trust, or their respective property. Any Cash not
distributed pursuant to this provision shall be the property of the Liquidating
Trust, free of any restrictions thereon.

            (i) Unclaimed Distributions. Any Unclaimed Distributions, and all
interest, dividends, and other earnings thereon, shall be held and segregated in
sub-accounts of the Liquidating Trust for the benefit of the Trust Holders
entitled thereto under the terms of this Plan and the Liquidating Trust
Agreement. All such Unclaimed Distributions shall be held for a period of one
year following the applicable Distribution Date and during such period shall be
released from the Liquidating Trust and delivered to Trust Holders entitled
thereto only upon presentation of proper proof by such Trust Holders of such
entitlement. At the end of one year following the relevant Distribution Date of
any Unclaimed Distributions, the Trust Holders theretofore entitled to such
Unclaimed Distributions shall cease to be entitled thereto and the Unclaimed
Distributions for each such Trust Holder shall then be distributed on a Ratable
basis to the Trust Holders who have received and have claimed Distributions and
who are otherwise entitled to further Distributions pursuant to the Plan and if
no such Trust Holders then exist, such Unclaimed Distributions shall be
distributed as set forth in Section 5.5(g) above. The Liquidating Trustee shall
pay, or cause to be paid, out of the funds held in any sub-account, all taxes
imposed by any federal, state and local taxing authorities, and any foreign
taxing authorities, on the income generated by the funds held in such
sub-account. The Liquidating Trustee shall also file, or cause to be filed any
tax or information return related to any sub-account. All Cash held in such
sub-accounts shall be invested in accordance with section 5.5 of

                                       18
<PAGE>
the Liquidating Trust Agreement and section 345 of the Bankruptcy Code, as
modified by the relevant Orders of the Court for investments made by the Debtors
during the Chapter 11 Cases. The earnings on such investments shall be held in
trust as an addition to the balance of the sub-accounts for the benefit of the
Trust Holders entitled to such Unclaimed Distributions, and shall not constitute
property of the Liquidating Trust.

      5.6 Allocation of Tax Items. Unless otherwise required by applicable tax
law, items of income, gain, loss and deduction recognized or incurred by the
Liquidating Trust and the amount of distributions received by the Liquidating
Trust shall be allocated ratably among the Trust Holders who are entitled to
receive Distributions in the tax year in accordance with the priorities set
forth in Article 4 hereof and section 4.4 of the Liquidating Trust Agreement,
provided that where more than one Class of Trust Holders actually receives a
Distribution in a tax year, such items of income, gain, loss and deduction, and
such distributions received by the Liquidating Trust, shall be allocated ratably
based upon the amount of each Distribution made to such Classes of Trust
Holders.

      5.7 Setoffs. The Debtors and the Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be,
are authorized, pursuant to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, to set off
against any Allowed Claim and the Distributions to be made on account of such
Allowed Claim, the claims, rights and Causes of Action of any nature that the
Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee may at any time hold against the holder of
such Allowed Claim; provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a
setoff nor the allowance of any Claim shall constitute a waiver or release by
the Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee of any such claims, rights and Causes of
Action that the Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee may at any time possess
against such holder.

      5.8 Distributions to Holders of Disputed Claims and Interests.

            (a) Resolution of Disputed Claims. No Liquidating Trust Units shall
be issued and no Distribution or payment shall be made on account of a Disputed
Claim or Interest until such Disputed Claim or Interest becomes an Allowed Claim
or Interest. Unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, after the
Effective Date, the Liquidating Trustee, under the direction of the Trust
Advisory Board, shall succeed to the Debtors' right to make and file objections
to Claims and Interests and settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all such
objections previously made or filed by the Debtors. The Debtors or the
Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be, shall file all objections to Claims and
Interests as soon as practicable, but in no event later than (i) ninety (90)
days after the later to occur of the Effective Date or the applicable Bar Date,
or (ii) such other time as may be fixed or extended by the order of the
Bankruptcy Court. All objections to Claims and Interests filed by the Debtors
and the Liquidating Trustee shall be filed and resolved in accordance with all
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules and the
Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction to resolve such objections pursuant to
section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code after the Effective Date.

            (b) Distributions when a Disputed Claim or Interest Becomes Allowed
or is Disallowed. On each Distribution Date, the Liquidating Trustee shall
reserve and segregate Cash sufficient to pay holders of Disputed Claims and
Interests their Ratable Share, if any, of the Available Cash distributed to
Trust Holders on such Distribution Date. Any such Cash reserved shall be held
and segregated in sub-accounts of the Liquidating Trust for the benefit of
holders of

                                       19
<PAGE>
Disputed Claims and Interests. In the event a Disputed Claim or Interest is
ultimately Allowed, the holder of such previously Disputed Claim or Interest
shall be issued Liquidating Trust Units in accordance with the treatment of
Classes of Claims or Interests set forth in Article 4, and on the next
succeeding Distribution Date, shall be entitled to such holder's Ratable Share
of any Distributions previously made on account of the Class of Liquidating
Trust Units issued to such holder. Any Cash reserved and held in sub-accounts
for the benefit of a holder of a Disputed Claim or Interest which is
subsequently Disallowed, in whole or in part, shall be distributed as Available
Cash on the next succeeding Distribution Date in accordance with the provisions
of this Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement. The Liquidating Trustee shall
pay, or cause to be paid, out of the funds held in any sub-account, all taxes
imposed by any federal, state and local taxing authorities, and any foreign
taxing authorities, on the income generated by the funds held in such
sub-account. The Liquidating Trustee shall also file, or cause to be filed, any
tax or information return related to any sub-account. All Cash held in such
sub-accounts shall be invested in accordance with section 5.5 of the Liquidating
Trust Agreement and section 345 of the Bankruptcy Code, as modified by the
relevant Orders of the Court for investments made by the Debtors during the
Chapter 11 Cases. The earnings on such investments shall be held in trust as an
addition to the balance of the sub-accounts for the benefit of the Trust Holders
entitled to such Distributions, and shall not constitute property of the
Liquidating Trust.

            (c) Late Claims. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Plan, any Claim which is not deemed filed pursuant to section 1111(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, or for which a Proof of Claim is not timely filed pursuant to

Claims register in the Chapter 11 Cases without need for any further notice,
motion, objection or order.

            (d) Estimation of Claims. The Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee, as

subject to estimation under section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and for which

extent permitted by section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, regardless of whether
any party in interest previously objected to such Claim. The Bankruptcy Court
will retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code at any time during litigation concerning any objection to any
Claim.

            (e) Procedure. All of the Claims objection, estimation and

transfer, mortgage, recording or other similar tax.

      5.13 Cancellation of the HIGI Interests. As of the Effective Date, the

HIGI Interests will not be required to surrender any stock certificate, warrants
or other evidence of such Interests.

      5.14 Cancellation of Agreements. On the Effective Date, except as
otherwise provided for herein, the Credit Agreement, the Debentures, and any
other agreement, note, bond, indenture, instrument or document evidencing or
creating a Claim (as used in this Section 5.14, collectively, the "Instruments")
will be deemed cancelled and of no further force or effect with respect to the
Debtors without any further action on the part of the Bankruptcy Court or any
other Person. The holders of such cancelled Instruments will have no Claims
against the Debtors for payment of or on such Instruments except for the rights
provided pursuant to this Plan. Each Instrument that is administered by a Paying
Agent shall continue in effect solely for the purposes of (a) allowing such
Paying Agent to further distribute Distributions to Trust Holders under this
Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement, and (b) permitting such Paying Agent
to maintain any rights or liens it may have for fees, costs, expenses and
indemnification under such Instrument (all of which such fees, costs, expenses
and indemnification shall be paid only from the Distributions made to such
Paying Agent under this Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement).

      5.15 Debtors' Continued Corporate Existence and Vesting of Assets.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Liquidating Trust
Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto, each Debtor
shall continue to exist on and after the Effective Date as a separate entity
with all the powers of a corporation under the laws of its respective state of
incorporation and without prejudice to any right to alter or terminate such
existence (whether by merger or otherwise) under such applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary in order to comply with
the Bankruptcy Code, the certificates of incorporation for each Debtor shall be
amended to prohibit the issuance of nonvoting equity securities. Except as
provided herein or in the Liquidating Trust Agreement regarding the transfer to
the Liquidating Trust of the Trust Assets, or any other agreement or instrument
relating thereto, on and after the Effective Date all remaining Assets of the
Debtors (i.e. Interests in subsidiaries) shall vest in each respective Debtor,
free and clear of all Liens, Claims or other encumbrances, except, to the extent
applicable, the Bank Group Liens. Schedule 5.15 sets forth the identity of all
individual persons proposed to serve as officers and directors of the Debtors

pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.

      8.4 Presumed Rejection of Plan. Class 5 is impaired and shall receive no
distribution of any property under the Plan and, therefore, is conclusively

by Class 5, the Debtors will request the Bankruptcy Court to confirm the Plan as

such Class in accordance with the provisions of section 1129(b) of the

ability to modify the Plan as it applies to any particular Debtor to satisfy the
confirmation requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. Each provision
of this Plan shall be considered severable and, if for any reason any provision
or provisions herein are determined to be invalid and contrary to any existing
or future law, the balance of this Plan shall be given effect without relation
to the invalid provision.

place on or prior to the Effective Date and in any way relating to the Debtors,
the Chapter 11 Cases, or the Plan.

            (b) Release by Holders of Claims and Interests. Effective on the
Confirmation Date, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, and
except as otherwise provided in the Confirmation Order, in consideration for the
obligations of such Persons under the Plan and the property to be delivered in
connection with the Plan, each holder of a Claim against or Interest in the
Debtors, shall be deemed to have forever released, waived and discharged each of
the Debtors or any of their respective successors and assigns, or any of their
respective properties, from any and all debts, Claims, Interests, obligations,
rights, causes of action, choses in action, demands, suits, proceedings and
liabilities, whether for fraud, tort, contract, violations of applicable
securities laws, or otherwise, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
liquidated or unliquidated, contingent or non-contingent, existing, or hereafter
arising, in law, equity or otherwise that are based in whole or in part upon any
act, omission, transaction, state of facts, circumstances or other occurrence or
failure of an event to occur, taking place on or prior to the Effective Date and
in any way relating to the Debtors, the Chapter 11 Cases, or the Plan; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall constitute a release or be deemed a release
or compromise of (i) any claims, obligations, rights, causes of action, choses
in action, demands, suits, proceedings against or liabilities of any Person
based upon any act or omission arising out of such Person's actual fraud; (ii)
the rights or Liens granted to the holders of Claims and Interests under the
Plan, or (iii) the claims or rights of any Person under any validly existing
insurance policy issued by, or any reinsurance agreement or other contract with,
any Insurance Company Subsidiary.

      11.7 Reservation of Rights. Except as expressly set forth herein, this
Plan shall have no force or effect unless the Court shall enter the Confirmation
Order. Neither the Filing of the Plan, any statement or provision contained in
the Plan or any schedule, Exhibit or agreement attached to the Plan, nor the
taking of any action by the Debtors with respect to the Plan shall be or shall
be deemed to be an admission or waiver of any rights of the Debtors with respect
to the holders of any Claims or Interests prior to the Effective Date.

      11.8 Successors and Assigns. The rights, benefits, and obligations of any
Person named or referred to in the Plan shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of, the heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of
such Person.

effect to principles of conflicts of law.

      11.10 Relation to Disclosure Statement, Confirmation Order and Agreements.
To the extent the Confirmation Order and/or this Plan is inconsistent with the
Disclosure Statement, this Plan controls the Disclosure Statement, and the
Confirmation Order (and any other subsequent order of the Court) controls this
Plan. To the extent any provision of the Liquidating Trust Agreement is found to
be inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, the provisions of the
Liquidating Trust Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the Confirmation Order (and any other subsequent order of the Court)
shall control the Liquidating Trust Agreement.
