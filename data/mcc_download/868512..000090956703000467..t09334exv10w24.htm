Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of Hollinger
International under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum
amount as will result in the Obligations of Hollinger International under this
Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. For purposes
hereof, &#147;Bankruptcy Law&#148; means any proceeding of the type referred to in
Section&nbsp;12.1.4 of the Credit Agreement or Title 11, U.S. Code or any similar
foreign, federal or state law for the relief of debtors.

Hollinger International, and shall remain in full force and effect until all

obligations of Hollinger International hereunder shall have been paid in full,
finally and indefeasibly, and the commitments under the Facilities, all Letters
of Credit, all Hedging Agreements and any other commitments by the Lenders or
the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to the Guaranteed Obligors
shall have terminated (even if the Letters of Credit shall have been cash
collateralized). Hollinger International guarantees that the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document under which they
arise, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in
any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party with respect thereto. The
creation or existence from time to time of additional Guaranteed Obligations to
the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties or any of them is hereby
authorized, without notice to Hollinger International, and shall in no way
impair the rights of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties or
the obligations of Hollinger International under this Guaranty, including
Hollinger International&#146;s guaranty of such additional Guaranteed Obligations.
