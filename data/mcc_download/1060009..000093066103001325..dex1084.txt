                              W I T N E S S E T H:

A.   WHEREAS, Lessor and Tenant have heretofore entered into a certain Amended
     and Restated Master Lease Agreement No. 1 dated as of April 20, 2001 (as
     the same may have heretofore been, is hereby, or may hereafter be amended,
     amended and restated, supplemented, modified, renewed, extended or
     replaced, the "Lease") demising to Tenant, among other properties, the real
     property described in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof and
     commonly known as Harrington House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center,
     together with the improvements thereon (the "Existing Leased Premises").

B.   WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Lessor, with the consent of Tenant, will
     subject certain contiguous parcels of real property located in Walpole,
     Massachusetts, including the Existing Leased Premises, to a condominium
     form of ownership to be known as the New Pond Village Condominium (the
     "Condominium") and to be governed by a Master Deed (the "Master Deed"),
     Unit Deeds (the "Unit Deeds"), a Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of
     Trust"), Condominium Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), and Rules and Regulations (the
     "Rules and Regulations"; and together with the Master Deed, the Unit Deeds,
     the Declaration of Trust, the Bylaws and any other document governing the

<PAGE>

     Condominium, each as amended from time to time, the "Condominium
     Documents") by the recording of the Master Deed, Units Deeds, and
     Declaration of Trust dated as of the date hereof.

C.   WHEREAS, the Condominium shall contain a Nursing Home Unit (consisting of
     certain portions of the Existing Leased Premises) and an
     Independent/Assisted Living Facility Unit, and certain general and limited
     common elements appurtenant thereto, all as described in the Condominium
     Documents.

D.   WHEREAS, Lessor and Tenant desire to amend the Lease, as it relates to the
     Existing Leased Premises, on the terms described in this Amendment.

E.   WHEREAS, capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given
     to them in the Condominium Documents.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants set forth herein, the
payment of One Dollar ($1.00), and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Lessor and Tenant
hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:

1. As of the date hereof, the Lease, as it applies to the Existing Leased
Premises, is amended: (a) to confirm and adopt the amended legal description
that is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit B (the "Revised Leased
Premises") in substitution for the Existing Leased Premises for all purposes
under the Lease, and (b) to confirm Tenant's agreement to treat the Condominium
Documents as "Permitted Encumbrances," as defined in, and for all purposes of,
the Lease, and to subordinate the Lease to the Condominium Documents.

2. Tenant hereby accepts and ratifies the provisions of the Condominium
Documents, and agrees that all such provisions are and shall be deemed to be
covenants running with the land which bind Tenant and its successors in interest
as if such provisions were recited or stipulated at length herein. Tenant agrees
that the Lease, as it relates to the Revised Leased Premises, is and shall
remain subordinate in every respect to the Condominium Documents and to Chapter
183A of the Massachusetts General Laws, in each case as amended from time to
time. As long as Tenant is a tenant of the Nursing Home Unit, and there is not
then continuing an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Lease) of
Tenant, Tenant shall be permitted, but not required (unless any such step
represents a duty, liability or obligation of Tenant by virtue of the
Condominium Documents being deemed "Permitted Encumbrances" for purposes of the
Lease), to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to cure, on behalf of
Lessor, any default under the Condominium Documents that results from a failure
by Lessor to perform any duty or satisfy any liability or obligation under the
Condominium Documents.

3. Lessor hereby covenants that, as long as Tenant is a tenant of the Nursing
Home Unit, and there is not then continuing an Event of Default (as such term is
defined in the Lease) of Tenant, in addition to any other obligations of Lessor
under the Lease, Lessor shall:

                                       2

<PAGE>

     (a)  Pay to (or credit to the account of) Tenant (i) any amounts refunded
          to Lessor or otherwise credited, as a refund, to the account of
          Lessor, as the Nursing Home Unit Owner, in respect of Common Expenses
          previously paid directly or indirectly by Tenant, and (ii) any amounts
          paid to Lessor or otherwise credited back to the account of Lessor, as
          the Nursing Home Unit Owner, pursuant to the last sentence of Section
          7(d) of the Bylaws, but only if the casualty damage to which such
          proceeds relate is fully repaired and restored; Lessor agreeing that
          Lessor shall take any commercially reasonable steps available to
          Lessor under the Condominium Documents which are reasonably requested
          by Tenant to ensure that any repair or restoration of the General
          Common Elements that is to be undertaken by the Condominium Trust is
          completed to the standard and within the time frame provided in the
          Condominium Documents. As used in this Amendment, references to
          amounts "indirectly paid" by Tenant mean amounts paid by Tenant to
          Lessor specifically in respect of amounts owed by Lessor to the
          Condominium Trust;


     (b)  Fund the Reserves required to be funded pursuant to Section 3(c) of
          the Bylaws; provided that Tenant shall reimburse Lessor on demand for
          the Nursing Home Unit's share of any amounts drawn down by the
          Condominium Trust from such Reserves to the extent such draw down is
          utilized to pay for expenditures for which Tenant (and not Lessor) is
          responsible under the Lease and this Amendment;

     (c)  Upon written request of Tenant, make all requisite arrangements on
          Tenant's behalf to permit Tenant to obtain access to all reports,
          documents, and information to which Lessor is entitled as a Unit Owner
          of the Condominium or provide certified and complete copies of all of
          the foregoing received by Lessor in its capacity as the Nursing Home
          Unit Owner; and

     (d)  (i) Upon the written request of Tenant, cause any of Tenant's
          Leasehold Mortgagees (as defined in the Lease) with an interest in the
          Revised Leased Premises (including, as of the date hereof, JPMorgan
          Chase Bank (f/k/a The Chase Manhattan Bank, successor by merger to
          Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York), as senior collateral agent
          and as second priority collateral agent (in such capacity, "JP Morgan
          Chase Bank") to be added as a "Listed Mortgagee" for all purposes
          under the Condominium Documents, and (ii) cause Tenant to be added as
          a "Listed Mortgagee" solely for purposes of Section 7(b) of the
          Bylaws.

4. Lessor and Tenant agree that, with respect to the Tenant
Consent/Approval/Agreement Matters defined in Section 5 below:

          (a)  Whenever the consent, approval or agreement of Lessor, as owner
               of the Nursing Home Unit (Lessor or any successor-in-interest of
               Lessor under

                                       3

<PAGE>

               the Condominium Documents, in such capacity, the "Nursing Home
               Unit Owner"), or the Trustee appointed by the Nursing Home Unit
               Owner ("Nursing Home Unit Trustee") is required before an action
               with respect to a Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter may be
               taken, continued or terminated, Lessor shall notify Tenant (with
               a copy to any party added as a "Listed Mortgagee" pursuant to
               Section 3(d)(i) above) in writing thereof (a
               "Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice"), and such notification shall
               be sent to Tenant as quickly as is commercially reasonable
               (taking into account Lessor's obligation to include in such
               Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice certain information as more
               fully provided in Section 4(d) below) after Lessor learns that
               such action is of the type covered by this Section 4 and, in any
               event, prior to any such action's being taken, continued or
               terminated;

          (b)  Within ten (10) days following Tenant's receipt of a
               Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice (or, if the Nursing Home Unit
               Owner or the Nursing Home Unit Trustee, as applicable, is
               required to take action with respect to such matter within a
               shorter period of time, within the shorter of (x) three (3)
               business days following Tenant's receipt of the Consent/Approval/
               Agreement Notice and (y) an amount of time following Tenant's
               receipt of the Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice equal to
               three-quarters (3/4) of the time available under the Condominium
               Documents to the Nursing Home Unit Owner or the Nursing Home Unit
               Trustee, as applicable, to make such decision) (such time period,
               the "Decision Period"), Tenant shall notify Lessor (with a copy
               to any party added as a "Listed Mortgagee" pursuant to Section
               3(d)(i) above) in writing (a "Tenant Response Notice") as to
               whether it wishes to grant its consent, approval or agreement to
               the proposed Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter or to withhold its
               consent, approval or agreement to such proposed matter (it being
               agreed by Tenant and Lessor that, if Tenant shall not so respond
               to Lessor within the Decision Period, Tenant shall be deemed to
               have granted its consent, approval and agreement to whatever
               action the Nursing Home Unit Owner or the Nursing Home Unit
               Trustee, as the case may be, shall choose to take with respect to
               such matter)


          (c)  If, pursuant to subparagraph (b) above, a Tenant Response Notice
               notifies Lessor of Tenant's decision to withhold its consent,
               approval or agreement with respect to a particular Tenant
               Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter, such Tenant Response Notice
               must also specify either (i) the reason or reasons for Tenant's
               withholding such consent, approval or agreement, or (ii) as
               described in subparagraph (d) below, that Tenant is not required
               to provide any such reason;

                                       4

<PAGE>

          (d)  In granting or withholding its consent, approval or agreement to
               any proposed action described in a Consent/Approval/Agreement
               Notice, Tenant shall be required to adhere to the same decision
               making standard as is required of the Nursing Home Unit Owner or
               the Nursing Home Unit Trustee, as applicable, by the terms, or
               legal effect, of the Condominium Documents (and Lessor agrees (x)
               to use its best efforts to identify the applicable standard in
               the Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice and (y) upon request of
               Tenant, to confer with Tenant in connection with its
               identification of the applicable standard for purposes of
               complying with the terms of this sentence). For example, (i) if
               the Condominium Documents provide that the Nursing Home Unit
               Owner or Nursing Home Unit Trustee, as applicable, may grant or
               withhold its consent, approval or agreement to a particular
               Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter in its sole discretion,
               then Tenant may grant or withhold its consent, approval or
               agreement thereto in its sole discretion, and in such case Tenant
               may specify in its Tenant Response Notice that it is permitted to
               take such action in its sole discretion and is not otherwise
               required to provide a reason for such granting or withholding,
               and (ii) if the Condominium Documents provide that the Nursing
               Home Unit Owner or the Nursing Home Unit Trustee, as applicable,
               may withhold its consent, approval or agreement to a particular
               Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter only for a reasonable
               reason or reasons, then Tenant must adhere to such standard, and
               in such case, Tenant must specify in its Tenant Response Notice a
               reasonable reason or reasons for its decision contained therein;

          (e)  (i) If, in a Tenant Response Notice, Tenant has withheld its
               consent, approval or agreement to any Tenant
               Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter, then Lessor, as the Nursing
               Home Unit Owner, shall, or shall require the Nursing Home Unit
               Trustee to, as applicable, withhold its consent, approval or
               agreement to such Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter; and

               (ii) If, in a Tenant Response Notice, Tenant has granted (or been
                    deemed to have granted) its consent, approval or agreement
                    to a particular Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter,
                    then:

                    (1)  if such matter is one of the Tenant Consent/Approval/
                         Agreement Matters described in any of Sections 5(a)
                         through (e) and 5(i) below, Lessor, as the Nursing Home
                         Unit Owner, shall, or shall instruct the Nursing Home
                         Unit Trustee to, as applicable, grant its consent,
                         approval or agreement to such Tenant Consent/
                         Approval/Agreement Matter unless it has a reasonable
                         reason or reasons for withholding the same, and

                    (2)  if such matter is one of the Tenant Consent/Approval/
                         Agreement Matters described in any of Sections 5(f)
                         through (h) or Sections 5(j) through (l) below, Lessor,
                         as the Nursing Home Unit Owner,

                                       5

<PAGE>

               may, or may instruct the Nursing Home Unit Trustee to, as
               applicable, grant or withhold its consent, approval or agreement
               to such Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter in its sole
               discretion; provided that, if in a Tenant Response Notice, Tenant
               has expressly granted its consent, approval or agreement to a
               particular Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter, Lessor, as
               the Nursing Home Unit Owner, shall, or shall require the Nursing
               Home Unit Trustee to, as applicable, grant its consent, approval
               or agreement to such Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter if
               (A) such matter is a Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter
               described in Section 5(j) and also relates solely to a matter to
               which Tenant would have been permitted under the Lease to grant
               its consent, approval or agreement without further input from or
               action on the part of Lessor before the Leased Premises were
               subject to a condominium regime, and (B) the proposed allocation
               of Common Expenses would cause the Nursing Home Unit Owner's
               allocated Common Expenses at all times to be lower than they are
               at the time the relevant Consent/Approval/Agreement Notice is
               sent; and (C) either (I) the granting of a consent, approval or
               agreement to the relevant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matter will
               not otherwise adversely affect Lessor or the Nursing Home Unit
               (as determined by the Lessor in its reasonable discretion), or
               (II) the consent, approval or agreement will be revocable by
               Lessor in its sole discretion at the termination of the Lease
               such that Lessor will not be bound by the reallocation after the
               termination of the Lease.

5. The "Tenant Consent/Approval/Agreement Matters" are limited to the following:

     (a) the adjustment of any casualty or condemnation losses affecting the
     General Common Elements;

     (b) the granting of permission to allow the Nursing Home Unit, the Nursing
     Home Unit Limited Common Elements, the General Common Elements, or
     utilities serving the Nursing Home Unit, the Nursing Home Unit Limited
     Common Elements, or the General Common Elements to be obstructed or
     otherwise cut off during construction by the Board of Trustees or any Unit
     Owner (or their tenant(s));

     (c) any action pursuant to which parking, other paved facilities or other
     improvements in the General Common Elements would be materially expanded;

     (d) the appointment of a new Managing Agent of the Condominium;

                                       6

<PAGE>

     (e) the amendment, rescission, or waiver of any material provision of any
     management agreement;

     (f) any decisions with respect to the General Common Elements (including
     adopting Budgets) which will result in costs to or other obligations of
     Tenant which are materially higher than the costs to and obligations of
     Tenant immediately prior to such decision;

     (g) the termination and/or partition of the Condominium to the extent such
     action would cause adverse regulatory consequences (e.g., licensure or
     zoning violations or violations of the Permitting Decisions) to Tenant;

     (h) the amendment, rescission, or waiver of any material provision of the
     Condominium Documents in a manner that would materially increase Tenant's
     direct or indirect obligations or liabilities under the Condominium
     Documents;

     (i) a decision not to restore the General Common Elements following a
     casualty or condemnation;

     (j) the allocation of any Common Expense in a manner other than based on
     Percentage Interests and/or Beneficial Interests;

     (k) the adjustment or amendment of the Percentage Interests or Beneficial
     Interest of any Unit Owner; or

     (l) any material amendment to the permitted uses of all or any portion of
     the Condominium property.

6. Tenant hereby covenants that, as long as Tenant is a tenant of the Nursing
Home Unit, Tenant shall:

     (a) provide prompt notice to Lessor of any written notice it receives of:

          (i) any violation of any Legal Requirements (as defined in the
     Condominium Documents) affecting the Revised Leased Premises or the
     Condominium; and

          (ii) any change in its insurance coverage relating to the Revised
     Leased Premises.

                                       7

<PAGE>

     (b) operate the Nursing Home Unit in a manner which is consistent with, and
     will not cause a default under, the Condominium Documents.

7. Each of Lessor and Tenant agrees that a breach by it under this Amendment
shall also constitute a breach of a Permitted Encumbrance by it under the Lease,
subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Lease, including,
without limitation, the limitations set forth in clauses (a) through (c) of
Section 8.3.1 of the Lease, the notice and cure rights afforded to Tenant under
Section 8.3 of the Lease, and the indemnification obligations of Tenant under
Section 24.1 of the Lease.

8. This Amendment is being executed to amend the Lease as it applies to the
Revised Leased Premises, and is not intended to amend the Lease in any respect
other than as expressly provided herein. Without limitation of the foregoing,
Lessor and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the Lease relates to the Revised
Leased Premises and multiple other properties and that, as provided in the
Lease, the Lease demises all of such properties as a unified commercial
operating lease and Lessor is not obligated, and may not be required, to lease
less than all of such properties pursuant to the Lease. As amended hereby, the
Lease remains in full force and effect and shall bind and inure to the benefit
of Lessor and Tenant and their respective successors and assigns and all those
claiming by, through or under them.

9. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto were upon the same
instrument.

10. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, unless a
cost (i) is incurred as a result of an act or omission by Tenant in
contravention of the Lease, or (ii) is otherwise the obligation of Tenant
pursuant to Section 24.1 of the Lease, or (iii) is incurred at the request of
Tenant, Lessor hereby agrees that Tenant shall not be responsible for paying the
following amounts relating to the Condominium:

     (a)  any cost or expenses incidental to (i) fidelity bonds or (ii) fidelity
          insurance coverage, in each case, purchased and maintained by the
          Trustees pursuant to the Condominium Documents;

     (b)  the cost or expense of any compensation paid to the Trustees pursuant
          to the second paragraph of Section 3(n) of the Declaration of Trust;

     (c)  any costs or expense arising in connection with the Indemnity of the
          Trustees set forth in Section 3(o) of the Declaration of Trust;

          Home Unit Owner in connection with the foregoing items (i) and (ii),
          in each case if and to the extent such cost is owed to the Board of
          Trustees, the Managing Agent or the Unit Owner of the
          Independent/Assisted Living Unit pursuant to the Condominium Documents
          (including, without limitation, Section 17(b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii)
          of the Bylaws); and

     (e)  any liability under the indemnity provision set forth in clause (i) of
          the second paragraph of Section 8(a) of the Master Deed.

11. Provided that the same is executed and delivered to Tenant by each
counterparty thereto, Tenant hereby agrees to execute, deliver and perform a
letter agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, whereby Tenant will
agree, pursuant to the terms set forth in said letter agreement, to provide
priority placement in its facility located on the Revised Leased Premises for
the residents of the ILF/ALF Facility (as such term is defined in such Exhibit
C), and the owner of the ILF/ALF Facility will agree, pursuant to the terms set
forth in said letter agreement, to provide priority placement in the ILF/ALF
Facility to the residents of Tenant's facility located on the Revised Leased
Premises.

12. Lessor hereby agrees to indemnify Tenant and any mortgagee of Tenant and
hold Tenant and any mortgagee of Tenant harmless from and against the following:

     (a)  any loss, damage or other cost (including, without limitation,
          reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) sustained by such party if,
          as a result of the submission of the property to the Condominium, any
          part of the Revised Leased Premises is held to be (i) a subdivision
          under Massachusetts law, or (ii) in violation of applicable zoning
          rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the Permitting
          Decisions);

     (b)  any loss, damage or other cost (including, without limitation,
          reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) sustained by such party
          resulting from Lessor's default under the Condominium Documents as the
          Nursing Home Unit Owner; provided that no such loss, damage or other
          cost (i) is incurred as a result of an act or omission by Tenant in
          contravention of the Lease, or (ii) is otherwise the obligation of
          Tenant pursuant to the Lease, including, without limitation, Section
          24.1 thereof, or (iii) is incurred at the request of Tenant.

13. Lessor hereby covenants that Lessor shall send written notice to all parties
to the Condominium Documents within five (5) business days of the date hereof
(and, in the case of any management agreement relating to any Managing Agent,
Lessor shall send written notice to all parties to such agreement within five
(5) business days of the date such agreement is executed if so permitted
therein), which notice shall state that, for so long as Tenant is the tenant of
the Nursing Home Unit, copies of all notices delivered to Lessor pursuant to
such agreements shall also be delivered to the following at the following
addresses (or to such other addresses as may, from time to time, be supplied to
Lessor by Tenant):

14. Lessor and Tenant hereby acknowledge that, as between Lessor and Tenant, the
provisions of the Lease relating to the use and disposition of insurance and
condemnation proceeds, including without limitation, the provisions of Section
14.1 thereof, continue in full force and effect, and, to the extent that such
provisions of the Lease require that such proceeds of insurance or condemnation
proceeds are to be paid or are payable to Tenant, but Lessor, as the Nursing
Home Unit Owner, instead receives or is entitled to receive such proceeds in
accordance with the terms of the Condominium Documents, then Lessor hereby (a)
absolutely and unconditionally assigns such proceeds to Tenant, to be held or
applied by Tenant in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Lease, and
(b) further agrees that, if Lessor receives any insurance or condemnation
proceeds assigned to Tenant pursuant to the foregoing clause (a), Lessor shall
be deemed to be holding the same in trust for the benefit of Tenant and shall
immediately cause such proceeds to be paid to Tenant. Lessor agrees that the
assignment provided for in this Section 14 constitutes a present, outright,
immediate, continuing and absolute assignment. Lessor further agrees that such
assignment shall not be construed to impose any obligation upon Tenant other
than the obligations otherwise applicable to Tenant under the Lease.

15. The easements, rights and appurtenances benefiting the Nursing Home Unit
under the Condominium Documents shall be deemed to be "easements, rights and
appurtenances relating to the Land and the Leased Improvements" for purposes of
Section 1.1(iii) of the Lease.

16. As provided in the Bylaws, the Lease shall be subject in every respect to
Chapter 183A, the Master Deed, the Declaration of Trust, and the Bylaws and
Rules and Regulations, in each case as amended from time to time.

17. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no action taken
by Tenant (and no failure to act on the part of Tenant), to the extent expressly
permitted under the terms of this Amendment, shall be deemed to violate Tenant's
obligations under Section 8.3 of the Lease, nor shall any such action (or
failure to act), even if leading to a default under the Condominium Documents,
constitute a default under the Lease.

18. Lessor hereby covenants that if, following a substantial casualty or
condemnation involving the Nursing Home Unit and the Limited Common Element
appurtenant thereto, Tenant offers to acquire the same from Lessor pursuant to
Section 14.2.1(B) of the Lease, and such offer is made within the 120-day period
immediately following such casualty or condemnation, then Lessor shall accept or
reject such offer within sixty (60) days of Lessor's receipt of such offer from
Tenant (Lessor agreeing that any failure to so accept or reject such offer
within such time period shall be deemed to be a rejection thereof for all
purposes under the Lease).

19. Except as amended hereby, the Lease remains in full force and effect and
shall bind and inure to the benefit of Lessor and Tenant as provided therein.

                   [Signatures appear on the following page.]

         Re:  New Pond Village Condominium

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     This letter agreement shall serve to acknowledge our respective ownership
of the Nursing Home Unit and the Independent/Assisted Living Unit in the above
referenced Condominium and confirm our understanding with respect to (i) the
admission of residents of the independent and/or assisted living facility (the
"ILF/ALF Facility") operated at the Independent/Assisted Living Facility Unit to
the nursing home/health care facility (the "Nursing Facility") operated at the
Nursing Home Unit and (ii) the admission of the residents of the Nursing
Facility to the ILF/ALF Facility.

     For so long as the Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, or any of its
affiliates, owns the Nursing Home Unit, it shall admit or shall cause the tenant
thereof to admit to the Nursing Facility, on a priority basis, to the extent
allowable by law, any resident of ILF/ALF Facility, provided that such resident
is seeking admission to the Nursing Facility and meets the then applicable
criteria of the Nursing Facility for admission.

     For so long as the New Pond Village, LLC or any of its affiliates, owns the
ILF/ALF Facility, it shall admit or shall cause the tenant thereof to admit to
the ILF/ALF Facility, on a priority basis, to the extent allowable by law, any
resident of Nursing Facility, provided that such resident is seeking admission
to the ILF/ALF Facility and meets the then applicable criteria of the ILF/ALF
Facility for admission, purchases the requisite Mortgage Bond and enters into
the then applicable Residency Agreement.

                                            Very truly yours,
