     pursuant  to  Sections  6, 7, 8 or 9 below  and an  election  not to  renew
     pursuant to this Section 2 shall not constitute a termination without cause
     for  purposes of Section 8 and Section  10(b).  Such  additional  period of

               purposes  to  substantiate  the  expenditure  as  an  income  tax
               deduction,   except   that   each  such   expenditure   shall  be
               reimbursable  only if it is of a nature qualifying it as a proper
               deduction  on the  federal  and state  income tax  returns of the

               Option  Agreement (as  hereinafter  defined)  (clauses (c)(i) and
               (ii) above  collectively,  the  "Options").  The Options shall be
               granted  pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan (as may
               be amended,  modified,  or replaced, or any new stock option plan

          (financial  or otherwise) on the business or reputation of the Company
          or any other member of the Group, or which  subjects,  or if generally
          known would  subject,  the Company or the Group to public  ridicule or

     (a)  Upon  any  termination  of the  employment  of the  Executive  whether
          pursuant to any of Sections 6 through 9 hereof or  otherwise,  neither
          the Executive nor Executive's  beneficiaries  or estate shall have any

          Agreement,  except as hereinafter set forth in this Section 11 and the
          right to receive any  benefits to which the  Executive  is entitled to
          pursuant  to any  Federal  state or  local  laws,  including,  without
          limitation, COBRA laws:

          (i)  the unpaid  portion of the Base  Salary  provided  for in Section
               5(a) above to the effective date of termination;

          (ii) reimbursement  for any expenses for which the Executive shall not

          period  which  is the  lesser  of (i)  three  (3)  months  or (ii) the
          effective  date of termination to the last day of the Initial Term. If
          the Executive  accepts other  employment or engages in Executive's own

          Executive  will be  required  to certify on a monthly  basis as to any
          such other  income and the Company  shall be entitled to review a copy
          of  the  Executive  income  tax  return(s)  covering  the  periods  in

          required to execute a general release of all claims arising out of the
          Executive's employment and the termination thereof, including, but not
          limited to, any claim of discrimination under state or federal law.

11.  <U>Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</U>.

                    confidential  nature that is the  property of the Company or
                    the Group and which has been or will be used by or  imparted
                    to  Executive  from  time  to  time  in  the  course  of the
                    performance  of  Executive's  duties  hereunder.   Executive

     Information  for the  Executive's  own  benefit  or on  behalf of any third
     party; and

     Executive   shall  return   promptly  on  the  termination  of  Executive's
     employment  for  whatever  reason  (or in the event of  Executive's  death,

          such person.  This  restriction  includes that  Executive will not (i)
          disclose to any third party the names,  backgrounds or  qualifications
          of any of the Company's or the Group's employees or otherwise identify
          them as potential  candidates for employment;  or (ii)  participate in
          any pre-employment interviews with any such employee.

13.  <U>Inventions</U>.

     (a)  The  Company   and  the  Group   shall  have  all  rights,   including
          international  priority  rights,  in all  Inventions.  As used herein,
          "<U>Inventions</U>" shall mean all procedures,  inventions,  developments and
          discoveries,   whether  or  not  patentable,   and  all   suggestions,
          proposals,  computer  programs and  writings,  including any copyright
          interests therein, which Executive authors, conceives or makes, either
          solely or jointly with others during  Executive's  employment with the
          Company which: (i) relate to any subject matter with which Executive's
          work for the Company or the Group may be concerned; (ii) relate to the
          business products or services or demonstrably  anticipated products or
          services  of the  Company or the Group;  (iii)  involve the use of the
          time, equipment,  materials or facilities of the Company or the Group;
          or (iv) relate or are  applicable to any phase of the Company's or the
          Group's business.

     (b)  Neither the Company nor the Group shall have rights in any  Inventions
          made or  conceived  by  Executive  that do not involve any  equipment,
          supplies,  facilities  or  materials  of the  Company or the Group and
          which are developed  entirely on Executive's own time unless:  (i) the
          Invention relates to the business, products or services of the Company
          or the Group; (ii) the Invention  relates to demonstrably  anticipated
          products  and  services  of the  Company  or the  Group,  or (iii) the
          Invention  results  from any services  performed by Executive  for the
          Company or the Group.

     (c)  Executive  shall promptly  disclose to the Company all Inventions and,
          at the  Company's  sole  expense,  give the Company all  assistance it
          reasonably  requires  to  perfect,  protect,  and  use its  rights  to
          Inventions. In particular, but without limitation, Executive will sign
          all  documents,  do all things and supply all  information  (including
          disks, binary code,  print-outs and descriptions) that the Company may
          deem  necessary or desirable to (i) transfer or record the transfer of
          Executive's entire right, title, and interest in Inventions;  and (ii)
          enable  the  Company  to  obtain  patent,   copyright,   or  trademark
          protection  for  Inventions  anywhere in the world.  Executive  hereby
          irrevocably  appoints the Company as Executive's attorney for purposes
          of  effectuating  the acts  contemplated  in this  Section.  Executive
          agrees  and  understands   that  compliance  with  the  covenants  and
          agreements  contained  in this  Section  is not  conditioned  upon the
          payment of any additional or special consideration.

     (d)  The  obligations of this Section shall continue beyond the termination
          of Executive's employment with the Company, whether the Inventions are
          patentable  or not,  if  conceived  or made by  Executive  during  the
          Employment  Period,  and shall be binding  upon  Executive's  assigns,
          executors,   administrators  and  other  legal  representatives.   For
          purposes of this Agreement, any Invention relating to the Company's or
          the Group's business upon which Executive files patent  application(s)
          within one (1) year after the  termination of this Agreement  shall be
          presumed to relate to an Invention  conceived by Executive  during the
          Employment  Period,  subject to proof to the  contrary  by good faith,
          written and duly corroborated records establishing that such Invention
          was  conceived  and  made  by  Executive  after  termination  of  this
          Agreement  and  that  no  Confidential  Information  was  utilized  by
          Executive with respect to that Invention.

14.  <U>Covenant Not to Compete</U>.

     (a)  Executive  agrees  that,  during the  Non-Compete  Period (as  defined
          below),  Executive  shall not,  directly or indirectly,  engage in any
          activities  either  on  Executive's  own  behalf  or that of any other
          business organization (whether as principal, partner, member, officer,
          director,  stockholder,  agent, joint venturer, consultant,  creditor,
          lender, guarantor,  surety, investor or otherwise) which are in direct
          or indirect  competition  with, or similar to, the business,  products
          and  services  of the  Company or the Group in the  United  States and
          Canada.

     (b)  Executive and the Company  expressly  declare that the territorial and
          time limitations  contained in this Section are entirely reasonable at
          this time and are properly and  necessarily  required for the adequate
          protection  of the business and  intellectual  property of the Company
          and Group. If such  territorial or time  limitations,  or any portions
          thereof,  are  deemed  to be  unreasonable  by a  court  of  competent
          jurisdiction,  whether due to passage of time, change of circumstances
          or  otherwise,  Executive and the Company agree to a reduction of said
          territorial  and/or time  limitations  to such areas and/or periods of
          time as said court shall deem reasonable.

     (c)  Before  taking any  position  with any person or entity that  provides
          services competitive or similar to the Company or the Group during the
          Non-Compete  Period,  the Executive shall give prior written notice to
          the Company of the name of such person or entity. The Company shall be
          entitled  to advise each such  person or entity of the  provisions  of
          this Agreement,  and to otherwise deal with each such person or entity
          to ensure that the  provisions of this Agreement are enforced and duly
          discharged.

     (d)  All time periods in this Agreement shall be computed by excluding from
          such  computation  any time during which the Executive is in violation
          of any provision of this  Agreement and any time during which there is
          pending in any court of competent  jurisdiction any action  (including
          any appeal from any final judgment) brought by any person,  whether or
          not a party to this  Agreement,  in which  action  the  Company or the
          Group seeks to enforce the  agreements and covenants in this Agreement
          or in which any person  contests the validity of such  agreements  and
          covenants or their  enforceability or seeks to avoid their performance
          or enforcement which is determined  adversely against the Executive or
          such other party.

     (e)  In addition to any other  rights or remedies  available to the Company
          or  the  Group,  in the  event  that  the  Company  make a good  faith
          determination that the Executive  breached  obligations under Sections
          11, 12, 13 or 14, any outstanding obligations of the Company hereunder
          shall immediately terminate.

     (f)  As used herein,  the term "<U>Non-Compete  Period</U>" means, with respect to
          the Executive, the Employment Period plus the period commencing on the
          effective  date of the  termination  of employment  and ending one (1)
          year after such date.

15.  <U>Extraordinary  Relief</U>.  Executive  acknowledges  and  understands  that the
     provisions  of  Sections  11,  12, 13,  and 14 of this  Agreement  are of a
     special and unique nature,  the breach of which would cause the Company and
     the Group irreparable  injury,  and cannot adequately be compensated for in
     damages by an action at law. In the event of a breach or threatened  breach
     by Executive of any  provision of such  Sections,  the Company or the Group
     may seek an injunction restraining Executive from such actual or threatened
     breach,  and  shall  not  be  required  to  post a bond  or to  prove  that
     irreparable  injury would result from the alleged  breach of the  aforesaid
     Sections.  Nothing  contained  herein shall be construed as prohibiting the
     Company or the Group from pursuing any other remedies  (including,  without
     limitation,  an action for damages)  available for any actual or threatened
     breach of this  Agreement,  and the pursuit of any  injunction or any other
     remedy shall not be deemed an exclusive election of such remedy.  Executive
     shall  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  reasonable   costs  and  expenses
     (including,  without limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses)
     incurred in connection  with the enforcement of Sections 11, 12, 13, and 14
     if it is  determined  that the  Company or the Group was  entitled  to such
     relief. The restrictions and limitations  herein regarding  non-disclosure,
     non-solicitation,  non-competition  and  inventions are in addition to, and
     not in  derogation  of,  applicable  law with  respect  to  non-disclosure,
     non-solicitation, non-competition and inventions in general.

16.  <U>Assistance in Litigation</U>.  Executive shall, upon reasonable notice, furnish
     such  information and proper  assistance to the Company and the Group as it
     may  reasonably  require,  at the expense of the Company and the Group,  in
     connection  with any  litigation  in which it is,  or may  become,  a party
     either during or after the Employment Period.

17.  <U>No  Disparagement</U>.  Executive  shall not, except in connection with a legal
     proceeding or order  (including a proceeding  relating to this  Agreement),
     from and after the date hereof, regardless of the expiration or termination
     of this Agreement, make any (i) statement to any person or entity which has
     a  business  relationship  with the  Company  or the  Group or (ii)  public
     statement, in each instance, that criticizes,  ridicules,  disparages or is
     derogatory  of the  Company  or the  Group,  or any of their  stockholders,
     investors,  officers,  directors,  agents  or  employees  or any  of  their
     products,  services  or  procedures,  whether  or not such  disparaging  or
     derogatory statements are true.

18.  <U>Notices</U>.   All   notices,   claims,   certificates,   demands   and   other
     communications  hereunder  shall  be  in  writing  and  sent  by  facsimile

     or delivered  pursuant  hereto which form a part hereof  contain the entire
     agreement  among the parties with respect to the subject  matter hereof and
     supersede  all  prior  and  contemporaneous  arrangements,   agreements  or
     understandings (whether written or oral) with respect thereto.

20.  <U>Successors  and  Assigns;  Assignment</U>.  The  terms and  provisions  of this
     Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and
     the Executive and their successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is
     personal  in its  nature and  neither  party may  assign or  transfer  this
     Agreement or any rights or obligations  hereunder,  except that the Company
     shall have the right to assign its rights  hereunder  to another  member of
     the Group.

21.  <U>Governing  Law</U>.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed  by and  construed  in
     accordance  with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
     the principles of conflict of laws.

22.  <U>Arbitration</U>.  In  consideration  of  the  Company  employing  Executive  or
     continuing to employ  Executive  and the mutual  promises set forth herein,
     Executive   and  the  Company   agree,   for   themselves   and  for  their
     representatives,  successors,  and assigns,  that any  controversy or claim
     arising  out  of  or  relating  to  this  Agreement,   its  enforcement  or
     interpretation,   or   because   of  an   alleged   breach,   default,   or
     misrepresentation in connection with any of its provisions,  or arising out
     of or  relating  in any  way to  Executive's  employment  with  Company  or
     termination  thereof,  shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in
     New York,  New York  before a single  arbitrator,  in  accordance  with the
     procedures required under New York law.

     (a)  To the extent not inconsistent with law, the following will govern any
          arbitration hereunder:

     The  National  Rules  for the  Resolution  of  Employment  Disputes  of the
     American  Arbitration  Association will apply. The arbitrator may award any
     form of remedy or relief (including injunctive relief) that would otherwise
     be available in court,  consistent with applicable laws. Any award pursuant
     to said  arbitration  shall be  accompanied  by a  written  opinion  of the
     arbitrator  setting forth the reason for the award.  The award  rendered by
     the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, and
     judgment upon the award may be entered,  and  enforcement may be sought in,
     any court of competent jurisdiction.

     Each party shall  share the costs of the  arbitrator  and forum fees.  Each
     party  shall bear its own  respective  attorney  fees and all other  costs,
     unless otherwise  required or allowed by law and awarded by the arbitrator,
     provided  further  that if any matter of  dispute  raised by a party or any
     defense or objection thereto was  unreasonable,  the arbitrator may assess,
     as part  of the  arbitration  award,  all or any  part  of the  arbitration
     expenses (including  reasonable attorney's fees) of the other party and the
     arbitration  fees  against the party  raising such  unreasonable  matter of
     dispute or defense or objection thereto.

     (b)  This predispute  resolution  agreement  covers all matters directly or
          indirectly  related  to  Executive's   recruitment,   employment,   or
          termination of employment by the Company,  including,  but not limited
          to,  alleged  violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
          sections  1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United  States Code and
          all amendments  thereto,  Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of
          1974 ("ERISA"),  the Americans with  Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"),

          Workers  Benefits  Protection  Act of 1990  ("OWBPA"),  the Fair Labor
          Standards  Act  ("FLSA"),  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act
          ("OSHA"),  the Consolidated Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1985
          ("COBRA"), and any and all claims under federal, state, and local laws
          against discrimination, but excluding Worker's Compensation Claims.

     (c)  In the event that either party files,  and is allowed by the courts to
          prosecute,  a court action  against the other,  the  plaintiff in such
          action agrees not to request,  and hereby waives such party's right to
          a trial by jury.

     (d)  EXECUTIVE AND THE COMPANY UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS AGREEMENT, THEY
          WOULD  HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE EACH  OTHER IN COURT,  AND THE RIGHT TO A
          JURY TRIAL,  BUT,  BY THIS  AGREEMENT,  THEY GIVE UP THOSE  RIGHTS AND
          AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL GRIEVANCES BY ARBITRATION.

23.  <U>Waivers</U>. The provisions of this Agreement may not be waived, temporarily or
     permanently,  except  pursuant to a writing  executed by the party  against
     whom enforcement of such waiver would be sought. The waiver by any party of
     a breach of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
     any subsequent breach.

     not be modified or amended  without  the written  agreement  of each of the
     parties.

     meanings or interpretations of this Agreement.

27.  <U>Survival</U>. The representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements of the
     parties  hereto shall survive any  cancellation,  termination,  rescission,
     amendment, modification or expiration of this Agreement and any termination
     of the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason.

28.  <U>Indemnification</U>.  The Executive shall be entitled to indemnification in his
     capacity  as an  officer  of the  Company  as  provided  in  the  Company's
     organizational documents and applicable law.

29.  <U>Executive's  Ability to Contract for the Company</U>.  Executive shall not have
     the  right to make any  contracts  or  commitments  for or on behalf of the
     Company or the Group, to sign or endorse any commercial  paper,  contracts,
     advertisements,  or  instrument  of  any  nature,  or  to  enter  into  any
     obligation  binding  the  Company  or the Group to the  payment of money or
     otherwise, except to the extent Executive is so authorized in writing.

30.  <U>Executive's   Representations</U>.   Executive  represents  and  warrants  that
     Executive is free to enter into this  Agreement  and to perform each of its
     terms and  covenants.  Executive  represents and warrants that Executive is
     not restricted or  prohibited,  contractually  or otherwise,  from entering
     into and performing  this  agreement,  and that  Executive's  execution and
     performance  of this  Agreement is not a violation or a breach of any other
     Agreement  between  Executive  and any other  person or  entity.  Executive
     agrees to indemnify  and hold the Company and the Group  harmless  from any
     and all costs and  expenses,  including  attorney's  fees,  incurred by the
     Company  and the  Group as a result  of any  breach  by  Executive  of this
     provision.
