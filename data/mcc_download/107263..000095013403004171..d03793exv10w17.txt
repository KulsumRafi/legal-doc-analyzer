         indebtedness for borrowed money ("Index Debt"):

</TABLE>

         For purposes of determining the Applicable Margin, with respect to the
         debt ratings criteria: (i) if neither Moody's nor S&P shall have in
         effect a rating for Index Debt (other than by reason of the
         circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition),
         then both such rating agencies will be deemed to have established
         ratings for Index Debt in Category 5; (ii) if only one of Moody's or
         S&P shall have in effect a rating for Index Debt, the Company and the
         Lenders will negotiate in good faith to agree upon another rating
         agency to be substituted by an agreement for the rating agency which
         shall not have a rating in effect, and in the absence of such agreement
         the Applicable Margin will be determined by reference to the available
         rating; (iii) except as expressly provided in the above table, if the
         ratings established by Moody's and S&P shall differ by (x) one
         Category, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the
         numerically higher Category, and (y) two or more Categories the
         Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the numerical
         Category which is one less than the numerically highest such Category
         (for example, if the rating from S&P is in Category 2 and the rating
         from Moody's is in Category 5, the Applicable Margin shall be
         determined by reference to Category 4); and (iv) if any rating
         established by Moody's or S&P shall be changed (other than as a result
         of a change in the rating system of either Moody's or S&P), such change
         shall be effective as of the date on which such change is first
         announced by the rating agency making such change. If the rating system
         of either Moody's or S&P shall change prior to the payment in full of
         the Obligation and the cancellation of all commitments to lend
         hereunder, the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to
         amend the references to specific ratings in this definition to reflect
         such changed rating system.

                                       2

If both Moody's and S&P shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate
debt obligations, the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to
agree upon a substitute rating agency and to amend the references to specific

agency, and the Applicable Margin shall continue to be based upon the ratings
Category in effect immediately prior to such event until such agreement on a

after the Amendment Effective Date, all references to the "Term Loan Agreement"
shall be to the Term Loan Agreement as herein amended. The execution, delivery,
and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided
herein, operate as a waiver of any Rights of the Lenders under the Term Loan
Agreement or any Loan Papers, nor constitute a waiver under the Term Loan
Agreement or any other provision of the Loan Papers.

         5.2      Reference to Miscellaneous Provisions. This Amendment, the LLC
Guaranty, and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Amendment are part
of the Loan Papers referred to in the Term Loan Agreement, and the provisions
relating to Loan Papers set forth in Section 12 are incorporated herein by

Progeny Facilities entered into contemporaneously herewith.

         5.4      Costs and Expenses. The Company agrees to pay promptly the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to Administrative Agent for services
rendered in connection with the preparation, negotiation, reproduction,
execution, and delivery of this Amendment.

         5.5      Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in a number of
identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all
purposes, and all of which constitute, collectively, one agreement; but, in
making proof of this Amendment, it shall not be necessary to produce or account
for more than one such counterpart. It is not necessary that all parties execute
the same counterpart so long as identical counterparts are executed by the
Company, each Guarantor, each Determining Lender, and Administrative Agent.

         5.6      Undertaking; Post Closing Actions. The parties to this
Amendment hereby agree and undertake to each use their best efforts and to act
diligently and promptly in taking any action or step necessary to resolve or
correct any error, omission, open item or general inconsistency or other
discrepancy which may exist, or of which the parties hereto may hereafter become
aware, herein, in any other Loan Paper, or any other Credit Document.

         5.7      THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS,
OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL
AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.

Amendment Effective Date.
