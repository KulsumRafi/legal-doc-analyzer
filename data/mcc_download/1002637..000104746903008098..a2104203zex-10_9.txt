          potential additional sources

        - Review of issues affecting production and regulatory compliance

        - Review of plans for and status of plant expansion.

        Any additional activity is subject to Solvay's approval.

        Under appropriate confidentiality arrangements with Solvay, the
        "Personne de Confiance" will have access to the same information that
        could be communicated to any other Millennium personnel, except
        technology transfer agents (also referred to by the Parties as TTAs).
        However, the "Personne de Confiance" shall not have the power to make
        contractual commitments on behalf of Millennium, amend this Agreement or
        any other

                                      - 4 -
<Page>

        agreements between Millennium and Solvay or enter into any other
        agreements on behalf of Millennium without specific written
        authorization from Millennium.
        Millennium may change its designated "Personne de Confiance" as
        necessary, provided he or she signs a confidentiality agreement in
        substantially similar form to that signed by [**] dated October 10, 1996
        (a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix D).

4 - PURCHASE ORDERS

4.1     PURCHASE COMMITMENT. Millennium agrees to purchase from Solvay and
        Solvay agrees to manufacture and supply to Millennium an amount of Bulk
        Product through Purchase Orders.

4.2     MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENT. Millennium shall order from Solvay the
        Minimum Order of Bulk Product for delivery in the years 2004 and
        following during the term of this Agreement. In the event that
        Millennium orders less than such Minimum Order for delivery in any given
        year (referred to as the "Given Year" hereinafter in this Article 4.2),
        Millennium shall pay a penalty calculated by multiplying the Order
        Shortfall by [**] percent ([**]%) and by [**] for delivery in such Given
        Year calculated as set forth in Appendix B hereto taking paragraph (a)
        thereof as the reference price.

        Such penalty, which is subject to waiver in case of the occurrence of a
        Delivery Shortfall during the Given Year as provided for in the
        provisions of Article 9.8(c), shall be paid in [**] of said Given Year.
        Such penalty shall be Millennium's exclusive liability and Solvay's sole
        remedy for Millennium not ordering the Minimum Order.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Order Shortfall shall be, for the
        purpose of calculating the penalty payment referenced above, reduced by
        the sum of:

        (a)    if Millennium has ordered more than the Minimum Order for
               delivery in the year preceding said Given Year (referred to as
               the "Previous Year" hereinafter in this Article 4.2), the Order
               Surplus for delivery in such Previous Year, and

        (b)    if the total quantity of Bulk Product delivered by Solvay at the
               end of the Previous Year is lower than the quantity ordered by
               Millennium for delivery in such Previous Year (such ordered
               quantity is not being subject to the deduction foreseen under
               Article 9.8(b)),

               (i)    if the total quantity of Bulk Product delivered by Solvay
                      at the end of said Previous Year is equal to or greater
                      than [**] grams, [**] grams, or

               (ii)   if the total quantity of Bulk Product delivered by Solvay
                      at the end of said Previous Year is lower than [**])
                      grams, [**] percent ([**]%) of the difference between [**]
                      and the total quantity of Bulk Product delivered by Solvay
                      accrued at the end of the Previous Year, expressed in
                      grams.

        The Parties acknowledge that, according to the above, the said Order
        Shortfall may be reduced to [**] but not below [**]. Any quantity taken
        into account to reduce said Order

                                      - 5 -
<Page>

        Shortfall for the purpose of calculating the penalty payment referenced
        above shall accordingly in no event exceed such Order Shortfall.

        In addition, Millennium agrees to pay to Solvay an amount in United
        States Dollars computed by multiplying that part of the Order Surplus
        which has been taken into account to reduce the Order Shortfall
        (expressed in grams) by the difference between

          -    the unit price applicable [**] for quantities [**] kilograms
               calculated as set forth in Appendix B hereto taking paragraph (a)
               thereof as the reference price, and

          -    the unit price applicable for [**] kilograms calculated as set
               forth in Appendix B hereto taking paragraph (b) thereof as the
               reference price.

        The said amount shall be paid by Millennium to Solvay [**].

4.3     SUPPLY COMMITMENT. Solvay shall accept purchase orders placed according
        to the provisions of Article 4.4 provided that the total amount of Bulk
        Product ordered for any year does not exceed its Production Capacity and
        shall supply such amount to Millennium according to the Delivery
        Schedule.

4.4     TIMING OF PURCHASE ORDERS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE. [**] during the term of
        this Agreement, Millennium shall provide Solvay with a purchase order
        specifying the amount of Bulk Product that Millennium is ordering for
        the following year.

        For the sake of clarification, Millennium has no obligation hereunder to
        place orders for delivery beyond the term of this Agreement and Solvay
        has no obligation hereunder to accept Purchase Orders for delivery
        beyond the term of this Agreement.

        Promptly after receipt of such purchase order, Solvay shall provide
        Millennium with a delivery schedule specifying the dates at which Bulk
        Product shall be delivered. Each delivery shall consist, to the extent
        possible, [**] of approximately [**] kilograms. The Parties shall
        discuss in good faith for adjusting the delivery dates according to
        their own specific requirements, including the limitations resulting
        from the operation and maintenance of Solvay's currently existing
        manufacturing facilities, and such delivery schedule will be finalized
        and agreed upon in good faith.

        Millennium may elect to increase the amount it has ordered for a year by
        providing Solvay with a supplemental purchase order [**], which increase
        Solvay shall accept provided that the total amount does not exceed the
        lesser of (i) the Production Capacity or (ii) [**] percent ([**]%) of
        the amount of the Purchase Order placed [**].

        Upon receipt of such supplemental purchase order, the Parties shall
        discuss in good faith for reviewing the delivery schedule established
        earlier in the year according to their own specific requirements,
        including the limitations resulting from the operation and maintenance
        of Solvay's currently existing manufacturing facilities, and such
        delivery schedule will be finalized and agreed upon in good faith.

        contrary provisions in the Specification, however, Bulk Product shall be
        packaged in a shipping container approved by Millennium [**]. Solvay
        shall [**]. In the event that Millennium specifies that the Bulk Product
        be shipped to a location other than Millennium's offices in South San
        Francisco (e.g., to a different location for product fill and finish),
        or in the event that Millennium's shipping request requires that the
        Bulk Product be placed into inventory [**], then upon Millennium's
        request, Solvay shall ship a quality control sample to Millennium's
        offices indicated above (or such other place as Millennium may
        designate) in advance of or not later than concurrently with the
        shipment of the Bulk Product or the placing of the Bulk Product into
        inventory. Except as provided herein with respect to non-conforming
        product or Bulk Product placed into inventory, title and risk of loss as
        to all Bulk Product shipped shall pass to Millennium or Millennium's
        designee [**]. In the event that, upon Millennium's request pursuant to
        Article 6, shipment of a lot of Bulk Product is not made promptly after
        the completion of manufacture of such lot and therefore such lot is
        placed into inventory, title shall pass to Millennium or Millennium's
        designee upon the delivery to inventory, but risk of loss shall remain
        with Solvay until such Bulk Product is delivered [**]. Solvay shall
        assist Millennium in arranging any desired insurance (in amounts that
        Millennium shall determine) and transportation [**], as the case may be.
        All customs, duties, costs, taxes, insurance premiums, and other
        expenses of such transportation and delivery (whether shipment of Bulk
        Product is made promptly after completion of manufacture or such Bulk
        Product is placed into inventory at Millennium's request), [**]. Solvay
        shall provide a packing list and a certificate of analysis to Millennium
        for every shipment and for every placing of the Bulk Product into
        inventory.

7.2     NON-CONFORMING AND NON-COMPLYING PRODUCT. Bulk Product supplied
        hereunder shall be produced by Solvay in compliance with all applicable
        laws and regulations of the United States, the European Union, and to
        the extent applicable, of Member States of the European Union, including
        without limitation current Good

                                      - 9 -
<Page>

        Manufacturing Practices as set forth in the United States Code of
        Federal Regulations, and in conformance with the Specification.
        Millennium may reject any shipment of Bulk Product which

        (a)    does not conform with the Specification or is not in compliance
               with such applicable laws and regulations, or

        (b)    is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the United
               States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, equivalent European
               Union regulatory agency requirements, or other applicable laws or
               governmental regulations. Any notice of rejection of
               non-conforming product or notice that the product is adulterated
               or misbranded must be submitted to Solvay [**] after receipt by
               Millennium or its designee at the shipment destination designated
               by Millennium (and for the sake of clarification, when Bulk
               Product is placed in inventory, the Parties agree that such
               inventory is not a shipment destination designated by Millennium
               for the purposes of this Article 7.2), accompanied by a report of
               analysis (including a product sample from the lot analyzed)
               prepared according to the Specification. If no such notice of
               rejection of non-conforming product is submitted, Millennium
               shall be deemed to have accepted such delivery of the product.
               Product may be rejected as non-conforming based on analysis of a
               product sample shipped in advance of or concurrently with the
               full lot.

7.3     PROCEDURES AFTER NOTICE OF REJECTION. After notice of rejection of
        product is given in accordance with Article 7.2 above, Millennium shall
        cooperate with Solvay in determining whether rejection is necessary or
        justified. Solvay shall notify Millennium promptly whether or not it
        accepts Millennium's basis for any rejection. If Solvay disagrees with
        Millennium's determination that a certain product does not meet the
        requirements of Article 7.2 above, such product shall be submitted to a
        mutually acceptable third party laboratory; the fees and expenses of
        such laboratory testing shall be borne entirely by the Party against
        whom such findings are made. Such third party laboratory shall determine
        whether such product meets the requirements of Article 7.2 above and the
        Parties agree that such laboratory's determination shall be final and
        determinative. Whether or not Solvay accepts Millennium's basis for
        rejection, promptly on receipt of a notice of rejection of product,
        Solvay shall, at Millennium's request, use its best efforts to replace
        such rejected product. In the event that the rejected lot is determined
        to not meet the requirements of Article 7.2 above, any moneys paid for
        the rejected lot shall be returned to Millennium [**] after such
        rejection, unless the Parties agree on a schedule pursuant to which
        Solvay shall deliver a replacement lot. Bulk Product may only be
        reprocessed in accordance with validated reprocessing procedures
        described in the drug master file, as agreed by the Parties.
        Unless Solvay requests the destruction of rejected Bulk Product [**] of
        receipt of Millennium's notice of rejection of such Bulk Product,
        Millennium shall promptly return such Bulk Product to Solvay, [**], and
        according to shipping instructions in the Specification. Millennium
        shall, upon receipt of a request for destruction of the material,
        destroy such Bulk Product promptly, properly and at Solvay's expense,
        and provide Solvay with certification of such destruction. In the event
        the Bulk Product is rejected by

        retain the relevant lot of Bulk Product and treat it in the same fashion
        provided above.

7.4     GOVERNING TERMS. All sales hereunder shall be subject to the provisions
        hereof (including the Specification) and shall not be subject to the
        terms and conditions contained on any shipping request of Millennium or
        confirmation of Solvay, except insofar as any such shipping request or
        confirmation establishes :
        (a)    the quantity of any Bulk Product to be shipped;
        (b)    the agreed delivery date as set forth in the Delivery Schedule;
        (c)    the shipment route and destination; or

               to Article 6 shipment is not made promptly after completion of
               the manufacture), or within [**] of receipt of Solvay's written
               certification of the completion of the manufacture and shipment

        designate by notice to Millennium.

8.5     TAXES. Solvay shall be responsible for all value added taxes, property
        taxes, sales tax or any other such tax resulting from sales of Bulk
        Product to Millennium from Solvay or production of Bulk Product or
        purchase of any raw materials.

8.6     MILLENNIUM'S RIGHT TO VERIFY MANUFACTURE CERTIFICATION. Millennium shall
        have the right at its own expense to have an independent third party,
        acceptable to Solvay, audit Solvay's production records, during normal
        business hours and upon reasonable notice, for the purpose of verifying
        the manufacture of Bulk Product in accordance with this Agreement as
        certified pursuant to Article 7.2. Solvay's acceptance of the
        independent third party shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percentage points
        (2%) in excess of the one-year LIBOR effective at the date such payment
        is due, and for the time period until payment is made by Millennium.

8.8     DELIVERY SHORTFALL. In recognition of the fact that long term supply
        disruptions will affect the commercial viability of Millennium and
        eptifibatide, in the event that the Delivery Shortfall at any time
        during a given year (referred to as the "Given Year" hereinafter in this
        Article 8.8) is greater than [**] kilograms, or in the event that the
        Delivery Shortfall at the end of said Given Year is greater than [**]
        kilograms, the Parties shall discuss in good faith for setting up
        alternatives to remedy such Delivery Shortfall. If no alternative is

               Product up to the said Delivery Shortfall [**] and purchase such
               quantity (referred to as the "Quantity" hereinafter in this
               Article 8.8 and in Article 8.9) [**] of the License Agreement,

        (b)    the said Delivery Shortfall shall be deducted from the quantity
               of Bulk Product ordered by Millennium in the Purchase Order for
               delivery in said Given Year and the Delivery Schedule of said
               Purchase Order shall be amended by withdrawing the deliveries
               which Solvay was unable to make,

<Page>

        (c)    if Millennium has ordered less than the Minimum Order for
               delivery in such Given Year, the penalty due by Millennium
               pursuant to Article 4.2 by reason of occurrence of an Order
               Shortfall for such Given Year shall be [**]; in the event that
               Millennium has already paid installments for such penalty during
               said Given Year, such installment payments shall be credited
               against future amounts due to Solvay hereunder except for the
               last year of the term of this Agreement for which Solvay shall
               reimburse Millennium in cash for such installment payments, and

        (d)    should Millennium exercise its right under paragraph 8.8(a) the
               Quantity purchased [**] shall not be taken into account to
               calculate for said Given Year (or for the [**], if such Quantity
               is delivered to Millennium [**]) the minimum [**]percent ([**]%)
               share of Millennium's total requirements of Bulk Product which

               2.2 of the License Agreement.

8.9     [**]. For any year of the term of this Agreement for which Millennium
        orders from Solvay at least the Minimum Order and orders [**] Bulk

        Millennium to Solvay pursuant to Section 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the
        License Agreement shall be [**] percent ([**]%).

        produced from Bulk Product in its possession or delivered to it after
        such termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the
        License Agreement except as provided for in Article 9.4(a).

        (a)    the use by or administration to any person of eptifibatide
               (except where such cost, claim, suit, expense or damage arose or

               Product;

        provided that Solvay gives prompt notice in writing to Millennium of any
        such claim or action, gives Millennium sole control and authority with

        requested by Millennium at Millennium's expense in defending such claim
        or action and does not compromise or settle such claim or action without
        Millennium's prior written consent. Millennium shall not accept any

        Product and the manufacture of same was accurate. Neither Party shall be
        liable to the other for indirect, incidental or consequential damages

        Agreement, the expenses of recall shall be the expenses of notification

        Agreement, the terms of the License Agreement shall control except for
        the provisions of Article 8.8(a), 8.8(d), 8.9 and 9.4(a) which shall
        prevail, and such provisions shall be deemed to supplement and amend the
        License Agreement for the period for which such provisions are in force

12.9    SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
        illegal or unenforceable by any court of law or any competent
        governmental or other authority, the remaining provisions shall be
        severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms so long as this
        Agreement with such terms or provisions does not fail of its essential
        purpose. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace any such
        illegal or unenforceable provisions with suitable substitute provisions
        which will maintain as far as possible the purposes and the effect of
        this Agreement.

        shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer-employee
        or joint venture relationship between the Parties. All activities by the
        Parties hereunder shall be performed by them as independent contractors.
        Neither Party shall incur any debts or make any commitments for the
        other Party, except to extent, if at all, specifically provided herein.

        of Millennium, in any manner disclose or publish the terms of this
        Agreement.

12.11   WAIVER. Failure of either Party to insist upon strict observance of or
        compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement in one or more
        instances shall not be deemed to be a waiver of its rights to insist
        upon such observance or compliance with the other terms hereof, at that
        point in time or in the future.

12.12   HEADINGS. All headings, titles and captions in this Agreement are for

Dear Alfred:

This letter serves to clarify any issues regarding [**] level of confidentiality
and access to information from COR's perspective. As "homme de confiance", COR
views [**] as a COR representative in frequent attendance at Solvay, and as
such, we would like him to have access to the same information that could be
communicated to any other COR personnel.

[**] has entered into a confidentiality arrangement with COR, and therefore this
letter specifically authorizes you to show [**] confidential COR information
that may be in your files, and to discuss with him any issues regarding the
relationship between COR and Solvay.

It is our hope that involving [**] in COR/Solvay issues on a regular basis will
improve communications between our companies and facilitate prompt resolution of
issues. However, you understand that [**] is not COR's general agent and he does
not have the power to commit COR or enter into agreements on behalf of COR
without specific instructions from COR.

We appreciate your willingness to include [**] as a representative of COR.

Regards,


/s/Mark D. Perrin

       ARTICLE 2. - AMENDMENT

               2.1 Section 2.2 of the LICENSE AGREEMENT shall be deleted and
               replaced by the following Section 2.2:

SECONDARY SUPPLY.
-----------------

        COR shall have the right to establish a Secondary Source for the
        manufacture of Bulk Product by the Licensed Process for COR The
        Secondary Source shall be selected from the list of specific potential
        secondary sources acceptable to COR and to Solvay which is attached
        hereto as Exhibit C; this list may be amended from time to time upon
        agreement of COR and Solvay, such agreement not to be unreasonably
        withheld, and without any additional fee. COR and Solvay agree that a
        potential corporate partner, such as one of those exemplified in Exhibit
        C, would be acceptable as the Secondary Source. COR will notify Solvay
        of the establishment of the Secondary Source. In the event COR
        terminates a supply arrangement with a Secondary Source, COR may
        establish an alternate Secondary Source. COR shall notify Solvay [**] of
        such a termination of supply arrangements with a Secondary Source.
        Further, after the Secondary Source is established, COR may use [**] for
        the manufacture of Bulk Product starting from Step One Intermediates
        supplied by Solvay to [**]. COR's future requirements for Bulk Product
        cannot be ascertained with certainty at the present time, however, COR
        wants to entertain certain minimum purchase obligations. Therefore,
        after the Secondary Source is established, COR shall be required to
        purchase from Solvay a share of at least [**] percent ([**]%) of its
        total, worldwide requirements for Bulk Product on a year-to-year basis
        (to the extent that such share does not exceed the manufacturing
        capacity planned by Solvay to produce Bulk Product) for the time period
        during which royalties are payable under this Agreement, except to the
        extent the parties have agreed otherwise in writing. For purposes of the
        preceding sentence, such planned capacity shall be determined for a
        particular calendar year X on the [**]. Notwithstanding the above
        however, COR may purchase from such Secondary Source and/or [**] percent
        ([**]%) of its requirements in the event of any breach or default of
        Solvay of any supply arrangement between COR and Solvay for so long as
        the breach or default remains uncured. In the event Solvay assigns or
        transfers to a third party the Licensed Process, this Agreement, the
        Supply Agreement or the Long Term Supply Agreement, inconsistently with
        the terms of these Agreements, COR may establish and additional,
        "Back-up" Secondary Source for the manufacture of Bulk Product. In the
        event that COR wishes to establish COR itself either as the

                                        2
<Page>

        Secondary Source or the Back-up Secondary Source, then COR and Solvay
        shall negotiate in good faith, before establishing COR in such capacity,
        a method for establishing [**].

               b) All the other provisions of the LICENSE AGREEMENT shall remain
               unchanged and in full force and effect.

               c) The present amendment shall be effective as of the first date
               here above written.

        IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed
in two original copies by their duly authorized representatives, as of the date
first above written.
