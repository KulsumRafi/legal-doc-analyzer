                      2002 SALARIED EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN




For the 2002 fiscal year, Liz Claiborne,  Inc.  maintained a bonus plan for full
time salaried employees under which bonuses were earned based upon a combination
of return on invested  operating  capital and  earnings  per share,  as measured
against  pre-established  targets,  and, as applicable,  achievement of targeted
levels of divisional  direct  operating profit and/or  departmental  performance
considerations and the achievement of individual goals, subject to certain terms
and conditions. A similar bonus plan is anticipated for 2003.
