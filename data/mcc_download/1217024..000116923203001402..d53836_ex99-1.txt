        business in which it is currently engaged. The Master Servicer is duly

        standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the business
        transacted by it or properties owned or leased by it requires such

               (ii) The Master Servicer has the power and authority to make,
        execute, deliver and perform this Servicing Agreement and all of the
        transactions contemplated under this Servicing Agreement, and has taken

        insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
        rights generally and by the availability of equitable remedies;

               (iii) The Master Servicer is not required to obtain the consent
        of any other Person or any consent, license, approval or authorization
        from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental authority,
        bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,
        performance, validity or enforceability of this Servicing Agreement,
        except for such consent, license, approval or authorization, or
        registration or declaration, as shall have been obtained or filed, as
        the case may be;

               (iv) The execution and delivery of this Servicing Agreement and
        the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Master
        Servicer will not violate any provision of any existing law or

        Servicer or any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
        of the Master Servicer, or constitute a material breach of any mortgage,
        indenture, contract or other agreement to which the Master Servicer is a
        party or by which the Master Servicer may be bound;

               (v) No litigation or administrative proceeding of or before any
        court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending (other than
        litigation with respect to which pleadings or


                                       4
<PAGE>

        documents have been filed with a court, but not served on the Master
        Servicer), or to the knowledge of the Master Servicer threatened,
        against the Master Servicer or any of its properties or with respect to
        this Servicing Agreement or the Bonds or the Certificates which, to the
        knowledge of the Master Servicer, has a reasonable likelihood of
        resulting in a material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated
        by this Servicing Agreement; and

               (vi) The Master Servicer is a member of MERS in good standing,
        and will comply in all material respects with the rules and procedures
        of MERS in connection with the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are

termination of the Master Servicer hereunder.

        Section 2.02 Existence. The Issuer will keep in full effect its
existence, rights and franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the
State of Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is or
becomes, organized under the laws of any other state or of the United States of
America, in which case the Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises under the laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and
preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Servicing Agreement.

        Section 2.03 Enforcement of Representations and Warranties. The Master
Servicer, on behalf of and subject to the direction of the Indenture Trustee, as
pledgee of the Mortgage Loans, or the Bond Insurer shall enforce the
representations and warranties and related obligations for breaches thereof of
the Seller pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement. Upon
the discovery by the Seller, the Master Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Bond Insurer or the Company of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made in the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement in respect
of any Mortgage Loan, or upon the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, which
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Bondholders, the
Certificateholders or the Bond Insurer, the party discovering the same shall
give prompt written notice to the other parties. The Master Servicer shall
promptly notify the Seller and request that, pursuant to the terms of the
Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement, the Seller either (i) cure such
breach or Repurchase Event in all material respects or (ii) purchase such
Mortgage Loan, in each instance in accordance with the Mortgage Loan Sale and
Contribution Agreement; provided that the Seller shall, subject to the
conditions set forth in the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement, have
the option to substitute an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans for such Mortgage Loan. Monthly Payments due with
respect to Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution shall
not be part of the Trust Estate and will be retained by the Master Servicer and
remitted by the Master Servicer to the Seller on the next succeeding Payment
Date. For the month of substitution, distributions to the Payment Account
pursuant to this Agreement will include the Monthly Payment due on a Deleted
Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter the Seller shall be entitled to
retain all amounts received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The Master
Servicer shall amend or cause to be amended the Mortgage Loan Schedule to
reflect the removal of such Mortgage Loan and the substitution of the Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans and the Master Servicer shall promptly


                                       5
<PAGE>

deliver the amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the related Subservicer, the Bond
Insurer, Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee.

        In connection with the substitution of one or more Eligible Substitute
Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer will
determine the amount (such amount, a "Substitution Adjustment Amount"), if any,
by which the aggregate principal balance of all such Eligible Substitute
Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less than the aggregate
principal balance of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans (after application of the
principal portion of the Monthly Payments due in the month of substitution that
are to be distributed to the Payment Account in the month of substitution). The
Seller shall pay the Substitution Adjustment Amount to the Master Servicer and
the Master Servicer shall deposit such Substitution Adjustment Amount into the
Collection Account upon receipt.

                                   ARTICLE III

                 Administration and Servicing of Mortgage Loans

        Section 3.01 Master Servicer to Assure Servicing. (a) The Master
Servicer shall supervise, or take such actions as are necessary to ensure, the
servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Property in
accordance with this Servicing Agreement and its normal servicing practices,
which generally shall conform to the standards of an institution prudently
servicing mortgage loans for its own account and shall have full authority to do
anything it reasonably deems appropriate or desirable in connection with such
servicing and administration. The Master Servicer may perform its
responsibilities relating to servicing through other agents or independent
contractors, but shall not thereby be released from any of its responsibilities
as hereinafter set forth. The authority of the Master Servicer, in its capacity
as master servicer, and any Subservicer acting on its behalf, shall include,
without limitation, the power to (i) consult with and advise any Subservicer
regarding administration of a related Mortgage Loan, (ii) approve any
recommendation by a Subservicer to foreclose on a related Mortgage Loan, (iii)
supervise the filing and collection of insurance claims and take or cause to be
taken such actions on behalf of the insured Person thereunder as shall be
reasonably necessary to prevent the denial of coverage thereunder, and (iv)
effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged
Property securing a related Mortgage Loan, including the employment of
attorneys, the institution of legal proceedings, the collection of deficiency
judgments, the acceptance of compromise proposals, the filing of claims under
any Primary Insurance Policy and the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy, and any
other matter pertaining to a delinquent Mortgage Loan. The authority of the
Master Servicer shall include, in addition, the power on behalf of the
Bondholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer or any of them to (i)
execute and deliver customary consents or waivers and other instruments and
documents, (ii) consent to transfer of any related Mortgaged Property and
assumptions of the related Mortgage Notes and Security Instruments (in the
manner provided in this Servicing Agreement) and (iii) collect any Insurance
Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Master Servicer and any Subservicer acting on its behalf may, and
is hereby authorized, and empowered by the Indenture Trustee to, execute and
deliver, on behalf of itself, the Bondholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Bond
Insurer or any of them, any instruments of satisfaction, cancellation, partial
or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the related Mortgage Loans, the Insurance Policies and the accounts related
thereto, and the Mortgaged Properties. The Master Servicer may exercise this
power in its own name or in the name of a Subservicer.

        In accordance with the standards of the preceding paragraph, the Master
Servicer shall advance or cause to be advanced funds as necessary for the
purpose of effecting the payment of taxes and assessments on the Mortgaged
Properties, which advances shall be reimbursable in the first instance from
related collections from the Mortgagors pursuant to Section 3.08, and further as
provided in Section 3.07; provided that the Master Servicer shall not be
obligated to make such advance if, in its good faith judgment, the Master
Servicer determines that such advance to be a Nonrecoverable Advance.

        The relationship of the Master Servicer (and of any successor to the
Master Servicer under this Agreement) to the Indenture Trustee under this
Agreement is intended by the parties to be that of an


                                       7
<PAGE>

independent contractor and not that of a joint venturer, partner or agent;
provided, however, that the Master Servicer is authorized and empowered by the
Indenture Trustee, on behalf of the Bondholders, the Bond Insurer and the
Indenture Trustee, in its own name or in the name of any Subservicer, when the
Master Servicer or such Subservicer, as the case may be, believes it is
appropriate in its best judgment to register any Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)
System, or cause the removal from the registration of any Mortgage Loan on the
MERS(R) System, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Indenture Trustee, the
Bond Insurer and the Bondholders or any of them, any and all instruments of
assignment and other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or
re-recording of a Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the
Indenture Trustee and its successors and assigns. Any expenses incurred in
connection with the actions described in the preceding sentence shall be borne
by the Master Servicer in accordance with Section 3.15, with no right of
reimbursement; provided, that if, as a result of MERS discontinuing or becoming
unable to continue operations in connection with the MERS System, it becomes
necessary to remove any Mortgage Loan from registration on the MERS System and
to arrange for the assignment of the related Mortgages to the Indenture Trustee,
then any related expenses shall be reimbursable to the Master Servicer from the
Trust Fund.

        (b) If the Mortgage relating to a Mortgage Loan did not have a lien
senior to the Mortgage Loan on the related Mortgaged Property as of the related
Cut-off Date, then the Master Servicer, in such capacity, may not consent to the
placing of a lien senior to that of the Mortgage on the related Mortgaged
Property.

        (c) The Master Servicer or the related Subservicer, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to (A) execute assumption agreements, substitution agreements,
and instruments of satisfaction or cancellation or of full release or discharge,
or any other document contemplated by this Servicing Agreement and other
comparable instruments with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to
the Mortgaged Properties subject to the Mortgages (and the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee each shall promptly execute any such documents on request of
the Master Servicer and prepared by it) and (B) approve the granting of an
easement thereon in favor of another Person, any alteration or demolition of the
related Mortgaged Property or other similar matters, if it has determined,
exercising its good faith business judgment in the same manner as it would if it
were the owner of the related Mortgage Loan, that the security for, and the
timely and full collectability of, such Mortgage Loan would not be adversely
affected thereby. An assumption pursuant to this Section 3.01 is permitted
solely if the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser of a Mortgaged
Property meets the same or better underwriting guidelines as those which were
applied to the original borrower and the security for such Mortgage Loan is not
impaired by the assumption. Any fee collected by the Master Servicer or the
related Subservicer for processing such request will be retained by the Master
Servicer or such Subservicer as additional servicing compensation.

        (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 3.01(a), the Master
Servicer shall not take any action inconsistent with the interests of the
Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer or the Bondholders or with the rights and
interests of the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer or the Bondholders under
this Servicing Agreement.


                                       8

        (e) The Indenture Trustee shall execute and return to the Master
Servicer any limited powers of attorney and other documents in form as provided
to it necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to service and
administer the related Mortgage Loans and REO Property.

        Section 3.02 Subservicing Agreements Between Master Servicer and
Subservicers. (a) The Master Servicer may enter into Subservicing Agreements
with Subservicers for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans and
for the performance of any and all other activities of the Master Servicer
hereunder. Each Subservicer shall be either (i) an institution the accounts of
which are insured by the FDIC or (ii) another entity that engages in the
business of originating or servicing mortgage loans comparable to the Mortgage
Loans, and in either case shall be authorized to transact business in the state
or states in which the related Mortgaged Properties it is to service are
situated, if and to the extent required by applicable law to enable the
Subservicer to perform its obligations hereunder and under the Subservicing
Agreement, and in either case shall be a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae approved
mortgage servicer. Any Subservicing Agreement entered into by the Master
Servicer shall include the provision that such Agreement may be immediately
terminated (x) with cause and without any termination fee by any Master Servicer
hereunder or (y) without cause in which case the Master Servicer shall be
responsible for any termination fee or penalty resulting therefrom. In addition,
each Subservicing Agreement shall provide for servicing of the Mortgage Loans
consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement. With the consent of the
Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer, the Master Servicer and the Subservicers
may enter into Subservicing Agreements and make amendments to the Subservicing
Agreements or enter into different forms of Subservicing Agreements providing
for, among other things, the delegation by the Master Servicer to a Subservicer
of additional duties regarding the administration of the Mortgage Loans;
provided, however, that any such amendments or different forms shall be
consistent with and not violate the provisions of this Servicing Agreement, and
that no such amendment or different form shall be made or entered into which
could be reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the interests of the
Bond Insurer or the Bondholders, without the consent of the Holders of Bonds
representing not less than a majority of the aggregate Bond Principal Balance of
the Bonds.

        The Master Servicer has entered into Subservicing Agreements with the
Initial Subservicers for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans
and may enter into additional Subservicing Agreements with Subservicers
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer for the servicing and
administration of certain of the Mortgage Loans.

        (b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder, the Master Servicer,
for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Bondholders,
shall enforce the obligations of each Subservicer under the related Subservicing
Agreement. Such enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal
prosecution of claims, termination of Subservicing Agreements and the pursuit of
other appropriate remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an
extent and at such time as the Master Servicer, in its good faith business
judgment, would require were it the owner of the related Mortgage Loans. The
Master Servicer shall pay the costs of such enforcement at its own expense, but
shall be reimbursed therefor only (i) from a general recovery resulting from
such enforcement only to the extent, if any, that such recovery exceeds all
amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) from a specific
recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys' fees against the party against whom
such enforcement is directed.


                                       9

        (c) The Master Servicer represents that it has entered into a contract
regarding the sale of sub- servicing rights with respect to the Group 1 Loans
with Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP ("Countrywide") and shall transfer the
subservicing of the Mortgage Loans from Wendover to Countrywide or an affiliate
thereof on or about April 1, 2003. The Master Servicer represents that it has
entered into a subservicing agreement with respect to the Group 2 Loans with
Midland Loan Services, Inc. The Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer hereby
consents to such transfer with respect to the Group 1 Loans.

        Section 3.03 Successor Subservicers. The Master Servicer shall be
entitled to terminate any Subservicing Agreement that may exist in accordance
with the terms and conditions of such Subservicing Agreement and without any
limitation by virtue of this Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that upon
termination, the Master Servicer shall either act as servicer of the related
Mortgage Loan or enter into an appropriate contract with a successor Subservicer
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer pursuant to which such
successor Subservicer will be bound by all relevant terms of the related
Subservicing Agreement pertaining to the servicing of such Mortgage Loan.

        Section 3.04 Liability of the Master Servicer. (a) Notwithstanding any
Subservicing Agreement, any of the provisions of this Servicing Agreement
relating to agreements or arrangements between the Master Servicer and a
Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or otherwise,
the Master Servicer shall under all circumstances remain obligated and primarily
liable to the Indenture Trustee, the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer for the
servicing and administering of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Property in
accordance with this Servicing Agreement. The obligations and liability of the
Master Servicer shall not be diminished by virtue of Subservicing Agreements or
by virtue of indemnification of the Master Servicer by any Subservicer, or any
other Person. The obligations and liability of the Master Servicer shall remain
of the same nature and under the same terms and conditions as if the Master
Servicer alone were servicing and administering the related Mortgage Loans. The
Master Servicer shall, however, be entitled to enter into indemnification
agreements with any Subservicer or other Person and nothing in this Servicing
Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification. For the
purposes of this Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to
have received any payment on a Mortgage Loan on the date the Subservicer
received such payment; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to
the Indenture Trustee as the successor Master Servicer; provided, further,
however, that the foregoing provision shall not affect the obligation of the
Master Servicer if it is also the Indenture Trustee to advance amounts which are
not Nonrecoverable Advances.

        Any Subservicing Agreement that may be entered into and any transactions
or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Subservicer in its
capacity as such and not as an originator shall be deemed to be between the
Subservicer and the Master Servicer alone, and the Indenture Trustee, the Bond
Insurer and the Bondholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have
no claims, rights, obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the
Subservicer except as set forth in Section 3.05.

        Section 3.05 Assumption or Termination of Subservicing Agreements by
Indenture Trustee. (a) If the Indenture Trustee or a successor Master Servicer
shall assume the servicing obligations of the Master Servicer in accordance with
Section 6.02 below, the Indenture Trustee, to the extent necessary to permit the
Indenture Trustee to carry out the provisions of Section 6.02 with respect to
the Mortgage Loans, shall


                                       10
<PAGE>

succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer under each
of the Subservicing Agreements. In such event, the Indenture Trustee or its
designee as the successor master servicer shall be deemed to have assumed all of
the Master Servicer's rights and obligations therein and to have replaced the
Master Servicer as a party to such Subservicing Agreements to the same extent as
if such Subservicing Agreements had been assigned to the Indenture Trustee or
its designee as a successor master servicer, except that the Indenture Trustee
or its designee as a successor master servicer shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligations or liabilities of the Master Servicer arising prior to
such assumption (other than the obligation to make any Advances) and the Master
Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations under
such Subservicing Agreements arising prior to such assumption. Nothing in the
foregoing shall be deemed to entitle the Indenture Trustee or its designee as a
successor master servicer at any time to receive any portion of the servicing
compensation provided under Section 3.15 except for such portion as the Master
Servicer would be entitled to receive.

        (b) In the event that the Indenture Trustee or a successor Master
Servicer assumes the servicing obligations of the Master Servicer under Section
6.02, upon the reasonable request of the Indenture Trustee or such successor
Master Servicer, the Master Servicer shall at its own expense deliver to the
Indenture Trustee, or to such successor Master Servicer, photocopies of all
documents, files and records, electronic or otherwise, relating to the
Subservicing Agreements and the related Mortgage Loans or REO Property then
being serviced and an accounting of amounts collected and held by it, if any,
and will otherwise cooperate and use its reasonable efforts to effect the
orderly and efficient transfer of the Subservicing Agreements, or
responsibilities hereunder to the Indenture Trustee, or to such successor Master
Servicer.

        Section 3.06 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments. (a) The Master
Servicer will coordinate and monitor remittances by Subservicers to it with
respect to the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Servicing Agreement.

        (b) The Master Servicer shall make its best reasonable efforts to
collect or cause to be collected all payments required under the terms and
provisions of the Mortgage Loans and shall follow, and use its best reasonable
efforts to cause Subservicers to follow, collection procedures comparable to the
collection procedures of prudent mortgage lenders servicing mortgage loans for
their own account to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this
Servicing Agreement. Consistent with the foregoing, the Master Servicer or the
related Subservicer may in its discretion (i) waive or permit to be waived any
late payment charge, prepayment charge, assumption fee, or any penalty interest
in connection with the prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) suspend or reduce
or permit to be suspended or reduced regular monthly payments for a period of up
to six months, or arrange or permit an arrangement with a Mortgagor for a
scheduled liquidation of delinquencies; provided, however, that the Master
Servicer or the related Subservicer may permit the foregoing only if it
believes, in good faith, that recoveries of Monthly Payments will be maximized;
provided further, however, that Monthly Payments may not be suspended during the
twelve months prior to the final maturity of the Bonds. In the event the Master
Servicer or related Subservicer shall consent to the deferment of the due dates
for payments due on a Mortgage Note, the Master Servicer shall nonetheless make
an Advance or shall cause the related Subservicer to make an advance to the same
extent as if such installment were due, owing and delinquent and had not been
deferred through liquidation of the Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that
the obligation of the


                                       11
<PAGE>

Master Servicer or the related Subservicer to make an Advance shall apply only
to the extent that the Master Servicer believes, in good faith, that such
advances are not Nonrecoverable Advances.

        (c) Within five Business Days after the Master Servicer has determined
that all amounts which it expects to recover from or on account of a Mortgage
Loan have been recovered and that no further Liquidation Proceeds will be
received in connection therewith, the Master Servicer shall cause the related
Subservicer to provide to the Master Servicer a certificate of a Servicing
Officer that such Mortgage Loan became a Liquidated Mortgage Loan as of the date
of such determination. The Master Servicer shall provide to the Indenture
Trustee a monthly summary of each Mortgage Loan that became a Liquidated
Mortgage Loan.

        (d) The Master Servicer shall establish a segregated account in the name
of the Indenture Trustee (the "Collection Account"), which shall be an Eligible
Account, in which the Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited any
amounts representing payments on and any collections in respect of the Mortgage
Loans due subsequent to the Cut-off Date (other than in respect of the payments
referred to in the following paragraph) within one Business Day (two Business
Days if the Subservicer is Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP or an affiliate)
following receipt thereof (or otherwise on or prior to the Closing Date),
including the following payments and collections received or made by it (without
duplication):

               (i) all payments of principal, including Principal Prepayments,
        of or interest on the Mortgage Loans (including advances by a
        Subservicer) received by the Master Servicer directly from Mortgagors or
        from the respective Subservicer, net of any portion of the interest
        thereof retained by the Subservicer as subservicing fees;

               (ii) the aggregate Repurchase Price of the Mortgage Loans
        purchased by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.18;

               (iii) Net Liquidation Proceeds;

               (iv) all proceeds of any Mortgage Loans repurchased by the Seller
        pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement, and all
        Substitution Adjustment Amounts required to be deposited in connection
        with the substitution of an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan pursuant
        to the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement;

               (v) Insurance Proceeds, other than Net Liquidation Proceeds,
        resulting from any insurance policy maintained on a Mortgaged Property;

               (vi) any Advance and any Compensating Interest payments; and

               (vii) any other amounts received by the Master Servicer,
        including any fees or penalties not retained by a Subservicer, required
        to be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to this Servicing
        Agreement.


                                       12
<PAGE>

provided, however, that with respect to each Due Period, the Master Servicer
shall be permitted to retain from payments in respect of interest on the
Mortgage Loans, the Servicing Fee for such Due Period. The foregoing
requirements respecting deposits to the Collection Account are exclusive, it
being understood that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Master Servicer need not deposit in the Collection Account fees (including
annual fees or assumption fees) or late charge and prepayment penalties, payable
by Mortgagors, each as further described in Section 3.15, or amounts received by
the Subservicer for the accounts of Mortgagors for application towards the
payment of taxes, insurance premiums, assessments and similar items. In the
event any amount not required to be deposited in the Collection Account is so
deposited, the Master Servicer may at any time (prior to being terminated under
this Agreement) withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The Master Servicer shall keep records
that accurately reflect the funds on deposit in the Collection Account that have
been identified by it as being attributable to the Mortgage Loans and shall hold
all collections in the Collection Account for the benefit of the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Bondholders, as their interests
may appear. The Master Servicer shall remit all Foreclosure Profits to the
Collection Account, to the extent not payable to the related Subservicer.

        Funds in the Collection Account may not be invested with, and shall not
be commingled with, the Master Servicer's own funds or general assets or with
funds respecting payments on mortgage loans or with any other funds not related
to the Bonds. Funds in the Collection Account shall be invested solely in
Eligible Investments, designated in the name of the Indenture Trustee, which
shall mature not later than the Business Day next preceding the third Business
Day prior to each Payment Date next following the date of such investment and
shall not be sold or disposed of prior to maturity. All income and gain realized
from any such investment shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer or the
related Subservicer. The amount of any losses incurred with respect to any such
investments shall be deposited in the Collection Account by the Master Servicer.

        In the event the Indenture Trustee assumes the responsibilities of the
Master Servicer under this Servicing Agreement upon a Servicing Default under
Section 6.01, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to reimburse itself for
Advances pursuant to Sections 3.07(a)(v), (viii) and (ix) prior to reimbursement
of the terminated Master Servicer or any successor Master Servicer.

        (e) The Master Servicer will require each Subservicer to hold all funds
constituting collections on the Mortgage Loans, pending remittance thereof to
the Master Servicer, in one or more accounts meeting the requirements of an
Eligible Account, and invested in Eligible Investments, and in the name of the
Indenture Trustee. The Subservicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected
and received pursuant to each Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its
own funds and general assets and any other funds. Each Subservicer shall make
remittances to the Master Servicer no later than the eighteenth (18th) day of
each month, commencing on the eighteenth (18th) day of the month next following
the Closing Date, or if such eighteenth (18th) day is not a Business Day, the
first Business Day immediately preceding such eighteenth (18th) day.

        Section 3.07 Withdrawals from the Collection Account. (a) The Master
Servicer shall, from time to time as provided herein, make withdrawals from the
Collection Account of amounts on deposit therein


                                       13
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 3.06 that are attributable to the Mortgage Loans for the
following purposes (without duplication):

               (i) to deposit in the Payment Account, by the third Business Day
        prior to each Payment Date, the Available Funds required to be
        distributed as provided in the Indenture on a Payment Date;

               (ii) to the extent deposited to the Collection Account, to
        reimburse itself or the related Subservicer for previously unreimbursed
        expenses incurred in maintaining individual insurance policies pursuant
        to Sections 3.10 or 3.11, or Liquidation Expenses, paid pursuant to
        Section 3.13 or otherwise reimbursable pursuant to the terms of this
        Servicing Agreement, such withdrawal right being limited to amounts
        received on the related Mortgage Loans (other than any Repurchase Price
        in respect thereto) which represent late recoveries of the payments for
        which such advances were made, or from related Liquidation Proceeds;

               (iii) to pay to itself out of each payment received on account of
        interest on a Mortgage Loan as contemplated by Section 3.15, an amount
        equal to the related Master Servicing Fee (to the extent not retained
        pursuant to Section 3.06);

               (iv) to pay to itself or the Seller, with respect to any Mortgage
        Loan or property acquired in respect thereof that has been purchased or
        otherwise transferred to the Seller, the Master Servicer or other
        entity, all amounts received thereon and not required to be distributed
        to Bondholders as of the date on which the related Purchase Price or
        Repurchase Price is determined;

               (v) to reimburse the Master Servicer or any Subservicer for any
        Advance of its own funds or any advance of such Subservicer's own funds,
        the right of the Master Servicer or a Subservicer to reimbursement
        pursuant to this subclause (v) being limited to amounts received
        (including, for this purpose, the Repurchase Price therefor, Insurance
        Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds) which represent late payments or
        recoveries of the principal of or interest on such Mortgage Loan
        respecting which such Advance or advance was made;

               (vi) to reimburse the Master Servicer or any Subservicer from
        Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds relating to a particular
        Mortgage Loan for amounts expended by the Master Servicer or such
        Subservicer pursuant to Section 3.13 in good faith in connection with
        the restoration of the related Mortgaged Property which was damaged by
        the Uninsured Cause or in connection with the liquidation of such
        Mortgage Loan;

               (vii) to pay the Master Servicer or any Subservicer (payment to
        any Subservicer to be subject to prior payment to the Master Servicer of
        an amount equal to the Subservicing Fee), as appropriate, from
        Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds received in connection with
        the liquidation of any Mortgage Loan, the amount which it or such
        Subservicer would have been entitled to receive under subclause (iii) of
        this Subsection 3.07(a) as servicing compensation on account of each
        defaulted Monthly Payment on such Mortgage Loan if paid in a timely
        manner by the related Mortgagor, but only to the extent that the
        aggregate of Liquidation Proceeds and


                                       14
<PAGE>

        Insurance Proceeds with respect to such Mortgage Loan, after any
        reimbursement to the Master Servicer or any Subservicer, pursuant to
        other subclauses of this Subsection 3.07(a), exceeds the outstanding
        Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan plus accrued and unpaid
        interest thereon at the related Mortgage Rate less the Servicing Fee
        Rate to but not including the date of payment (in any event, the amount
        of servicing compensation received by a Subservicer and the Master
        Servicer with respect to any defaulted Monthly Payment shall not exceed
        the applicable Servicing Fee);

               (viii) to reimburse the Master Servicer or any Subservicer for
        advances of funds pursuant to Article III, the right to reimbursement
        pursuant to this subclause being limited to amounts received on the
        related Mortgage Loan (including, for this purpose, the Repurchase Price
        therefor, Insurance Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds) which represent
        late recoveries of the payments for which such advances were made;

               (ix) to reimburse the Master Servicer or any Subservicer for any
        Nonrecoverable Advance previously made, and not reimbursed pursuant to
        this Subsection 3.07(a);

               (x) to deposit in the Payment Account, by the third Business Day
        prior to each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee Fee and the Derivative
        Contract Payment Amount;

               (xi) to withdraw any other amount deposited in the Collection
        Account that was not required to be deposited therein pursuant to
        Section 3.06;

               (xii) to pay Radian the premium with respect to the Radian
        Lender-Paid PMI Policy;

               (xiii) to pay the Owner Trustee the Owner Trustee Fee and the
        Bond Insurer the Premium Amount;

               (xiv) to reimburse the Master Servicer for costs associated with
        the environmental report specified in Section 3.13(e); and

               (xv) clear and terminate the Collection Account following a
        termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Trust
        Agreement.

In connection with withdrawals pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi),
(vii) and (viii), the Master Servicer's entitlement thereto is limited to
collections or other recoveries on the related Mortgage Loan, and the Master
Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting, on a Mortgage Loan by
Mortgage Loan basis, for the purpose of justifying any withdrawal from the
Collection Account pursuant to such clauses. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimburse
itself for any previously unreimbursed expenses incurred pursuant to Section
3.13 or otherwise reimbursable expenses incurred pursuant to the terms of this
Servicing Agreement, but only to the extent of collections or other recoveries
on the related Mortgage Loan.


                                       15
<PAGE>

        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.07, the Master
Servicer may, but is not required to, allow the Subservicers to deduct from
amounts received by them or from the related account maintained by a
Subservicer, prior to deposit in the Collection Account, any portion to which
such Subservicers are entitled as servicing compensation (including income on
Eligible Investments) or reimbursement of any reimbursable Advances or Servicing
Advances made by such Subservicers.

        Section 3.08 Collection of Taxes Assessments and Similar Items;
Servicing Accounts.

        (a) The Master Servicer shall establish and maintain or cause the
related Subservicer to establish and maintain, one or more Servicing Accounts.
The Master Servicer or a Subservicer will deposit and retain therein all
collections from the Mortgagors for the payment of taxes, assessments, insurance
premiums, or comparable items as agent of the Mortgagors.

        (b) The deposits in the Servicing Accounts shall be held in trust by the
Master Servicer or a Subservicer (and its successors and assigns) in the name of
the Indenture Trustee. Such Servicing Accounts shall be Eligible Accounts and if
permitted by applicable law, invested in Eligible Investments held in trust by
the Master Servicer or a Subservicer as described above and maturing, or be
subject to redemption or withdrawal, no later than the date on which such funds
are required to be withdrawn, and in no event later than 45 days after the date
of investment; withdrawals of amounts from the Servicing Accounts may be made
only to effect timely payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or
comparable items, to reimburse the Master Servicer or a Subservicer for any
advances made with respect to such items, to refund to any Mortgagors any sums
as may be determined to be overages, to pay interest, if required, to Mortgagors
on balances in the Servicing Accounts or to clear and terminate the Servicing
Accounts at or any time after the termination of this Servicing Agreement.

        Section 3.09 Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding
the Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall provide, and shall cause any
Subservicer to provide, to the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Owner
Trustee access to the documentation regarding the related Mortgage Loans and REO
Property and to the Bondholders, the FDIC, and the supervisory agents and
examiners of the FDIC access to the documentation regarding the related Mortgage
Loans required by applicable regulations, such access being afforded without
charge but only upon reasonable request and during normal business hours at the
offices of the Master Servicer or the Subservicers that are designated by these
entities; provided, however, that, unless otherwise required by law, the Master
Servicer or the Subservicer shall not be required to provide access to such
documentation if the provision thereof would violate the legal right to privacy
of any Mortgagor; provided, further, however, that the Indenture Trustee, the
Bond Insurer and the Owner Trustee shall coordinate their requests for such
access so as not to impose an unreasonable burden on, or cause an unreasonable
interruption of, the business of the Master Servicer or any Subservicer. The
Master Servicer and the Subservicers shall allow representatives of the above
entities to photocopy any of the documentation and shall provide equipment for
that purpose at a charge that covers their own actual out-of-pocket costs.

        Section 3.10 Maintenance of Primary Insurance Policies and the Radian
Policy; Collection Thereunder.

        (a) The Master Servicer shall, or shall cause the related Subservicer
to, exercise its best reasonable efforts to maintain and keep in full force and
effect each Primary Insurance Policy by a Qualified Insurer, or other insurer
satisfactory to the Bond Insurer and the Rating Agencies, with respect to each
Mortgage Loan as to which as of the Cut-off Date a Primary Insurance Policy was
in effect and the original principal amount of the related Mortgage Note
exceeded 80% of the Original Value in an amount at least equal to the excess of
such original principal amount over 75% of such Original Value until the
principal amount of any such first lien Mortgage Loan is reduced below 80% of
the Original Value or, based upon a new appraisal, the principal amount of such
first lien Mortgage Loan represents less than 80% of the new appraised value.
The Master Servicer shall, or shall cause the related Subservicer to, effect the
timely payment of the premium on each Primary Insurance Policy. The Master
Servicer and the related Subservicer shall have the power to substitute for any
Primary Insurance Policy another substantially equivalent policy issued by
another Qualified Insurer, provided, that, such substitution shall be subject to
the condition that it will not cause the ratings on the Bonds to be downgraded
or withdrawn, without taking into account the Bond Insurance Policy, as
evidenced by a writing from each Rating Agency, and (ii) the Bond Insurer shall
have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        (b) The Master Servicer shall take all such actions on behalf of the
Trust as are necessary to service, maintain and administer the Radian
Lender-Paid PMI Policy and to enforce the Trust's rights under the Radian
Lender-Paid PMI Policy. The Master Servicer shall effect the timely payment of
the Radian PMI Policy Fee. To the extent the Mortgagor with respect to a Radian
PMI Insured Loan is delinquent, the Master Servicer shall advance the related
Radian PMI Policy Fee as a Servicing Advance. Except as expressly set forth
herein, the Master Servicer shall have full authority on behalf of the Trust to
do anything it reasonably deems appropriate or desirable in connection with the
servicing, maintenance and administration of the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy.
The Master Servicer shall make its best reasonable efforts to file all insured
claims under the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy and collect from Radian all
Insurance Proceeds due to the Trust under the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy. The
Master Servicer shall not take, or permit any Subservicer to take, any action
which would result in non-coverage under the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy of
any loss which, but for the actions of the Master Servicer or any Subservicer,
would have been covered thereunder. To the extent coverage is available, the
Master Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and effect the
Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy for the life of the Mortgage Loan. Neither the
Master Servicer nor the Indenture Trustee shall terminate the Radian Lender-
Paid PMI Policy with respect to any Mortgage Loan, except in accordance with the
terms thereof. The Master Servicer shall cooperate with Radian and shall use its
best efforts to furnish all reasonable aid, evidence and information in the
possession of the Master Servicer or to which the Master Servicer has access
with respect to any Radian PMI Insured Loan.

        (c) If Radian remains in default pursuant to the Radian Lender-Paid PMI
Policy and may be terminated thereunder without payment of any further premium
for such policy, the Master Servicer shall use its best efforts to replace such
policy with a substitute policy at the same premium rate that is charged under
the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy and with coverage for losses in amounts
substantially similar to those under the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy. Any
substitute policy shall be entered into only with the written consent of the
Bond Insurer.

        Section 3.11 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance and Fidelity Coverage. (a)
The Master Servicer shall maintain and keep, or cause each Subservicer to
maintain and keep, with respect to each Mortgage Loan and REO Property, in full
force and effect hazard insurance (fire insurance with extended coverage) equal
to at least the lesser of the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan or
the current replacement cost of the Mortgaged Property, and containing a
standard mortgagee clause, provided, however, that the amount of hazard
insurance may not be less than the amount necessary to prevent loss due to the
application of any co-insurance provision of the related policy. Unless
applicable state law requires a higher deductible, the deductible on such hazard
insurance policy may be no more than $1,000 or 1% of the applicable amount of
coverage, whichever is less. In the case of a condominium unit or a unit in a
planned unit development, the required hazard insurance shall take the form of a
multi-peril policy covering the entire condominium project or planned unit
development, in an amount equal to at least 100% of the insurable value based on
replacement cost.

        (b) Any amounts collected by the Master Servicer or a Subservicer under
any such hazard insurance policy (other than amounts to be applied to the
restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or amounts released to the
Mortgagor in accordance with the Master Servicer's or a Subservicer's normal
servicing procedures, the Mortgage Note, the Security Instrument or applicable
law) shall be deposited initially in a Collection Account, for transmittal to
the Payment Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.07.

        (c) Any cost incurred by a Master Servicer or a Subservicer in
maintaining any such hazard insurance policy shall not be added to the amount
owing under the Mortgage Loan for the purpose of calculating monthly
distributions to Bondholders, notwithstanding that the terms of the Mortgage
Loan so permit. Such costs shall be recoverable by the Master Servicer or a
Subservicer out of related late payments by the Mortgagor or out of Insurance
Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds or by the Master Servicer from the Repurchase
Price, to the extent permitted by Section 3.07.

        (d) No earthquake or other additional insurance is to be required of any
Mortgagor or maintained on property acquired with respect to a Security
Instrument other than pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall
at any time be in force and shall require such additional insurance. When, at
the time of origination of the Mortgage Loan or at any subsequent time, the
Mortgaged Property is located in a federally designated special flood hazard
area, the Master Servicer shall use its best reasonable efforts to cause with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property flood insurance (to the
extent available and in accordance with mortgage servicing industry practice) to
be maintained. Such flood insurance shall cover the Mortgaged Property,
including all items taken into account in arriving at the Appraised Value on
which the Mortgage Loan was based, and shall be in an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan and (ii) the
minimum amount required under the terms of coverage to compensate for any damage
or loss on a replacement cost basis, but not more than the maximum amount of
such insurance available for the related Mortgaged Property under either the
regular or emergency programs of the National Flood Insurance Program (assuming
that the area in which such Mortgaged Property is located is participating in
such program). Unless applicable state law requires a higher deductible, the
deductible on such flood insurance may not exceed $1,000 or 1% of the applicable
amount of coverage, whichever is less.


                                       18
<PAGE>

        (e) If insurance has not been maintained complying with Subsections 3.11
(a) and (d) and there shall have been a loss which would have been covered by
such insurance had it been maintained, the Master Servicer shall pay, or cause
the related Subservicer to pay, for any necessary repairs.

        (f) The Master Servicer shall present, or cause the related Subservicer
to present, claims under any applicable Primary Insurance Policy or the related
hazard insurance or flood insurance policy.

        (g) The Master Servicer shall obtain and maintain at its own expense and
for the duration of this Servicing Agreement and shall cause each Subservicer to
obtain and maintain a blanket fidelity bond and an errors and omissions
insurance policy covering such Person's officers, employees and other persons
acting on its behalf in connection with its activities under this Servicing
Agreement or the related Subservicing Agreement. The amount of coverage shall be
at least equal to the coverage maintained by the Master Servicer acceptable to
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to service loans for it or otherwise in an amount as
is commercially available at a cost that is generally not regarded as excessive
by industry standards. The Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Indenture
Trustee of any material change in the terms of such bond or policy. The Master
Servicer shall provide annually to the Indenture Trustee a certificate of
insurance that each such bond and policy are in effect. If any such bond or
policy ceases to be in effect, the Master Servicer shall, to the extent
possible, give the Indenture Trustee ten days' notice prior to any such
cessation and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a comparable
replacement bond or policy, as the case may be. Any amounts relating to the
Mortgage Loans collected under each such bond or policy shall be deposited
initially in a Collection Account for transmittal to the Payment Account,
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.07.

        Section 3.12 Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption Agreements. (a) In any case
in which the Master Servicer is notified by any Mortgagor or Subservicer that a
Mortgaged Property relating to a Mortgage Loan has been or is about to be
conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Master Servicer shall enforce, or shall instruct
such Subservicer to enforce, any due-on-sale clause contained in the related
Security Instrument to the extent permitted under the terms of the related
Mortgage Note and by applicable law. The Master Servicer or the related
Subservicer may repurchase a Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price when the
Master Servicer requires acceleration of the Mortgage Loan, but only if the
Master Servicer is satisfied, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered
to the Indenture Trustee, that either (i) such Mortgage Loan is in default or
default is reasonably foreseeable or (ii) if such Mortgage Loan is not in
default or default is not reasonably foreseeable, such repurchase will have no
adverse tax consequences for the Trust Estate or any Securityholder. If the
Master Servicer reasonably believes that such due-on-sale clause cannot be
enforced under applicable law or if the Mortgage Loan does not contain a
due-on-sale clause, the Master Servicer is authorized, and may authorize any
Subservicer, to consent to a conveyance subject to the lien of the Mortgage, and
to take or enter into an assumption agreement from or with the Person to whom
such property has been or is about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such Person
becomes liable under the related Mortgage Note and unless prohibited by
applicable state law, such Mortgagor remains liable thereon, on condition,
however, that the related Mortgage Loan shall continue to be covered by a hazard
policy and (if so covered before the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer
enters into such agreement) by any Primary Insurance Policy. In connection with
any such assumption, no material term of the related Mortgage Note may be
changed. The Master Servicer shall forward to the Indenture Trustee the original
copy of such assumption agreement, which copy shall be added by the Indenture
Trustee to


                                       19
<PAGE>

the related Mortgage File and which shall, for all purposes, be considered a
part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and
instruments constituting a part thereof. A portion, equal to up to 2% of the
Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, of any fee or additional
interest collected by the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer for
consenting in any such conveyance or entering into any such assumption agreement
may be retained by the related Subservicer as additional servicing compensation.

        (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision of
this Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be deemed to be in
default, breach or any other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of
any assumption of a Mortgage Loan by operation of law or any conveyance by the
Mortgagor of the related Mortgaged Property or assumption of a Mortgage Loan
which the Master Servicer reasonably believes it may be restricted by law from
preventing, for any reason whatsoever or if the exercise of such right would
impair or threaten to impair any recovery under any applicable insurance policy.

        Section 3.13 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans. (a) The Master
Servicer shall, or shall direct the related Subservicer to, foreclose upon or
otherwise comparably convert the ownership of properties securing any Mortgage
Loans that come into and continue in default and as to which no satisfactory
arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments pursuant to
Section 3.06, except that the Master Servicer shall not, and shall not direct
the related Subservicer to, foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert a
Mortgaged Property if there is evidence of toxic waste or other environmental
hazards thereon unless the Master Servicer follows the procedures in Subsection
(e) below.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) In connection with such foreclosure or other conversion, the Master
Servicer in conjunction with the related Subservicer, if any, shall use its best
reasonable efforts to preserve REO Property and to realize upon defaulted
Mortgage Loans in such manner (including short sales) as to maximize the receipt
of principal and interest by the Bondholders, taking into account, among other
things, the timing of foreclosure and the considerations set forth in Subsection
3.13(d). The foregoing is subject to the proviso that the Master Servicer shall
not be required to expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or
towards the restoration of any property unless it determines in good faith (i)
that such restoration or foreclosure will increase the proceeds of liquidation
of the Mortgage Loan to Bondholders after reimbursement to itself for such
expenses and (ii) that such expenses will be recoverable to it either through
Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for purposes of
reimbursements from the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.07) or through
Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar priority). The Master
Servicer shall be responsible for all other costs and expenses incurred by it in
any such proceedings; provided, however, that it shall be entitled to
reimbursement thereof (as well as its normal servicing compensation), and in
respect of any Subservicer only, to receive Foreclosure Profits as additional
servicing compensation to the extent that transfers or withdrawals from the
Collection Account with respect thereto are permitted under Section 3.07. Any
income from or other funds (net of any income taxes) generated by REO Property
shall be deemed for purposes of this Servicing Agreement to be Insurance
Proceeds.


                                       20
<PAGE>

        (d) The Trust Estate shall not acquire any real property (or any
personal property incident to such real property) except in connection with a
default or reasonably foreseeable default of a Mortgage Loan. In the event that
the Trust Estate acquires any real property (or personal property incident to
such real property) in connection with a default or imminent default of a
Mortgage Loan, such property shall be disposed of by the Master Servicer (or its
agent) on behalf of the Trust Estate within two years after its acquisition by
the Trust Estate.

        (e) With respect to any Mortgage Loan as to which the Master Servicer or
a Subservicer has received notice of, or has actual knowledge of, the presence
of any toxic or hazardous substance on the Mortgaged Property, the Master
Servicer shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the
Bond Insurer and shall act in accordance with any such directions and
instructions provided by the Bond Insurer, or if a Bond Insurer Default exists,
by the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the Issuer. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence of this Section 3.13(e), with respect to any Mortgage Loan
described in such sentence, the Master Servicer shall, if requested by the Bond
Insurer, obtain and deliver to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Bond
Insurer an environmental audit report prepared by a Person who regularly
conducts environmental audits using customary industry standards, a copy of
which shall be delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee. The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such report pursuant to Section
3.07. If the Bond Insurer or the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, has not
provided directions and instructions to the Master Servicer in connection with
any such Mortgage Loan within 30 days of a request by the Master Servicer for
such directions and instructions, then the Master Servicer shall take such
action as it deems to be in the best economic interest of the Trust Estate
(other than proceeding against the Mortgaged Property) and is hereby authorized
at such time as it deems appropriate to release such Mortgaged Property from the
lien of the related Mortgage. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Master
Servicer shall not obtain on behalf of the Issuer a deed as a result or in lieu
of foreclosure, and shall not otherwise acquire possession of or title to, or
commence any proceedings to acquire possession of or title to, or take any other
action with respect to, any Mortgaged Property, if the Owner Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee could reasonably be considered to be a responsible party for
any liability arising from the presence of any toxic or hazardous substance on
the Mortgaged Property, unless the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee has
been indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction against such liability.

        Section 3.14 Indenture Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.
(a) Upon payment in full of any Mortgage Loan or the receipt by the Master
Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner
customary for such purposes, the Master Servicer will immediately notify the
Indenture Trustee by a certification signed by a Servicing Officer in the form
of the request for release (the "Request for Release") attached hereto as
Exhibit B (which certification shall include a statement to the effect that all
amounts received or to be received in connection with such payment which are
required to be deposited in the Payment Account have been or will be so
deposited) and shall request delivery to the Master Servicer or Subservicer, as
the case may be, of the Mortgage File. Upon receipt of such certification and
request, the Custodian shall release the related Mortgage File to the Master
Servicer or Subservicer and execute and deliver to the Master Servicer, without
recourse, the request for reconveyance, deed of reconveyance or release or
satisfaction of mortgage or such instrument releasing the lien of the Security
Instrument (furnished by the Master Servicer), together with the Mortgage Note
with


                                       21
<PAGE>

written evidence of cancellation thereon. In connection with the satisfaction of
any MOM Loan, the Master Servicer is authorized to cause the removal from the
registration on the MERS(R) System of such Mortgage.

        (b) From time to time as is appropriate, for the servicing or
foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan or collection under an insurance policy, the
Master Servicer may deliver to the Custodian a Request for Release signed by a
Servicing Officer on behalf of the Master Servicer in substantially the form
attached as Exhibit B hereto. Upon receipt of the Request for Release, the
Indenture Trustee shall deliver the Mortgage File or any document therein to the
Master Servicer or Subservicer, as the case may be, as bailee for the Indenture
Trustee.

        (c) The Master Servicer shall cause each Mortgage File or any document
therein released pursuant to Subsection 3.14(b) to be returned to the Indenture
Trustee, when the need therefor no longer exists, and in any event within 21
days of the Master Servicer's receipt thereof, unless the Mortgage Loan has
become a Liquidated Mortgage Loan and the Liquidation Proceeds relating to the
Mortgage Loan have been deposited in the Collection Account or such Mortgage
File is being used to pursue foreclosure or other legal proceedings. Prior to
return of a Mortgage File or any document to the Indenture Trustee, the Master
Servicer, the related insurer or Subservicer to whom such file or document was
delivered shall retain such file or document in its respective control as bailee
for the Indenture Trustee unless the Mortgage File or such document has been
delivered to an attorney, or to a public trustee or other public official as
required by law, to initiate or pursue legal action or other proceedings for the
foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property either judicially or non- judicially, and
the Master Servicer has delivered to the Indenture Trustee a certificate of a
Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and address of the Person to which
such Mortgage File or such document was delivered and the purpose or purposes of
such delivery. If a Mortgage Loan becomes a Liquidated Mortgage Loan, the
Indenture Trustee shall deliver the Request for Release with respect thereto to
the Master Servicer and upon deposit of the related Liquidation Proceeds in the
Collection Account.

        (d) The Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Master
Servicer any court pleadings, requests for trustee's sale or other documents
necessary to (i) the foreclosure or trustee's sale with respect to a Mortgaged
Property; (ii) any legal action brought to obtain judgment against any Mortgagor
on the Mortgage Note or Security Instrument; (iii) obtain a deficiency judgment
against the Mortgagor; or (iv) enforce any other rights or remedies provided by
the Mortgage Note or Security Instrument or otherwise available at law or
equity. Together with such documents or pleadings the Master Servicer shall
deliver to the Indenture Trustee a certificate of a Servicing Officer in which
it requests the Indenture Trustee to execute the pleadings or documents. The
certificate shall certify and explain the reasons for which the pleadings or
documents are required. It shall further certify that the Indenture Trustee's
execution and delivery of the pleadings or documents will not invalidate any
insurance coverage under the insurance policies or invalidate or otherwise
affect the lien of the Security Instrument, except for the termination of such a
lien upon completion of the foreclosure or trustee's sale.

        Section 3.15 Master Servicing Compensation. (a) As compensation for its
activities hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive the
Servicing Fee from full payments of accrued interest on each Mortgage Loan. The
Master Servicer shall be solely responsible for paying any and all fees with


                                       22
<PAGE>

respect to a Subservicer and the Trust Estate shall not bear any fees, expenses
or other costs directly associated with any Subservicer.

        (b) The Master Servicer or the related Subservicer may retain additional
servicing compensation in the form of prepayment charges, if any, a portion of
the assumption fees up to 2% of the Stated Principal Balance of the related
Mortgage Loan, tax service fees, fees for statement of account or payoff, late
payment charges, or otherwise, to the extent such fees are collected from the
related Mortgagors or, with respect to a Liquidated Mortgage Loan, to the extent
such fees have accrued. The Master Servicer shall be required to pay all
expenses it incurs in connection with servicing activities under this Servicing
Agreement and shall not be entitled in connection with servicing activities
under this Servicing Agreement to reimbursement except as provided in this
Servicing Agreement. Expenses to be paid by the Master Servicer under this
Subsection 3.15(b) shall include payment of the expenses of the accountants
retained pursuant to Section 3.17.

        (c) The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
shall be entitled to receive, as additional servicing compensation, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and the related Mortgage Notes and Mortgages,
any late payment charges or late fees, demand fees, assumption fees, loan
modification fees, extension fees, consent fees, beneficiary statement charges,
or similar items, in each case to the extent received with respect to any
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.

        Furthermore, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its
behalf, shall be entitled to receive, as additional servicing compensation, a
Workout Fee; provided, however, that the Master Servicer, or any Special
Servicer acting on its behalf, shall not enter into any workout arrangement with
respect to any Multifamily Loan which will result in a Workout Fee without the
consent of the Bond Insurer. If any Corrected Mortgage Loan again becomes a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, any right to the Workout Fee with respect to
such Mortgage Loan earned in connection with the initial modification,
restructuring or workout thereof shall terminate, and the Master Servicer, or
any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall be entitled to a new Workout
Fee for such Mortgage Loan upon resolution or workout of the subsequent event of
default under such Mortgage Loan. If the Master Servicer, or any Special
Servicer acting on its behalf, is terminated for any reason hereunder it shall
retain the right to receive any Workout Fees payable in respect of any Mortgage
Loans which became Corrected Mortgage Loans during the period that it acted as
Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable (and the successor Master
Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall not be entitled to any
portion of such Workout Fees), in each case until the Workout Fees for any such
Mortgage Loan ceases to be payable in accordance with this paragraph.

        (d) In addition to other servicing compensation provided for in this
Agreement, and not in lieu thereof, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer
acting on its behalf, shall be entitled to (i) the Disposition Fee payable out
of certain Liquidation Proceeds prior to the deposit of the Liquidation Proceeds
in the Collection Account and (ii) a fee of 0.25% of the unpaid balance of any
Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loan relating to any REO Property repurchased from the
Trust Fund pursuant to Section 2.03.


                                       23

        Section 3.16 Annual Statements of Compliance. No later than March 1 of
each year, commencing in March 2004, the Master Servicer at its own expense
shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee, with a copy to the Bond Insurer and the
Rating Agencies, an Officer's Certificate stating, as to the signer thereof,
that (i) a review of the activities of the Master Servicer during the preceding
calendar year and of performance under this Servicing Agreement has been made
under such officer's supervision, (ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Master Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations
under this Servicing Agreement for such year, or, if there has been a default in
the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to
such officer and the nature and status thereof including the steps being taken
by the Master Servicer to remedy such default; (iii) a review of the activities
of each Subservicer during the Subservicer's most recently ended calendar year
on or prior to December 31 of the preceding year and its performance under its
Subservicing Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision; and (iv)
to the best of the Servicing Officer's knowledge, based on his review and the
certification of an officer of the Subservicer (unless the Servicing Officer has
reason to believe that reliance on such certification is not justified), either
each Subservicer has performed and fulfilled its duties, responsibilities and
obligations under this Servicing Agreement and its Subservicing Agreement in all
material respects throughout the year, or, if there has been a default in
performance or fulfillment of any such duties, responsibilities or obligations,
specifying the nature and status of each such default known to the Servicing
Officer. Copies of such statements shall be provided by the Master Servicer to
the Bondholders upon request or by the Indenture Trustee at the expense of the
Master Servicer should the Master Servicer fail to provide such copies.

        Section 3.17 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report.
(a) No later than March 1 of each year, commencing in March 2004, the Master
Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants
who are members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and
who are KPMG LLP (or a successor thereof) or are otherwise acceptable to the
Bond Insurer to furnish a statement to the Master Servicer, which will be
provided to the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Rating Agencies, to
the effect that, in connection with the firm's examination of the Master
Servicer's financial statements as of the end of the preceding calendar year,
nothing came to their attention that indicated that the Master Servicer was not
in compliance with Sections 3.06, 3.07 and 3.08 except for (i) such exceptions
as such firm believes to be immaterial and (ii) such other exceptions as are set
forth in such statement.

        (b) No later than March 1 of each year, commencing in March 2004, the
Master Servicer, at its expense, shall or shall cause each Subservicer to cause
a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants to
furnish to the Master Servicer or such Subservicer a report stating that (i) it
has obtained a letter of representation regarding certain matters from the
management of the Master Servicer or such Subservicer which includes an
assertion that the Master Servicer or such Subservicer has complied with certain
minimum mortgage loan servicing standards (to the extent applicable to
residential mortgage loans) identified in the Uniform Single Attestation Program
for Mortgage Bankers established by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America
with respect to the servicing of first and second lien conventional single
family mortgage loans during the most recently completed calendar year and (ii)
on the basis of an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
such representation is fairly stated in all material respects, subject to such
exceptions and other qualifications that may be appropriate. Immediately upon
receipt of such


                                       24
<PAGE>

report, the Master Servicer shall or shall cause each Subservicer to furnish a
copy of such report to the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Rating
Agencies.

        Section 3.18 Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans. The Master
Servicer may, on behalf of the Issuer, but is not obligated to, repurchase from
the Issuer any Mortgage Loan delinquent in payment for a period of 90 days or
longer for a price equal to the Repurchase Price therefor. In addition, the
Master Servicer must repurchase any Mortgage Loan which does not satisfy the
requirements of 3.01(d) at a price equal to the Repurchase Price. Any such
purchase shall be accomplished as provided in Subsection 2.03 hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture Trustee, whether acting as
Indenture Trustee or in the capacity of successor Master Servicer, shall have no
obligation hereunder or under any other Basic Document to repurchase any
Mortgage Loan.

        Section 3.19 Information Required by the Internal Revenue Service
Generally and Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged Property.
The Master Servicer shall prepare and deliver all federal and state information
reports when and as required by all applicable state and federal income tax
laws. In particular, with respect to the requirement under Section 6050J of the
Code to the effect that the Master Servicer or Subservicer shall make reports of
foreclosures and abandonments of any mortgaged property for each year beginning
in 2003, the Master Servicer or Subservicer shall file reports relating to each
instance occurring during the previous calendar year in which the Master
Servicer (i) acquires an interest in any Mortgaged Property through foreclosure
or other comparable conversion in full or partial satisfaction of a Mortgage
Loan, or (ii) knows or has reason to know that any Mortgaged Property has been
abandoned. The reports from the Master Servicer or Subservicer shall be in form
and substance sufficient to meet the reporting requirements imposed by Section

Section 6050P of the Code (reports relating to cancellation of indebtedness).

        Section 3.20 Realization Upon Multifamily Loans. (a) With respect to any
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer
on its behalf, shall determine, in accordance with the servicing standards
herein, whether to grant a modification, waiver or amendment of the terms of
such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (subject to the limitations contained in
Section 3.12), commence foreclosure proceedings or attempt to sell such
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan with reference to which course of action is
reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis
with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.

        (b) In connection with any foreclosure or other acquisition, the Master
Servicer shall pay the costs and expenses in any such proceedings as a Servicing
Advance. If the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, elects
to proceed with a non-judicial foreclosure in accordance with the laws of the
state where the related Mortgaged Property is located, the Master Servicer, or
any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall not be required to pursue a deficiency
judgment against the related Mortgagor or any other liable party if the laws of
such state do not permit such a deficiency judgment after a non-judicial
foreclosure or if the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf,
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that, if a deficiency judgment is
obtained, the likely recovery will not be sufficient to warrant the cost, time,
expense and/or exposure of pursuing such a deficiency judgment.


                                       25

        In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be issued to the Indenture Trustee, or to its nominee (which shall not
include the Master Servicer or any Special Servicer) or a separate trustee or
co-trustee on behalf of the Indenture Trustee, as Indenture Trustee for the
Bondholders. Notwithstanding any such acquisition of title and cancellation of
the related Multifamily Loan, such Multifamily Loan shall (except for purposes
of Section 8.01 of the Trust Agreement) be considered to be a Mortgage Loan held
in the Trust Fund until such time as the related REO Property shall be sold by
the Trust Fund and the Stated Principal Balance of each Multifamily Loan
relating to an REO Property shall be reduced by any REO Proceeds allocated to
principal. Consistent with the foregoing, for purposes of all calculations
hereunder, so long as such Multifamily Loan shall be considered to be an
Outstanding Mortgage Loan:

               (i) it shall be assumed that, notwithstanding that the
        indebtedness evidenced by the related Mortgage Note shall have been
        discharged, such Mortgage Note and, for purposes of determining the
        Stated Principal Balance thereof, the related amortization schedule in
        effect at the time of any such acquisition of title, remain in effect;
        and

               (ii) REO Proceeds received in any month shall be deemed to be
        treated first, as a recovery of any related and unreimbursed Servicing
        Advances and, if applicable, unpaid Liquidation Expenses; second, as a
        recovery of accrued and unpaid interest on the related Multifamily Loan
        related to the REO Property to, but not including, the Due Date in the
        Due Period of receipt; third, as a recovery of principal of the related
        Multifamily Loan related to the REO Property to the extent of its entire
        unpaid principal balance; and fourth, as a recovery of any other amounts
        deemed to be due and owing in respect of the related Multifamily Loan
        related to the REO Property.

        (c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
shall not, on behalf of the Trust Fund, obtain title to a Mortgaged Property as
a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise obtain title to any direct or
indirect partnership interest or other equity interest in any Mortgagor pledged
pursuant to a pledge agreement and thereby be the beneficial owner of a
Mortgaged Property, and shall not otherwise acquire possession of, or take any
other action with respect to, any Mortgaged Property if, as a result of any such
action, the Indenture Trustee, for the Trust Fund or the Bondholders, would be
considered to hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of, or to be an
"owner" or "operator" of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended from time to time, or any comparable law, unless the Master Servicer, or
any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, has previously determined in
accordance with the servicing standards herein, based on an updated Phase I
Environmental Assessment report prepared (not more than 12 months prior to the
taking of such action) by a Qualified Environmental Consultant, that:

               (A) the Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable
        environmental laws and regulations or, if not, that taking such actions
        as are necessary to bring the Mortgaged Property into compliance
        therewith is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a
        present value basis than not taking such actions, and


                                       26
<PAGE>

               (B) there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property
        relating to the use, management or disposal of any Hazardous Materials
        for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or
        remediation could be required under any applicable federal, state or
        local law or regulation, or that, if any such Hazardous Materials are
        present for which such action could be required, after consultation with
        a Qualified Environmental Consultant, taking such actions with respect
        to the Mortgaged Property is reasonably likely to produce a greater
        recovery on a present value basis than not taking such actions.

        In the event that the Phase I Environmental Assessment first obtained or
updated by the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
with respect to a Mortgaged Property indicates that such Mortgaged Property may
not be in compliance with applicable environmental laws or that Hazardous
Materials may be present but does not definitively establish such fact, the
Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall cause such
further environmental tests as the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer
acting on its behalf, shall deem prudent to protect the interests of Bondholders
to be conducted by a Qualified Environmental Consultant. Any such tests shall be
deemed part of the Phase I Environmental Assessment obtained by the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, for purposes of this
Section 3.20. The Master Servicer shall pay for the cost of preparation of such
Phase I Environmental Assessments as well as the cost of any remedial,
corrective or other further action contemplated by clauses (A) and/or (B) of
this Section 3.20(c) as a Servicing Advance, unless such Advance would be a
Nonrecoverable Advance.

        (d) The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall
report to the IRS and to the related Mortgagor, in the manner required by
applicable law, the information required to be reported regarding any Mortgaged
Property which is abandoned or foreclosed. The Master Servicer, or any Special
Servicer acting on its behalf, shall deliver a copy of any such report to the
Indenture Trustee.

        Section 3.21 Title and Management of REO Properties Related to
Multifamily Loans. (a) In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property related
to a Multifamily Loan is acquired for the benefit of Bondholders in foreclosure
or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of the Indenture Trustee, or its nominee (which shall not
include the Master Servicer or any Special Servicer), or a separate trustee or
co-trustee, on behalf of the Trust Fund and the Bondholders. The Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall maintain accurate records
with respect to each related REO Property reflecting the status of taxes,
assessments and other similar items that are or may become a lien on such REO
Property and the status of insurance premiums payable with respect thereto.

        (b) The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall
have full power and authority, subject only to the specific requirements and
prohibitions of this Agreement, to do any and all things in connection with any
REO Property as are consistent with the servicing standards herein, all on such
terms and for such period as the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its
behalf, deems to be in the best interests of Bondholders, and, in connection
therewith, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall
agree to the payment of management fees that are consistent with general market
standards. The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall
segregate and hold all revenues received by it with respect to any REO Property
separate and apart from its own funds and general assets and shall


                                       27
<PAGE>

establish and maintain with respect to any REO Property a segregated custodial
account (each, an "REO Account"), each of which shall be an Eligible Account and
shall be entitled "Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as indenture trustee,
in trust for the registered holders of IMH Assets Corp., Collateralized
Asset-Backed Bonds, Series 2003-1, REO Account." The Master Servicer, or any
Special Servicer on its behalf, shall be entitled to any interest or investment
income earned on funds deposited in an REO Account to the extent provided in
Section 3.06(d). The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf,
shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the related REO Account within two
Business Days after receipt all REO Proceeds received by it with respect to any
REO Property, and shall withdraw therefrom funds necessary for the proper
operation, management and maintenance of such REO Property, including:

        (i) all insurance premiums and ground rents, if any, due and payable in
        respect of such REO Property;

        (ii) all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such REO
        Property and such other Mortgaged Properties that may result in the
        imposition of a lien thereon; and

        (iii) all costs and expenses necessary to protect, maintain, manage,
        operate, repair and restore such REO Property.

        To the extent that such REO Proceeds are insufficient for the purposes
set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above, the Master Servicer shall make an
Advance equal to the amount of such shortfall unless the Master Servicer
determines, in its good faith judgment, that such Advance would be a
Nonrecoverable Advance. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement
of such Advances (with interest) made pursuant to the preceding sentence, to the
extent permitted pursuant to Section 3.07. The Master Servicer, or any Special
Servicer on its behalf shall remit to the Master Servicer, from each REO Account
for deposit in the Collection Account on a monthly basis prior to the third
Business Day prior to the related Payment Date the REO Proceeds received or
collected from the related REO Property, except that in determining the amount
of such REO Proceeds, the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its
behalf, may retain in such REO Account reasonable reserves for repairs,
replacements and necessary capital improvements and other related expenses.

        Section 3.22 Sale of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Related REO
Properties. (a) The Master Servicer shall appoint itself as Special Servicer or
shall enter into (or have in place) a Subservicing Agreement with a Special
Servicer (other than the Master Servicer) to service each Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan. With respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or related
REO Property which the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf,
has determined to sell in accordance with Section 3.20 or otherwise, the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall deliver to the Indenture
Trustee and the Bond Insurer an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the
Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, has determined to sell
such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property in accordance with this
Section 3.22. The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, will
give the Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer not less than 10 Business Days'
prior written notice of its intention to sell any Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan or REO Property. The Repurchase Price for any Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan or REO Property purchased under this Section 3.22(a) shall be deposited
into the Collection Account, and the Indenture Trustee, upon receipt of an
Officers' Certificate


                                       28
<PAGE>

from the Master Servicer to the effect that such deposit has been made, shall
release or cause to be released the related Mortgage File, and shall execute and
deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without
recourse, representation or warranty as shall be provided to it and are
reasonably necessary to vest in the ownership of such Multifamily Loan or REO
Property. In connection with any such purchase, the Master Servicer, or any
Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall deliver the related servicing file
to the Person effecting such purchase.

        (b) If any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property is not
purchased as described in the first sentence of Section 3.21(a) within 10
Business Days of the Indenture Trustee having received notice in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 3.22(a) above, then either the Special Servicer or the
Master Servicer, in that order, may, at its option, within 10 Business Days
after the expiration of such 10 Business Day period, purchase (or designate an
Affiliate thereof to purchase) such Mortgage Loan or REO Property out of the
Trust Fund at a cash price equal to the Repurchase Price. The Repurchase Price
for any such Mortgage Loan or REO Property purchased under this Section 3.22(b)
shall be deposited into the Collection Account, and the Indenture Trustee, upon
receipt of an Officers' Certificate from the Master Servicer to the effect that
such deposit has been made, shall release or cause to be released to the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer (or the designated Affiliate thereof), as
applicable, the related Mortgage File, and shall execute and deliver such
instruments of transfer or assignments, in each case without recourse,
representation or warranty as shall be provided to it and are reasonably
necessary to vest in the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (or the
designated Affiliate thereof),as applicable, the ownership of such Mortgage Loan
or REO Property. In connection with any such purchase by the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer, if any, shall deliver the related servicing file to the
Master Servicer.

        (c) The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
may offer to sell to any Person (including the Depositor, the Master Servicer
and any Special Servicer) any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property
not otherwise purchased pursuant to Section 3.22(a) or 3.22(b) if and when the
Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, determines,
consistent with the servicing standards herein, that such a sale would be in the
best economic interests of the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer (as a collective
whole). The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall
give the Indenture Trustee not less than 10 Business Days prior written notice
of its intention to sell such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property,
in which case the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
shall accept any offer received from any Person that is determined by the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, to be a fair cash price,
as determined in accordance with Section 3.22(b), for such Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan or REO Property if the offeror is a Person other than the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, or an Affiliate thereof,
or is determined to be such a price by an independent appraiser if the offeror
is the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, or an
Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that any offer by an Interested Person in
the amount of the Repurchase Price shall be deemed to be a fair cash price.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Indenture Trustee
in its individual capacity nor any of its Affiliates, may make an offer to
purchase or purchase any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property
pursuant hereto. In addition, in the event that the Master Servicer, or any
Special Servicer acting on its behalf, receives more than one fair offer with
respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property, the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, may accept an offer that
is not the highest fair cash offer if it determines, in accordance with the
servicing


                                       29
<PAGE>

standards herein, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests
of the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer (for example, if the prospective buyer
making the lower cash offer is more likely to perform its obligations, or the
terms offered by the prospective buyer making the lower cash offer are more
favorable). The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf,
shall use its best efforts in accordance with the servicing standards herein, to
sell any REO Property no later than the day prior to the Determination Date
immediately prior to the Final Scheduled Payment Date.

        (d) In determining whether any offer received represents a fair price
for any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property, the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall be entitled to
engage and may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or
other expert in real estate matters retained by the Master Servicer, or any
Special Servicer acting on its behalf, the cost of which shall be advanced as a
Servicing Advance, unless such Servicing Advance would be a Nonrecoverable
Advance. In determining whether any offer constitutes a fair price for any
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property, the Master Servicer, or
any Special Servicer acting on its behalf (or, if applicable, such
appraiser)shall take into account, and any appraiser or other expert in real
estate matters shall be instructed to take into account, any appraisal obtained
and, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any
delinquency on such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the physical (including
environmental) condition of the related Mortgaged Property or such REO Property,
the state of the local economy and the Trust Fund's obligation to dispose of any
REO Property within the time period specified in Section 3.21(a).

        (e) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.21, the Master Servicer, or
any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, shall act on behalf of the Trust Fund
and the Bond Insurer in negotiating and taking any other action necessary or
appropriate in connection with the sale of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan
or REO Property, including the collection of all amounts payable in connection
therewith. Any sale of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property
shall be without recourse to, or representation or warranty by, the Indenture
Trustee, the Depositor, the Bond Insurer, the Master Servicer, any Special
Servicer or the Trust Fund (except that any contract of sale and assignment and
conveyance documents may contain customary warranties of title and condition, so
long as the only recourse for breach thereof is to the Trust Fund), and, if such
sale is consummated in accordance with the duties of the Master Servicer, any
Special Servicer, the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms
of this Servicing Agreement, no such Person who so performed shall have any
liability to the Trust Fund or any Bondholder with respect to the purchase price
therefor accepted by the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer acting on its
behalf.

        (f) Liquidation Proceeds related to any such sale shall be promptly, and
in any event within one Business Day following receipt thereof, deposited in the
Collection Account in accordance with Section 3.06(d).

        Section 3.23 Transfer of Servicing Between Master Servicer and Special
Servicer; Record Keeping. (a) Upon determining that any Multifamily Loan has
become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall immediately
give notice thereof, together with a copy of the related Mortgage File, to a
Special Servicer and shall use its best efforts to provide such Special Servicer
with all information, documents but excluding the original documents
constituting such Mortgage File) and records


                                       30
<PAGE>

(including records stored electronically on computer tapes, magnetic discs and
the like) relating to such Multifamily Loan and reasonably requested by the
Special Servicer to enable it to assume its duties hereunder with respect
thereto without acting through a Subservicer. The Master Servicer shall use its
best efforts to comply with the preceding sentence within five Business Days of
the date such Multifamily Loan became a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and in
any event shall continue to act as Master Servicer and administrator of such
Multifamily Loan (i) if the Master Servicer does not exercise such discretion or
(ii) until the Special Servicer has commenced the servicing of such Multifamily
Loan, which shall occur upon the receipt by the Special Servicer of the
information, documents and records referred to in the preceding sentence. No
later than 10 Business Days before the Master Servicer is required to deliver a
copy of the Mortgage File to the Special Servicer, it shall review the Mortgage
File and request from the Indenture Trustee any material documents that it is
aware are missing from the Mortgage File to the extent that the Indenture
Trustee has such documents. With respect to each Multifamily Loan that becomes a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall instruct the related
Mortgagor to continue to remit all payments in respect of such Mortgage Loan to
the Master Servicer. Upon determining that a Multifamily Loan is no longer a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall immediately give
notice thereof to the Master Servicer and upon giving such notice, the Special
Servicer's obligation to service such Multifamily Loan shall terminate and the
obligations of the Master Servicer to service and administer such Multifamily
Loan as a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall
resume.

        (b) In servicing any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special
Servicer shall provide to the Indenture Trustee originals of documents included
within the definition of "Mortgage File" for inclusion in the related Mortgage
File (to the extent such documents are in the possession of the Special
Servicer) and copies of any additional related Mortgage Loan information,
including correspondence with the related Mortgagor, and the Special Servicer
shall provide copies of the foregoing to the Master Servicer, including, without
limitation, electronic data and/or files in CMSA IRP format.

        (c) The Master Servicer shall maintain ongoing payment records with
respect to each of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and shall provide any
Special Servicer with any information reasonably required by the Special
Servicer to perform its duties under this Agreement. Any Special Servicer shall
provide the Master Servicer with any information the Master Servicer reasonably
requires to perform its duties under this Agreement.

        (d) In the event that the Special Servicer is required under the terms
of this Agreement to service, or perform any of its duties hereunder with
respect to, a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the
Master Servicer shall provide the Special Servicer with a copy of any document
contained in the Mortgage File that is necessary for the Special Servicer to
perform any of its duties hereunder. Upon request, the Master Servicer shall
provide the Special Servicer, at the Special Servicer's expense, with a copy of
any document contained in the Mortgage File that is not currently necessary for
the Special Servicer to perform its duties hereunder.

        Section 3.24 Inspections. Commencing in 2003, the Master Servicer (or,
with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and the related REO
Properties, any Special Servicer) shall, with respect to each Multifamily Loan,
inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property (i) when the
Master Servicer determines that it is prudent to conduct such an inspection,
(ii) with respect to any


                                       31
<PAGE>

Multifamily Loan with a Stated Principal Balance of greater than $1,000,000, at
least once every year and (ii) with respect to any Multifamily Loan with a
Stated Principal Balance of less than or equal to $1,000,000, at least once
every two years. Promptly after a Multifamily Loan becomes a Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan (and in any event within 60 days thereafter), the Master Servicer,
or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall inspect the Mortgaged Property. The
annual inspections will be done at the expense of the servicer performing the
inspection. The inspection done at the time a Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan will be an expense of the Trust Fund. The Master Servicer
and any Special Servicer shall each prepare or cause to be prepared as soon as
reasonably possible a written report of each such inspection and shall deliver a
copy of such report (which may be in electronic format) to the Bond Insurer and
each Rating Agency within 15 days after the preparation thereof.

        Section 3.25 Available Information and Notices. Upon request, the Master
Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall promptly furnish to each
Rating Agency, the Bond Insurer and the Indenture Trustee (in written or
electronic format) annual reports of each Mortgagor with respect to the net
operating income and occupancy rates required to be delivered by the related
Mortgagor and actually received by the Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer
on its behalf, with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, to the extent
that delivery of such items is consistent with applicable law and the related
Mortgage Loan documents. Upon request, the Master Servicer, or any Special
Servicer on its behalf, shall promptly furnish to each Rating Agency, the Bond
Insurer and the Indenture Trustee (in written or electronic format) all rent
rolls and sales reports with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, to
the extent they are delivered by the related Mortgagor to the Master Servicer,
or any Special Servicer on its behalf, and to the extent that delivery of such
items is consistent with applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan documents.
The Master Servicer, or any Special Servicer on its behalf, shall promptly
notify each Rating Agency, the Bond Insurer and the Indenture Trustee if it
obtains knowledge of any material uninsured damage to a Mortgaged Property that
relates to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. In addition to the other reports
and information made available and distributed pursuant to other provisions of
this Agreement, the Master Servicer and any Special Servicer shall, in
accordance with such reasonable rules and procedures as it may adopt, also make
available any information relating to the Multifamily Loans and the related
Mortgaged Properties or the related Mortgagors for review by the Bond Insurer,
the Depositor, the Rating Agencies and the Indenture Trustee. The Master
Servicer and any Special Servicer acting on its behalf, as the case may be, will
also make such information available to any Person that is a Bondholder or
potential Bondholder.

                              Servicing Certificate

        Section 4.01 Remittance Reports. On the Business Day following each
Determination Date, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee a
report, prepared as of the close of business on the Determination Date (the
"Remittance Report"), in the form of a magnetic tape or disk or such other
method as to which the Master Servicer and Indenture Trustee shall agree. The
Remittance Report and any written information supplemental thereto shall include
such information with respect to the Mortgage Loans that is reasonably available
to the Master Servicer and that is required by the Indenture Trustee for
purposes of making the calculations and providing the reports referred to in the
Indenture, as set forth in written specifications or guidelines issued by the
Indenture Trustee from time to time.

        In addition, prior to each Payment Date, the Master Servicer shall
determine the total amount of Realized Losses, if any, that resulted from any
Cash Liquidation, Debt Service Reduction, Deficient Valuation or REO Disposition
that occurred during the related Collection Period. The amount of each Realized
Loss shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Indenture
Trustee with the related Remittance Report.

        The determination by the Master Servicer of such amounts shall, in the
absence of obvious error, be presumptively deemed to be correct for all purposes
hereunder and the Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee shall be protected in
relying upon the same without any independent check or verification. The
Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation to recompute, recalculate or verify
any information provided to it by the Master Servicer.

        Section 4.02 Reserved.

        Section 4.03 Reserved.

        Section 4.04 Advances. If any Monthly Payment on a Mortgage Loan that
was due on the immediately preceding Due Date or due during the related
Collection Period and delinquent on the Determination Date is delinquent other
than as a result of application of the Relief Act, the Master Servicer will
deposit in the Collection Account not later than the third Business Day
immediately preceding the related Payment Date an amount equal to such Monthly
Payment net of the related Servicing Fee for such Mortgage Loan, except to the
extent the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer determines any such
advance to be nonrecoverable from Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or
future payments on any Mortgage Loan. Subject to the foregoing and in the
absence of such a determination, the Master Servicer shall continue to make such
advances through the date that the related Mortgaged Property has, in the
judgment of the Master Servicer, been completely liquidated. No later than the
fourth Business Day preceding each Payment Date, the Master Servicer shall
present an Officer's Certificate to the Indenture Trustee and the Bond Insurer
with respect to the Mortgage Loans, (i) stating that the Master Servicer elects
not to make an Advance in a stated amount and (ii) detailing the reason it deems
the advance to be a


                                       33

Nonrecoverable Advance. The Master Servicer will include in the Remittance
Report a list of each Mortgage Loan for which it does not make an Advance in
accordance with this Section.

        Such Advances may be made in whole or in part from funds in the
Collection Account being held for future distribution or withdrawal on or in
connection with Payment Dates in subsequent months. Any funds being held for
future distribution to Securityholders and so used shall be replaced by the
Master Servicer from its own funds by deposit in the Collection Account on or
before the fourth Business Day preceding any Payment Date to the extent that
funds in the Collection Account with respect to such Payment Date shall be less
than payments to Securityholders required to be made on such date.

        Section 4.05 Compensating Interest Payments. The Master Servicer shall
deposit in the Collection Account not later than the third Business Day
preceding the Payment Date an amount equal to the Compensating Interest for the
related Determination Date. The Master Servicer shall not be entitled to any
reimbursement of any Compensating Interest payment.

        Section 4.06 Exchange Act Reporting. (a) The Indenture Trustee and the
Master Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the Issuer and the Depositor in
connection with the Trust's satisfying the reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act. The Indenture Trustee shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any
Forms 8-K and 10-K customary for similar securities as required by the Exchange
Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder, and the Master
Servicer shall sign (or shall cause another entity acceptable to the Commission
to sign) and the Indenture Trustee shall file (via the Commission's Electronic
Data Gathering and Retrieval System) such forms on behalf of the Depositor or
Issuer (or such other entity). The Depositor and the Issuer hereby grant to the
Indenture Trustee a limited power of attorney to execute any Form 8-K and file
each such document on behalf of the Depositor and the Issuer. Such power of
attorney shall continue until the earlier of (i) receipt by the Indenture
Trustee from the Depositor and the Issuer of written termination of such power
of attorney and (ii) the termination of the Trust. Notwithstanding anything
herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the Master Servicer, and not the
Indenture Trustee, shall be responsible for executing each Form 10-K filed on
behalf of the Trust.

        (b) Each Form 8-K shall be filed by the Indenture Trustee within 15 days
after each Distribution Date, with a copy of the statement to the
Certificateholders for such Distribution Date as an exhibit thereto. Prior to
March 30th of each year (or such earlier date as may be required or permitted by
the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission), the Indenture
Trustee shall file a Form 10-K, in substance as required by applicable law or
applicable Commission staff's interpretations. The Indenture Trustee shall
prepare the Form 10-K and provide the Master Servicer with the Form 10-K no
later than March 20th of each year. The Master Servicer shall execute such Form
10-K upon its receipt and shall provide the original of such executed Form 10-K
to the Indenture Trustee no later than March 25th of each year. Such Form 10-K
shall include as exhibits the Master Servicer's annual statement of compliance
described under Section 3.16 and the accountant's report described under Section
3.17, in each case to the extent they have been timely delivered to the
Indenture Trustee. If they are not so timely delivered, the Indenture Trustee
shall file an amended Form 10-K including such documents as exhibits reasonably
promptly after they are delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture
Trustee shall have no liability with respect to any failure to properly prepare
or file such periodic reports resulting from or relating to the Indenture
Trustee's inability or failure to obtain any information not resulting from its
own


                                       34

negligence or willful misconduct. The Form 10-K shall also include a
certification in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 (the "Certification"),
in compliance with Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and any
additional directives of the Commission, which shall be signed by the senior
officer of the Master Servicer in charge of securitization.

        (c) In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall sign a certification (in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2) for the benefit of the Master Servicer
and its officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain aspects of items 1
through 3 of the Certification (provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee
shall not undertake an analysis of any accountant's report attached as an
exhibit to the Form 10-K).

        (d) In addition, (i) the Indenture Trustee shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Master Servicer and the Depositor and their officers, directors and
Affiliates from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs
and expenses arising out of or based upon a breach of the Indenture Trustee's
obligations under this Section 4.06 caused by the Indenture Trustee's
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith, and (ii)
the Master Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indenture Trustee, the
Master Servicer, the Issuer and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs
and expenses arising out of or based upon a breach of the Master Servicer's
obligations under this Section 4.06 or the Master Servicer's negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith. If (i) the indemnification
provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Master
Servicer, then the Indenture Trustee agrees that it shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by the Master Servicer as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities of the Master Servicer in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Master Servicer on the one hand
and the Indenture Trustee on the other in connection with a breach of the
Indenture Trustee's obligations under this Section 4.06 caused by the Indenture
Trustee's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith
and (ii) the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient
to hold harmless the Indenture Trustee, then the Master Servicer agrees that it
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indenture Trustee as a
result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Indenture Trustee in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indenture
Trustee on the one hand and the Master Servicer on the other in connection with
a breach of the Master Servicer's obligations under this Section 4.06 or the
Master Servicer's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection
therewith.

        (e) In the event the Commission permits separate or split certifications
to be made with respect to the items currently contained in the Certification,
the Indenture Trustee shall provide a certification with respect to items 1 and
2 and the Master Servicer shall provide a certification with respect to items 3,
4 and 5 contained within the Certification, in each case substantially in the
form of the Certification attached as Exhibit C-1, or other form as indicated by
the Commission for this purpose. In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall sign a
certification (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-3) for the benefit of
the Master Servicer and its officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain
aspects of item 3 of the Certification (provided, however, that the Indenture
Trustee shall not undertake an analysis of any accountant's report attached as
an exhibit to the Form 10-K).

        (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Basic Documents, the
provisions of this Section 4.06 may be amended by the Master Servicer, the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee without the consent of the Securityholders.

        (g) Prior to January 30th of the first year in which the Indenture
Trustee is able to do so under applicable law, the Indenture Trustee shall file
with the Commission a Form 15D Suspension Notification with respect to the
Trust.

                               The Master Servicer

        Section 5.01 Liability of the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall
be liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations
specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the Master Servicer herein.

        Section 5.02 Merger or Consolidation of or Assumption of the Obligations
of the Master Servicer. Any corporation into which the Master Servicer may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Master
Servicer shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the
Master Servicer, shall be the successor of the Master Servicer, hereunder,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding;
provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person to the Master Servicer
shall be qualified to sell mortgage loans to and service mortgage loans for
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

        The Master Servicer may assign its rights and delegate its duties and
obligations under this Servicing Agreement; provided, that the Person accepting
such assignment or delegation shall be a Person which is qualified to service
mortgage loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee (as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans) and the
Company (in its sole discretion) and the Bond Insurer, is willing to service the
Mortgage Loans and executes and delivers to the Indenture Trustee and the
Company an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Bond
Insurer, the Indenture Trustee and the Company, which contains an assumption by
such Person of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant
and condition to be performed or observed by the Master Servicer under this
Servicing Agreement; provided, further, that each Rating Agency's rating of the
Class 1-A-1 Bonds and Class 2-A-1 Bonds without regard to the Bond Insurance
Policy or the Class 1-B-1 Bonds in effect immediately prior to such assignment
and delegation will not be qualified, reduced, or withdrawn as a result of such
assignment and delegation (as evidenced by a letter to such effect from each
Rating Agency) or considered to be below investment grade.

        Section 5.03 Limitation on Liability of the Master Servicer and Others.
Neither the Master Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or employees or
agents of the Master Servicer shall be under any liability to the Company, the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Bondholders for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith
pursuant to this Servicing Agreement, provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Master Servicer or any such Person against any liability
which would otherwise be imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence in the performance of its duties hereunder or by reason of
its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. The Master
Servicer and any director or officer or employee or agent of the Master Servicer
may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed
and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Master
Servicer and any director or officer or employee or agent of the Master Servicer
shall be indemnified by the Company and held harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred in connection with any legal action relating to


                                       37
<PAGE>

this Servicing Agreement or the Bonds, including any amount paid to the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 5.06(b), other than any
loss, liability or expense related to any specific Mortgage Loan or Mortgage
Loans (except as any such loss, liability or expense shall be otherwise
reimbursable pursuant to this Servicing Agreement) and any loss, liability or
expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of its duties hereunder or by reason of its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. The Master Servicer
shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal
action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage Loans in
accordance with this Servicing Agreement, and which in its opinion may involve
it in any expense or liability; provided, however, that the Master Servicer may
in its sole discretion undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or
desirable in respect of this Servicing Agreement, and the rights and duties of
the parties hereto and the interests of the Securityholders hereunder. In such
event, the reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action and any liability
resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Company, and
the Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor. The Master
Servicer's right to indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 5.03
shall survive any resignation or termination of the Master Servicer pursuant to
Section 5.04 or 6.01 with respect to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities
arising prior to such resignation or termination (or arising from events that
occurred prior to such resignation or termination).

        Section 5.04 Master Servicer Not to Resign. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.02, the Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and
duties hereby imposed on it except (i) upon determination that the performance
of its obligations or duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law or (ii) upon satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) the
Master Servicer has proposed a successor servicer to the Company, the Bond
Insurer and the Indenture Trustee in writing and such proposed successor
servicer is reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Indenture Trustee; and
(b) each Rating Agency shall have delivered a letter (obtained by and at the
expense of the Master Servicer) to the Company, the Bond Insurer and the
Indenture Trustee prior to the appointment of the successor servicer stating
that the proposed appointment of such successor servicer as Master Servicer
hereunder will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the then current
rating of the Bonds or the then current rating of the Bonds without taking into
account the Bond Insurance Policy; and (c) such proposed successor servicer is
acceptable to the Bond Insurer, as evidenced by a letter to the Company and the
Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that no such resignation by the Master
Servicer shall become effective until such successor servicer or, in the case of
(i) above, the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans, shall have
assumed the Master Servicer's responsibilities and obligations hereunder or
another successor Master Servicer has been appointed in accordance with Section
6.02. Any such resignation shall not relieve the Master Servicer of
responsibility for any of the obligations specified in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 as
obligations that survive the resignation or termination of the Master Servicer.
The Master Servicer shall have no claim (whether by subrogation or otherwise) or
other action against any Bondholder or the Bond Insurer for any amounts paid by
the Master Servicer pursuant to any provision of this Servicing Agreement. Any
such determination permitting the resignation of the Master Servicer shall be
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Indenture
Trustee and the Bond Insurer.

        Section 5.05 Delegation of Duties. In the ordinary course of business,
the Master Servicer at any time may delegate any of its duties hereunder to any
Person, including any of its Affiliates, who agrees to conduct such duties in
accordance with standards comparable to those with which the Master Servicer


                                       38
<PAGE>

complies pursuant to Section 3.01. Such delegation shall not relieve the Master
Servicer of its liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such duties and
shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 5.04.

        Section 5.06 Master Servicer to Pay Indenture Trustee's and Owner
Trustee's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Master Servicer covenants
and agrees to pay to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and any co-trustee
of the Indenture Trustee from time to time, and the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and any such co-trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation
(which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) for all services rendered by each
of them in the execution of the trusts created under the Trust Agreement, the
Indenture or any other Basic Document and in the exercise and performance of any
of the powers and duties under the Trust Agreement or the Indenture, as the case
may be, of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and any co-trustee of the
Indenture Trustee, and the Master Servicer will pay or reimburse (i) the
Indenture Trustee and any co-trustee upon request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Indenture Trustee or any
co-trustee of the Indenture Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of
this Servicing Agreement or any other Basic Document except any such expense,
disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith and (ii)
the Owner Trustee upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances incurred or made by the Owner Trustee in accordance with any of the
provisions of this Servicing Agreement except any such expense, disbursement or
advance as may arise from its willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith
or grossly negligent failure to act.

        (b) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Indenture Trustee and
the Owner Trustee for, and to hold the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee,
as the case may be, harmless against, any claim, tax, penalty, loss, liability
or expense of any kind whatsoever, incurred without negligence (gross negligence
in the case of the Owner Trustee) or willful misconduct on its part, arising out
of, or in connection with, the failure by the Master Servicer to perform its
duties in compliance with this Servicing Agreement, including the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself
against any claim in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers or duties under any Basic Document, provided that:

               (i) with respect to any such claim, the Indenture Trustee or
        Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall have given the Master Servicer
        written notice thereof promptly after the Indenture Trustee or Owner
        Trustee, as the case may be, shall have actual knowledge thereof, it
        being understood that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the
        Master Servicer of its indemnification obligations hereunder;

               (ii) while maintaining control over its own defense, the Company,
        the Indenture Trustee or Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall
        cooperate and consult fully with the Master Servicer in preparing such
        defense; and

               (iii) notwithstanding anything in this Servicing Agreement to the
        contrary, the Master Servicer shall not be liable for settlement of any
        claim by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner


                                       39
<PAGE>

        Trustee, as the case may be, entered into without the prior consent of
        the Master Servicer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        (c) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Owner Trustee for, and
to hold the Owner Trustee, harmless against, any claim, tax, penalty, loss,
liability or expense of any kind whatsoever, in connection with the Owner
Trustee's duties under any of the Basic Documents, except to the extent that
such claim, tax, penalty, loss liability or expense is (i) caused by the Owner
Trustee's own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith or grossly
negligent failure to act or (ii) incurred as a result of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 6.03 of the Trust Agreement
expressly made by the Owner Trustee.

        (d) No termination of this Servicing Agreement or the resignation or
removal of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee shall affect the
obligations created by this Section 5.06 of the Master Servicer to indemnify the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee under the conditions and to the extent
set forth herein. This section shall survive the termination of this Servicing
Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Master Servicer. Any amounts to
be paid by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Subsection may not be paid from
the Trust Estate.

        Collection Account or Payment Account any deposit required to be made
        under the terms of this Servicing Agreement, including any Advances and
        Compensating Interest (other than Servicing Advances), which continues
        unremedied for a period of one (1) Business Day after the date upon

        Servicer by the Company, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or to the
        Master Servicer, the Company, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee by

               (ii) Failure on the part of the Master Servicer duly to observe
        or perform in any material respect any other covenants or agreements of
        the Master Servicer (including Servicing Advances) set forth in the
        Bonds or in this Servicing Agreement, which failure, in each case,
        materially and adversely affects the interests of Bondholders and which
        continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which
        written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, and
        stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, shall have
        been given to the Master Servicer by the Company, the Issuer or the
        Indenture Trustee; or

               (iii) The entry against the Master Servicer of a decree or order

        Master Servicer) or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, to pay when
        due any amount payable by it under the terms of the Insurance Agreement
        which continues unremedied for a period of three (3) Business Days after
        the date upon which written notice of such failure shall have been given
        to the Seller (so long as the Seller is the Master Servicer) or the
        Master Servicer, as the case may be; or

               (vi) Failure on the part of the Seller or the Master Servicer to
        duly perform in any material respect any covenant or agreement set forth
        in the Insurance Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for a

        Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy) after the date on which written notice of
        such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given

        Percentage for the Group 2 Loans is in excess of 18%.

then, (a) and in every such case, other than that set forth in (v), (vi) or
(vii) hereof, so long as a Servicing Default shall not have been remedied by the
Master Servicer, either the Issuer, subject to the direction of the Indenture
Trustee as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans, with the consent of the Bond Insurer,
or the Bond Insurer, or if a Bond Insurer Default exists, the holders of at
least 51% of the aggregate Bond Principal Balance of each Class of Bonds, by
notice then given in writing to the Master Servicer (and to the Indenture
Trustee and the Issuer if given by the Bond Insurer) or (b) in the case of the
events set forth in (v), (vi) or (vii) hereof, the Bond Insurer, or if a Bond
Insurer Default exists, the holders of at least 51% of the aggregate Bond
Principal Balance of each Class of Bonds may, by notice to the Master Servicer,
terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer as servicer
under this Servicing Agreement other than its right to receive servicing
compensation and expenses for servicing the Mortgage Loans hereunder during any
period prior to the date of such termination and the Issuer, subject to the
direction of the Indenture Trustee as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans, with the
consent of the Bond Insurer, or the Bond Insurer may exercise any and all other
remedies available at law or equity; provided, however, that the successor to
the Master Servicer appointed pursuant to Section 6.02 shall have accepted the
duties of Master Servicer effective upon the resignation or termination of the
Master Servicer. Any such notice to the Master Servicer shall also be given to
each Rating Agency, the Bond Insurer, the Company and the Issuer. On or after
the receipt by the Master Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Master Servicer under this Servicing Agreement, whether with
respect to the Bonds or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be
vested in the Indenture Trustee, pursuant to and under this Section 6.01; and,
without limitation, the Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or
otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish
all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of each
Mortgage Loan


                                       42
<PAGE>

and related documents, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto and the Securityholders by their acceptance of any Security, acknowledge
and agree that there will be a period of transition before the actual servicing
functions can be fully transferred to the Indenture Trustee, as successor Master
Servicer, or to a successor Master Servicer appointed by the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to the provisions hereof, provided, that the Indenture Trustee shall
use its reasonable best efforts to succeed to the actual servicing functions or
find a successor Master Servicer as soon as possible but no later than 90 days
after such termination. The Master Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
Indenture Trustee in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and
rights of the Master Servicer hereunder, including, without limitation, the
transfer to the Indenture Trustee or the successor Master Servicer for
administration by it of (i) the property and amounts which are then or should be
part of the Trust Fund or which thereafter become part of the Trust Estate; (ii)
originals or copies of all documents of the Master Servicer reasonably requested
by the Indenture Trustee to enable it to assume the Master Servicer's duties
thereunder; (iii) the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer under the
Subservicing Agreements with respect to the Mortgage Loans; (iv) all cash
amounts which shall at the time be deposited by the Master Servicer or should
have been deposited to the Collection or the Payment Account or thereafter be
received with respect to the Mortgage Loans; and (v) all costs or expenses
associated with the complete transfer of all servicing data and the completion,
correction or manipulation of such servicing data as may be required by the
Indenture Trustee or any successor Master Servicer to correct any errors or
insufficiencies in the servicing data or otherwise to enable the Indenture
Trustee or successor Master Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans properly and
effectively. All reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the succession as Master Servicer,
including amending this Servicing Agreement to reflect such succession as Master
Servicer pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be paid by the predecessor Master
Servicer (or if the predecessor Master Servicer is the Indenture Trustee, the
initial Master Servicer) upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such
costs and expenses, and if not so paid by the predecessor Master Servicer, shall
be reimbursed by the Trust pursuant to Section 6.07 of the Indenture.

        Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of the Master Servicer
hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive, out of any late
collection of a payment on a Mortgage Loan which was due prior to the notice
terminating the Master Servicer's rights and obligations hereunder and received
after such notice, that portion to which the Master Servicer would have been
entitled pursuant to Sections 3.07 and 3.15 as well as its Master Servicing Fee
in respect thereof, and any other amounts payable to the Master Servicer
hereunder the entitlement to which arose prior to the termination of its
activities hereunder.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance
under Section 6.01(i) after the applicable grace periods specified in such
Section, shall not constitute a Servicing Default if such delay or failure could
not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the Master Servicer
and such delay or failure was caused by an act of God or the public enemy, acts
of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion or sabotage,
epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or
similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve the Master Servicer
from using reasonable efforts to perform its respective obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Master
Servicer shall provide the Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the
Bondholders with notice of such failure or delay by it, together with a
description of its efforts to so perform


                                       43
<PAGE>

its obligations. The Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Indenture
Trustee, the Bond Insurer and the Owner Trustee in writing of any Servicing
Default.

        Section 6.02 Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. Within
90 days of the time the Master Servicer receives a notice of termination
pursuant to Section 6.01 or sends a notice pursuant to clause (i) of Section
5.04, the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer,
or other successor appointed in accordance with this Section 6.02, shall be the
successor in all respects to the Master Servicer in its capacity as servicer
under this Servicing Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for
herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities
relating thereto placed on the Master Servicer by the terms and provisions
hereof, including but not limited to the provisions of Article VIII. Nothing in
this Servicing Agreement shall be construed to permit or require the Indenture
Trustee or any other successor Master Servicer to (i) succeed to the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the initial Master Servicer in its
capacity as the Seller under the Mortgage Loan Sale and Contribution Agreement,
(ii) be responsible or accountable for any act or omission of the Master
Servicer prior to the effectiveness of the Master Servicer's termination
hereunder, (iii) require or obligate the Indenture Trustee, in its capacity as
successor Master Servicer, to purchase, repurchase or substitute any Mortgage
Loan, (iv) fund any losses on any Eligible Investment directed by any other
Master Servicer, or (v) be responsible for the representations and warranties of
the Master Servicer, except as provided herein; provided, however, that the
Indenture Trustee, as successor Master Servicer, shall be required to make any
Advances to the extent that the Master Servicer failed to make such Advances, to
the extent such Advance is not determined by the Indenture Trustee to be
nonrecoverable. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to such compensation as the Master Servicer would have been entitled to
hereunder if no such notice of termination had been given. Notwithstanding the
above, (i) if the Indenture Trustee is unwilling to act as successor Master
Servicer, or (ii) if the Indenture Trustee is legally unable so to act, the
Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer may (in the
situation described in clause (i)) or shall (in the situation described in
clause (ii)) appoint or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint
any established housing and home finance institution, bank or other mortgage
loan servicer having a net worth of not less than $10,000,000 as the successor
to the Master Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the
responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer hereunder;
provided that the appointment of any such successor Master Servicer shall be
acceptable to the Bond Insurer, as evidenced by the Bond Insurer's prior written
consent and provided further that the appointment of any such successor Master
Servicer will not result in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the
ratings assigned to the Class 1-A-1 Bonds and Class 2-A-1 Bonds without regard
to the Bond Insurance Policy or the Class 1- B-1 Bonds by the Rating Agencies.
Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder, unless the
Indenture Trustee is prohibited by law from so acting or is unwilling to act as
such, the Indenture Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.
In connection with such appointment and assumption, the successor shall be
entitled to receive compensation out of payments on Mortgage Loans in an amount
equal to the compensation which the Master Servicer would otherwise have
received pursuant to Section 3.15 (or such lesser compensation as the Indenture
Trustee and such successor shall agree). The appointment of a successor Master
Servicer shall not affect any liability of the predecessor Master Servicer which
may have arisen under this Servicing Agreement prior to its termination as
Master Servicer (including, without limitation, the obligation to purchase
Mortgage Loans pursuant to Section 3.01, to pay any deductible under an
insurance policy pursuant to Section 3.11 or to indemnify the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 5.06), nor shall


                                       44
<PAGE>

any successor Master Servicer be liable for any acts or omissions of the
predecessor Master Servicer or for any breach by such Master Servicer of any of
its representations or warranties contained herein or in any related document or
agreement. The Indenture Trustee, the Custodian and such successor shall take
such action, consistent with this Servicing Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession.

        In connection with the termination or resignation of the Master Servicer
hereunder, either (i) the successor Master Servicer, including the Indenture
Trustee if the Indenture Trustee is acting as successor Master Servicer, shall
represent and warrant that it is a member of MERS in good standing and shall
agree to comply in all material respects with the rules and procedures of MERS
in connection with the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are registered with
MERS, in which case the predecessor Master Servicer shall cooperate with the
successor Master Servicer in causing MERS to revise its records to reflect the
transfer of servicing to the successor Master Servicer as necessary under MERS'
rules and regulations, or (ii) the predecessor Master Servicer shall cooperate
with the successor Master Servicer in causing MERS to execute and deliver an
assignment of Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to
the Indenture Trustee and to execute and deliver such other notices, documents
and other instruments as may be necessary or desirable to effect a transfer of
such Mortgage Loan or servicing of such Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R) System to
the successor Master Servicer. The predecessor Master Servicer shall file or
cause to be filed any such assignment in the appropriate recording office. The
predecessor Master Servicer shall bear any and all fees of MERS, costs of
preparing any assignments of Mortgage, and fees and costs of filing any
assignments of Mortgage that may be required under this Section 6.02. The
successor Master Servicer shall cause such assignment to be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee promptly upon receipt of the original with evidence of
recording thereon or a copy certified by the public recording office in which
such assignment was recorded.

        (b) Any successor, including the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the
Bondholders, to the Master Servicer as servicer shall during the term of its
service as servicer (i) continue to service and administer the Mortgage Loans
for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Bond Insurer, (ii) maintain in
force a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and omissions in the
performance of its obligations as Master Servicer hereunder and a fidelity bond
in respect of its officers, employees and agents to the same extent as the
Master Servicer is so required pursuant to Section 3.11(g).

        (c) Any successor Master Servicer, including the Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the Bondholders, shall not be deemed to be in default or to have
breached its duties hereunder if the predecessor Master Servicer shall fail to
deliver any required deposit to the Collection Account or otherwise cooperate
with any required servicing transfer or succession hereunder.

        (d) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, in no event
shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for any servicing fee or any differential
in the amount of the servicing fee paid hereunder and the amount necessary to
induce any successor Servicer to act as a successor Servicer under this
Servicing Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein.

        Section 6.03 Notification to Bondholders. Upon any termination or
appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer pursuant to this Article VI or
Section 5.04, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt


                                       45
<PAGE>

written notice thereof to the Bondholders, the Owner Trustee, the Bond Insurer,
the Company, the Issuer and each Rating Agency.

        Section 6.04 Waiver of Defaults. The Indenture Trustee shall transmit by
mail to all Bondholders and the Bond Insurer, within 10 days after the
occurrence of any Servicing Default known to the Indenture Trustee, unless such
Servicing Default shall have been cured, notice of each such Servicing Default
hereunder known to a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee. The Bond
Insurer, or if a Bond Insurer Default exists, the holders of at least 51% of the
aggregate Bond Principal Balance of the Bonds may waive any default by the
Master Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and the
consequences thereof, except a default in the making of or the causing to be
made any required distribution on the Bonds. Upon any such waiver of a past
default, such default shall be deemed to cease to exist, and any Servicing
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been timely remedied for every
purpose of this Servicing Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the
extent expressly so waived. The Master Servicer shall give notice of any such
waiver to the Rating Agencies.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         Duties of the Master Servicer

        Section 8.01 Administrative Duties. (a) Duties with Respect to the
Indenture. The Master Servicer shall perform all its duties and the duties of
the Issuer under the Indenture. In addition, the Master Servicer shall consult
with the Owner Trustee as the Master Servicer deems appropriate regarding the
duties of the Issuer under the Indenture. The Master Servicer shall monitor the
performance of the Issuer and shall advise the Owner Trustee when action is
necessary to comply with the Issuer's duties under the Indenture. The Master
Servicer shall prepare for execution by the Issuer or shall cause the
preparation by other appropriate Persons of all such documents, reports,
filings, instruments, certificates and opinions as it shall be the duty of the
Issuer to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to the Indenture. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall take all necessary action that is the
duty of the Issuer to take pursuant to the Indenture.

        (b) Duties with Respect to the Issuer.

               (i) In addition to the duties of the Master Servicer set forth in
        this Servicing Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, the Master
        Servicer shall perform such calculations and shall prepare for execution
        by the Issuer or the Owner Trustee or shall cause the preparation by
        other appropriate Persons of all such documents, reports, filings,
        instruments, certificates and opinions as it shall be the duty of the
        Issuer or the Owner Trustee to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to this
        Servicing Agreement or any of the Basic Documents or under state and
        federal tax and securities laws, and at the request of the Owner
        Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Bond Insurer shall take all
        appropriate action that it is the duty of the Issuer to take pursuant to
        this Servicing Agreement or any of the Basic Documents. In accordance
        with the directions of the Issuer, the Bond Insurer or the Owner
        Trustee, the Master Servicer shall administer, perform or supervise the
        performance of such other activities in connection with the Bonds
        (including the Basic Documents) as are not covered by any of the
        foregoing provisions and as are expressly requested by the Issuer, the
        Indenture Trustee, the Bond Insurer or the Owner Trustee.

               (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Servicing Agreement or any
        of the Basic Documents to the contrary, the Master Servicer shall be
        responsible for promptly notifying the Owner Trustee and the Bond
        Insurer in the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the Issuer's
        payments (or allocations of income) to an Owner (as defined in the Trust
        Agreement) as contemplated in Section 5.03 of the Trust Agreement. Any
        such notice shall be in writing and specify the amount of any
        withholding tax required to be withheld by the Owner Trustee pursuant to
        such provision.

               (iii) In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its other
        obligations under this Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer may
        enter into transactions with or otherwise deal with any of its
        Affiliates; provided, however, that the terms of any such transactions
        or dealings shall be


                                       50
<PAGE>

        in accordance with any directions received from the Issuer and shall be,
        in the Master Servicer's opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer in any
        material respect than with terms made available to unrelated third
        parties.

        (c) Tax Matters. The Master Servicer shall prepare, on behalf of the
Owner Trustee, financial statements and such annual or other reports of the
Issuer as are necessary for the preparation by the Indenture Trustee of tax
returns and information reports as provided in Section 5.03 of the Trust
Agreement, including, without limitation, Form 1099.

        (d) Non-Ministerial Matters. With respect to matters that in the
reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer are non-ministerial, the Master
Servicer shall not take any action pursuant to this Article VIII unless within a
