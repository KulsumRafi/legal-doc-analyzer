<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
purposes of the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan") for eligible employees of Infinity Broadcasting Corporation ("Corporation") and its
subsidiaries (the Corporation and its subsidiaries severally and collectively referred to in the Plan as the "Company") are to foster and promote the long-term financial success of the
Company and materially increase stockholder value by: (i)&nbsp;attracting and retaining employees of outstanding ability; (ii)&nbsp;strengthening the Company's capability to develop, maintain and
direct a high performance team; (iii)&nbsp;motivating employees, by means of performance-related incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iv)&nbsp;providing incentive
compensation opportunities competitive with those of other major companies; and (v)&nbsp;enabling employees to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Administration</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will be administered by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation ("Committee") which will consist of two or more members. The members will be appointed by the
Board of Directors, and any vacancy on the Committee will be filled by the Board of Directors or in a manner authorized by the Board. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee will have the sole and complete authority: (i)&nbsp;to select in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.3 persons who will
participate in the Plan ("Participant" or "Participants") (including the right to delegate authority to select Participants); (ii)&nbsp;to make Awards and payments in such forms and amounts as it
may determine (including the right to delegate authority to make Awards within limits approved from time to time by the Committee); (iii)&nbsp;to impose such limitations, restrictions, terms and
conditions upon such Awards as the Committee or its authorized delegates deems appropriate; (iv)&nbsp;to interpret the Plan and the terms of any document relating to the Plan and to adopt, amend and
rescind administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (v)&nbsp;to amend or cancel an existing Award in whole or in part (including the right to delegate authority
to amend or cancel an existing Award in whole or in part within limits approved from time to time by the Committee), except that the Committee and its authorized delegates may not, unless otherwise
provided in the Plan, or unless the Participant affected thereby consents, take any action under this clause that would adversely affect the rights of such Participant with respect to the Award, and
except that the Committee and its authorized delegates may not, unless otherwise provided in the Plan, take any action to amend any outstanding Option under the Plan in order to decrease the Option
Price under such Option; and (vi)&nbsp;to make all other determinations and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the interpretation, implementation and administration of the Plan.
The Committee's determinations on matters within its authority will be conclusive and binding upon the Company and all other persons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Participants
selected by the Committee (or its authorized delegates) must be Eligible Persons, as defined below. "Eligible Persons" are persons who are employees of the Company or its parent
corporation(s) or their subsidiaries ("Employee" or "Employees"). Eligible Persons will also include
independent contractors of the Company as to an Award if the person is an independent contractor at the time the Award is granted. In making this selection and in determining the form and amount of
Awards, the Committee may give consideration to the functions and responsibilities of the Eligible Person, his or her past, present and potential contributions to the Company and such other factors as
the Committee deems relevant. </FONT></P>

(ii)&nbsp;Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") and Participant Limited Stock Appreciation Rights ("Participant Limited Rights"), as described in Article&nbsp;II; (iii)&nbsp;Performance Awards

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Shares Subject to the Plan</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Shares

Stock"), or "Formula Value Stock" as defined in Section&nbsp;8.12(d) (Common Stock and Formula Value Stock severally and collectively referred to in the Plan as "Stock"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
maximum number of shares of Stock which may be issued for all purposes under the Plan will be 8,500,000, plus such additional shares as the Board of Directors or the Committee or their respective
delegee may, from time to time, authorize by a resolution or resolutions duly adopted by said Board of Directors or Committee. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>Except
as otherwise provided below, any shares of Stock subject to an Option or other Award which is canceled or terminates without any shares having been issued pursuant thereto having been exercised
will again be available for Awards under the Plan. Shares subject to an Option canceled upon the exercise of an SAR will not again be available for Awards under the Plan except to the extent the SAR
is settled in cash. To the extent that an Award is settled in cash, shares of Stock subject to that Award will again be available for Awards. Shares of Stock tendered by a Participant or withheld by
the Company to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the exercise or vesting of an Award will be available again for Awards under the Plan. Shares of
Restricted Stock forfeited to the Company in accordance with the Plan and the terms of the particular Award will be available again for Awards under the Plan. </FONT></P>

at Fair Market Value as of the date the original Option was exercised, a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of whole shares used by the Participant to exercise the original Option. The
Reload Option will be exercisable only between the date of its grant and the date of expiration of the original Option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
Reload Option will be subject to such additional terms and conditions as the Committee may approve, which terms may provide that the Committee may cancel the Participant's right to receive the
Reload Option and that the Reload Option will be granted only if the Committee has not canceled such right prior to the exercise of the original Option. Such terms may also provide that, upon the
exercise by a Participant of a Reload Option while an Eligible Person, an additional Reload Option will be granted with respect to the number of whole shares used to exercise the first Reload Option. </FONT></P>

Committee may also at any time and from time to time provide for the deferral of delivery of any shares for which the Option may be exercisable until a specified date or dates and subject to terms and
conditions determined by the Committee. </FONT></P>

accelerate the time at which all or any part of the Option may be exercised. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee will establish procedures governing the exercise of Options and will require that notice of exercise be given. Stock purchased on exercise of an Option must be paid for
as follows: (1)&nbsp;in cash or by check (acceptable to the Company in accordance with guidelines established for this purpose), bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; or
(2)&nbsp;if so provided by the Committee: (i)&nbsp;through the delivery of shares of Stock which are then outstanding and which have a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the
exercise price, (ii)&nbsp;by delivery of an unconditional and irrevocable undertaking by a broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price, or (iii)&nbsp;by
any combination of the permissible forms of payment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Unless
the Committee provides otherwise: (a)&nbsp;in the event the Participant is no longer an Eligible Person and ceased to be such as a result of termination of service to the Company with the
consent of the Committee or as a result of his or her death, retirement or disability, each of his or her outstanding Options will be exercisable by the Participant (or his or her legal representative
or designated beneficiary), to the extent that such Option was then exercisable, at any time prior to an expiration date established by the Committee at the time of award, but in no event after such
expiration date; (b)&nbsp;in the event an Award is made to the estate of a person who died while an Employee, each outstanding Option held by such estate will be exercisable by the estate (or the
distributee of said estate) at any time prior to an expiration date established by the Committee at the time of award; and (c)&nbsp;if the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Person for any other
reason, all of the Participant's then outstanding Options will terminate immediately. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
so provided in the Stock Option Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Article&nbsp;VII of the Plan), the Company will have the
right to cancel any portion of the Option (whether vested or nonvested) that remains unexercised on the date the Company exercises its Company Limited Right pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.6 (or the
entire Option if no part of the Option has yet been exercised) in exchange for a payment in cash of an amount equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Option remains unexercised
at the time the Company exercises such right multiplied by the excess of (a)&nbsp;the higher of (x)&nbsp;the Minimum Price Per Share (as defined below), or (y)&nbsp;the highest reported closing
sale price of a share of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange at any time during the period beginning on the sixtieth (60<SUP>th</SUP>) day prior to the date on which the Company
exercises such right and ending on the date on which the Company exercises such right, over (b)&nbsp;the Option Price per share. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;2.6, unless otherwise provided in the relevant Stock Option Agreement, the term "Minimum Price Per Share" will mean the highest gross price (before brokerage
commissions and soliciting dealers' fees) paid or to be paid for a share of Common Stock (whether by way of exchange, conversion, distribution upon liquidation or otherwise) in any Change in Control
which is in effect at any time during the period beginning on the sixtieth (60<SUP>th</SUP>) day prior to the date on which the Company exercises such right and ending on the date on which the
Company exercises such right. For purposes of this definition, if the consideration paid or to be paid in any such Change in Control consists, in whole or in part, of consideration other than cash,
then the Board will take such action as in its judgment it deems appropriate to establish the cash value of such consideration. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company's right to cancel an Option pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.6 may be exercised at any time until the end of the thirtieth (30<SUP>th</SUP>) day following the occurrence of the Change in
Control. </FONT></P>

whole or in part by reference to appreciation in Stock value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, an SAR entitles the Participant to receive, with respect to each share of Stock as to which the SAR is exercised, the excess of the share's Fair Market Value on the date
of exercise over its Fair Market Value on the date the SAR was granted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARs
may be granted in tandem with Options granted under the Plan ("Tandem SARs") or independently of Options ("Independent SARs"). An SAR granted in tandem with an NSO may be granted
either at or after the time the Option is granted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARs
awarded under the Plan will be evidenced by either a Stock Option Agreement (when SARs are granted in tandem with an Option) or a separate written agreement between the Company
and the Participant in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time determine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as otherwise provided herein, a Tandem SAR will be exercisable only at the same time and to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as the Option related thereto is
exercisable, and the Committee may prescribe additional conditions and limitations on the exercise of the SAR. The exercise of a Tandem SAR will cancel the related Option. Tandem SARs may be exercised
only when the Fair Market Value of Stock to which it relates exceeds the Option Price. </FONT></P>

that, if the amount to be received by a Participant in any year is limited pursuant to this provision, payment of all or a portion of the amount that is unpaid as a result of the limitation may be
made to the Participant at a subsequent time. No such limitation will require a Participant to return to the Company any amount theretofore received by him or her upon the exercise of an SAR. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment
of the amount to which a Participant is entitled upon the exercise of an SAR will be made in cash, Stock, or partly in cash and partly in Stock, as the Committee may

Committee. </FONT></P>

there is any change in the Stock and/or the corporate structure of the Company, through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, split up, dividend in
kind or other change in the corporate structure or distribution to the stockholders, appropriate adjustments may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company (or if the Company is not the
surviving
corporation in any such transaction, the board of directors of the surviving corporation) in the aggregate number and kind of shares subject to the Plan, and the number and kind of shares and the
price per share subject to outstanding Options or which may be issued under outstanding Performance Awards or Awards of Restricted Stock. Appropriate adjustments may also be made by the Board of
Directors or the Committee in the terms of any Awards under the Plan to reflect such changes and to modify any other terms of outstanding Awards, including modifications of performance targets and

the United States) be required to be performed at any place or places outside of the United States of America or during usual vacation periods or periods of illness or other incapacity. In the event
that either of the above conditions is applicable (or is applicable as modified by the Committee) and is not fulfilled, the Participant will forfeit all rights to any unexercised Option or SAR, or any
Performance Award or Stock held which has not yet been determined by the Committee to be payable or unrestricted (and any unpaid amounts equivalent to dividends or other distributions or amounts

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The

requirements") with respect to payments made pursuant to the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
the case of an Award pursuant to which Stock may be delivered, the Committee will have the right to require that the Participant or other appropriate person remit to the Company an amount
sufficient to satisfy any applicable statutory withholding requirements, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Committee with regard to such requirements, prior to the delivery of any Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
and to the extent that such withholding is required, the Committee may permit the Participant or such other person to elect at such time and in such manner as the Committee provides to have the
Company hold back from the shares to be delivered, or to deliver to the Company, Stock having a value calculated to satisfy the statutory withholding requirement. In the alternative, the Committee
may, at the time of grant of any such Award, require that the Company withhold from any shares to be delivered Stock with a value calculated to satisfy any applicable statutory tax withholding
requirements. </FONT></P>

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee will be entitled to determine: (i)&nbsp;whether or not any such leave of absence will be treated as if the Participant ceased to be an
Eligible Person; and (ii)&nbsp;the impact, if any, of any such leave of absence on Awards under the Plan. In the event a Participant transfers within the Company, such Participant will not be deemed
