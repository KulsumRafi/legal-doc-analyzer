and shall be subject to any and all conditions and provisions set forth in this
Agreement as it may be amended from time to time. Each Stock Option Schedule shall
incorporate all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall contain such
other terms and conditions that the Committee shall establish for the grant of

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the employment of the

termination of employment shall be terminated and forfeited immediately upon termination
of employment.</FONT></SMALL> </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><SMALL><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 7 below, in the
event the employment of the Optionee is terminated for any reason other than the death
or disability of the Optionee, then any Options granted hereunder that are vested
but unexercised at the time of termination of employment shall terminate
immediately upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the full exercise of the
Options, (ii) the expiration of the Options by their terms, or (iii) 90 days following
the date of termination of such employment of the Optionee.</FONT></SMALL> </P>

terminate immediately upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the full
exercise of the Options, (ii) the expiration of the Options by their terms, or (iii)

Company an amount equal to the &quot;Option Gain&quot; on any Options exercised during
the twelve-month period preceding such Forfeiture Event and any Options exercised
following such Forfeiture Event. For purposes hereof, &quot;Option Gain&quot;

penalties may be sought, (ii) the commission of an act of fraud or

In addition, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to purchase any shares

of enforcing payment of the Option Gain with respect to any shares which have not been
sold or otherwise transferred by the Optionee.</SMALL></FONT> </P>

Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan, part in cash and part in shares, or such
other manner as may be approved by the Committee consistent with the terms of the
Plan as it may be amended from time to time. Shares of Class A Common Stock

which for purposes hereof shall be considered to be the average closing price of the
Company's Class A Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten
trading days just prior to the date of exercise. Only shares of the Company's Class A
