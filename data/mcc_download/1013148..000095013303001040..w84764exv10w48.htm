dispute or claim hereunder, either party shall be entitled to submit the claim
or dispute to binding arbitration to be held in Fairfax County, Virginia, in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration
Association (the &#147;AAA&#148;), before a single arbitrator chosen from an AAA panel of
arbitrators experienced in complex contractual matters who is mutually
agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator,
the parties shall request an odd numbered panel of proposed arbitrators from
the AAA in complex contractual matters, the parties must alternatively strike
one name each from the list of panel members. Unless the parties agree
otherwise, the party selecting first will be determined by the flip of a coin.
The last remaining name will be designated as the sole arbitrator. The
determination of the single arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties and not subject to any appeal or judicial review. An
arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section&nbsp;17 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for the resolution of any such dispute or claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator shall, in addition to making an
award, be entitled to determine that the costs and expenses incurred by the
prevailing party in the arbitration (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees and expenses and the costs of the AAA) be paid by the other
party to the arbitration. Judgment on the decision of the arbitrator may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Executive and Company
hereby (i)&nbsp;irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia located in Fairfax County, Virginia for
this purpose; (ii)&nbsp;waives any right to contest the venue of such courts; or
(iii)&nbsp;to assert that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
