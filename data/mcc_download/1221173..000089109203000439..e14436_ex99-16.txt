            WHEREAS, the Owner has acquired certain first lien fixed and
adjustable rate conventional mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis (the
"Mortgage Loans") originated or acquired by the Servicer;

            WHEREAS, the Owner desires to contract with the Servicer, from time
to time, for the servicing responsibilities associated with the Mortgage Loans
and the Servicer desires to assume the servicing responsibilities to such
Mortgage Loans, from time to time, and the parties desire to provide the terms
and conditions of such servicing by the Servicer; and

            WHEREAS, the Owner desires to sell some or all of the Mortgage Loans
from time to time (a) to one or more third party purchasers in one or more whole
loan pools (each a "Whole Loan Transfer"); or (b) directly or indirectly, to
certain trusts to be formed as part of publicly-issued or privately placed,
rated or unrated, mortgage pass-through transactions (each a "Pass-Through
Transfer"), in any or all cases (subject to the terms of this Agreement)
retaining the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
hereinafter set forth, and for other good and reasonable consideration, the

                         SERVICING OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS

            Section 3.01 Servicer to Service.

            From the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loans to the
related Closing Date, the Servicer shall have serviced the related Mortgage
Loans in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. From and after the
related Closing Date, the Servicer, as an independent contractor, shall service
and administer the Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement and shall have full
power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with
such servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or
desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted
Servicing Practices.

            Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may waive,
modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of
strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any
Mortgagor if in the Servicer's reasonable and prudent determination such waiver,
modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Owner,
provided, however, that the Servicer shall not make any future advances with
respect to a Mortgage Loan and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect
to the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer,
imminent and the Servicer has obtained the prior written consent of the Owner)
the Servicer shall not permit any modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan
that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of
principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance
(except for actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity date on
such Mortgage Loan. With respect to a Reconstitution Agreement, in the event of
any such modification which permits the deferral of interest or principal
payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section 3.04, the difference
between (a) such month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan
Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b)
the amount paid by the Mortgagor. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Servicer shall continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered,
to execute and deliver on behalf of itself and the Owner, all instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all
other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with
respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably required by the Servicer, the
Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents
necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement.

            In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer
shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same
care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, and the Owner's reliance on the Servicer.


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

            Absent written consultation and approval by the Owner, as specified
in this Section 3.01, the Servicer may take actions relative to the servicing
and administration of the Mortgage Loans that are consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices.

            Section 3.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.

            In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not
paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails
to perform any other covenant or obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such
failure continues beyond any applicable grace period, the Servicer shall take
such action as it shall deem to be in the best interest of the Owner, consistent
with any related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy. With respect to any defaulted
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall have the right to review the status of the
related forbearance plan and, subject to the second paragraph of Section 3.01,
may modify such forbearance plan; including extending the Mortgage Loan
repayment date for a period of one year. In connection with a foreclosure or
other conversion, the Servicer shall exercise such rights and powers vested in
it hereunder and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as
prudent mortgage servicers would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct to their own affairs, including, without limitation, advancing funds for
the payment of taxes and insurance premiums. During this period and in the
administration of such defaulted Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall be
responsible for making all customary Servicing Advances.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, in
the event the Servicer has reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property
is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the Owner
otherwise requests an environmental inspection or review of such Mortgaged
Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector, the Servicer shall cause such
inspection to occur. Inspections conducted upon the Owner's request shall be at
the Owner's expense. Upon completion of the inspection, the Servicer shall
promptly provide the Owner with a written report of the environmental
inspection.

            After reviewing the environmental inspection report, the Owner shall
determine how the Servicer shall proceed with respect to the Mortgaged Property.
In the event (a) the environmental inspection report indicates that the
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes
and (b) the Owner directs the Servicer to proceed with foreclosure or acceptance
of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall be reimbursed for all
reasonable costs associated with such foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure and any related environmental clean up costs, as applicable,
from the related Liquidation Proceeds, or if the Liquidation Proceeds are
insufficient to fully reimburse the Servicer, the Servicer shall be entitled to
be reimbursed from amounts in the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.05
hereof. In the event the Owner directs the Servicer not to proceed with
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall
be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances made with respect to the related
Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof.

            Section 3.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

            Continuously from the related Closing Date until the date each
Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to this Agreement, the Servicer shall proceed
diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the
same shall become due and payable and, with respect to Escrow Mortgage Loans
only, shall take special care in ascertaining and estimating Escrow Payments and
all other charges that will become due and payable with respect to the Mortgage
Loans and each related Mortgaged Property, to the end that the installments
payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to pay such charges as and when
they become due and payable.

            Section 3.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account.

            The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to the Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial
Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled "Wells Fargo
Home Mortgage, Inc. in trust for Centre Capital Group, Inc, owner of Fixed and
Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, and various Mortgagors" (provided, in the event
that this Agreement is assigned to a third party, the Custodial Account(s) shall
be reestablished in trust for such Assignee). The Custodial Account shall be
established with a Qualified Depository acceptable to the Owner. Any funds
deposited in the Custodial Account shall at all times be fully insured to the
full extent permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial
Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section 3.05. The
creation of any Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a letter agreement in
the form of Exhibit C hereto. A copy of such letter agreement shall be furnished
to the Owner and, upon request, to any subsequent owner of the Mortgage Loans.

            The Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account within 48 hours
of receipt, and retain therein, the following collections received by the
Servicer and payments made by the Servicer after the related Closing Date, other
than payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-off Date, or
received by the Servicer prior to the Cut-off Date but allocable to a period
subsequent thereto:

            (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage Loans,
      including all Principal Prepayments;

            (ii) any amounts received from the Originator in connection with the
      repurchase of any Mortgage Loan;

            (iii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
      adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

            (iv) all Liquidation Proceeds;

            (v) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be
      deposited pursuant to Section 3.12 (other than proceeds to be held in the
      Escrow Account and applied to the

      restoration and repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
      Mortgagor in accordance with Section 3.17) and Section 3.17;

            (vi) all Condemnation Proceeds that are not applied to the
      restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
      Mortgagor;

            (vii) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial Account
      pursuant to Sections 3.01, 3.10, 4.03, 5.01 or 5.02;

            (viii) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or in part,
      the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the month of
      distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Servicer's own funds,
      without reimbursement therefor up to a maximum amount per month of the
      Servicing Fee actually received for such month for the Mortgage Loans; and

            (ix) any amounts received with respect to or related to any REO
      Property or REO Disposition Proceeds.

            The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account
shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of (a) Servicing Fees which
are payable solely from the interest portion of Monthly Payments, Insurance
Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds, or (b) Ancillary Income,
need not be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial Account. Any interest
paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the depository institution
shall accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the Servicer shall be entitled
to retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial Account pursuant to
Section 3.05. Additionally, any other benefit derived from the Custodial Account
associated with the receipt, disbursement and accumulation of principal,
interest, taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage blanket insurance, etc. shall accrue
to the Servicer.

            Section 3.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

            The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

            (i) to make payments to the Owner in the amounts and in the manner
      provided for in Section 4.01;

            (ii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, in the amount of LPMI Fee, to
      make payments with respect to premiums for LPMI Policies;

            (iii) to reimburse itself for Monthly Advances of the Servicer's
      funds made pursuant to Section 4.03, the Servicer's right to reimburse
      itself pursuant to this subclause (ii) being limited to amounts received
      on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late payments of principal
      and/or interest respecting which any such advance was made, it being
      understood that, in the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's
      right thereto shall be prior to the rights of Owner;


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

            (iv) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing Advances, the
      Servicer's right to reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (iii) with
      respect to any Mortgage Loan (a) being limited to related Liquidation
      Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and such other amounts
      as may be collected by the Servicer from the Mortgagor or otherwise
      relating to the Mortgage Loan and (b) if, after the liquidation of such
      Mortgage Loan, such payments are insufficient to satisfy such unreimbursed
      Servicing Advances then the Servicer may seek reimbursement from other
      amounts in the Custodial Account, it being understood that, in the case of
      any such reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the
      rights of the Owner;

            (v) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the Custodial
      Account and to pay itself the Servicing Fee pursuant to Section 5.01
      hereof;

            (vi) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the
      termination of this Agreement;

            (vii) to transfer funds to another Qualified Depository in
      accordance with Section 3.10 hereof;

            (viii) to pay any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section
      3.18 related to any REO Property, it being understood that in the case of
      any such expenditure or withdrawal related to a particular REO Property,
      the amount of such expenditure or withdrawal from the Custodial Account
      shall be limited to amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account with
      respect to the related REO Property;

            (ix) to invest funds in certain Eligible Investments in accordance
      with Section 3.10 hereof; and

            (x) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

            In the event that the Custodial Account is interest bearing, on each
Remittance Date, the Servicer shall withdraw all funds from the Custodial
Account except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 4.01, the Servicer
is not obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Servicer may use such
withdrawn funds only for the purposes described in this Section 3.05.

            Section 3.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

            The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and
apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand
accounts, titled, "Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. in trust for Centre Capital
Group, Inc., owner of Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, and various
Mortgagors" (provided, in the event that this Agreement is assigned to a third
party, the Escrow Account(s) shall be reestablished in trust for such Assignee).
The Escrow Accounts shall be established with a Qualified Depository in a manner
that shall provide maximum available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in
the Escrow Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section
3.07. The creation of any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

letter agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereto. A copy of such letter
agreement shall be furnished to the Owner and, upon request, to any subsequent
owner of the Mortgage Loans.

            The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts within
48 hours of receipt, and retain therein:

            (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage Loans,
      for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as required
      under the terms of this Agreement; and

            (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation
      Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair of any
      Mortgaged Property.

            The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 3.07. The Servicer shall retain any interest paid on funds deposited in
the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than interest on
escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the extent
required by law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

            Section 3.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

            Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the
Servicer only:

            (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
      water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium charges, fire and
      hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting Escrow Payments for
      the related Mortgage;

            (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advance made by the
      Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage Loan, but only from amounts
      received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late collections of
      Escrow Payments thereunder;

            (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in excess of
      the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan;

            (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to reduce
      the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of
      the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

            (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
      Property in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 3.16;

            (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the extent required
      by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account;


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

            (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the termination
      of this Agreement; and

            (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

            Section 3.08 Notification of Adjustments.

            With respect to each ARM Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall adjust
the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related interest rate adjustment date and
shall adjust the Monthly Payment on the related mortgage payment adjustment
date, if applicable, in compliance with the requirements of applicable law and
the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The Servicer shall execute and deliver
any and all necessary notices required under applicable law and the terms of the
related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding the Mortgage Interest Rate and
Monthly Payment adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon written request
therefor, deliver to the Owner, at the Owner's expense, such notifications and
any additional applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used
to calculate and implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer
or the receipt of notice from the Owner that the Servicer has failed to adjust a
Mortgage Interest Rate or Monthly Payment in accordance with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, the Servicer shall immediately deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused
the Owner thereby.

            Section 3.09 Completion and Recordation of Assignment of Mortgage.

            To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Assignments
of Mortgage is subject to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real
property records in all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which
any or all of the Mortgaged Properties are situated, and in any other
appropriate public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation to be
effected at the CCGI's expense at the direction of the Owner. At the Owner's
direction and expense (provided that CCGI shall be responsible only for such
expenses with respect to the first set of Assignments of Mortgages prepared and
recorded after the related Closing Date), the Servicer shall cause the
endorsements on the Mortgage Note, the Assignment of Mortgage, and the
assignment of security agreement to be completed. Notwithstanding the transfer
of rights pursuant to any Assignments of Mortgage, CCGI shall remain liable for
the expenses associated with the preparation, endorsement and recordation with
respect to the first set of Assignments of Mortgages prepared and recorded after
the related Closing Date.

            Section 3.10 Protection of Accounts.

            The Servicer may transfer the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to time. Such transfer
shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the Owner, which consent shall
not be withheld unreasonably, provided, however, if the Owner does not respond
within 10 days after receipt of request for consent, the Owner shall have been
deemed to consent to such transfer.

            The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by
the Owner because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account are not demand
deposit accounts and/or money market accounts.


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

            Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account may at the option of the
Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments; provided that in the event that
the depository institution with which the Custodial Account or Escrow Account is
maintained at any time fails to qualify as a Qualified Depository, the Servicer
shall be obligated to invest any amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or
the Escrow Account which exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the
"Insured Amount") in Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such
excess amount becomes present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account.
Any such Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date
next following the date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if
such Eligible Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository that
maintains the Custodial Account, then such Eligible Investment may mature on
such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible Investment shall be made in the name of
the Servicer in trust for the benefit of the Owner. All income on or gain
realized from any such Eligible Investment shall be for the benefit of the
Servicer and may be withdrawn at any time by the Servicer. Any losses incurred
in respect of any such investment shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,
by the Servicer out of its own funds immediately as realized.

            Section 3.11 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

            With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall maintain
accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become a lien upon
the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy and LPMI Policy premiums and
fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all
bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and shall
effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date,
employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which
shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts sufficient
for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. The Servicer
assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills, shall
effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each Mortgagor's
faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the Escrow
Payments, and shall make advances from its own funds to effect such payments.
With regard to Non-Escrow Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices to determine that any such
payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first became due and shall
insure that the Mortgaged Property is not lost to a tax lien as a result of
nonpayment and that such Mortgage is not left uninsured and shall make advances
from its own funds to effect any such delinquent payments to avoid the lapse of
insurance coverage on the Mortgaged Property or to avoid the imposition of a tax
lien.

            Section 3.12 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

            The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan
hazard insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured
by a generally acceptable insurer rated B:III or better in the current Best's
Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage
and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property
is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) 100% of
the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and
(ii) the greater of (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan
and (b) an amount


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or
the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.

            If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged
Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood
Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood
insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier rated B:III or better
in Best's in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the
minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any
damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the
mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the type of building
insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the
term of the Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable
law and pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located
in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is
covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related
Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if
said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within
forty-five (45) days after such notification, the Servicer shall immediately
force place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

            If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project, the
Servicer shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Servicer promptly of any change
in the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have
a material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

            The Servicer shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged Property
any additional insurance as may be required pursuant to applicable laws.

            In the event that any Owner or the Servicer shall determine that the
Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards and risks
not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the Mortgagor pursuant
to the terms of the Mortgage, the Servicer shall, in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices, provide notice of such to the Mortgagor.

            All policies required hereunder shall name the Servicer as loss
payee and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of
any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

            The Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of
choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance
companies unless such companies are rated B:III or better in Best's and are
licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in which the


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Mortgaged Property is located. The Servicer shall determine that such policies
provide sufficient risk coverage and amounts, that they insure the property
owner, and that they properly describe the property address. The Servicer shall
furnish to the Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration of any such insurance in
sufficient time for the Mortgagor to arrange for renewal coverage by the
expiration date.

            Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts collected by the Servicer
under any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow
Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged
Property, or property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be
released to the Mortgagor, in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures as specified in Section 3.16) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05.

            Section 3.13 Force Placed Insurance.

            Each Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain the
required hazard insurance policy at the Mortgagor's cost and expense, and on the
Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the Servicer to obtain and maintain
such insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense, and to seek reimbursement
therefor from the Mortgagor. Upon any failure of the Mortgagor to maintain the
required hazard insurance, the Servicer shall obtain and maintain such force
placed hazard insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense.

            Section 3.14 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance.

            The Servicer shall maintain with responsible companies, at its own
expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy,
with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting in any
capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or papers
relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Servicer Employees"). Any such Fidelity Bond
and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the Mortgage
Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Servicer against losses,
including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Servicer Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 3.14 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its
duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage
under any such bond and insurance policy shall be acceptable to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. Upon the request of any Owner, the Servicer shall cause to be
delivered to such Owner a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and
insurance policy and a statement from the surety and the insurer that such
fidelity bond and insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or materially
modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the Owner.


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

            Section 3.15 Inspections.

            The Servicer shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as deemed
necessary by the Servicer to assure itself that the value of the Mortgaged
Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is more than 90
days delinquent, the Servicer immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged Property
and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices. The Servicer shall keep an electronic report of each such inspection.

            Section 3.16 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

            The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Owner prior to
releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to be
applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property if such release
is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. At a minimum, with respect
to claims greater than $15,000, the Servicer shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

            (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory independent verification
      of completion of repairs and issuance of any required approvals with
      respect thereto;

            (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to preserve the
      priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
      requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;

            (iii) the Servicer shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not 60 or
      more days delinquent; and

            (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall place the
      Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

            With respect to claims of $15,000 or less, the Servicer shall comply
with the following conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance
Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:

            (i) the related Mortgagor shall provide an affidavit verifying the
      completion of repairs and issuance of any required approvals with respect
      thereto;

            (ii) the Servicer shall verify the total amount of the claim with
      the applicable insurance company; and

            (iii) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall place the
      Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

            If the Owner is named as an additional loss payee, the Servicer is
hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such a claim in
the name of the Owner.

            Section 3.17 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.

            With respect to each Mortgage Loan with a LTV in excess of 80%, the
Servicer shall:

            (i) with respect to Mortgage Loans which are not LPMI Loans, without
      any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain in full
      force and effect a PMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan
      in excess of 67% (or such other percentage as stated in the related
      Acknowledgment Agreement) of value, and shall pay or shall cause the
      Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV of
      such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the event that such PMI Policy
      shall be terminated, the Servicer shall obtain from another Qualified
      Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to
      the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially the
      same fee level. The Servicer shall not take any action which would result
      in noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for
      the actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In
      connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or
      to be entered into pursuant to Section 5.02, the Servicer shall promptly
      notify the insurer under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such
      assumption or substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of
      such PMI Policy and shall take all actions which may be required by such
      insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under such PMI
      Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or
      substitution of liability, the Servicer shall obtain a replacement PMI
      Policy as provided above.

            (ii) with respect to LPMI Loans, maintain in full force and effect
      an LPMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in excess of 67%
      (or such other percentage as stated in the related Acknowledgment
      Agreement) of value, and from time to time, withdraw the LPMI Fee with
      respect to such LPMI Loan from the Custodial Account in order to pay the
      premium thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is
      reduced to 80%. In the event that the interest payments made with respect
      to any LPMI Loan are less than the LPMI Fee, the Servicer shall advance
      from its own funds the amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI Fee, in
      payment of the premium on the related LPMI Policy. Any such advance shall
      be a Servicing Advance subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions
      on Section 3.05. In the event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated,
      the Servicer shall obtain from another Qualified Insurer a comparable
      replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to the remaining coverage
      of such terminated LPMI Policy, at substantially the same fee level. The
      Servicer shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage under
      any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the
      Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In connection with any
      assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into
      pursuant to Section 5.02, the Servicer shall promptly notify the insurer
      under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution
      of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and shall
      take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
      the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is
      terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability,
      the Servicer shall obtain a replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

<PAGE>

            In connection with its activities as servicer, the Servicer agrees
to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner, claims to the insurer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action
as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy
respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05.

            Section 3.18 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

            In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Servicer, or in the event the Servicer is not
authorized or permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the
REO Property is located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing
business" or tax laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate
of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be
consistent with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer from any attorney
duly licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is located.
The Person or Persons holding such title other than the Owner shall acknowledge
in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Owner.

            The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Owner solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for
its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same
locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the
same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year,
except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interest of the Owner.

            The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event
within three years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (i) a
REMIC election has not been made with respect to the arrangement under which the
Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held, and (ii) the Servicer determines,
and gives an appropriate notice to the Owner to such effect, that a longer
period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO Property. If a
period longer than one and a half years is permitted under the foregoing
sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Servicer shall
report monthly to the Owner as to the progress being made in selling such REO
Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Owner, a purchase money
mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money mortgage
shall name the Servicer as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage shall not
be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate participation
agreement among the Servicer and Owner shall be entered into with respect to
such purchase money mortgage.

            The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to
the lesser of (a) 100% of the maximum insurable value of the improvements which
are a part of such property, or (b) unpaid principal balance of the related
Mortgage Loan at the time it becomes an REO Property, liability


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount required
above.

            The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the Servicer
at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Servicer deems to be
in the best interests of the Owner. The proceeds of sale of the REO Property
shall be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as practical
thereafter the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Servicer shall
reimburse itself for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid
Servicing Fees, and on the Remittance Date immediately following the date on
which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale
remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Owner.

            The Servicer shall advance funds necessary for the proper operation,
management and maintenance of the REO Property, including the cost of
maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to Section 3.12 and the fees of any
managing agent of the Servicer, or the Servicer itself, which advances shall be
deemed "Servicing Advances" for the purposes hereunder. The REO management fee
shall be an amount that is reasonable and customary in the area where the
Mortgaged Property is located. The Servicer shall make monthly distributions on
each Remittance Date to the Owners of the net cash flow from the REO Property
(which shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses
described in this Section 3.18 and of any reserves reasonably required from time
to time to be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time,
the Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one or
more REO Properties as provided by Section 9.02.

            Section 3.19 Real Estate Owned Reports.

            Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section 4.02, the
Servicer shall furnish to the Owner upon request an electronic statement with
respect to any REO Property covering the operation of such REO Property for the
previous month and the Servicer's efforts in connection with the sale of such
REO Property and any rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof
for the previous month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other
information as the Owner shall reasonably request.

            Section 3.20 Liquidation Reports.

            Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the
acquisition thereof by the Owner pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the
Servicer shall submit to the Owner a liquidation report with respect to such
Mortgaged Property.

            Section 3.21 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged
Property.

            Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Servicer shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time, or
any successor statute thereto, and applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury
regulations issued pursuant thereto.

            Section 3.22 PMI and LPMI Obligations.

            The Servicer shall comply with all provisions of applicable state
and federal law relating to the cancellation of, or collection of premiums with
respect to, PMI Policies and LPMI Policies, including, but not limited to, the
provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and all regulations
promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time. The Servicer shall be
obligated to make premium payments with respect to (a) LPMI Policies, and (b) if
the Mortgagor fails to pay any PMI Policy premium, such PMI Policy.

                                PAYMENTS TO OWNER

            Section 4.01 Remittances.

            On each Remittance Date the Servicer shall remit by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Owner (a) all amounts deposited in the
Custodial Account as of the close of business on the Determination Date (net of
charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
3.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the Servicer is obligated to
distribute pursuant to Section 4.03, minus (c) any amounts attributable to
Principal Prepayments received after the applicable Principal Prepayment Period
which amounts shall be remitted on the following Remittance Date, together with
any additional interest required to be deposited in the Custodial Account in
connection with such Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 3.04(viii),
and minus (d) any amounts attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on
a Due Date or Dates subsequent to the first day of the month of the Remittance
Date, which amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the
Due Period for such amounts.

            With respect to any remittance received by the Owner after the
second Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was due,
the Servicer shall pay to the Owner interest on any such late payment at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change,
plus three percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account by the Servicer on the date such late payment is made and shall cover
the period commencing with the day following such second Business Day and ending
with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next
succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by the Servicer of any such interest
shall not be deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver of any Event of
Default by the Servicer.

            Section 4.02 Statements to Owner.

            (a) Not later than the Remittance Date, the Servicer shall furnish
to the Owner a monthly statement (a "Monthly Remittance Advice") containing such
information in the form of FNMA form 2010 or such other form as shall be
required by the Fannie Mae Guides or by the Owner, in hard copy or electronic
medium mutually acceptable to the parties as to the accompanying remittance and
the period ending on the preceding Determination Date.

            (b) In addition, such Monthly Remittance Advice shall track, on a
monthly basis, the Mortgage Interest Rate and the delinquency status of the
Mortgage Loans. A cumulative delinquency report shall be provided to the Owner
upon the Owner's request.

            Beginning with calendar year 2001, the Servicer shall prepare and
file any and all tax returns, information statements or other filings for the
tax year 2000 and subsequent tax years required to be delivered to any
governmental taxing authority or to the Owner pursuant to any


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

applicable law with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, the Servicer shall provide the Owner with such
information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for the Owner to
prepare its federal income tax return as the Owner may reasonably request from
time to time.

            Section 4.03 Monthly Advances by Servicer.

            On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, the
Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds an amount
equal to all Monthly Payments (with interest adjusted to the Mortgage Loan
Remittance Rate) which were due on the Mortgage Loans during the applicable Due
Period and which were delinquent at the close of business on the immediately
preceding Determination Date or which were deferred pursuant to Section 3.01.
Any amounts held for future distribution and so used shall be replaced by the
Company by deposit in the Custodial Account on or before any future Remittance
Date if funds in the Custodial Account on such Remittance Date shall be less
than payments to the Purchaser required to be made on such Remittance Date. The
Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any Mortgage Loan will
continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the payment in full of
the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior to the Remittance
Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and other payments or
recoveries (including Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation Proceeds) with respect
to the Mortgage Loan unless the Servicer deems such Monthly Advances to be
unrecoverable, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer
delivered to the Owner.

            Section 4.04 Due Dates Other Than the First of the Month.

            Mortgage Loans having Due Dates other than the first day of a month,
including Mortgage Loans permitting semi-annual amortization of principal, shall
be accounted for as described in this Section 4.04. Any payment due on a day
other than the first day of each month shall be considered due on the first day
of the month in which that payment is due as if such payment were due on the
first day of said month. For example, a payment due on August 15 shall be
considered to be due on August 1 of said month. With respect to a Mortgage Note
permitting semi-annual amortization of principal, the Servicer shall be required
to remit monthly scheduled principal and interest based on a monthly
amortization schedule. Any payment collected on a Mortgage Loan after the
Cut-off Date shall be deposited in the Custodial Account. For Mortgage Loans
with Due Dates on the first day of a month, deposits to the Custodial Account
begin with the payment due on the first of the month following the Cut-off Date.

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

            Section 5.01 Servicing Compensation.

            As compensation for its services hereunder, the Servicer shall be
entitled to withdraw from the Custodial Account or to retain from interest
payments on the Mortgage Loans the amount of its Servicing Fee. The Servicing
Fee shall be payable monthly and shall be computed on the basis of the same
unpaid principal balance and for the period respecting which any related
interest payment on a Mortgage Loan is computed.

            Additional servicing compensation in the form of Ancillary Income
shall be retained by the Servicer to the extent not required to be deposited in
the Custodial Account. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain late charges
whether or not deposited to the Custodial Account. The Servicer shall be
required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing
activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement thereof except
as specifically provided for herein.

            Section 5.02 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

            The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale"
provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by
the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be sold
whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the
Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note; provided that,
if in the Servicer's prudent business judgment, it determines that an assumption
of the Mortgage Loan is in the best interests of the Owner, it shall deliver
notice of such determination to the Owner and may permit such assumption if
approved by the Owner. When the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the
Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance
or the Owner's consent otherwise in accordance with the preceding sentence,
exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the
"due-on-sale" clause applicable thereto, provided, however, that the Servicer
shall not be required to take such action if the Servicer, in its prudent
business judgment, believes it is not in the best interests of the Owner and
shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if the
exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to impair any recovery under
the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.

            If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under applicable
law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause or if the Owner approves such
assumption pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Servicer shall enter into
(i) an assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such
property has been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under
the Mortgage Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in
the event the Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the
original Mortgagor remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has
the prior consent of the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of
liability agreement with the Owner of the Mortgaged Property


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

pursuant to which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and the
Owner of the Mortgaged Property is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable
under the Mortgage Note; provided that no such substitutions should be permitted
unless such person satisfies the underwriting criteria of the Servicer and has a
credit risk rating at least equal to that of the original Mortgagor. The
Mortgage Loan, as assumed, shall conform in all respects to the requirements,
representations and warranties of this Agreement. The Servicer shall notify the
Owner that any such assumption or substitution agreement has been contemplated
by forwarding to the Owner the original copy of such assumption or substitution
agreement (indicating the Mortgage File to which it relates) which copy shall be
added by the Owner to the related Mortgage File and which shall, for all
purposes, be considered part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all
other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof. The Servicer shall
be responsible for recording any such assumption or substitution agreements. In
connection with any such assumption or substitution agreement, the Monthly
Payment on the related Mortgage Loan shall not be changed but shall remain as in
effect immediately prior to the assumption or substitution, the Mortgage
Interest Rate, the stated maturity or the outstanding principal amount of such
Mortgage Loan shall not be changed nor shall any required monthly payments of
principal or interest be deferred or forgiven. Any assumption fee collected by
the Servicer for entering into an assumption agreement shall be retained by the
Servicer as additional servicing compensation. In connection with any such
assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by the related Mortgage
Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding principal amount of the
Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

            Section 5.03 Right to Examine Servicer Records.

            The Owner shall have the right to examine and audit any and all of
the books, records, or other information of the Servicer, whether held by the
Servicer or by another on its behalf, with respect to or concerning this
Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, during business hours or at such other times as
may be reasonable under applicable circumstances, upon reasonable advance
notice.

            Section 5.04 Servicing Tape.

            On or before each Remittance Date, the Servicer shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Owner or the Owner's designee, a computer readable
file containing servicing information, including without limitation, those
fields specified by the Owner from time to time and reasonably available to the
Servicer, on a loan-by-loan basis and in the aggregate, with respect to the
Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder.

            Section 5.05 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage
Files.

            Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan the Servicer shall
notify the Owner in the Monthly Remittance Advice as provided in Section 4.02,
and may request the release of any Mortgage Loan documents. Upon receipt of such
request, the Custodian shall, within five (5) Business Days, release the related
Mortgage File to the Servicer; provided, that the Servicer shall use its best
efforts to obtain the release of the related Mortgage File from the Custodian.
The Custodian shall indemnify the Servicer out of its own funds for any loss,
liability


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

or expense incurred by the Servicer as a direct result of the failure of the
Custodian to release the related Mortgage File as provided in this paragraph.

            If the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or
should the Servicer otherwise prejudice any rights the Owner may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Owner, the Servicer shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within 2 Business Days of receipt of such demand by the
Owner. The Servicer shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 3.14 insuring the Servicer against
any loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

            Section 5.06 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.

            On or before July 31st of each year beginning July 31, 2000, the
Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants
which is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to
furnish a statement to each Owner stating that (i) it has obtained a letter of
representation regarding certain matters from the management of the Servicer
which includes an assertion that the Servicer has complied with certain minimum
residential mortgage loan servicing standards, identified in the Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers established by the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, with respect to the servicing of residential mortgage
loans during the most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) on the basis of an
examination conducted by such firm in accordance with standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, such representation is
fairly stated in all material respects, subject to the exception and other
qualifications that may be appropriate.

                                 AND AGREEMENTS

            Section 6.01 Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the
Servicer.

            The Servicer, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, hereby makes the following representations and warranties
to the Owner as of each Closing Date:

            (a) Due Organization and Authority. The Servicer is a California
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of state and has all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now being
conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing in each state where a
Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such state require licensing or
qualification in order to conduct business of the type conducted by the
Servicer, and in any event the Servicer is in compliance with the laws of any
such state to the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of the terms of
this Agreement; the Servicer has the full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement (including all instruments of
transfer to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the Servicer and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized; this Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Servicer and all requisite action has been taken by the
Servicer to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in
accordance with its terms;

            (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Servicer;

            (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the acquisition of the servicing responsibilities by the Servicer or
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will conflict with or result in a
breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Servicer's charter
or by-laws or any legal restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the
Servicer is now a party or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or
result in an acceleration under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation
of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer or
its property is subject, or impair the ability of the Servicer to service the
Mortgage Loans, or impair the value of the Mortgage Loans;

            (d) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe, nor does it
have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every
covenant contained in this Agreement. The Servicer is solvent;

            (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Servicer's knowledge, threatened against the
Servicer which, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in
any material adverse change in the business,


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the Servicer, or in any
material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer to carry on its
business substantially as now conducted, or in any material liability on the
part of the Servicer, or which would draw into question the validity of this
Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the
obligations of the Servicer contemplated herein, or which would be likely to
impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the terms of this
Agreement;

            (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization or
order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
delivery and performance by the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with
this Agreement, or if required, such approval has been obtained prior to each
Closing Date;

            (g) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved servicer of
conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the
facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
is in good standing to service mortgage loans for either Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac, and no event has occurred, including but not limited to a change in
insurance coverage, which would make the Servicer unable to comply with either
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which would require
notification to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

            (h) No Commissions to Third Parties. The Servicer has not dealt with
any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or commission
in connection with this transaction other than the Owner;

            Section 6.02 Remedies for Breach of Representations and Warranties
of the Servicer.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6.01 shall survive the engagement of the Servicer to
perform the servicing responsibilities as of each Closing Date and the delivery
of the Servicing Files to the Servicer and shall inure to the benefit of the
Owner. Upon discovery by either the Servicer or the Owner of a Breach of any of
the foregoing representations and warranties which materially and adversely
affects the ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and obligations under
this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects the value of the
Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the security interest
on such Mortgaged Property or the interest of the Owner (in the case of any of
the foregoing, a "Breach"), the party discovering such Breach shall give prompt
written notice to the other.

            Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice to
the Servicer of any Breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
6.01 which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to
perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially
and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or
the priority of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer
shall use its Best Efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all material respects
and, if such Breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Owner's option,
assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under this Agreement (or respecting
the affected Mortgage Loans) to a


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

successor servicer, subject to the approval of the Owner, which approval shall
be in the Owner's sole discretion. Such assignment shall be made in accordance
with Section 10.01.

            In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Owner and hold it
harmless against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable
and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and
expenses resulting from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or
grounded upon, or resulting from, a Breach of the Servicer representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement.

            Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or arising out
of the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 shall
accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by the Servicer or notice thereof by
the Owner to the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such Breach
within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the Servicer by the
Owner for compliance with this Agreement.

            Section 6.03 Representations and Warranties of the Owner.

            The Owner, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, makes the following representations and warranties to the
Servicer as of each Closing Date:

            (a) Due Organization and Authority. The Owner is a North Carolina
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state of its incorporation and has all licenses necessary to carry on its
business as now being conducted; the Owner has the full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform in accordance
herewith; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement (including
all instruments of transfer to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the
Owner and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized; this Agreement evidences the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Owner; and all requisite corporate action has been
taken by the Owner to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Owner in
accordance with its terms;

            (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Owner;

            (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the conveyance of the servicing responsibilities to the Servicer or
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will conflict with or result in a
Breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Owner's charter or
by-laws or any legal restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the
Owner is now a party or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or result
in an acceleration under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation of any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Owner or its
property is subject, or impair the value of the servicing contract consummated
hereby;

            (d) Ability to Perform. The Owner does not believe, nor does it have
any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
contained in this Agreement;


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

            (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or threatened against the Owner which, either in any one
instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse change in the
business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the Owner, or
in any material impairment of the right or ability of the Owner to carry on its
business substantially as now conducted, or in any material liability on the
part of the Owner, or which would draw into question the validity of this
Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the
obligations of the Owner contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair
materially the ability of the Owner to perform under the terms of this
Agreement;

            (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization or
order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
delivery and performance by the Owner of or compliance by the Owner with this
Agreement, or if required, such approval has been obtained prior to each Closing
Date;

            (g) Ownership. The Owner is the sole owner and holder of the
Mortgage Loans. The servicing responsibilities contracted for as of the relevant
Closing Date have not been assigned or pledged, and the Owner has good and
marketable interest therein, has full right to transfer the servicing
responsibilities to the Servicer free and clear of any encumbrance, equity,
interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security interest, and has full right
and authority, subject to no interest of, or agreement with, any other party
(other than any notice required by law, regulation or otherwise, to be delivered
to the Mortgagors) to assign the servicing responsibilities pursuant to this
Agreement; and

            (h) No Commissions to Third Parties. The Owner has not dealt with
any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or commission
in connection with this transaction other than the Servicer.

            Section 6.04 Remedies for Breach of Representations and Warranties
of the Owner.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6.03 shall survive the engagement of the Servicer to
perform the servicing responsibilities as of the Closing Dates and the delivery
of the Servicing Files to the Servicer and shall inure to the benefit of the
Servicer. Upon discovery by either the Servicer or the Owner of a Breach of any
of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially and adversely
affects the value of the servicing contract established herein or the interest
of the Servicer, the party discovering such Breach shall give prompt written
notice to the other.

            Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice to
the Owner of any Breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
6.03 which materially and adversely affects the value of the servicing contract,
the Owner shall use its Best Efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all
material respects.

            The Owner shall indemnify the Servicer and hold it harmless against
any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary
legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, any reasonable legal fees


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

and related expenses incurred by the Owner in connection with enforcing this
indemnity, resulting from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or
grounded upon, or resulting from, a Breach of the Owner representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the
obligation of the Owner to indemnify the Servicer pursuant to this Section 6.04
constitutes the sole remedy of the Servicer respecting a Breach of the foregoing
representation and warranties.

            Any cause of action against the Owner relating to or arising out of
the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Section 6.03 shall
accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by the Owner or notice thereof by the
Servicer to the Owner, (ii) failure by the Owner to cure such Breach within the
applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the Owner by the Servicer for
compliance with this Agreement.

                   WHOLE LOAN TRANSFER; PASS-THROUGH TRANSFER

            Section 7.01 Removal of Mortgage Loans from Inclusion Under this
Agreement Upon a Pass-Through Transfer or a Whole Loan Transfer on One or More
Reconstitution Dates.

            (a) The Owner and the Servicer agree that with respect to some or
all of the Mortgage Loans, from time to time the Owner shall:

            1.    Effect a Whole Loan Transfer, and/or

            2.    Effect a Pass-Through Transfer,

            in each case retaining the Servicer as the servicer thereof, or as
applicable the "seller/servicer". On the related Reconstitution Date, the
Mortgage Loans transferred shall cease to be covered by this Agreement.

            (b) With respect to each Whole Loan Transfer or Pass-Through
Transfer, as the case may be, entered into by the Owner, the Servicer agrees to
cooperate fully with the Owner, the Owner's designee, any prospective purchaser,
or any rating agency with respect to all reasonable requests and due diligence
procedures and to use its Best Efforts to facilitate such Whole Loan Transfer or
Pass-Through Transfer, as the case may be.

            (c) The Servicer acknowledges that with respect to some or all of
the Mortgage Loans, the Owner intends to effect one or more Whole Loan Transfers
and/or one or more Pass-Through Transfers. With respect to each Whole Loan
Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer, as the case may be, entered into by the
Owner, the Servicer agrees:

            (i) to negotiate and to execute all agreements executed in
      connection with such Whole Loan Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer that
      govern the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans (and any
      agreements and other documents incidental thereto) as the Owner shall
      reasonably request, provided that the servicing provisions contained
      therein shall be substantially similar to those contained in this
      Agreement and shall not contain any obligations materially more onerous
      than those contained herein that increase the expenses or obligations of
      the Servicer, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties (provided,
      that each of the Servicer and the Owner is given an opportunity to review
      and reasonably negotiate in good faith the content of such documents not
      specifically referenced or provided herein), which governing documents, in
      the case of a Pass-Through Transfer, shall contain provisions customarily
      included in publicly issued or privately placed rated secondary mortgage
      market transactions;

            (ii) to cooperate fully with the Owner and any prospective
      purchaser, at the Owner's expense, with respect to all reasonable requests
      and due diligence procedures including participating in meetings with
      rating agencies, bond insurers and such other


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

      parties as the Owner shall designate and participating in meetings with
      prospective purchasers of the Mortgage Loans or interests therein and
      providing information contained in the Mortgage Loan Schedule including
      any diskette or other related data tapes provided as reasonably requested
      by such purchasers;

            (iii) to negotiate and execute one or more master servicing
      agreements between the Servicer and any third party servicer which is
      servicing loans on behalf of the Owner providing for such third party
      servicer to master service such Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Owner;

            (iv) to negotiate and execute one or more subservicing agreements
      between the Servicer and any master servicer which is generally considered
      to be a prudent master servicer in the secondary mortgage market
      designated by the Owner in its sole discretion after consultation with the
      Servicer and/or one or more custodial and servicing agreements among the
      Owner or an affiliate of the Owner, the Servicer and a third party
      custodian/trustee which is generally considered to be a prudent
      custodian/trustee in the secondary mortgage market designated by the Owner
      in its sole discretion after consultation with the Servicer, in either
      case for the purpose of pooling the Mortgage Loans with other mortgage
      loans for resale or securitization;

            (v) in connection with a Pass-Through Transfer, a Whole Loan
      Transfer, or any securitization of any Mortgage Loans, to negotiate and
      execute a pooling and servicing agreement, which pooling and servicing
      agreement may, at the Owner's direction, contain contractual provisions
      including, but not limited to, a 24-day certificate payment delay (54-day
      total payment delay), servicer advances of delinquent scheduled payments
      of principal and interest through liquidation (unless deemed
      non-recoverable) and payment of compensating interest with respect to
      prepayment interest shortfalls (to the extent of the monthly servicing fee
      payable thereto), servicing representations and warranties which in form
      and substance conform to secondary market standards for securities backed
      by mortgage loans similar to the Mortgage Loans, and such provisions with
      regard to servicing responsibilities, investor reporting, segregation and
      deposit of principal and interest payments, custody of the Mortgage Loans,
      and other covenants as are required by the Owner and one or more
      nationally recognized rating agencies for "AAA" rated mortgage
      pass-through transactions which are "mortgage related securities" for
      purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, unless
      otherwise mutually agreed;

            (vi) to deliver to the Owner and to any Person designated by the
      Owner (a) for inclusion in any prospectus or other offering material such
      publicly available information regarding the Servicer, its financial
      condition and its mortgage loan delinquency, foreclosure and loss
      experience and any additional information requested by the Owner, (b) any
      similar non-public, unaudited financial information (which the Owner may,
      at its option and at its cost, have audited by certified public
      accountants) and such other information as is reasonably requested by the
      Owner and which the Servicer is capable of providing without unreasonable
      effort or expense, and to indemnify the Owner and its affiliates for
      material misstatements contained in such information, and (c) such


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

      statements and audit letters of reputable, certified public accountants
      pertaining to information provided by the Servicer pursuant to clause (a)
      above as shall be reasonably requested by the Owner; and

            (vii) to deliver to the Owner, and to any Person designated by the
      Owner, such legal documents and opinions of counsel (which may be in-house
      opinions of counsel) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Owner as are
      customarily delivered and reasonably determined by the Owner to be
      necessary in connection with Whole Loan Transfers or Pass-Through
      Transfers, as the case may be, it being understood that the cost of any
      opinions of outside special counsel that may be required for a Whole Loan
      Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer, as the case may be, shall be the
      responsibility of the Owner.

            (d) The Servicer shall provide to the Owner or issuer, as the case
may be, and any other participants in such Whole Loan Transfer or Pass-Through
Transfer, any and all information with respect to itself, its servicing
portfolio or the Mortgage Loans and appropriate verification of information
which may be reasonably available to the Servicer, whether through letters of
its auditors and counsel or otherwise, as the Owner or any such other
participant shall request upon reasonable demand.

            (e) In the event the Owner has elected to have the Servicer hold
record title to the Mortgages, prior to a Reconstitution Date the Owner or its
designee shall prepare an Assignment of Mortgage in blank from the Owner,
acceptable to the trustee or such third party, as the case may be, for each
Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer and
shall pay all preparation and recording costs associated therewith. The Servicer
shall execute each Assignment of Mortgage, track such Assignments of Mortgage to
ensure they have been recorded and deliver them as required by the trustee or
such third party, as the case may be, upon the Servicer's receipt thereof.
Additionally, the Servicer shall prepare and execute, at the direction and
expense of the Owner, any note endorsements in connection with any and all
Reconstitution Agreements; provided that CCGI shall be responsible for the
expenses with respect to the initial endorsements.

            (f) All Mortgage Loans not sold or transferred pursuant to a
Pass-Through Transfer or Whole Loan Transfer and any and all Mortgage Loans
repurchased by the Owner pursuant to Section 7.02 below with respect to a
Pass-Through Transfer or Whole Loan Transfer shall be subject to this Agreement
and shall continue to be serviced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and with respect thereto this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

            Section 7.02 Owner's Repurchase and Indemnification Obligations.

            Upon receipt by the Servicer of notice from the trustee of a Breach
of any Owner representation or warranty contained in any Reconstitution
Agreement or a request by the trustee for the repurchase of any Mortgage Loan
transferred to a trustee pursuant to a Pass-Through Transfer or to a third party
purchaser pursuant to a Whole Loan Transfer, the Servicer shall promptly notify
the Owner of same and shall, at the direction of the Owner, use its Best Efforts
to cure and correct any such Breach and to satisfy the requests or concerns of
the trustee or the third party purchaser related to such deficiencies of the
related Mortgage Loans transferred to the trustee or other such third party
purchaser.


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

            The Owner shall repurchase from the Servicer any Mortgage Loan
transferred to a trustee pursuant to a Pass-Through Transfer or to a third party
purchaser pursuant to a Whole Loan Transfer with respect to which the Servicer
has been required by the trustee or such third party purchaser to repurchase due
to a Breach of a representation or warranty made by the Owner with respect to
the Mortgage Loans, or the servicing thereof prior to the transfer date to the
trustee or any third party purchaser in any Reconstitution Agreement and not due
to a breach of the Servicer's obligations thereunder or pursuant to this
Agreement. The repurchase price to be paid by the Owner to the Servicer shall
equal that repurchase price paid by the Servicer to the third party purchaser
plus all reasonable costs and expenses borne by the Servicer in connection with
the cure of said Breach of a representation or warranty made by the Owner and in
connection with the repurchase of such Mortgage Loan from the trustee or the
third party purchaser, including, but not limited to, reasonable and necessary
attorneys' fees.

            At the time of repurchase, the Custodian and the Servicer shall
arrange for the reassignment of the repurchased Mortgage Loan to the Owner
according to the Owner's instructions and the delivery to the Custodian of any
documents held by the trustee or other relevant third party purchaser with
respect to the repurchased Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Reconstitution
Agreement. In the event of a repurchase, the Servicer shall, simultaneously with
such reassignment, give written notice to the Owner that such repurchase has
taken place, and amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the addition of the
repurchased Mortgage Loan to this Agreement. In connection with any such
addition, the Servicer and the Owner shall be deemed to have made as to such
repurchased Mortgage Loan the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement except that all such representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed made as of the date of such repurchase.

            Section 7.03 Indemnification; Third Party Claims.

            The Servicer shall indemnify the Owner and hold it harmless against
any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable
and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees
and expenses that the Owner may sustain in any way related to the failure of the
Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict
compliance with the terms of this Agreement or any Reconstitution Agreement
entered into pursuant to Section 7.01. The Servicer immediately shall notify the
Owner if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or any
Reconstitution Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, shall promptly notify Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee with respect to any claim made by a third party
with respect to any Reconstitution Agreement, assume (with the prior written
consent of the Owner) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in
connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or the Owner in
respect of such claim. The Servicer shall follow any written instructions
received from the Owner in connection with such claim. The Owner promptly shall
reimburse the Servicer for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding
sentence except when the claim is in any way related to the Servicer's
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the Servicer to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with the terms of
this Agreement or any Reconstitution Agreement.

                                  THE SERVICER

            Section 8.01 Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

            The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to
do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

            Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or
any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the
Servicer, shall be the successor of the Servicer hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, provided,
however, that the successor or surviving Person shall be an institution (i)
having a net worth of not less than $25,000,000, and (ii) which is a Fannie Mae-
and Freddie Mac-approved servicer in good standing.

            Section 8.02 Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others.

            Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Owner for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith
pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however, that
this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such person against any
Breach of warranties or representations made herein, or failure to perform its
obligations in strict compliance with any standard of care set forth in this
Agreement, or any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any
breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Servicer and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on
any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any
Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Servicer shall not be under
any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not
incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this
Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability,
provided, however, that the Servicer may, with the consent of the Owner,
undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to
this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto. In such event,
the Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Owner of the reasonable
legal expenses and costs of such action.

            Section 8.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by Servicer.

The Owner has entered into this Agreement with the Servicer and subsequent
Owners will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the independent status
of the Servicer, and the representations as to the adequacy of its servicing
facilities, plant, personnel, records and


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

procedures, its integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the
continuance thereof. Therefore, the Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement
or the servicing hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any
portion hereof (to other than a third party in the case of outsourcing routine
tasks such as taxes, insurance and property inspection, in which case the
Servicer shall be fully liable for such tasks as if the Servicer performed them
itself) or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets without the prior written consent of the Owner, which consent shall be
granted or withheld in the reasonable discretion of the Owner, provided,
however, that the Servicer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder
without prior written consent of the Owner to any entity that is directly owned
or controlled by the Servicer, and the Servicer guarantees the performance of
such entity hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer, the
Servicer shall provide the Owner with a written statement guaranteeing the
successor entity's performance of the Servicer's obligations under the
Agreement.

            The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer and the Owner or upon the
determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Servicer. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by
an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Owner which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Owner. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Servicer's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 10.01.

            Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 8.03, in
the event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof (to other than a third party in the case of outsourcing routine tasks
such as taxes, insurance and property inspection, in which case the Servicer
shall be fully liable for such tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself)
or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
assets, without the prior written consent of the Owner, then the Owner shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in
Section 9.01 without any payment of any penalty or damages and without any
liability whatsoever to the Servicer or any third party.

                                   TERMINATION

            Section 9.01 Termination for Cause.

            This Agreement shall be terminable at the sole option of the Owner,
if any of the following events of default exist on the part of the Servicer:

            (i) any failure by the Servicer to remit to the Owner any payment
required to be made under the terms of this Agreement which continues unremedied
for a period of five days after the date upon which written notice of such
failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Servicer by the Owner; or

            (ii) failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform in any
material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the
Servicer set forth in this Agreement which continues unremedied for a period of
30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the
same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the Owner; or

            (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license to do business
in any jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located; or

            (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority
having jurisdiction for the appointment of a conservator or receiver or
liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, including bankruptcy,
marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the
winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the
Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged or
unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

            (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator
or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of
assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer or
of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or

            (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its
debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any
applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization statute, make an assignment
for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations
or cease its normal business operations for three Business Days; or

            (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications of a Fannie Mae
or Freddie Mac servicer; or

            (viii) the Servicer fails to maintain a minimum net worth of
      $25,000,000; or


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

            (ix) the Servicer attempts to assign its right to servicing
compensation hereunder or the Servicer attempts, without the consent of the
Owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets or to assign this Agreement or the servicing responsibilities
hereunder or to delegate its duties hereunder or any portion thereof (to other
than a third party in the case of outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes,
insurance and property inspection, in which case the Servicer shall be fully
liable for such tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself) in violation of
Section 8.03.

            In each and every such case, so long as an event of default shall
not have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the Owner may have at
law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and specific performance,
the Owner, by notice in writing to the Servicer, may terminate all the rights
and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the servicing
contract established hereby and the proceeds thereof.

            Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority
and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in a successor servicer
appointed by the Owner. Upon written request from the Owner, the Servicer shall
prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity designated by the Owner any
and all documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession
all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination,
including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the
Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The
Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and such successor in effecting the
termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including
without limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration by it of
all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to the
Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to the
Mortgage Loans.

            By a written notice, the Owner may waive any default by the Servicer
in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences. Upon any
waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every
purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

            Section 9.02 Termination Without Cause.

            This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last Mortgage
Loan to the Owner (or advances by the Servicer for the same), and (b) the
disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last Mortgage
Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent of
the Servicer and the Owner in writing or (iii) at the sole option of the Owner,
without cause, upon 30 days written notice. Any such notice of termination shall
be in writing and delivered to the Servicer by registered mail to the address
set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Owner and the Servicer shall
comply with the termination procedures set forth in Sections 10.01 and 10.03
hereof and the procedures set forth below, provided that, in the event the Owner


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

terminates this Agreement without cause in accordance with subclause (iii)
above, the Owner shall pay the Servicer a termination fee equal to (A) with
respect to fixed rate Mortgage Loans, 2.0% of the aggregate unpaid principal
balance of the fixed rate Mortgage Loans as of such termination date and (B)
with respect to ARM Mortgage Loans, 2.0% of the aggregate unpaid principal
balance of the ARM Mortgage Loans as of such termination date.

            In connection with any such termination referred to in clause (ii)
or (iii) above, the Owner will be responsible for reimbursing the Servicer for
all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances within 15
Business Days following the date of termination and other reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with any transfer of servicing.

            Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that
(i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of 90 days or more (a
"Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage Loan becomes an REO Property, the
Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to such
Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property upon 15 days' written notice to the
Servicer. In the event of such election, the Owner shall reimburse the Servicer
for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances
within 15 Business Days following the date of termination and other reasonable
and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with any transfer of servicing,
including, but not limited to, costs associated with the transfer of the related
files to the Owner's designee.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            Section 10.01 Successor to the Servicer.

            Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to Sections 6.02,
7.03, 8.03, 9.01 or 9.02, the Owner shall (i) succeed to and assume all of the
Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor having the characteristics set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.01 and which shall succeed to all rights and
assume all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under
this Agreement simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this Agreement. In connection
with such appointment and assumption, the Owner may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor out of payments on Mortgage Loans as it and
such successor shall agree, provided, however, that no such compensation shall
be in excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement without the
consent of the Owner. In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities
and liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of such
termination until the effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence
and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall
take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial
condition of its successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a successor
shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 10.01 and shall in no event relieve
the Servicer of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections
6.01 and the remedies available to the Owner under Section 6.02 and 7.03, it
being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02 and
7.03 shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement.

            Within 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity by the
Owner, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity
any and all documents and other instruments, place in such successor's
possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement of the
Mortgage Notes and related documents, and the preparation and recordation of
Assignments of Mortgage, at the discretion of the Owner and, at the Owner's sole
expense. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer and to the Owner an instrument accepting
such appointment, wherein the


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

successor shall make the representations and warranties set forth in Section
6.01, whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the rights,
powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer,
with like effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any
termination or resignation of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.03, 9.01 or 9.02 shall not affect any claims
that the Owner may have against the Servicer arising out of the Servicer's
actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or resignation.

            The Servicer shall deliver promptly to the successor servicer the
funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account and all Mortgage Loan
documents and related documents and statements held by it hereunder and the
Servicer shall account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such
instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required to more fully
and definitively vest in the successor all such rights, powers, duties,
responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer.

            Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the Servicer
shall notify by mail the Owner of such appointment in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 10.07.

            Section 10.02 Closing.

            Each closing for the engagement of the Servicer to perform the
servicing responsibilities respecting Mortgage Loans shall take place on the
related Closing Date. At the Owner's option, the closing shall be either: by
telephone, confirmed by letter or wire as the parties shall agree; or conducted
in person, at such place as the parties shall agree.

            Each closing shall be subject to each of the following conditions:

            (a) all of the representations and warranties of the Servicer and
the Owner under this Agreement shall be true and correct as of each Closing Date
and no event shall have occurred which, with notice or the passage of time,
would constitute a default under this Agreement;

            (b) the Owner and Servicer each shall have received, or the Owner's
attorneys shall have received in escrow, (i) with respect to the first Closing
Date, all Closing Documents as specified in Section 10.03(a) hereof, and (ii)

Section 10.03(b) hereof, in such forms as are agreed upon and acceptable to the
Servicer and the Owner, duly executed by all signatories other than the Owner as
required pursuant to the respective terms thereof; and

            (c) all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall have been
complied with and no default or Event of Default under this Agreement shall have
occurred and be continuing for a period of 30 days or more prior to the related
Closing Date.

which is prohibited or which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision,

independent mortgage brokerage companies on the Servicer's behalf, to
personally, by telephone or mail, solicit the Mortgagor under any Mortgage Loan
for the purpose of refinancing such Mortgage Loan; provided, that the Servicer
may solicit any Mortgagor for whom the Servicer has received a request for
verification of mortgage, a request for demand for payoff, a mortgagor initiated
written or verbal communication indicating a desire to prepay the related
Mortgage Loan, or the mortgagor initiates a title search, provided further, it
is understood and agreed that promotions undertaken by the Servicer or any of
its affiliates which (i) concern optional insurance products or other additional
projects or (ii) are directed to the general public at large, including, without
limitation, mass mailings based on commercially acquired mailing lists,
newspaper, radio and television advertisements shall not constitute solicitation
under this Section 10.09 nor is the Servicer prohibited from responding to
unsolicited requests or inquiries made by a Mortgagor or an agent of a
Mortgagor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following solicitations, if
undertaken by the Servicer or any affiliate of the Servicer, shall not be
prohibited under this Section 10.09: (i) solicitations that are directed to the
general public at large, including, without limitation, mass mailings based on

                                                         (date)

Centre Capital Group, Inc.
200 Pringle Avenue
Suite 500
Walnut Creek, CA 94596

Dear Sirs:

            You have requested [our] [my] opinion, as [Assistant] General
Counsel to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (the "Company"), with respect to
certain matters in connection with the servicing by the Company of the Mortgage
Loans pursuant to that certain Master Servicing Agreement, Fixed and Adjustable
Rate Mortgage Loans, by and between the Company and Centre Capital Group, Inc.,
(the "Owner"), dated as of April___, 2000, (the "Master Servicing Agreement")
being executed contemporaneously with an Assignment and Assumption Agreement by
and between the Company and the Owner (the "Assignment and Assumption
Agreement"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings
set forth in the Master Servicing Agreement.

            [We] [I] have examined the following documents:

            1.    the Master Servicing Agreement;

            2.    the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and

            3.    such other documents, records and papers as [we] [I] have
                  deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for this opinion.

            To the extent [we] [I] have deemed necessary and proper, [we] [I]
have relied upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
the Master Servicing Agreement. [We] [I] have assumed the authenticity of all
documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the
legal capacity of natural persons and the conformity to the originals of all
documents.


                                    Exh G-1
<PAGE>

            Based upon the foregoing, it is [our] [my] opinion that:

      1. The Company is a duly organized, validly existing corporation in good
standing under the laws of California and is qualified to service and administer
the Mortgage Loans in the states where the Mortgaged Properties are located.

      2. The Company has the power to engage in the transactions contemplated by
the Master Servicing Agreement and all requisite power, authority and legal
right to execute and deliver the Master Servicing Agreement and the Assignment
and Assumption Agreement, and to perform and observe the terms and conditions of
such instruments.

      3. Each of the Master Servicing Agreement and the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable in accordance
with its respective terms against the Company, subject to bankruptcy laws and
other similar laws of general application affecting rights of creditors and
subject to the application of the rules of equity, including those respecting
the availability of specific performance, none of which will materially
interfere with the realization of the benefits provided thereunder.

      4. Either (i) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or
governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of or compliance by the Company with the Master
Servicing Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, or the servicing
of the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Master Servicing Agreement; or (ii) any required consent, approval,
authorization or order has been obtained by the Company.

      5. Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, nor the
fulfillment of the terms of, the Master Servicing Agreement or the Assignment
and Assumption Agreement conflicts or will conflict with or results or will
result in a breach of, or constitutes or will constitute a default under, the
charter or by-laws of the Company, the terms of any indenture or other agreement
or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or to
which it is subject, or violates any statute or order, rule, regulations, writ,
injunction or decree of any court, governmental authority or regulatory body to
which the Company is subject or by which it is bound.

      6. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the best of [our] [my] knowledge, threatened against the Company which, in [our]
[my] judgment, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any
material adverse change in the business, operations, financial condition,
properties or assets of the Company or in any material impairment of the right
or ability of the Company to carry on its business substantially as now
conducted or in any material liability on the part of the Company or which would
draw into question the validity of the Master Servicing Agreement, the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, or which would be likely
to impair materially the ability of the Company to perform under the terms of
the Assignment and Assumption Agreement or the Master Servicing Agreement.
