      that a Senior Executive's Total Compensation shall exceed one million
      dollars ($1,000,000) for a taxable year (calculated in accordance with

      the Company to defer such excess pursuant to the Mandatory Deferral
      provisions of the Plan.

3. THE FIRST SENTENCE OF SECTION 4.5.1 IS AMENDED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
