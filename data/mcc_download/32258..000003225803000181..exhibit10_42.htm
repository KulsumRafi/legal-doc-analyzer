<p><b>Section 3.1(d) -&nbsp; Repayments and
Prepayments</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following shall be added to the end of Section 3.1(d) of the

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&ldquo;Notwithstanding the
foregoing during the time period from March 12, 2003 through
September 30, 2004 (the &ldquo;<b><i>Waiver Period</i></b>&rdquo;),
and provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred
during such Waiver Period, the Borrower may receive net proceeds

Proceeds</i></b>&rdquo;), and such Exempt Net Proceeds shall not be
subject, during the Waiver Period and thereafter, to the provisions

received in excess of Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000)
during the Waiver Period shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 3.1(d).&rdquo;</font></p>

<p><b>Amendments to Equipment Agreement.&nbsp;</b> Borrower agrees
(a) to the amendments to Statements of Work (as defined in the
Equipment Agreement) set forth in <b>Section 3.1</b> below, (b)
that such amendments shall constitute Change Orders (as defined in
the Equipment Agreement) agreed to between the parties for purposes
of the Equipment Agreement, and (c) that all the provisions in the
Equipment Agreement relating to effecting Change Orders shall be
deemed to have been complied with in connection with the Change
Orders below upon the parties&rsquo; execution of this
Amendment.</p>

<p>The agreed-on Change Orders are as follows:</p>

<p>Borrower shall not charge Lender for any additional costs to
complete the PS500 Wright Medical and Guidant systems effective
January 1, 2003.&nbsp; The billings dated January 24, 2003, for
December 2002 activity, shall constitute the final billings on the
procurement and installation of these systems.&nbsp; These systems
shall be delivered by Borrower to Titan Scan Technologies
Corporation (&ldquo;<b><i>Titan Scan</i></b>&rdquo;) at the
expected system performance level in terms of power and utilization
(in accordance with the Statement of Work issued to Borrower),
which is for Guidant 3kW, 10 MeV, and for Wright 3kW, 5 MeV, 24
hour per day, 7 days per week operation with 95%
&ldquo;up-time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Billings by Borrower of the applicable Lender entity for
activity after December 31, 2002 on the demo PS500 unit in Dublin,
California shall not exceed $200,000 to finish the unit as
currently agreed under the applicable Statement of Work.&nbsp; The
current agreement between the parties is for the system to
substantially operate at the same capability as the unit installed
at Wright Medical, including automated material handling and
electron beam energy of 5MeV and power at 3kW.&nbsp; However, if
directed by Titan Scan through a Change Order signed by the Chief
Financial Officer of Lender (or his designate in writing),
additional work shall be billed accordingly.</p>

<p>There shall be no future billings by Borrower of the applicable
Lender entity for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) on the PS500 line
effective January 1, 2003 unless new work is directed by Titan Scan
through a Change Order signed by the Chief Financial Officer of
Lender (or his designate in writing).</p>

<p>There shall be no future billings by Borrower of the applicable
Lender entity on the Baxter Cygnet and Baxter PI#1 systems
effective January 1, 2003.&nbsp; The parties agree that these
systems were complete as of such time.</p>

<p>Billings by Borrower of the applicable Lender entity to complete
the production and installation of the Baxter PI#2 system shall not
exceed $24,000 after January 1, 2003.&nbsp; This amount is
consistent with the estimate for project completion provided by
Borrower to Titan Scan in January 2003.</p>

<p>The current delivery schedules for all systems being produced by
Borrower for Titan Scan shall not change as a result of this
Amendment and the Change Orders contained herein.</p>

<p>Borrower shall enter into a Two Year Service Contract with
Lender and/or Titan Scan to be agreed upon by the parties to
provide technical services to installed and fielded Titan Scan
medical sterilization systems.&nbsp; If an agreement on a Two Year
Service Contract is not reached, Borrower shall provide technical
services on a time and materials basis, the rate of which shall be
Borrower labor costs, plus allocation of fringe, occupancy, and
direct overhead application, plus 20% margin.&nbsp; The rates shall
be renewable annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

modified by this Amendment and the Change Orders contained herein,
all other terms of the Equipment Agreement and any Statements of
Work issued thereunder remain unchanged and in full force and
effect.</font></p>

forth in <b>Section&nbsp;2</b> and <b>Section 3</b> above shall be

amendment to or waiver of any other term or condition of the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the Equipment Agreement,
(ii) prejudice any right or remedy which Lender may now have or may
have in the future under or in connection with the Credit Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the Equipment Agreement, or (iii) be
a consent to any future amendment, waiver or modification of any
other term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the Equipment Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
