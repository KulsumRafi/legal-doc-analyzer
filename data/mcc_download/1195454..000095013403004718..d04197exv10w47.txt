ARTICLE 3. GRANT OF LEASE AND BUILDING ACCESS

3.1 LESSEE FIBER. Unless otherwise converted to an IRU pursuant to Section 3.6,
MFN grants to Lessee a Lease in 43,040 fiber miles in the MFN System (the
"Lessee Fiber") for a period of 20 years beginning on the Acceptance Date for
each segment. Such Lessee Fiber is identified by segment in Exhibit B. MFN shall
provide Lessee with maps sufficiently depicting the routes of the Lessee Fiber
within 60 days of the Effective Date. To the extent the Acceptance Date for any
Lessee Fiber has not occurred as of the Effective Date, MFN has the obligation
to design, engineer, install, and construct or acquire such Lessee Fiber. Unless
otherwise accepted by Lessee, all Lessee Fiber shall provide Diversity. Lessee

3.2 LEASE LIMITATIONS. The Lease granted to Lessee hereunder and any rights
granted by Lessee to third party users, are subject to all Right-of-Way
Authorizations applicable to the MFN System and the Buildings. Lessee will
adhere to the requirements of all such Right-of-Way Authorizations. The Lease of
the Lessee Fiber hereunder does not convey any legal title to any real or
personal property, including the fibers, cable, or the MFN System. This Lease
does not include any Equipment used to transmit capacity over, or to "light,"
the Lessee Fiber.

3.3 BUILDING ACCESS. MFN will provide Building Access to the Buildings listed in
Exhibit C. To the extent the Lessee Fiber does not terminate at the Buildings
listed in Exhibit C as of the Effective Date, MFN has the obligation to design,
engineer, install, and construct or acquire fiber and terminate such fiber at
such Buildings. All such terminations established by MFN shall comply with the
relevant Fiber Testing Specifications (including the splice loss and optical
fiber specifications) set forth in Exhibit A and with relevant
telecommunications industry practices. MFN shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide all Building terminations with Diversity. In the event that a
termination in a Building does not have Diversity, then MFN shall give notice to
Lessee and the reduction in the Building Access Payment set forth in Section
4.2(c)

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


shall apply to such termination. Lessee agrees to pay the Building Access
Payment set forth in Section 4.2 for Building Access.

3.4 ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS. Except as provided in Section 3.5, below, MFN is only
obligated to provide Building Access at those locations listed in Exhibit C.
However, at any time during the Term, Lessee may request that MFN connect the
Lessee Fibers to additional Buildings under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Within 15 days of Lessee's request, if accepted, MFN will provide
Lessee with its then-current order form specifying the Building Access Payment,
any non-recurring charges (as set forth in Section 4.3), and the anticipated
Delivery Date of the requested Building (each such order form a "Product
Order"). Lessee must sign the Product Order and return to MFN within 15 days.
All future Product Orders signed by both parties are governed by and
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

Alternatively, if MFN rejects the Building request or Lessee rejects the Product
Order, Lessee has the option of either:

(a) requesting that MFN participate with Lessee in a joint construction effort
to make such interconnection pursuant to a separate agreement negotiated between
the parties that shall not require a Building Access Payment; or

(b) requesting that MFN construct the lateral connection as Lessee's contractor
pursuant to a separate agreement negotiated between the parties. If MFN accepts,
Lessee will own the lateral connection and related facilities and Lessee will
pay the one time charge for the connection at Cost; or

(c) constructing and owning the lateral connection to the Building and
interconnecting to the MFN backbone at a Splice Point in accordance with Section
9.2, below. Lessee, in its good faith discretion, may permit MFN to utilize
Williams' interconnection facilities to connect to a Building. There is no
Building Access Payment associated with Splice Point interconnection.

3.5 MANHATTAN BUILDING. Upon Lessee's request, MFN agrees to conduct a
feasibility study, at Williams Communications sole cost and expense, to
determine if MFN can provide connectivity from a manhole at the southeast corner
of 11th Avenue and 27th Street (near 111 E. 8th St.) to Lessee's POP located at
601 W. 26th Street on the sixth floor and continuing from the POP to Lessee POP
in 60 Hudson in New York, New York. If feasible, MFN will perform all necessary
construction at Williams Communications' sole cost and expense.

3.6 CONVERSION TO IRU. At any time during the Term, upon the request of Lessee
and Lessee's payment to MFN of the net present value of the Lease Payments and
Building Access Payments calculated based upon a mutually agreed upon discount
rate, MFN shall grant to Lessee an Indefeasible Right of Use to the Lessee
Fibers and Building terminations equal to the remaining term of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 4. CONSIDERATION; FEES

4.1 LEASE PAYMENTS. MFN represents that the fiber miles set forth in Exhibit B,
are either the actual fiber miles (calculated as the route miles traversed by
the Lessee Fiber multiplied by the number of Lessee Fibers on the route) or a
bona fide estimate thereof, such estimate calculated utilizing OTDR distances
less ten percent (10%). Lessee shall make monthly payments to MFN in advance
during the Term, in an amount calculated as [*****] PER FIBER MILE PER MONTH
("Lease Payments") based on the fiber miles set forth in Exhibit B, beginning
upon the Effective Date or on the Acceptance Date of the Lessee Fiber set forth
in Exhibit B if later than the Effective Date.

4.2 BUILDING ACCESS PAYMENTS. Except as provided in Section 3.4, in exchange for
Building Access at each Building, Lessee shall make Building Access Payments to
MFN in advance.

         (a) The Building Access Payment is calculated as follows:

            (c) If MFN does not offer Diversity in the termination to a
Building, the Building Access Payment for that Building shall be reduced by
[***] (for a total of [***] for the first year) until such time as Diversity is
provided, if ever.

            (d) Lessee may cancel a Building after 24 months of Building Access
Payments for such Building by providing at least 30 days prior written notice to
MFN, provided that Williams maintains a minimum of 40 Buildings during the Term.

            (e) The parties agree that MFN may splice up to a full ribbon of
cable at each Building even if Lessee requests interconnection of less than 12
fibers. Lessee is not obligated to pay the Building Access Payment for any extra
fibers spliced over and above the number of fibers ordered, and Lessee may still
port such fibers under Section 3.1.

4.3. NON-RECURRING CHARGES. Upon Product Order execution, MFN will invoice and
Lessee agrees to pay non-recurring charges agreed upon in the Product Order.
Non-recurring charge will include:

            (a) MFN's Costs associated with splicing, testing and/or
constructing laterals at new Buildings provided pursuant to Section 3.4:

            (b) Intra-building riser cabling and construction pursuant to
Section 5.6; and

            (c) MFN's Costs associated with Splice Point interconnection
pursuant to Section 9.2.

4.4 ADDITIONAL CHARGES. MFN will invoice and Lessee agrees to pay for all other
additional fees and charges contemplated by this Agreement or set forth in a
signed Product Order for services.

4.5 PAYMENT TERMS. Building Access Payments and Lease Payments commence on the
first day of the month beginning with the month after the Acceptance Date of the
relevant Lessee Fiber and/or Building, except that the first payment shall
include payment from the Acceptance Date to the last day of the month during
which the Acceptance Date occurs, as well as payment for the first full month
after the Acceptance Date. Lessee shall continue making such payments through
the first day of the month in which the Expiration Date occurs, unless the
Agreement is terminated prior to the Expiration Date as herein provided. All
payments are payable in accordance with Article 11.

4.6 NO BUILDING ACCESS PAYMENTS AT POPS. MFN will not charge a Building Access
Payment for termination within MFN POPs where Lessee is collocating with MFN, or
at Lessee's POPs. In addition, provided that Lessee is making Building Access
Payments in connection with any Building, Lessee shall have the right to route
other interconnections through

of the Lessee Fiber or Buildings by the scheduled Delivery Date, the parties
will designate representatives to meet and review the status of the delivery. If
the scheduled Delivery Date for any segment of Lessee Fiber or a Building is in
fact delayed, such delay will be considered a triggering event for the accrual
of liquidated damages to the Lessee as follows:

         (a) Subject to subsections (b), (c) and (d) below, and provided the
delay is not caused in whole or in part by Lessee, Lessee is entitled to a
credit against monthly charges in an amount equal to $18 per fiber mile of the
segment of Lessee Fiber for which the Delivery Date is delayed per month until
such time as such segment is delivered, and a credit against monthly charges in
an amount equal to $1,600 per delayed Building per month until delivered
("Liquidated Damages");

         (b) Liquidated Damages for each segment of Lessee Fibers is limited to
50% of the present value of the total monthly charges payable based on [******]
per fiber mile (using a discount factor of 10%) associated with the fiber miles
for the delayed segment. As an example, if a segment consisting of [***] fiber
miles is delayed under the Agreement, the present value of monthly charges for
that segment is [***********], and the total maximum Liquidated Damages payable
to Lessee for the delayed segment, regardless of duration of delay is
[***********]. Partial months of delay will be credited on a daily pro-rated
basis;

         (c) Liquidated Damages for Lessee Fiber for all delays are limited to
25% of the then-current monthly invoicing of [******] per fiber mile to Lessee.
As an example, if MFN is currently billing Lessee [********] per month, Lessee
is entitled to a maximum of [********] per month in Liquidated Damages,
regardless of the number of delayed segments;

         (d) Lessee may terminate the Agreement with respect a delayed segment
of Lessee Fibers or a delayed Building upon 15 days prior written notice to MFN,
unless and until delivery actually occurs. Upon termination, Liquidated Damages
will cease to accrue for the terminated segments and/or Buildings, and MFN has
no further payment obligations with respect to such segment.

         The parties agree that the Liquidated Damages represent a reasonable
estimate of anticipated damages incurred by Lessee in the event of a delay of a
segment of Lessee Fiber or a

Building. The Liquidated Damages and termination of a segment with a reduction
of payment obligations are the sole and exclusive remedies of the Lessee and the
sole and exclusive liabilities of MFN with respect to a delivery delay, and
provided each party has complied with the terms of this Section 5.1, under no
circumstances will a delay in the Delivery Date for a segment of Lessee Fiber or
a Building be considered a default.

5.2 OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE COMPLETION NOTICE. MFN shall promptly notify Lessee in
writing of the date upon which MFN has completed connecting a Building.

5.3 ACCEPTANCE AND TESTING OF FIBERS

         (a) MFN TESTING. MFN shall give notice to Lessee at least 21 days prior
to the date MFN intends to begin testing of Lessee Fiber ("Fiber Acceptance
Testing"). Lessee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to have a
representative present at such Fiber Acceptance Testing. MFN shall perform Fiber
Acceptance Testing of the Lessee Fiber and provide test deliverables to Lessee
in accordance with Exhibit A. The provisions of this Subsection 5.3 are intended
to apply to the delivery of Lessee Fiber and the delivery of Buildings and the
Acceptance Date for both are conditioned on the acceptance of such test results.

         (b) OBJECTIONS TO TEST RESULTS. Lessee shall have 21 calendar days
after receipt of test deliverables to provide MFN written notice of any bona
fide determination by Lessee that the Lessee Fiber does not meet the Fiber
Testing Specifications. Such notice shall identify the specific data that
indicate a failure or other specific reasons that such Lessee Fiber fail to meet
the Fiber Testing Specifications.

         (c) RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS. Upon receiving written notice from Lessee
pursuant to Section 5.3(b), MFN shall either: (i) expeditiously take such action
as shall be reasonably necessary to cause such portion of the Lessee Fiber to
meet the Fiber Testing Specifications and then re-test the Lessee Fiber in
accordance with the provisions of this Article; or (ii) provide Lessee written
notice that MFN disputes Lessee's determination that the Lessee Fiber does not
meet the Fiber Testing Specifications. After taking corrective actions and
re-testing the Lessee Fiber, MFN shall provide to Lessee a copy of the new test
deliverables and Lessee shall again have all rights provided in this Article
with respect to such new test deliverables. The cycle described above of
testing, taking corrective action and re-testing shall take place until the
Lessee Fiber is accepted.

         (d) INDEPENDENT TESTING. If MFN provides notice to Lessee pursuant to
Subsection 5.3(c)(ii), Lessee shall within five calendar days of such notice
designate by written notice to MFN the names and addresses of three reputable
and independent fiber optic testing companies. MFN shall designate one of such
companies to conduct an independent re-test of the Lessee Fiber for the relevant
Lessee Fiber. If, after such re-testing, the testing company determines that the
Lessee Fiber so tested: (i) meet the Fiber Testing Specifications, then Lessee
shall pay the testing company's charges for performing the testing and the
Acceptance Date for



                                       9
<PAGE>

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL



the relevant Lessee Fiber shall be 21 calendar days after the date that MFN
originally provided its test deliverables; or (ii) do not meet the Fiber Testing
Specifications, then MFN shall pay the testing company's charges for performing
the testing and shall perform the corrective action and re-testing set forth in
Subsection 5.3(c)(i).

5.4 ACCEPTANCE. Unless Lessee provides a timely written objection pursuant to
Section 5.3, the Acceptance Date for each delivery occurs on the twenty-first
calendar day after the Delivery Date, or, if earlier, the date Lessee (a)
provides written acceptance of the Lessee Fiber or Building or (b) commences use
of the Lessee Fiber or Building. Any failure by Lessee to accept or reject the
Lessee Fiber within the 21-day period, or any use of the Lessee Fiber by Lessee
Fiber for any purpose other than testing, constitutes acceptance for purposes of
this Agreement and Lessee is deemed to have accepted upon such use or on the
22nd day after the Delivery Date.

5.5 AS-BUILT DRAWINGS. MFN will provide to Lessee, within 180 days of the
Acceptance Date, as-built drawings of Lessee Fiber in the format described in
Exhibit D to this Agreement.

5.6 INTRABUILDING EXTENSIONS. Lessee may elect to obtain either fiber optic or
metallic (e.g., coaxial cable or copper twisted pair) extensions between a MFN
Demarcation Point at a Building and another point within the same Building. Upon
written request for either such extension setting forth the design and
terminating location of such extension, MFN shall, at its sole discretion and in
accordance with its then-standard order intervals, either (a) construct a
Lessee-owned riser for a nonrecurring charge equal to its Cost; (b) designate at
least one, but up to three, reputable MFN-approved contractors authorized to
perform such work, in which case MFN shall have no responsibility for such
extension and Lessee shall deal directly with any such contractor for
Lessee-owned risers; or (c) provide MFN-owned riser at MFN's then-current
charge. MFN shall reasonably cooperate with any such approved contractors
selected by Lessee to allow them to perform such work.

5.7 USE OF PARTIALLY COMPLETED SEGMENT. If MFN has not delivered a segment or
ring of Lessee Fiber by the scheduled Delivery Date, but some portions of the
segment are available for use, MFN shall, upon request of Lessee, permit Lessee
to use such available portions and Lessee shall pay a pro rata share of the
lease payment with respect to the Lessee Fibers in such segment. In addition, in
the event that Lessee elects to accept a portion of a segment of Lessee Fiber
prior to the time that a complete segment or ring is available for use, the late
fee payment set forth in Section 5.1 shall be reduced in proportion to the
Lessee Fibers in the segment or ring being utilized.

5.8 EARLY DELIVERY. In the event that MFN has any Lessee Fibers available prior
to the scheduled Delivery Date, MFN may give notice to Lessee, offering to
deliver such Lessee Fibers prior to the scheduled Delivery Date therefore.
Lessee shall advise MFN whether or not Lessee desires to begin using such Lessee
Fibers prior to the scheduled Delivery Date. If Lessee elects to begin such use
prior to the scheduled Delivery Date, the Term of such Lessee Fibers and payment
obligations shall commence upon the actual Acceptance Date thereof.

ARTICLE 6. COLLOCATION AND MAINTENANCE

Collocation, operation and maintenance of the Lessee Fiber is governed by the
Collocation and Maintenance Agreement, dated contemporaneously with this
Agreement.

ARTICLE 7. AUTHORIZATIONS

7.1 MAINTAINING AUTHORIZATIONS. MFN shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain, renew, or replace the Right-of-Way Authorizations during the Term. If
MFN determines it is not commercially reasonable to maintain, renew or replace
any of its existing Right-of-Way Authorizations during the Term, then MFN shall
give notice to Lessee and shall cooperate with Lessee, at Lessee's written
request, to attempt to maintain, renew or replace such Right-of-Way
Authorizations, at Lessee's sole Cost. During the last three years of the Term,
upon written notice from Lessee requesting such information, MFN shall promptly
provide written notice of the status (including any potential or pending
terminations or expirations) of Right-of-Way Authorizations relating to the
Lessee Fiber, including but not limited to whether or not MFN intends to extend
or renew any Right-of-Way Authorizations. In the event that during the Term any
Right-of-Way Authorization expires or is terminated and is not replaced, Lessee
shall have the right upon 30 days prior written notice to MFN, to terminate the
Lease with respect to the Lessee Fiber affected by such expired or terminated
Right-of-Way Authorization. Upon such termination, Lessee's obligation to make
any Lease payments with respect to which the Lease has been terminated shall
expire.

7.2 EXTENSION OF LEASE TERM. To the extent MFN has elected to maintain or extend
or replace Right-of-Way Authorizations with respect to this Lease beyond the
Term, Lessee may request an extension of the Term of such Lease, and MFN agrees
to negotiate with Lessee with respect to such extension, but MFN shall have no
obligation to grant any such extension.

ARTICLE 8. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

ARTICLE 9. INTERCONNECTION OF LESSEE'S SYSTEM

9.1 GENERAL. After the Effective Date, Lessee has the right but not the
obligation to request additional Buildings to be interconnected with the Lessee
Fiber.

9.2 SPLICE POINTS. Except as limited by Section 9.3, MFN will provide Lessee
with access to the MFN System backbone at mutually agreed upon
manholes/handholes ("Splice Point(s)") for the purpose of interconnecting a
Lessee-owned lateral connection to the Lessee Fiber. Upon acceptance of Lessee's
request for a Splice Point, MFN, in its reasonable discretion, will select the
closest serving manhole or handhole. Lessee must provide and install
Lessee-owned manholes/handholes and/or conduit to the selected MFN
manhole/handhole for Splice Point interconnection. MFN or an MFN-approved
contractor will perform all interconnection work,



                                       11

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL



including penetration of the MFN manholes/handholes, installation of the
conduit, and pulling and maintaining the fiber optic cable between Lessee's
facilities and the selected MFN manhole/handhole. All work in MFN
manholes/handholes and splice enclosures, including splicing and
manhole/handhole penetration, will be managed and supervised by MFN. MFN will
then provide a ribbon tie cable between Lessee's facilities and MFN's selected
manhole/handhole, and each party will perform splicing in its own
manhole/handhole. MFN will invoice and Lessee agrees to pay all Costs associated
with MFN's provision of Splice Points, including the cost of the ribbon tie
cable. MFN shall allow Lessee to connect at agreed upon Splice Points at any
time during the Term at no cost to Lessee other than those provided hereinabove.

9.3 DATA CENTER ACCESS. MFN Data Center Access is restricted to Lessee's
provision of dedicated private line transport services to Lessee's customers.
Under no circumstances is Lessee permitted to sell IP transit services or
dedicated dark fiber transactions that originate or terminate in an MFN Data
Center, unless permitted pursuant to a separate agreement with MFN. MFN reserves
the right to inspect Lessee's use of a MFN Data Center at any time, 24 hours per
day, after reasonable notice to Lessee. Any violation of this section is deemed
a material breach of the Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict Lessee from
providing any and all services to Lessee customers in separate space located
outside or within the same building as the MFN Data Center.

Collocation within a MFN Data Center facility is pursuant to separate
collocation license agreement executed between the Parties.

9.4 DEMARCATION POINT.

         (a) BUILDINGS. The Demarcation Point for a Building shall be at:

                  (i) MFN's fiber patch panel, the DSX-N panel (as designated by
         MFN), a splice enclosure in the basement or MFN closest serving manhole
         serving the Building; provided, however, that MFN agrees to provide
         conduit connectivity to Lessee at all non-ILEC Buildings; or

                  (ii) the demarcation point mandated by the agreement between
         Lessor and the ILEC; and, to the extent Lessor is later allowed to
         install or access a fiber patch panel or DSX-N panel inside of the
         Building, such point shall become the Demarcation Point if mutually
         agreeable and Lessor agrees to deliver Lessee's Fiber to such point.

(b) SPLICE POINTS. The Demarcation Point for each Splice Point is at the
Lessee-provided manhole/handhole unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties.

9.5 ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON INTERCONNECTION RIGHTS. Lessee's exercise of the
interconnection right set forth in Section 9.2 shall be subject to any
prohibitions or restrictions in



                                       12
<PAGE>

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL



MFN's Right-of-Way Authorizations. Lessee may not establish an interconnection
that MFN, in its reasonable discretion (applied without unreasonable
discrimination with respect to interconnections made by MFN or third parties),
determines is likely to materially and adversely affect the MFN System.

9.6 FACILITIES OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL. Lessee shall retain ownership of any
portion of facilities on its side of the Demarcation Point during the Term of
this Agreement and MFN shall have no obligation to maintain, repair, relocate,
or monitor such Lessee facilities (including any fiber drop facilities
established pursuant to Section 9.3). Lessee shall not access a splice, splice
box, splice vault, or similar facility interconnecting with MFN's System. MFN
shall perform any work required with respect to such splice facilities and may
invoice Lessee for the Cost of performing such work at the request of Lessee
(except to the extent the work relates to the termination in a Building).

9.7 LESSEE RESPONSIBILITY. Subject to the provisions herein, Lessee shall be
responsible for obtaining the rights required and for all costs of:

         (a) obtaining rights of way within or beyond MFN's Right-of-Way
         Authorizations;

         (b) obtaining building access, entry rights, ducts, or riser cables to
         interconnect in buildings or any access beyond MFN's Demarcation Point
         with respect to a Building;

         (c) providing all Equipment and MFN-approved materials to construct and
         install each interconnection, including cables and conduit and any
         labor charges associated therewith; and

         (d) bringing facilities to and connecting them with MFN's System.

9.8 THIRD PARTY RELATIONS. If necessary, and where applicable, MFN shall assist
Lessee, at Lessee's Cost, in obtaining from any land or building owner, MFN, or
private or governmental right-of-way owner, any rights required to access and
exit interconnection points. Lessee shall use reasonable efforts to avoid
damaging the relationships between MFN and such third parties.

ARTICLE 10.  USE OF THE LESSEE FIBER

10.1 OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH LAWS; EXCLUSIVE USE. Lessee shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable government codes, ordinances, laws, rules,
regulations, Right-of-Way Authorizations and/or restrictions in its use of MFN's

other taxes assessed based upon revenues Lessee receives due to its use of the
Lessee Fiber.

14.3 RIGHT TO CONTEST TAXES. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, a party shall have the right by appropriate proceedings brought in
good faith to protest the imposition and/or amount of any taxes or franchise,
license or permit fees imposed on or assessed against it. In such event, the
protesting party shall indemnify and hold the other party harmless from any
expense, legal action or cost, including reasonable attorney's fees, resulting
from the protesting party's exercise of its rights hereunder.

14.4 PROHIBITION ON AGREEMENTS AFFECTING OTHER PARTY. Without the prior consent
of Lessee, MFN shall not enter into any agreement that would have the effect of

Agreement or the service to be provided hereunder, as well as any financial or
business information of either party are confidential ("Confidential
Information"). Such Confidential Information shall be held in confidence, and

for its intended purpose, and such Confidential Information, including all
copies thereof, shall be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed after the
receiving party's need for it has expired or upon the request of the disclosing
party. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced except to the extent
necessary to accomplish the purposes and intent of this Agreement, or as

receiving party; (b) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a governmental or
judicial rule, order or regulation; (c) the recipient of the Confidential
Information independently develops; (d) becomes available to the receiving party
without restriction from a third party; (e) is required by its lender and is
given to such lender on a confidential basis; or (f) is subject to "due

securities having a market value of at least $100 million) and is given to such
potential acquirer on a confidential basis.

16.2 PUBLICITY. Following the Effective Date, the parties shall coordinate and
cooperate with each other when making public announcements or disclosures to any
governmental entities related to the terms of this Agreement and each party
shall have the right to promptly review, comment upon and approve (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) any publicity materials, press
releases or other public statements or disclosures to governmental entities by
the other party that refer to, or that describe any aspect of this Agreement;
provided, however, that no party shall have an approval right with respect to
any public announcements or disclosures to any governmental entities which are,
in the reasonable judgment of the party making such public announcement or
disclosure, required by law.

ARTICLE 17. DEFAULT

17.1 PARTIAL TERMINATION UPON DEFAULT. Either party, upon written notice to the
other party after the other party's default and the other party's failure to
cure any default in the performance of any material obligation hereunder prior
to the end of the applicable cure period, may terminate this Agreement as herein
provided, provided that at the time of termination such default remains uncured:

         (a) MFN may terminate this Agreement, to the extent that Lessee is the
defaulting party; and/or

         (b) Lessee may terminate this Agreement, to the extent that the default
relates to the MFN System (or, at Lessee's election, with respect to any Lessee
Fiber for which the Acceptance Date has not occurred as provided in Article 5),
if MFN is the defaulting party.

17.2 SPECIFIC DEFAULT EVENTS. Events of default shall include but not be limited
to: (a) the making of a general assignment for the benefit of the defaulting
party's creditors; (b) the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy or other insolvency protection against the
defaulting party which is not dismissed within 90 calendar days thereafter; (c)
the filing by the defaulting party of any petition or answer seeking, consenting
to, or acquiescing in reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief; (d) any violation by Lessee of the
restrictions set forth in Section 20.3.

17.3 CURE PERIOD. The cure period applicable to Section 17.1 shall be:





                                       19
<PAGE>

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


         (a) with respect to a default in payment, the period ending ten (10)
business days after a written notice of such default is given;

         (b) with respect to any other default, the period ending 30 calendar
days after a written notice of such default is given, provided, however, that if
such default cannot with reasonable diligence be cured within such 30-day
period, and such other party has commenced to effect a cure immediately upon
receipt of such notice, and diligently pursues such cure, then such cure period
will be extended for a period reasonably required to cure such default but in no
event more than an additional 30 calendar days.

17.4 FAILURE TO CURE. Upon the failure by the defaulting party to timely cure
any such default after notice thereof from the other party, the other party may,
subject to the provisions of Section 19, take such action as it determines, in
its sole discretion, to be necessary to correct the default, and pursue any
legal remedies it may have under this Agreement, applicable law, or principles
of equity relating to such breach.

17.5 WAIVER OF SPECIFIC DEFAULTS. Any event of default by the defaulting party
may be waived under the terms of this Agreement at the other party's option. Any
such waiver shall be in writing.

17.6 DISPUTED AMOUNTS. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article,
failure to pay an amount subject to a bona fide dispute shall not be an event of
default (until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Article 19 or otherwise) to
the extent the disputed amount is (a) less than $100,000 or (b) paid into an
escrow account of a nationally chartered domestic bank with offices in New York
pending resolution of the dispute. The interest rate set forth in Section 11.2
shall apply to amounts so withheld or paid into escrow by one party and later
awarded to the other party, but the party paying such amounts into escrow shall,
upon closing of an escrow account, be entitled to any interest received from,
and responsible for paying any fees charged by, the bank holding the escrow
funds.

ARTICLE 18. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party shall be in default under this Agreement with respect to any delay
in such party's performance (other than the payment of monetary amounts due
under this Agreement) caused by any of the following conditions: act of God,
fire, flood, material shortage or unavailability not resulting from the
responsible party's failure to timely place orders therefor, lack of
transportation, government codes, ordinances, laws, rules, regulations or
restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any other cause beyond the reasonable
control of such party, provided that the party claiming relief under this
Section shall promptly notify the other in writing of the existence of the event
relied on and the cessation or termination of said event. The party claiming
relief under this Section shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the time for any such delay.

ARTICLE 19. ARBITRATION

19.1 OBLIGATION TO ARBITRATE. Any dispute or disagreement relating to this
Agreement or any matter arising between Lessee and MFN in connection with this
Agreement which is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of Lessee and MFN
within 30 calendar days from the date that either party informs the other in
writing that such dispute or disagreement exists, shall be settled by
arbitration by a single arbitrator in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect
on the date that such notice is given. If the parties are unable to agree on a
single arbitrator within fifteen calendar days, the American Arbitration
Association shall select an arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the parties and shall include written findings of law and
fact, and judgment may be obtained thereon by either party in a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and
presenting its own case. The cost of the arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties unless the
award otherwise provides.

19.2 EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION OBLIGATION. The obligation herein to arbitrate
shall not be binding upon any party with respect to requests for preliminary
injunctions, temporary restraining orders or other procedures in a court of
competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such
court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending
resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute.

ARTICLE 20. ASSIGNMENT

20.1 RESTRICTIONS ON ASSIGNMENT. Except as provided in the second sentence of
this Section, neither party shall assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or
its rights or obligations hereunder to any other party without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Either party shall have the right, without the other party's consent,
to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement in whole or in part as collateral
to any lender or to any of its Affiliates or to any corporation into which it
may be merged or consolidated or which purchases all or substantially all of its
assets.

20.2 AGREEMENT BINDS SUCCESSORS. This Agreement and each of the party's
respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and each of their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment or transfer shall be
subject to the other party's rights under this Agreement and any assignee or
transferee shall continue to perform the assigning party's obligations under
this Agreement.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                          FIBER TESTING SPECIFICATIONS

MFN will perform fiber testing, as described below, on each Leased Fiber and
will provide documentation of these test results to the Customer via e-mail.
Each "span" will be defined in documentation included in the Customer's package.
Acceptance of a span by Customer will be an acknowledgement by the Customer that
all Leased Fiber complies with all performance criteria contained herein and
performs within the parameters of the fiber manufacturer's specifications.

1)       POWER TESTING: This end-to-end loss measurement will be conducted for
         each Leased Fiber in the span and from both directions using an
         industry-accepted laser source and power meter. The bi-directional
         average will be used to determine the end-to-end loss of the span at
         each appropriate wavelength. This test will be conducted at both 1310
         nm and 1550 nm for Standard Single Mode Fiber; Dispersion Shifted Fiber
         (True WaveTM, LEAFTM, etc.) will be tested at 1550 nm only. In the
         event that a span consists of both Standard Single Mode and Dispersion
         Shifted fiber types, only 1550 nm testing will be conducted. This power
         testing will ensure fiber continuity and the absence of crossed fibers
         in the span. Power testing will only be conducted where the Leased
         Fiber is terminated by MFN in fiber distribution panels at both ends of
         the span.

2)       OTDR TESTING: This testing will be conducted at both 1310 nm and 1550
         nm wavelengths when the Leased Fiber consists of Standard Single Mode
         Fiber, but will be done at 1550 nm only if the Leased Fiber consists of
         either Dispersion Shifted Fiber (True-WaveTM, LEAFTM, etc.) or a
         combination of Single Mode and Dispersion Shifted fiber types.

         OTDR testing will be conducted on a bi-directional basis for each
         Leased Fiber in each span at the appropriate wavelengths for the Leased
         Fiber described above. However, if due to length or attenuation reasons
         that the Leased Fiber span exceeds the dynamic range of an OTDR, a
         portion or the entire span may be tested on a unidirectional basis
         only. Alternatively, the Leased Fiber span may be divided into shorter
         testing spans, to the extent reasonably possible, in order to obtain
         bi-directional analysis. Also, in instances where a Customer intends to
         accept Leased Fiber that is not terminated at one end by MFN in a fiber
         distribution panel (such as in a manhole or handhole) only
         unidirectional testing will be performed.

         The turnover documentation package delivered to Customer will contain
         the actual traces that detail the testing parameters (including pulse
         width, averaging and range). The average bi-directional splice loss for
         all splices within each span will be of 0.15 dB or less while each
         connector pair (such as at a FDP) will have an average bi-directional
         loss of 0.5 dB or less. (Note that the front and end connector of the
         span can only be measured uni-directionally and will also have a loss
         equal to or less than 0.5 dB). In the event that OTDR acceptance
         testing must be done on a unidirectional basis (for reasons described
         above), an average per span splice loss will be 0.30 dB.

         If the average bi-directional splice loss of each span exceeds 0.15 dB
         (or 0.30 dB uni-directionally), MFN will provide upon the Customer's
         request documentation of at a least three attempts to reduce this value
         to below 0.15 dB (0.30 dB uni-directionally). The only exception to
         this will be in the instance of a splice between two different fiber
         types (Standard Single-mode to Dispersion Shifted, Depressed-Clad to
         Matched Clad, fibers with different mode-field diameters).

Customer should also note that the loss and/or reflectance of the front-end
connector (as measured using a launch cord) is only an indicator of a problem
such as a defective port, bulkhead, or the like. Since a different patch cord
will be used by Customer (that connects to their equipment, for example) to mate
to this connector, a different loss and/or reflectance may occur.

     between the fiber optic cable and other utility or structure cannot be
     obtained, then the fiber optic cable shall be encased in steel pipe.

o    In rock, the fiber optic cable, conduit or inner duct shall be placed to
     provide a minimum of 18 inches below the surface of the solid rock, or
     provide a minimum of 42 inches of total cover, whichever requires the least
     amount of rock excavation. For cover depths of 18 inches to 24 inches,
     steel pipe is required. Cover depths of 24 inches or greater do not require
     steel pipe.

o    In the case where existing steel pipelines, ducts or conduits are to be
     utilized, the existing depth shall be considered as adequate.

4.0  BURIED CABLE WARNING TAPE.

o    All fiber optic cable, conduit and inner duct shall be installed with
     buried cable (stretch Type) warning tape except where existing steel
     pipelines, conduits or other salvaged conduit systems are used. The warning
     tape as specified earlier in this document shall be placed as follows. One
     layer of warning tape shall be placed directly on top of the fiber optic
     cable, conduit or inner duct. A second layer of warning tape shall be
     placed at a depth of 12 inches below grade.

5.0  CONDUIT/INNER DUCT CONSTRUCTION.

o    All conduits or inner ducts may be placed and installed by means of
     trenching, plowing, jack and bore, mini-directional bore or directional
     bore. All conduits or inner ducts will generally be placed on level grade,
     parallel to the surface and with only gradual changes in grade elevation.

CONFIDENTIAL PORTION MARKED [*************] HAS BEEN OMITTED PURSUANT TO A
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

                       FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT (this "Amendment") is made by and between
METROMEDIA FIBER NETWORK SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("MFN") and
WILLIAMS COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Lessee").

                                   Background

Lessee and MFN are parties to the Lease Agreement dated April 26, 2002 (the
"Agreement").

On May 20, 2002, MFN and most of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries
each filed voluntary petitions for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") with the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy
Court") and MFN is currently operating its business and managing its property as
a debtor-in-possession (the "Pending Bankruptcy Case").

The parties now wish to amend the Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Amendment.

NOW THEREFORE, for mutual consideration, the value of which the parties
acknowledge, the terms of the Agreement are amended as follows:

1. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment have the meaning
ascribed in the Agreement.

2. The definition of "Term" is deleted and replaced with the following:

"'TERM' begins on the date of full execution of the First Amendment to this
Agreement and includes the initial term and any subsequent renewal terms."

3. Section 3.1 is deleted and replaced with the following:

"During the Term, unless otherwise converted to an IRU pursuant to Section 3.6,
MFN grants to Lessee a Lease in 30,740 fiber miles in the MFN System (the
'Lessee Fiber'). The Lessee Fiber is identified by segment in Exhibit B-1.
Lessee agrees to pay the fees set forth in Section 4.1 for the Lessee Fibers.

4. The following Section 3.6 is added to the Agreement:

"TERM. The initial term of the agreement expires [*********] years after the
effective date of the First Amendment to this Agreement, with [***************]
renewal periods. Unless Lessee provides a minimum of 60 days notice of
termination prior to the expiration of the then-current term, the Agreement
automatically renews under the same terms and conditions."

5. EXHIBITS B AND C are wholly replaced with EXHIBIT B-1 AND C-1, attached to
this Amendment.

6. The following Section 17.7 is added to the Agreement:

"CROSS DEFAULT. MFN and Lessee are parties to a second Lease Agreement dated
April 26, 2002 pursuant to which MFN is the lessee (the "Longhaul Agreement").
The parties agree that a default under the Longhaul Agreement is deemed a
default under this Agreement, giving the non-defaulting party the right to
terminate if the Longhaul Agreement is likewise terminated. The right to
terminate under this Section 17.7 automatically expires if the non-defaulting
party does not provide notice, within 60 days of termination of the Longhaul
Agreement, of its intent to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement. Such
termination shall be effective 120 days after such notice, if given.

7. Section 20.3(b) is deleted and replaced with the following:

8. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION; PRE-PETITION CURE. The parties agree to effect a
pre-petition netting in Bankruptcy Court for all pre-petition amounts owed
between Metromedia Fiber Network Services, Inc., Metromedia Fiber National
Network, Inc.(together "Debtor"), and Williams Communications, LLC. The parties
acknowledge and agree, that after netting, Debtor owes Williams Communications,
LLC [*************] in pre-petition obligations (the "Prepetition Debt"). As
full satisfaction of the Prepetition Debt, Debtor agrees to provide to Williams
a credit against monthly invoices issued under the Agreement over the initial
3-year term as follows:

      o     months 1-12 [*******] per month

      o     months 13-24 [*******] per month

      o     months 24-36 [*******] per month

9. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Amendment is effective upon the date of the last
signature hereto ("Effective Date"). The parties agree that the new billing rate
as specified in paragraph 3 of this Amendment is effective October 1, 2002. To
be sure, any invoices rendered during September

EXECUTION COPY

2002 for October services, will be adjusted accordingly. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge that the Amendment must be approved by the
Bankruptcy Court pursuant to an order, in form and substance acceptable to
Lessee and MFN, which provides for, among other things, the following: (i)
assumption of the Agreement, as amended, pursuant to section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) a finding that the parties negotiated the Amendment at
arm's length and in good faith. If such approval is not obtained on or before
October 17, 2002 or such later date as the parties may agree to, this Amendment
will be null and void and of no force or effect and Lessee agrees to pay the
difference between the amended amounts invoiced for October and the actual
amounts owed under the Agreement.

10. ASSUMPTION AND WAIVER OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS. If following the assumption of the
Agreement:

         (a) one or more metro fiber rings currently operated by MFN on which
Lessee has Lessee Fiber, is effectively abandoned because MFN elects no longer
to operate those markets and the markets are sold to a third party, then any
damage claim of Lessee arising from the effective abandonment of any such market
is a general unsecured claim in the Pending Bankruptcy Case; and/or

         (b) one or more, but less than all, MFN's metropolitan networks are
sold to a third party who intends to operate such networks, then, subject to
Lessee's rights under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as described below,
Lessee and MFN will execute a new agreement in all respects identical to the
existing Agreement but which includes only the Lessee Fiber in markets sold to a
third party. The new agreement may be assigned by MFN to the third party
pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the existing Agreement will
be deemed amended to eliminate the assigned Lessee Fiber from its scope. The
occurrence of events contemplated by this subparagraph is not a breach by MFN of
the Agreement and will not give rise to a claim. Lessee may object to any
assignment pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code on the grounds that
Lessee is not receiving adequate assurance of future performance or that an
assignment to the third party assignee in question is otherwise not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code; provided, however, that in the event Lessee's
objection to such assignment is sustained but the relevant network is
nevertheless sold to the third party, the parties agree that damages, if any,
arising from the breach resulting from MFN's inability to provide service to
Lessee under the Agreement with respect to the networks sold to the third party,
will be a general unsecured claim in the Pending Bankruptcy Case; or

                  ARTICLE III. GRANT OF LICENSE AND COLLOCATION

3.1 GRANT OF LICENSE.

nature in Provider's real or personal property. Customer shall provide,
maintain, and for all purposes be solely responsible for all Customer Equipment
at Collocation Sites.

         (b) Customer shall have the exclusive right to use the rack space

firm or entity, without the prior written consent of Lessor.

3.2 COLLOCATION SITES. Provider agrees to provide and Customer agrees to pay for
the Collocation Sites and corresponding number of racks identified in Exhibit A
in each of Provider's Collocation Sites. From time to time, Customer may order

48v DC power per rack (collectively, the "Basic Services"). A rack space shall
be adequate to contain a rack (measuring 26 inches (width) x 24 inches (depth) x
78 or 84 inches (height)). The total linear inches for Customer rack space
within each location shall not exceed the sum of the number of rack spaces for
such location multiplied by 26 inches. To the extent Provider has additional
available and uncommitted collocation space and power at the Collocation Sites,
Customer may order additional Basic Services. Customer shall use the standard

request, Provider shall notify Customer whether the Additional Services are
available and, if they are, Provider's standard rates for the Additional
Services as set forth in Section 2.2(b). Customer shall provide written notice
to Provider confirming its request for such Additional Services at the quoted
rates prior to Provider providing such Additional Services. If upgrades or
expansions to a Collocation Site or its facilities are necessary to accommodate
Customer's request, Provider may charge the entire Costs of such upgrades or
expansions to Customer to be paid in advance.

delivered, installed, and maintained in a safe condition and meeting or
exceeding the standards of Provider. Provider shall allow Customer reasonable
access to each Collocation Site for purposes of installing Customer Equipment,
provided that, if a Collocation Site is not ready for installation of equipment
other than security, alarm, HVAC, power, back-up power or other common systems
on such date, Provider shall allow such access



                                       7
<PAGE>

EXECUTION COPY                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

within five (5) days of the first date such Collocation Site is ready for such
installation. Provider shall provide Customer with at least thirty (30) days
notice prior to the date it estimates each Collocation Site will be ready for
installation of Customer Equipment.

3.6 ALARMS.

         (a) Provider shall continuously monitor Collocation Site security,
environmental, and power alarms at one or more manned monitoring centers. At
Customer's request, Provider shall establish procedures to allow Customer, at

security and environmental alarm information where technically feasible.

         (b) Each Party shall promptly notify the other of any matters
pertaining to any damage or impending damage to or loss of the use of
Collocation Site or surrounding premises that are known to it and that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Collocation Site.

3.7 COLLOCATION SITE MAINTENANCE. Customer shall provide all maintenance and
repair of Customer Equipment. Any improvement, modification, addition to,
relocation, or removal of Customer Equipment, shall be subject to Provider's
prior review and written approval. Customer shall pay the cost of such

Equipment. Provider's approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Provider's
maintenance responsibility shall be limited to the demarcation point and the
associated cross connect at that point.

3.8 USE OF CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT.

equipment that overloads any electrical paneling, circuitry, or wiring.

         (b) STANDARDS. Customer shall ensure that Customer Equipment is
installed, operated, and maintained to meet or exceed any reasonable
requirements of Provider, any requirements of Provider's building management or
insurance underwriters, and any applicable local, state and federal codes and
public health and safety laws and regulations (including fire regulations and
the National Electric Code).

         (c) INTERVENTION. If any part of the Customer Fibers or Customer
Equipment is not placed and maintained in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and Customer fails to correct the violation within
(i) ten (10) days if the violation creates a life safety hazard, or (ii) thirty
(30) days for any other violation, each from receipt of written notice thereof
from Provider, then Provider may, at its option, without further notice to
Customer, correct the deficiency at Customer's expense without liability (except
to the extent the Agreement permits recovery for Provider's gross negligence)
for damages to the fiber, Customer Equipment or for any interruption of
Customer's services. As soon as practicable thereafter, Provider shall advise
Customer in writing of the work performed or the action taken. Customer shall
reimburse Provider for all Costs reasonably incurred by Provider associated with
any work or action performed by Provider pursuant hereto.

         (d) THREAT TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY. If Provider determines that
Customer's actions or failure to fulfill an obligation of this Agreement, or its
Customer Equipment poses an immediate threat to the safety of Provider's
employees or the public, interferes with the performance of Provider's service


                                       8
<PAGE>

EXECUTION COPY                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

obligations, or poses an immediate threat to the physical integrity of
Provider's facilities, Provider may perform such work and/or take such action
that it deems necessary without notice to Customer and without subjecting itself
to any liability (except to the extent the Agreement permits recovery for
Provider's gross negligence) for damage to the fiber, Customer Equipment or for
any interruption of Customer's services. As soon as practicable thereafter,
Provider shall advise Customer in writing of the work performed or the action
taken. Customer shall reimburse Provider for all expenses reasonably incurred by
Provider associated with any work or action performed by Provider pursuant
hereto. Customer shall remit payment to Provider within thirty (30) calendar
days from its receipt of Provider's invoice therefor.

3.9 ACCESS TO COLLOCATION SITE. Provider shall provide Customer with escorted
twenty-four hour access to Customer's assigned racks and, as reasonably
necessary, other portions of Provider's common space. Customer agrees to pay the
fees set forth in Section 2.2(d) for escorted access. To obtain such access,
Customer shall provide Provider with reasonable advance notice and Provider
shall provide escorted access. Provider shall use reasonable efforts to respond
to emergency requests for such access.

         (a) NOTICE. Customer shall notify Provider Network Operations Center
prior to entering a Collocation Site and shall comply with any reasonable
Provider notice procedures.

         (b) SECURITY. Customer shall abide by Provider's reasonable security
requirements. When deemed appropriate by Provider, Customer employees,
customers, or representatives shall be issued passes or visitor identification
cards which must be presented upon request before entry to Collocation Sites and
surrendered upon demand or upon termination of the Agreement. Such passes or
other identification shall be issued only to persons meeting any reasonable
security criteria applicable at the relevant Collocation Site for such purpose.
Nothing in this Subsection shall be construed as preventing Customer from having
twenty-four hour escorted access to Collocation Sites.

         (c) RIGHT TO TERMINATE INDIVIDUAL'S ACCESS. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Provider shall, without threat of liability, have
the right to immediately terminate the right of access of any Customer personnel
or representative should it determine in its sole discretion for any lawful
reason that termination of such access is in its best interest. Provider shall
promptly notify Customer of any such termination, and Customer shall have a
reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that the terminated rights of access
should be reinstated. Any termination of a specific individual's access shall
remain in effect pending Provider's final determination as to the advisability
of such reinstatement.

         (d) REMOVAL OF CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT. Within sixty (60) days after the end
of the Term or Customer's abandonment of any collocation arrangement at a
Collocation Site, Customer shall remove all Customer Equipment from the System
or any other Provider facilities at Customer's sole cost under Provider's
supervision. Customer shall provide Provider with at least sixty (60) days'
notice prior to such removal. If Customer fails to remove the same within said
sixty-day period, Provider shall either:

        (i) remove Customer's Equipment and issue an invoice to Customer for the
     cost of removal and storage; or

EXECUTION COPY                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

        (ii) notify Customer that Provider elects to take ownership of such
    abandoned Customer Equipment, in which case Customer shall execute a bill of
    sale or other document evidencing Provider's title to such Customer
    Equipment.

such a manner as will best enable it to fulfill its own service requirements is
in no manner limited by this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement.

any part of the Collocation Sites; provided that Customer shall have the right
to have one or more of its employees or representatives present during the time
of any such inspection. Provider shall give Customer advance notice of such
inspections, except in those instances where Provider determines that safety
considerations justify the need for such an inspection without the delay of
providing notice. The making of periodic inspections or the failure to do so
shall not operate to impose upon Provider any liability of any kind whatsoever
nor relieve Customer of any responsibility, obligation, or liability allocated
to it in this Agreement.

3.12 LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES. Customer shall not have the power, authority or
right to create and shall not permit any lien or encumbrance, including, without
limitation, tax liens, mechanics' liens, or other liens or encumbrances with
respect to work performed, in connection with the installation, repair,
maintenance or operation of its Customer Equipment or other property installed
within the Collocation Site.

3.13 SUBORDINATION. Customer's rights under this Agreement shall be totally
subordinate to any bona fide mortgages, loans, deeds of trust, or any other
borrowing upon the real or personal property which may be incurred by Provider.
Customer shall sign any such reasonable documents as are necessary to satisfy
any lender, private or institutional, to reflect said subordination.

3.14 INDEPENDENT PARTIES. The presence of a Provider or Customer employee or
representative (as an inspector or otherwise) while an employee or
representative of the other party is at the Collocation Site or performing work
pursuant to this Agreement shall not make either party liable for the actions of
the other party and shall not be deemed to waive the responsibility of either
party to perform its obligations in a safe and workmanlike manner.

shall operate as a limitation on the right of either party hereto to bring an
action for damages against any third person, including indirect, special or
consequential damages, based on any acts or omissions of such third person as
such acts or omissions may affect the construction, operation or use of the

rights of claims, execute such documents and do whatever else may be reasonably
necessary to enable the other party to pursue any such action against such third
person.

10.3 NOTICE. Provider and Customer agree to promptly provide each other with
notice of any claim which may result in an indemnification obligation hereunder.
The Indemnitor may defend such claim with counsel of its own choosing provided
that no settlement or compromise of any such claim shall occur without the
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

10.4 MATERIAL AND CONTINUING OBLIGATION. Each Party's obligation to indemnify,
defend, protect, and save the other Party harmless is a material obligation to
the continuing performance of the other Party's obligations hereunder.

11.1 RESTRICTION ON TYPES OF LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER

ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, INCLUDING DAMAGE OR LOSS OF PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT,

the extent set forth in this Section on behalf of its successors, assigns, and
any entity claiming by, through, or under such party.

11.4 PURSUIT OF ACTIONS AGAINST UNDERLYING LANDLORDS. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article, and only to the extent Provider is
required under the terms and provisions of any underlying lease or agreement to
indemnify an Underlying Landlord from and against any and all claims, suits,
judgments, liabilities, losses and expenses (hereinafter "Lease Claims") arising
out of service interruption, cessation, unreliability of or damage to the
Collocation Site, regardless of whether such Lease Claims arise from the sole or
partial negligence, willful misconduct or other action or inaction of such
Underlying Landlord, Customer hereby releases such Underlying Landlord, and
hereby waives, all Lease Claims arising out of service interruption, cessation,
unreliability of or damage to the Collocation Site regardless of whether such
claims, suits, judgments, liabilities, losses or expenses arise from the sole or
partial negligence, willful misconduct or other action or inaction, of such
Underlying Landlord. Customer shall notify Provider in writing before pursuing
any such Lease Claim against an Underlying Landlord and such notification shall
make specific reference to this provision of the Agreement, and Provider shall
respond in writing within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notification as

specific and umbrella or excess liability policies.

         (b) Worker's Compensation Insurance in amounts required by applicable
law and Employers Liability Insurance with limits not less than $1,000,000 each

endorsement.

         (c) Automobile Liability Insurance with a combined single limit of
$2,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage per occurrence, to include

excess liability policies.

If the Landlord imposes more stringent insurance requirements pursuant to the
relevant lease (as it may be modified from time to time), Customer shall
promptly comply with the Landlord's requirements, after receiving written notice
of such requirements. Provider shall, upon Customer's request, provide a copy of
the relevant provisions of the lease to Customer, to the extent such disclosure
is not prohibited by the terms of the lease.

the foregoing coverages through a claims made policy basis, that party shall
cause such policy or policies to be maintained for at least three years beyond
the expiration of this Agreement.

12.3 WAIVER OF SUBROGATION. The parties shall each obtain from the insurance
companies providing the coverages required by this Agreement a waiver of all

officers, directors, and employees or any other party entitled to indemnity
under this Agreement to the extent of such indemnity.

or negotiating this Agreement a Party learns confidential information regarding
the facilities or plans of the other, the receiving Party shall (a) protect the
confidential information from disclosure to third parties with the same degree

own confidential and proprietary information, but in any case with at least
reasonable care and (b) refrain from using such confidential information except
in negotiating or performing under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a
Party may provide such confidential information to its directors, officers,
members, managers, employees, agents, and contractors, consultants
("Representatives"), Affiliates, contractors, financial institutions, lenders,
Underlying Landlords, potential assignees (who are bound by a written agreement
restricting use and disclosure of confidential information), and Representatives
of Affiliates, in each case whose access is reasonably necessary. Each such
recipient of confidential information shall be informed by the Party disclosing
confidential information of its confidential nature, and shall be directed to
treat such information confidentially and shall agree to abide by these
provisions. In any event, each Party shall be liable (with respect to the other
Party) for any breach of this provision by any entity to whom that Party
discloses confidential information. The terms of this Agreement (but not its
execution or existence) shall be considered confidential information for
purposes of this Article, except as set forth in Section 15.3. The obligations
set forth in this Section shall survive expiration or termination of this
Agreement for a period of two (2) years, except that, with respect to any
confidential information designated by the disclosing Party as a trade secret,
and entitled to protection as such, the obligations set forth in this Section
shall survive such expiration or termination indefinitely.

15.2 PERMITTED DISCLOSURES. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither
Provider nor Customer shall be required to hold confidential any information
that:

         (a) becomes publicly available other than through the recipient;

         (b) is required to be disclosed by a governmental, regulatory
authority, or judicial order, rule, or regulation or proceedings with respect to
this Agreement or a Party's obligations as a publicly held company, provided
that a Party subject to such requirement shall promptly notify the other Party
of such requirement;

         (c) is independently developed by the disclosing Party;

         (d) becomes available to the disclosing Party without restriction from
a third party;

         (e) to the extent disclosure by the receiving Party as required by
applicable law or regulation.

15.3 GOODWILL AND PUBLICITY. Neither Party shall use the name, trade name,
service mark, or trademark of the other in any promotional or advertising
material without the prior written consent of the other. Provided each Party
consents, the Parties shall coordinate and cooperate with each other when making
public announcements related to the terms of this Agreement and each Party shall
have the right to promptly review, comment upon, and approve any publicity
materials, press releases, or other public statements by the other Party that
refer to, or that describe any aspect of, this Agreement.

                  ARTICLE XVI. PROHIBITION ON IMPROPER PAYMENTS

otherwise "improper" purposes. Neither Party shall pay any commission, fees or

for the sole purpose of establishing compliance with such provisions, to the
extent reasonably necessary.

                   ARTICLE XVII. FORCE MAJEURE; EMINENT DOMAIN

17.1 EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. Neither Provider nor Customer shall be in default
under this Agreement with respect to any delay in its performance (other than
the payment of monetary amounts due under this Agreement) caused by any Force
Majeure Event. The Party claiming relief under this Article shall promptly
notify the other in writing of the existence of the Force Majeure Event relied
on, the expected duration of the Force Majeure Event, and the cessation or
termination of the Force Majeure Event. The Party claiming relief under this
Article shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the time for
any such delay.

17.2 EMINENT DOMAIN. Should any portion of a Collocation Site or the Customer
Fibers be acquired by eminent domain, nationalization, or expropriation (each of
which, a "Taking") by any authority or entity possessing such power, then each
Party shall be excused from performance of its obligations to the extent
provided in Section 17.1. Provider shall give Customer notice of any proposed
Taking within fifteen (15) days of Provider itself receiving notice of any
proceedings. In the proceeding for any such Taking or an involuntary
discontinuance of the use of a portion of the Collocation Site or the Customer
Fibers in anticipation of a Taking, the interests of Customer and Provider in
the affected portion shall be severed. Any awards resulting from the proceeding
or otherwise provided shall be allocated between Customer and Provider in
accordance with such interests. In addition, Customer and Provider shall each be
entitled to claim and receive the portion of the total award attributable to its
interest in the affected assets and may claim damages payable on account of
relocation or re-routing expenses relating to the Taking.

                      ARTICLE XVIII. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

18.1 OBLIGATION TO ARBITRATE. Any dispute or disagreement relating to this
Agreement or any matter arising between Customer and Provider in connection with
this Agreement which is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of Customer and
Provider within 30 calendar days from the date that either party informs the
other in writing that such dispute or disagreement exists, shall be settled by
arbitration by a single arbitrator in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect
on the date that such notice is given. If the parties are unable to agree on a
single arbitrator within fifteen calendar days, the American Arbitration
Association shall select an arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the parties and shall include written findings of law and
fact, and judgment may be obtained thereon by either party in a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and
presenting its own case. The cost of the arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties unless the
award otherwise provides.

18.2 EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION OBLIGATION. The obligation herein to arbitrate
shall not be binding upon any party with respect to requests for preliminary
injunctions, temporary restraining orders or other procedures in a court of
competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such
court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending
resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute.

legal rights to anyone not an executing Party of this Agreement except under the

EXECUTION COPY

CONFIDENTIAL PORTION MARKED [*************] HAS BEEN OMITTED PURSUANT TO A
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

            FIRST AMENDMENT TO COLLOCATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT (this "Amendment") is made by and between
METROMEDIA FIBER NETWORK SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Provider") and
WILLIAMS COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Customer").

                                   Background

Provider and Customer are parties to the Collocation and Maintenance Agreement
dated April 26, 2002 (the "Agreement").

On May 20, 2002, Provider and most of its direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries each filed voluntary petitions for reorganization pursuant to
Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. (the "Bankruptcy Code") with
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
"Bankruptcy Court") and Provider is currently operating its business and
managing its property as a debtor-in-possession (the "Pending Bankruptcy Case").

The parties now wish to amend the Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Amendment.

NOW THEREFORE, for mutual consideration, the value of which the parties
acknowledge, the terms of the Agreement are amended as follows:

1. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment have the meaning
ascribed in the Agreement.

2. EXHIBIT A is replaced with EXHIBIT A-1, attached to this Amendment.

3. Section 2.1 is deleted and replaced with the following:

"CHARGES FOR MAINTENANCE. Customer shall pay Provider a maintenance fee of
[*****] per fiber mile, per month for the maintenance services set forth in
Article 6 of this Agreement, such amount totaling [*******] per month (30,740
fiber miles x [**]). Invoices for such maintenance services shall be issued
monthly."

4. Section 2.6 (a) is modified by removing the reference to "PAIX locations' and
2.6(c) is deleted in its entirety.

5. Section 3.1(c) is modified by adding the following sentence at the end:

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer is not entitled to reimbursement or the
cash equivalent of the Rack Credits under any circumstances, including
termination of this Agreement prior to expiration of the Rack Credits."


CONFIDENTIAL

6. Section 3.2 is deleted and replaced with the following:

         "As of the effective date of the First Amendment to this Agreement,
Provider agrees to provide and Customer agrees to pay for the Collocation Sites
and corresponding number of racks identified in EXHIBIT A-1 together with
associated collocation services ordered by Customer. From time to time, Customer
may order additional Basic Services and Additional Services at Provider's
Collocations Sites in accordance with Section 3.5(a).

7. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Amendment is effective upon the date of the last
signature hereto ("Effective Date"). The parties agree that the new monthly
billing rate as specified in paragraph 6 of this Amendment is effective October
1, 2002. To be sure, any invoices rendered during September 2002 for October
services, will be adjusted accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge that the Amendment must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court
pursuant to an order, in form and substance acceptable to Provider and Customer,
which provides for, among other things, the following: (i) assumption of the
Agreement, as amended, pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii)
a finding that the parties negotiated the Amendment at arm's length and in good
faith. If such approval is not obtained on or before October 17, 2002 or such
later date as the parties may agree to, this Amendment will be null and void and
of no force or effect and Customer agrees to pay the difference between the
amended amounts invoiced for October and the actual amounts owed under the
Agreement.

8. ASSUMPTION AND WAIVER OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS. If following the assumption of the
Agreement:

         (a) one or more metro fiber rings currently operated by Provider on
which Customer has collocation racks or fiber, is effectively abandoned because
Provider elects no longer to operate those markets and the markets are sold to a
third party, then any damage claim of Customer arising from the effective
abandonment of any such market is a general unsecured claim in the Pending
Bankruptcy Case; and/or

         (b) one or more, but less than all, Provider's metropolitan networks
are sold to a third party who intends to operate such networks, then, subject to
Customer's rights under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as described below,
Customer and Provider will execute a new agreement in all respects identical to
the existing Agreement but which includes only the markets sold to a third
party. The new agreement may be assigned by Provider to the third party pursuant
to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the existing Agreement will be deemed
amended to eliminate the assigned fiber and collocation racks from its scope.
The occurrence of events contemplated by this subparagraph is not a breach by
Provider of the Agreement and will not give rise to a claim. Customer may object
to any assignment pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code on the grounds
that Customer is not receiving adequate assurance of future performance or that
an assignment to the third party assignee in question is otherwise not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code; provided, however, that in the event Customer's
objection to such assignment is sustained but the relevant network is
nevertheless sold to the third party, the parties agree that damages, if any,
arising from the breach resulting from Provider's inability to provide service
to Customer under the Agreement with respect to the markets sold to the third
party, will be a general unsecured claim in the Pending Bankruptcy Case; or

CONFIDENTIAL

EXECUTION COPY

(c) the Agreement is terminated due to Provider's failure to perform or its
rejection thereof, nothing herein constitutes a waiver of Customer's right to a
general unsecured claim for all outstanding Pre-Petition Debt and an
administrative claim for post-petition damages caused by any breach of the
Agreement, or of the right of Provider or any party in interest to object to any
such claim. Any and all administrative expense claims will require Williams
Communications to satisfy the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code to establish
the claim and is without prejudice to any other party's right to contest such
claim.

9. Except as amended, all of the original terms and conditions of the Agreement
continue in full force and effect, neither party is in currently in default, and
the Agreement, as amended, is hereby ratified and confirmed.

The parties have executed this Amendment on the dates set forth below.

                  ARTICLE 3. GRANT OF LEASE AND BUILDING ACCESS

3.1 GENERAL. From time to time during the Term, Lessee may request to lease
fiber miles and building access from MFN. MFN will respond to all such requests
within 15 days. If the requested fiber miles and/or building access is available
as determined in MFN's good faith reasonable discretion, the parties will
execute "Product Orders". Each fully executed Product Order is automatically
incorporated by reference into the Agreement #2. Each Product Order will set
forth the number of fiber strands (the "Lessee Fiber"), identify Buildings,
state all recurring and non-recurring fees, estimate a Delivery Date and set
forth any other relevant terms agreed upon by the parties.

3.2 FIBER. Lessee is entitled to order a maximum of 42,024 FIBER MILES under
this Agreement #2. Unless otherwise converted to an IRU pursuant to Section 3.5,
MFN grants to Lessee a lease in the Lessee fiber for a period of 20 years
beginning on the Acceptance Date.

At any time during the Term, Lessee may substitute between 6 and 96 Lessee Fiber
for Lessee Fiber in any other segment(s) provided: (i) Lessee Fiber in such
other segment(s) are available as determined in MFN's good faith reasonable
discretion; (ii) such Lessee Fiber have not yet been spliced in order to
establish interconnections by Lessee; (iii) such substitution does not leave
less than 6 fibers in such segment; (iv) Lessee shall be responsible for the
Costs related to the splicing and re-testing arising from Lessee's specific
request for substitution of Lessee Fiber, if applicable (not to include Costs
for splicing or testing for the normal delivery of Lessee Fiber); and (v) though
the number of such substitutions are not limited, Lessee will use reasonable
business judgment to make substitutions based upon a good faith determination of
the need therefore.

3.3 LEASE LIMITATIONS. The Lease granted to Lessee hereunder and any rights
granted by Lessee to third party users, are subject to all Right-of-Way
Authorizations applicable to the MFN System and the Buildings. Lessee will
adhere to the requirements of all such Right-of-Way Authorizations. The Lease of
the Lessee Fiber hereunder does not convey any legal title to any real or
personal property, including the fibers, cable, or the MFN System. This Lease
does not include any Equipment used to transmit capacity over, or to "light,"
the Lessee Fiber.

3.4 BUILDING ACCESS.

         (a) From time to time during the Term, Lessee may request that MFN
connect Lessee Fibers to Buildings under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Within 15 days of Lessee's request, if accepted, MFN will provide
Lessee with its then-current order form specifying the

<PAGE>
EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


Building Access Payment, any non-recurring charges (as set forth in Section 4.3)
and the anticipated Delivery Date of the requested Building (each such order
form a "Product Order"). Lessee must sign the Product Order and return to MFN
within 15 days. All Product Orders signed by both parties are governed by and
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

         (b) MFN shall design, engineer, install, and construct or acquire fiber
and terminate such fiber necessary to provide Building Access. All such
terminations established by MFN within the MFN System shall comply with the
relevant Fiber Testing Specifications (including the splice loss and optical
fiber specifications) set forth in Exhibit A and with relevant
telecommunications industry practices. MFN shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide all Building terminations with Diversity.

         (c) If MFN rejects the Building request or Lessee rejects the Product
Order, Lessee has the option of either:

                  (i) requesting that MFN participate with Lessee in a joint
         construction effort to make such interconnection pursuant to a separate
         agreement negotiated between the parties that shall not require a
         Building Access Payment; or

                  (ii) requesting that MFN construct the lateral connection as
         Lessee's contractor pursuant to a separate agreement negotiated between
         the parties. If MFN accepts, Lessee will own the lateral connection and
         related facilities and Lessee will pay the one time charge for the
         connection at Cost; or

                  (iii) constructing and owning the lateral connection to the
         Building and interconnecting to the MFN backbone at a Splice Point in
         accordance with Section 9.2, below. Lessee, in its good faith
         discretion, may permit MFN to utilize Williams' interconnection
         facilities to connect to a Building. There is no Building Access
         Payment associated with Splice Point interconnection.

3.5 CONVERSION TO IRU. At any time during the Term, upon the request of Lessee
and Lessee's payment to MFN of the net present value of the Lease Payments and
Building Access Payments calculated based upon a mutually agreed upon discount
rate, MFN shall grant to Lessee an Indefeasible Right of Use to the Lessee Fiber
and Building terminations equal to the remaining term of this Agreement #2.

                         ARTICLE 4. CONSIDERATION; FEES

4.1 LEASE PAYMENTS. Lessee shall make monthly payments to MFN in advance during
the Term, in an amount calculated as [*****} PER FIBER MILE PER MONTH based on
the fiber miles set forth in each Product Order ("Lease Payments"). MFN
represents that the fiber miles stated in each Product Order, are either the
actual fiber miles (calculated as the route miles traversed by the Lessee Fiber

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


         (e) The parties agree that MFN may splice up to a full ribbon of cable
at each Building even if Lessee requests interconnection of less than 12 fibers.
Lessee is not obligated to pay the Building Access Payment for any extra fibers
spliced over and above the number of fibers ordered, and Lessee may still port
such fibers under Section 3.1.

4.3. NON-RECURRING CHARGES. Upon Product Order execution, MFN will invoice and
Lessee agrees to pay non-recurring charges agreed upon in the Product Order.
Non-recurring charge will include:

         (a) MFN's Costs associated with splicing, testing and/or constructing
laterals at Buildings provided pursuant to Section 3.4:

         (b) Intra-building riser cabling and construction pursuant to Section
5.6; and

         (c) MFN's Costs associated with Splice Point interconnection pursuant
to Section 9.2.

4.4 ADDITIONAL CHARGES. MFN will invoice and Lessee agrees to pay for all other
additional fees and charges contemplated by this Agreement or set forth in a
signed Product Order for services.

4.5. PAYMENT TERMS. Building Access Payments and Lease Payments commence on the
first day of the month beginning with the month after the Acceptance Date of the
relevant Lessee Fiber and/or Building, except that the first payment shall
include payment from the Acceptance Date to the last day of the month during
which the Acceptance Date occurs, as well as payment for the first full month
after the Acceptance Date. Lessee shall continue making such payments through
the first day of the month in which the Term expires, unless earlier terminated
as herein provided. All payments are payable in accordance with Article 11.

4.6 NO BUILDING ACCESS PAYMENTS AT POPS. MFN will not charge a Building Access
Payment for termination within MFN POPs where Lessee is collocating with MFN, or
at Lessee's POPs. Lessee will pay other recurring charges and nonrecurring
charges associated with services rendered by MFN at MFN POPs. In addition,
provided that Lessee is making Building Access Payments in connection with any
Building, Lessee shall have the right to route other interconnections through
the Demarcation Point for such Building without paying any additional Building
Access Payment. To be sure, however, MFN is not obligated to provide Williams
with any intra-building riser fiber to facilitate Lessee's other
interconnections.

                       ARTICLE 5. DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

5.1 DELIVERY. MFN will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Lessee
Fiber and Buildings by the date stated in a Product Order. In the event MFN
anticipates a failure to deliver all or a portion of the Lessee Fiber or

Date for any segment of Lessee Fiber or a Building is in fact delayed, such
delay will be considered a triggering event for the accrual of liquidated
damages to the Lessee as follows:

         (a) Subject to subsections (b), (c) and (d) below, and provided the
delay is not caused in whole or in part by Lessee, Lessee is entitled to a
credit against monthly charges in an amount equal to [***] per fiber mile of the
segment of Lessee Fiber for which the Delivery Date is delayed per month until
such time as such segment is delivered, and a credit against monthly charges in
an amount equal to [******] per delayed Building per month until delivered
("Liquidated Damages");

         (b) Liquidated Damages for each segment of Lessee Fiber is limited to
[***] of the present value of the total monthly charges payable based on
[******] per fiber mile (using a discount factor of [***]) associated with the
fiber miles for the delayed segment.
[*******************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
****************************************************]Partial months of delay
will be credited on a daily pro-rated basis;

         (c) Liquidated Damages for Lessee Fiber for all delays are limited to
[***] of the then-current monthly invoicing of [******] per fiber mile to
Lessee. As an example, if MFN is currently billing Lessee [*******] per month,
Lessee is entitled to a maximum of [*******] per month in Liquidated Damages,
regardless of the number of delayed segments;

         (d) Lessee may terminate the Agreement with respect a delayed segment
of Lessee Fiber or a delayed Building upon 15 days prior written notice to MFN,
unless and until delivery actually occurs. Upon termination, Liquidated Damages
will cease to accrue for the terminated segments and/or Buildings, and MFN has
no further payment obligations with respect to such segment.

The parties agree that the Liquidated Damages represent a reasonable estimate of
anticipated damages incurred by Lessee in the event of a delay of a segment of
Lessee Fiber or a Building. The Liquidated Damages and termination of a segment
with a reduction of payment obligations are the sole and exclusive remedies of
the Lessee and the sole and exclusive liabilities of MFN with respect to a
delivery delay, and provided each party has complied with the terms of this
Section 5.1, under no circumstances will a delay in the Delivery Date for a
segment of Lessee Fiber or a Building be considered a default.

5.2 OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE COMPLETION NOTICE. MFN shall promptly notify Lessee in
writing of the date upon which MFN has completed connecting a Building.

5.3 ACCEPTANCE AND TESTING OF FIBERS

         (a) MFN TESTING. MFN shall give notice to Lessee at least 21 days prior
to the date MFN intends to begin testing of Lessee Fiber ("Fiber Acceptance
Testing"). Lessee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to have a
representative present at such Fiber Acceptance Testing.

MFN shall perform Fiber Acceptance Testing of the Lessee Fiber and provide test
deliverables to Lessee in accordance with Exhibit A. The provisions of this
Subsection 5.3 are intended to apply to the delivery of Lessee Fiber and the
delivery of Buildings and the Acceptance Date for both are conditioned on the
acceptance of such test results.

         (b) OBJECTIONS TO TEST RESULTS. Lessee shall have 21 calendar days
after receipt of test deliverables to provide MFN written notice of any bona
fide determination by Lessee that the Lessee Fiber does not meet the Fiber
Testing Specifications. Such notice shall identify the specific data that
indicate a failure or other specific reasons that such Lessee Fiber fail to meet
the Fiber Testing Specifications.

         (c) RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS. Upon receiving written notice from Lessee
pursuant to Section 5.3(b), MFN shall either: (i) expeditiously take such action
as shall be reasonably necessary to cause such portion of the Lessee Fiber to
meet the Fiber Testing Specifications and then re-test the Lessee Fiber in
accordance with the provisions of this Article; or (ii) provide Lessee written
notice that MFN disputes Lessee's determination that the Lessee Fiber does not
meet the Fiber Testing Specifications. After taking corrective actions and
re-testing the Lessee Fiber, MFN shall provide to Lessee a copy of the new test
deliverables and Lessee shall again have all rights provided in this Article
with respect to such new test deliverables. The cycle described above of
testing, taking corrective action and re-testing shall take place until the
Lessee Fiber is accepted.

         (d) INDEPENDENT TESTING. If MFN provides notice to Lessee pursuant to
Subsection 5.3(c)(ii), Lessee shall within five calendar days of such notice
designate by written notice to MFN the names and addresses of three reputable
and independent fiber optic testing companies. MFN shall designate one of such
companies to conduct an independent re-test of the Lessee Fiber for the relevant
Lessee Fiber. If, after such re-testing, the testing company determines that the
Lessee Fiber so tested: (i) meet the Fiber Testing Specifications, then Lessee
shall pay the testing company's charges for performing the testing and the
Acceptance Date for the relevant Lessee Fiber shall be 21 calendar days after
the date that MFN originally provided its test deliverables; or (ii) do not meet
the Fiber Testing Specifications, then MFN shall pay the testing company's
charges for performing the testing and shall perform the corrective action and
re-testing set forth in Subsection 5.3(c)(i).

5.4 ACCEPTANCE. Unless Lessee provides a timely written objection pursuant to
Section 5.3, the Acceptance Date for each delivery occurs on the twenty-first
calendar day after Delivery Date, or, if earlier, the date Lessee (a) provides
written acceptance of the Lessee Fiber or Building or (b) commences use of the
Lessee Fiber or Building. Any failure by Lessee to accept or reject the Lessee
Fiber within the 21-day period, or any use of the Lessee Fiber by Lessee Fiber
for any purpose other than testing, constitutes acceptance for purposes of this
Agreement #2 and Lessee is deemed to have accepted upon such use or on the 22nd
day after the Delivery Date.

5.5 AS-BUILT DRAWINGS. MFN will provide, within 180 days of the Acceptance Date,
to Lessee as-built drawings of Lessee Fiber in the format described in Exhibit C
to this Agreement.

5.6 INTRABUILDING EXTENSIONS. Lessee may elect to obtain either fiber optic or
metallic (e.g., coaxial cable or copper twisted pair) extensions between a MFN
Demarcation Point at a Building and another point within the same Building. Upon
written request for either such extension setting forth the design and
terminating location of such extension, MFN shall, at its sole discretion and in
accordance with its then-standard order intervals, either (a) construct a
Lessee-owed riser for a nonrecurring charge equal to its Cost; (b) designate at
least one, but up to three, reputable MFN-approved contractors authorized to
perform such work, in which case MFN shall have no responsibility for such
extension and Lessee shall deal directly with any such contractor for
Lessee-owned risers; or (c) provide MFN-owned riser at MFN's then-current
charge. MFN shall reasonably cooperate with any such approved contractors
selected by Lessee to allow them to perform such work.

5.7 USE OF PARTIALLY COMPLETED SEGMENT. If MFN has not delivered a segment or
ring of Lessee Fiber by the scheduled Delivery Date, but some portions of the
segment are available for use, MFN shall, upon request of Lessee, permit Lessee
to use such available portions and Lessee shall pay a pro rata share of the
lease payment with respect to the Lessee Fiber in such segment. In addition, in
the event that Lessee elects to accept a portion of a segment of Lessee Fiber
prior to the time that a complete segment or ring is available for use, the late
fee payment set forth in Section 5.1 shall be reduced in proportion to the
Lessee Fiber in the segment or ring being utilized.

5.8 EARLY DELIVERY. In the event that MFN has any Lessee Fiber available prior
to the scheduled Delivery Date, MFN may give notice to Lessee, offering to
deliver such Lessee Fiber prior to the scheduled Delivery Date therefore. Lessee
shall advise MFN whether or not Lessee desires to begin using such Lessee Fiber
prior to the scheduled Delivery Date. If Lessee elects to begin such use prior
to the scheduled Delivery Date, the Term of such Lessee Fiber and payment
obligations shall commence upon the actual Acceptance Date thereof.

                     ARTICLE 6. COLLOCATION AND MAINTENANCE

Collocation, operation and maintenance of the Lessee Fiber is governed by the
Collocation and Maintenance Agreement, dated contemporaneously with this
Agreement #2.

                            ARTICLE 7. AUTHORIZATIONS

7.1 MAINTAINING AUTHORIZATIONS. MFN shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain, renew, or replace the Right-of-Way Authorizations during the Term. If
MFN determines it is not commercially reasonable to maintain, renew or replace
any of its existing Right-of-Way Authorizations during the Term, then MFN shall
give notice to Lessee and shall cooperate with Lessee, at Lessee's written
request, to attempt to maintain, renew or replace such Right-of-Way
Authorizations, at Lessee's sole Cost. During the last three years of the Term,
upon written notice from Lessee requesting such information, MFN shall promptly
provide written notice of the status (including any potential or pending
terminations or expirations) of Right-of-Way Authorizations


                                       10
<PAGE>
EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


relating to the Lessee Fiber, including but not limited to whether or not MFN
intends to extend or renew any Right-of-Way Authorizations. In the event that
during the Term any Right-of-Way Authorization expires or is terminated and is
not replaced, Lessee shall have the right upon 30 days prior written notice to
MFN, to terminate the Lease with respect to the Lessee Fiber affected by such
expired or terminated Right-of-Way Authorization. Upon such termination,
Lessee's obligation to make any Lease payments with respect to which the Lease
has been terminated shall expire.

7.2 EXTENSION OF LEASE TERM. To the extent MFN has elected to maintain or extend
or replace Right-of-Way Authorizations with respect to this Lease beyond the
Term, Lessee may request an extension of the Term of such Lease, and MFN agrees
to negotiate with Lessee with respect to such extension, but MFN shall have no
obligation to grant any such extension.

                        ARTICLE 8. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

                  ARTICLE 9. INTERCONNECTION OF LESSEE'S SYSTEM

9.1 GENERAL. After the Effective Date, Lessee has the right but not the
obligation to request additional Buildings to be interconnected with the Lessee
Fiber.

9.2 SPLICE POINTS. Except as limited by Section 9.3, MFN will provide Lessee
with access to the MFN System backbone at mutually agreed upon
manholes/handholes ("Splice Point(s)") for the purpose of interconnecting a
Lessee-owned lateral connection to the Lessee Fiber. Upon acceptance of Lessee's
request for a Splice Point, MFN, in its reasonable discretion, will select the
closest serving manhole or handhole. Lessee must provide and install
Lessee-owned manholes/handholes and/or conduit to the selected MFN
manhole/handhole for Splice Point interconnection. MFN or an MFN-approved
contractor will perform all interconnection work, including penetration of the
MFN manholes/handholes, installation of the conduit, and pulling and maintaining
the fiber optic cable between Lessee's facilities and the selected MFN
manhole/handhole. All work in MFN manholes/handholes and splice enclosures,
including splicing and manhole/handhole penetration, will be managed and
supervised by MFN. MFN will then provide a ribbon tie cable between Lessee's
facilities and MFN's selected manhole/handhole, and each party will perform
splicing in its own manhole/handhole. MFN will invoice and Lessee agrees to pay
all Costs associated with MFN's provision of Splice Points including the cost of
the ribbon tie cable. MFN shall allow Lessee to connect at agreed upon Splice
Points at any time during the Term at no cost to Lessee other than those
provided hereinabove.

9.3 DATA CENTER ACCESS. MFN Data Center Access is restricted to Lessee's
provision of dedicated private line transport services to Lessee's customers.
Under no circumstances is Lessee permitted to sell IP transit services or
dedicated dark fiber transactions that originate or terminate in an MFN Data
Center, unless allowed by a separate agreement. MFN reserves the right to
inspect Lessee's use of a MFN Data Center at any time, 24 hours per day, after
reasonable notice to Lessee. Any violation of this section is deemed a material
breach of the Agreement. Nothing herein shall


                                       11
<PAGE>
EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


restrict Lessee from providing any and all services to Lessee customers in
separate space located outside or within the same building as the MFN Data
Center.

Collocation within a MFN Data Center is pursuant to separate collocation license
agreement executed between the Parties.

9.4 DEMARCATION POINT.

         (a) BUILDINGS. The Demarcation Point for a Building shall be at:

                  (i) MFN's fiber patch panel, the DSX-N panel (as designated by
         MFN), a splice enclosure in the basement or MFN closest serving manhole
         serving the Building; provided, however, that MFN agrees to provide
         conduit connectivity to Lessee at all non-ILEC Buildings; or

                  (ii) the demarcation point mandated by the agreement between
         Lessor and the ILEC; and, to the extent Lessor is later allowed to
         install or access a fiber patch panel or DSX-N panel inside of the
         Building, such point shall become the Demarcation Point if mutually
         agreeable and Lessor agrees to deliver Lessee's Fiber to such point.

         (b) SPLICE POINTS. The Demarcation Point for each Splice Point is at
the Lessee-provided manhole/handhole unless otherwise agreed upon by the
parties.

9.5 ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON INTERCONNECTION RIGHTS. Lessee's exercise of the
interconnection right set forth in Section 9.1 shall be subject to any
prohibitions or restrictions in MFN's Right-of-Way Authorizations. Lessee may
not establish an interconnection that MFN, in its reasonable discretion (applied
without unreasonable discrimination with respect to interconnections made by MFN
or third parties), determines is likely to materially and adversely affect the
MFN System.

9.6 FACILITIES OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL. Lessee shall retain ownership of any
portion of facilities on its side of the Demarcation Point during the Term of
this Agreement #2 and MFN shall have no obligation to maintain, repair,
relocate, or monitor such Lessee facilities (including any fiber drop facilities
established pursuant to Section 9.3). Lessee shall not access a splice, splice
box, splice vault, or similar facility interconnecting with MFN's System. MFN
shall perform any work required with respect to such splice facilities and may
invoice Lessee for the Cost of performing such work at the request of Lessee
(except to the extent the work relates to the termination in a Building included
in an executed Product Order).

9.7 LESSEE RESPONSIBILITY. Subject to the provisions herein, Lessee shall be
responsible for obtaining the rights required and for all costs of:

         (a) obtaining rights of way within or beyond MFN's Right-of-Way
Authorizations;

         (b) obtaining building access, entry rights, ducts, or riser cables to
interconnect in buildings or any access beyond MFN's Demarcation Point with
respect to a Building;

         (c) providing all Equipment and MFN-approved materials to construct and
install each interconnection, including cables and conduit and any labor charges
associated therewith; and

         (d) bringing facilities to and connecting them with MFN's System.

9.8 THIRD PARTY RELATIONS. If necessary, and where applicable, MFN shall assist
Lessee, at Lessee's Cost, in obtaining from any land or building owner, MFN, or
private or governmental right-of-way owner, any rights required to access and
exit interconnection points. Lessee shall use reasonable efforts to avoid
damaging the relationships between MFN and such third parties.

                       ARTICLE 10. USE OF THE LESSEE FIBER

10.1 OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH LAWS; EXCLUSIVE USE. Lessee shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable government codes, ordinances, laws, rules,
regulations, Right-of-Way Authorizations and/or restrictions in its use of MFN's
System. Subject to Article 20, Lessee may use the Lessee Fiber for any lawful
telecommunications purpose. MFN shall have no right to use Lessee Fiber during
the Term of this Agreement #2.

10.2 SYSTEM DAMAGE. MFN and Lessee shall promptly notify each other of any
matters pertaining to any damage or impending damage to or loss of the MFN
System that are known to such party. Lessee shall take all commercially
reasonable precautions against, and shall assume liability, subject to the terms
herein, for, any damage caused by it to the MFN System. Lessee shall not use the
Lessee Fiber in a way that interferes in any material way with or materially
adversely affects the use of any fibers of MFN or the MFN System.

10.3 REGULATORY COOPERATION. Each party shall cooperate with and support the
other in complying with any requirements applicable to the MFN System imposed by
any governmental or regulatory agency or authority.

10.4 LIENS. Lessee shall not cause or permit any part of the MFN System to
become subject to any mechanics lien, materialmans lien, vendors lien, or any
similar lien whether by operation of law or otherwise. If Lessee breaches its
obligations under this Section, it shall immediately notify MFN in writing,
shall promptly cause such lien to be discharged and released of record without
cost to MFN, and shall indemnify MFN against all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and court costs at trial and on appeal) incurred in
discharging and releasing such lien.

            ARTICLE 14. TAXES AND FRANCHISE, LICENSE AND PERMIT FEES

14.1 OBLIGATIONS TO PAY RIGHT-OF-WAY CHARGES AND TAXES. The parties acknowledge
that a material premise of this Agreement #2 is that during the Term, MFN shall
obtain, and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, its Right-of-Way
Authorizations at its own cost. MFN shall timely pay any and all (a) taxes,
franchise, license and permit fees based on the physical location of the MFN
System, and/or the construction thereof in or on public roads, highways or
rights-of-way; and (b) Right-of-Way Authorization payments applicable to the
System. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall pay any taxes, franchise,
license and permit fees based upon its Lease or use of Lessee Fiber. Failure to
pay such taxes or payments by the party responsible therefore, which continues
after seven (7) calendar days written notice thereof by the other party, shall
authorize, but not obligate, the other party to make such payments and
responsible party shall reimburse the other party for such payments promptly
upon demand together with interest at the rate set forth in Section 14.2 from
the date that the other party made such payment until reimbursed by the
responsible party.

14.2 OBLIGATION TO TIMELY PAY TAXES BASED ON REVENUES. Except as set forth in
Section 14.1, Lessee shall pay any and all sales, use, income, gross receipts or
other taxes assessed based upon revenues Lessee receives due to its use of the
Lessee Fiber.

14.3 RIGHT TO CONTEST TAXES. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, a party shall have the right by appropriate proceedings brought in
good faith to protest the imposition and/or amount of any taxes or franchise,
license or permit fees imposed on or assessed against it. In such event, the
protesting party shall indemnify and hold the other party harmless from any
expense, legal action or cost, including reasonable attorney's fees, resulting
from the protesting party's exercise of its rights hereunder.

14.4 PROHIBITION ON AGREEMENT AFFECTING OTHER PARTY. Without the prior consent
of Lessee, MFN shall not enter into any agreement that would have the effect of
obligating Lessee to pay additional taxes or franchise, license or permit fees
unless such agreement is required by a government or agency thereof in
connection with the grant of a franchise, license, permit or similar
governmental requirement or required pursuant to a Right-of-Way Authorization.

Agreement #2 or the service to be provided hereunder, as well as any financial

releases or other public statements or disclosures to governmental entities by
the other party that refer to, or that describe any aspect of this Agreement #2;
provided, however, that no party shall have an approval right with respect to

material obligation hereunder prior to the end of the applicable cure period,
may terminate this Agreement #2 as herein provided, provided that at the time of
termination such default remains uncured:

         (a) MFN may terminate this Agreement #2, to the extent that Lessee is
the defaulting party; and/or

         (b) Lessee may terminate this Agreement #2, to the extent that the
default relates to the MFN System (or, at Lessee's election, with respect to any
Lessee Fiber for which the Acceptance Date has not occurred as provided in
Article 5), if MFN is the defaulting party.

17.2 SPECIFIC DEFAULT EVENTS. Events of default shall include but not be limited
to: (a) the making of a general assignment for the benefit of the defaulting
party's creditors; (b) the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy or other insolvency protection against the
defaulting party which is not dismissed within 90 calendar days thereafter; (c)
the filing by the defaulting party of any petition or answer seeking, consenting
to, or acquiescing in reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief; (d) any violation by Lessee of the
restrictions set forth in Section 20.3.

17.3 CURE PERIOD. The cure period applicable to Section 17.1 shall be:

         (a) with respect to a default in payment, the period ending ten (10)
business days after a written notice of such default is given;

         (b) with respect to any other default, the period ending 30 calendar
days after a written notice of such default is given, provided, however, that if
such default cannot with reasonable diligence be cured within such 30-day
period, and such other party has commenced to effect a cure immediately upon
receipt of such notice, and diligently pursues such cure, then such cure period
will be extended for a period reasonably required to cure such default but in no
event more than an additional 30 calendar days.

17.4 FAILURE TO CURE. Upon the failure by the defaulting party to timely cure
any such default after notice thereof from the other party, the other party may,
subject to the provisions of Section 19, take such action as it determines, in
its sole discretion, to be necessary to correct the default, and pursue any
legal remedies it may have under this Agreement #2, applicable law, or
principles of equity relating to such breach.

17.5 WAIVER OF SPECIFIC DEFAULTS. Any event of default by the defaulting party
may be waived under the terms of this Agreement #2 at the other party's option.
Any such waiver shall be in writing.

17.6 DISPUTED AMOUNTS. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article,
failure to pay an amount subject to a bona fide dispute shall not be an event of
default (until such dispute is resolved

EXECUTION COPY                                                      CONFIDENTIAL


pursuant to Article 19 or otherwise) to the extent the disputed amount is (a)
less than $100,000 or (b) paid into an escrow account of a nationally chartered
domestic bank with offices in New York pending resolution of the dispute. The
interest rate set forth in Section 11.2 shall apply to amounts so withheld or
paid into escrow by one party and later awarded to the other party, but the
party paying such amounts into escrow shall, upon closing of an escrow account,
be entitled to any interest received from, and responsible for paying any fees
charged by, the bank holding the escrow funds.

                            ARTICLE 18. FORCE MAJEURE

         Neither party shall be in default under this Agreement #2 with respect
to any delay in such party's performance (other than the payment of monetary
amounts due under this Agreement #2) caused by any of the following conditions:
act of God, fire, flood, material shortage or unavailability not resulting from
the responsible party's failure to timely place orders therefore, lack of
transportation, government codes, ordinances, laws, rules, regulations or
restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any other cause beyond the reasonable
control of such party, provided that the party claiming relief under this
Section shall promptly notify the other in writing of the existence of the event
relied on and the cessation or termination of said event. The party claiming
relief under this Section shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the time for any such delay.

                             ARTICLE 19. ARBITRATION

19.1 OBLIGATION TO ARBITRATE. Any dispute or disagreement relating to this
Agreement #2 or any matter arising between Lessee and MFN in connection with
this Agreement #2 which is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of Lessee and
MFN within 30 calendar days from the date that either party informs the other in
writing that such dispute or disagreement exists, shall be settled by
arbitration by a single arbitrator in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect
on the date that such notice is given. If the parties are unable to agree on a
single arbitrator within fifteen calendar days, the American Arbitration
Association shall select an arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the parties and shall include written findings of law and
fact, and judgment may be obtained thereon by either party in a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and
presenting its own case. The cost of the arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties unless the
award otherwise provides.

19.2 EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION OBLIGATION. The obligation herein to arbitrate
shall not be binding upon any party with respect to requests for preliminary
injunctions, temporary restraining orders or other procedures in a court of
competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such
court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending
resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                          FIBER TESTING SPECIFICATIONS

MFN will perform fiber testing, as described below, on each Leased Fiber and
will provide documentation of these test results to the Customer via e-mail.
Each "span" will be defined in documentation included in the Customer's package.
Acceptance of a span by Customer will be an acknowledgement by the Customer that
all Leased Fiber complies with all performance criteria contained herein and
performs within the parameters of the fiber manufacturer's specifications.

1)   POWER TESTING: This end-to-end loss measurement will be conducted for each
     Leased Fiber in the span and from both directions using an
     industry-accepted laser source and power meter. The bi-directional average
     will be used to determine the end-to-end loss of the span at each
     appropriate wavelength. This test will be conducted at both 1310 nm and
     1550 nm for Standard Single Mode Fiber; Dispersion Shifted Fiber (True
     WaveTM, LEAFTM, etc.) will be tested at 1550 nm only. In the event that a
     span consists of both Standard Single Mode and Dispersion Shifted fiber
     types, only 1550 nm testing will be conducted. This power testing will
     ensure fiber continuity and the absence of crossed fibers in the span.
     Power testing will only be conducted where the Leased Fiber is terminated
     by MFN in fiber distribution panels at both ends of the span.

2)   OTDR TESTING: This testing will be conducted at both 1310 nm and 1550 nm
     wavelengths when the Leased Fiber consists of Standard Single Mode Fiber,
     but will be done at 1550 nm only if the Leased Fiber consists of either
     Dispersion Shifted Fiber (True-WaveTM, LEAFTM, etc.) or a combination of
     Single Mode and Dispersion Shifted fiber types.

     OTDR testing will be conducted on a bi-directional basis for each Leased
     Fiber in each span at the appropriate wavelengths for the Leased Fiber
     described above. However, if due to length or attenuation reasons that the
     Leased Fiber span exceeds the dynamic range of an OTDR, a portion or the
     entire span may be tested on a unidirectional basis only. Alternatively,
     the Leased Fiber span may be divided into shorter testing spans, to the
     extent reasonably possible, in order to obtain bi-directional analysis.
     Also, in instances where a Customer intends to accept Leased Fiber that is
     not terminated at one end by MFN in a fiber distribution panel (such as in
     a manhole or handhole) only unidirectional testing will be performed.

     The turnover documentation package delivered to Customer will contain the
     actual traces that detail the testing parameters (including pulse width,
     averaging and range). The average bi-directional splice loss for all
     splices within each span will be of 0.15 dB or less while each connector
     pair (such as at a FDP) will have an average bi-directional loss of 0.5 dB
     or less. (Note that the front and end connector of the span can only be
     measured uni-directionally and will also have a loss equal to or less than
     0.5 dB). In the event that OTDR acceptance testing must be done on a
     unidirectional basis (for reasons described above), an average per span
     splice loss will be 0.30 dB.

     If the average bi-directional splice loss of each span exceeds 0.15 dB (or
     0.30 dB uni-directionally), MFN will provide upon the Customer's request
     documentation of at a least three attempts to reduce this value to below
     0.15 dB (0.30 dB uni-directionally). The only exception to this will be in
     the instance of a splice between two different fiber types (Standard
     Single-mode to Dispersion Shifted, Depressed-Clad to Matched Clad, fibers
     with different mode-field diameters).

Customer should also note that the loss and/or reflectance of the front-end
connector (as measured using a launch cord) is only an indicator of a problem
such as a defective port, bulkhead, or the like. Since a different patch cord
will be used by Customer (that connects to their equipment, for example) to mate
to this connector, a different loss and/or reflectance may occur.

     conduit or inner duct shall be installed in such a way as to provide a
     minimum of 12 inches of vertical clearance between it and other sub-surface
     utilities or other structures as well as maintain the applicable minimum
     depth requirement. To maintain the minimum applicable depth requirement,
     the fiber optic cable, conduit or inner duct shall be installed under the
     existing utility or other structure. If the 12 inch vertical separation
     between the fiber optic cable and other utility or structure cannot be
     obtained, then the fiber optic cable shall be encased in steel pipe.

o    In rock, the fiber optic cable, conduit or inner duct shall be placed to
     provide a minimum of 18 inches below the surface of the solid rock, or
     provide a minimum of 42 inches of total cover, whichever requires the least
     amount of rock excavation. For cover depths of 18 inches to 24 inches,
     steel pipe is required. Cover depths of 24 inches or greater do not require
     steel pipe.

o    In the case where existing steel pipelines, ducts or conduits are to be
     utilized, the existing depth shall be considered as adequate.

4.0 BURIED CABLE WARNING TAPE.

o    All fiber optic cable, conduit and inner duct shall be installed with
     buried cable (stretch Type) warning tape except where existing steel
     pipelines, conduits or other salvaged conduit systems are used. The warning
     tape as specified earlier in this document shall be placed as follows. One
     layer of warning tape shall be placed directly on top of the fiber optic
     cable, conduit or inner duct. A second layer of warning tape shall be
     placed at a depth of 12 inches below grade.

5.0 CONDUIT/INNER DUCT CONSTRUCTION.

o    All conduits or inner ducts may be placed and installed by means of
     trenching, plowing, jack and bore, mini-directional bore or directional
     bore. All conduits or inner ducts will generally be placed on level grade,
     parallel to the surface and with only gradual changes in grade elevation.

          c)   Developed and/or improved areas.

          d)   High growth areas.

          Note: Railroad right-of-ways are not considered metro areas.

o    All fiber optic cable crossings of major streams, rivers, bays and
     navigable waterways shall be placed in HDPE, PVC or steel conduit.

o    At all other utility or other underground obstacle crossings, the fiber
     optic cable shall be placed in split or solid steel conduit and the conduit
     will extend at least ten (10) feet beyond the edges of the obstacle in both
     directions.

o    All jack and bores will utilize steel conduit.

o    All directional and mini-directional bores will utilize HDPE or steel
     conduit.

o    Fiber optic cable placed in rock will be installed in HDPE, PVC or steel
     conduit.

o    Fiber optic cable placed in swampy or wetland areas will be installed in
     HDPE, PVC or steel conduit.

o    Fiber optic cable placed on bridges shall be installed in steel conduit and
     the conduit shall have expansion joints placed at each structural (bridge)
     expansion joint or at the minimum every 150 feet, whichever is the shorter
     distance.

o    Whenever steel, HDPE or PVC conduit is installed, it must have inner ducts

EXECUTION COPY

CONFIDENTIAL PORTION MARKED [*************] HAS BEEN OMITTED PURSUANT TO A
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

                      FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT #2

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT (this "Amendment") is made by and between
METROMEDIA FIBER NETWORK SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("MFN") and
WILLIAMS COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Lessee").

                                   Background

Lessee and MFN are parties to that certain Lease Agreement #2 dated April 26,
2002 (the "Agreement #2").

On May 20, 2002, MFN and most of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries
each filed voluntary petitions for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") with the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy
Court") and MFN is currently operating its business and managing its property as
a debtor-in-possession (the "Pending Bankruptcy Case").

The parties now wish to amend the Agreement #2 in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Amendment.

NOW THEREFORE, for mutual consideration, the value of which the parties
acknowledge, the terms of the Agreement #2 are amended as follows:

1. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment have the meaning
ascribed in the Agreement #2.

2. The definition of "Term" is deleted and replaced with the following:

"'TERM' begins on the date of full execution of the First Amendment to this
Agreement #2 and includes the initial term and any subsequent renewal terms."

3. Section 3.2 is hereby amended to substitute "54,324 fiber miles" for 42,024
fiber miles in the first sentence.

4. The following Section 3.6 is added to the Agreement #2:

"TERM. The initial term of the agreement expires [*********] years after the
Effective Date of the First Amendment to this Agreement #2, with
[***************] renewal periods. Unless Lessee provides a minimum of 60 days
notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then-current term, the
Agreement #2 automatically renews under the same terms and conditions."

5. Section 4.1 is deleted and replaced with the following:

"Lessee shall make monthly payments to MFN in advance during the Term. Pricing
for new orders, unless otherwise agreed, will be calculated as [******] per
fiber mile per month based on the fiber miles set forth in each Product Order,
provided, however, if Lessee Fiber is designated


CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 1 OF 4

<PAGE>
EXECUTION COPY


in the Product Order as "Unrestricted Fiber" then the pricing for such
unrestricted fiber will be [****] per fiber mile per month ("Lease Payments").
For purposes of the Agreement #2, "Unrestricted Fiber" refers to Lessee Fiber
which may be subleased as dark fiber. Notwithstanding the forging, all Product
Orders are subject to minimum pricing of [******] per month for the first 4
fibers and [******] per month for each additional fiber pair thereafter and
Lessee may not lease more than [***] of its total Lessee Fibers as Unrestricted
Fiber. The right to lease unrestricted fiber automatically terminates upon a
change of control of Lessee; provided, however, that a change of control
resulting from the recapitalization of Lessee's parent company, Williams
Communications Group, Inc. as part of its current Chapter 11 proceedings will
not cause a termination of Lessee's sublease rights so long as Lessee is not
thereafter controlled by a third-party telecommunications provider. MFN
represents that the fiber miles stated in each Product Order, are either the
actual fiber miles (calculated as the route miles traversed by the Lessee Fiber
multiplied by the number of Lessee Fiber on the route) or a bona fide estimate
thereof, such estimate calculated utilizing OTDR distances less ten percent
(10%)."

6. Section 20.3 is deleted and replaced with the following:

"RESTRICTION OF TRANSFER OF DARK FIBER RIGHTS. MFN is providing the Lessee Fiber
for Lessee's exclusive use. Except to the extent Lessee pays for the right to
sublease the Lessee Fiber as contemplated in Section 4.1, Lessee may not
sublease, swap, assign, license, sublicense, sell or share the Lessee Fiber as
"dark fiber," as such term is commonly understood in the telecommunications
industry.

7. The following Section 17.7 is added to the Agreement #2:

"CROSS DEFAULT. MFN and Lessee are parties to a Lease Agreement dated April 26,
2002 pursuant to which MFN is the lessee (the "Longhaul Agreement"). The parties
agree that a default under the Longhaul Agreement is deemed a default under this
Agreement #2, giving the non-defaulting party the right to terminate if the
Longhaul Agreement is likewise terminated. The right to terminate under this
Section 17.7 automatically expires if the non-defaulting party does not provide
notice, within 60 days of termination of the Longhaul Agreement, of its intent
to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement #2. Such termination shall be
effective 120 days after such notice, if given.

7. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Amendment is effective upon the date of the last
signature hereto ("Effective Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge that the Amendment must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant
to an order, in form and substance acceptable to Lessee and MFN, which provides
for, among other things, the following: (i) assumption of the Agreement #2, as
amended, pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) a finding that
the parties negotiated the Amendment at arm's length and in good faith. If such
approval is not obtained on or before October 17, 2002 or such later date as the
parties may agree to, this Amendment will be null and void and of no force or
effect and Lessee agrees to pay the difference between the amended amounts
invoiced for October and the actual amounts owed under the Agreement #2.

8. ASSUMPTION AND WAIVER OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS. If following the assumption of the
Agreement #2:

         (a) one or more metro fiber rings currently operated by MFN on which
Lessee has Lessee Fiber, is effectively abandoned because MFN elects no longer
to operate those markets and the markets are sold to a third party, then any
damage claim of Lessee arising from the effective abandonment of any such market
is a general unsecured claim in the Pending Bankruptcy Case; and/or

         (b) one or more, but less than all, MFN's metropolitan networks are
sold to a third party who intends to operate such networks, then, subject to
Lessee's rights under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as described below,
Lessee and MFN will execute a new agreement in all respects identical to the
existing Agreement #2 but which includes only the Lessee Fiber in markets sold
to a third party. The new agreement may be assigned by MFN to the third party
pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the existing Agreement #2
will be deemed amended to eliminate the assigned Lessee Fiber from its scope.
The occurrence of events contemplated by this subparagraph is not a breach by
MFN of the Agreement #2 and will not give rise to a claim. Lessee may object to
any assignment pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code on the grounds
that Lessee is not receiving adequate assurance of future performance or that an
assignment to the third party assignee in question is otherwise not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code; provided, however, that in the event Lessee's
objection to such assignment is sustained but the relevant network is
nevertheless sold to the third party, the parties agree that damages, if any,
arising from the breach resulting from MFN's inability to provide service to
Lessee under the Agreement #2 with respect to the Lessee sold to the third
party, will be a general unsecured claim in the Pending Bankruptcy Case; or

         (c) the Agreement #2 is terminated due to MFN's failure to perform or
its rejection thereof, nothing herein constitutes a waiver of Lessee's right to
a general unsecured claim for all outstanding Pre-Petition Debt and an
administrative claim for post petition damages caused by any breach of the
Agreement #2, or of the right of MFN or any party in interest to object to any
such claim. Any and all administrative expense claims will require Williams
Communications to satisfy the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code to establish
the claim and is without prejudice to any other party's right to contest such
claim; and/or

9. Except as amended, all of the original terms and conditions of the Agreement
#2 continue in full force and effect, neither party is in currently in default,
and the Agreement #2, as amended is hereby ratified and confirmed.
