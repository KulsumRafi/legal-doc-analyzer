                           from the MSN Search Sitein Japan.

                           If Microsoft fails to deliver the Minimum Queries
                           rendering to the URL http://search.msn.co.jp before
                           December 31, 2003, then the Guaranteed Phase for MSN
                           Japan will extend until all such guaranteed Queries
                           are delivered (the "Guaranteed Phase Extension for
                           MSN Japan"). During the Guaranteed Phase Extension
                           for MSN Japan, Company will not be required to make
                           any additional Guaranteed Payments, but Company will
                           continue to be required to make Revenue Share
                           Payments. Once the Guaranteed Phase for MSN Japan has
                           concluded, Company shall pay Microsoft pursuant to
                           Section 3.2.2 for Gross Revenue from the MSN Search
                           Site in Japan.
