                           LOAN MODIFICATION AGREEMENT


         This Loan Modification Agreement (this "Loan Modification
Agreement") is entered into as of November 7, 2002, by and between SILICON
VALLEY BANK, a California-chartered bank, with its principal place of
business at 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and with a loan
production office located at One Newton Executive Park, Suite 200, 2221
Washington Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02462, doing business under the name
"Silicon Valley East" ("Bank") and NETSCOUT SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware
corporation with offices at 310 Littleton Road, Westford, Massachusetts
01886-4105 ("Borrower").

1. DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS AND OBLIGATIONS. Among other
indebtedness and obligations which may be owing by Borrower to Bank, Borrower is
indebted to Bank pursuant to a certain loan arrangement dated as of March 12,
1998, evidenced by, among other documents, a certain Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement dated as of March 12, 1998 between Borrower and Bank, as
amended by certain Loan Modification Agreements between Borrower and Bank dated
March 11, 1999, March 10, 2000, June 27, 2000, March 9, 2001, August 14, 2001,
September 7, 2001, and March 10, 2002 (as may be amended from time to time, the
"Loan Agreement"). The Loan Agreement established a working capital line of
credit in favor of Borrower in the maximum principal amount of Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000.00) (the "Committed Revolving Line"). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the Loan
Agreement.

Hereinafter, all indebtedness and obligations owing by Borrower to Bank shall be
referred to as the "Obligations".

2. DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL. Repayment of the Obligations is secured by the
Collateral as described in the Loan Agreement (together with any other
collateral security granted to Bank, the "Security Documents").

Hereinafter, the Security Documents, together with all other documents
evidencing or securing the Obligations shall be referred to as the "Existing
Loan Documents".

3. DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS.

                                    (a) Quick Ratio. Borrower shall maintain, as
                                    of the last day of each quarter, a ratio of

                                    December 31, 2002, and (ii) Three Million
                                    One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,100,000.00)
                                    as of the quarter ending March 31, 2003. For

                                    with GAAP."

                  2.       The Compliance Certificate appearing as EXHIBIT C to
                           the Loan Agreement is hereby replaced with the
                           Compliance Certificate attached hereto as EXHIBIT A.

         B. WAIVERS.

                  1.       Bank hereby waives Borrower's existing defaults under
                           the Loan Agreement by virtue of Borrower's failure to
                           comply with the financial covenants set forth in
                           Section 6.7 thereof as of the quarters ending June
                           30, 2002 and September 30, 2002. Bank's waiver of
                           Borrower's compliance of said affirmative covenant
                           shall apply only to the foregoing specific periods.

4. FEES. Borrower shall pay to Bank a modification fee for this Amendment in an
amount equal to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), which fee shall be due on the
date hereof and shall be deemed fully earned as of the date hereof. The Borrower
shall also reimburse Bank for all legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this amendment to the Existing Loan Documents.

5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS: RATIFICATION OF PERFECTION CERTIFICATE. Borrower shall
not, without providing the Bank with thirty (30) days prior written notice: (i)
relocate its principal executive office or keep any Collateral in any additional
locations, or (ii) change its jurisdiction of organization, or (iii) change its
organizational structure or type, (iv) change its legal name, or (v) change any
organizational number (if any) assigned by its jurisdiction of organization.

6. AUTHORIZATION TO FILE. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to file financing
statements without notice to Borrower, with all appropriate jurisdictions, as
Bank deems appropriate, in order to further perfect or protect Bank's interest
in the Collateral.

7. CONSISTENT CHANGES. The Existing Loan Documents are hereby amended wherever
necessary to reflect the changes described above.

8. RATIFICATION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS. Borrower hereby ratifies, confirms, and
reaffirms all terms and conditions of all security or other collateral granted
to the Bank, and confirms that the indebtedness secured thereby includes,
without limitation, the Obligations.

9. NO DEFENSES OF BORROWER. Borrower agrees that, as of this date, it has no
defenses against the obligations to pay any amounts under the Obligations.

10. CONTINUING VALIDITY. Borrower understands and agrees that in modifying the
existing Obligations, Bank is relying upon Borrower's representations,
warranties, and agreements, as set forth in the Existing Loan Documents. Except
as expressly modified pursuant to this Loan Modification Agreement, the terms of
the Existing Loan Documents remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
Bank's agreement to modifications to the existing Obligations pursuant to this
Loan Modification Agreement in no way shall obligate Bank to make any future
modifications to the Obligations. Nothing in this Loan Modification Agreement
shall constitute a satisfaction of the


                                       2


<PAGE>


Obligations. It is the intention of Bank and Borrower to retain as liable
parties all makers of Existing Loan Documents, unless the party is expressly
released by Bank in writing. No maker will be released by virtue of this Loan
Modification Agreement.

11. RIGHT OF SETOFF. In consideration of Bank's agreement to enter into this
Loan Modification Agreement, Borrower and any guarantor hereby reaffirm and
hereby grant to Bank, a lien, security interest and right of setoff as security
for all Obligations to Bank, whether now existing or hereafter arising upon and
against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or hereafter in the
possession, custody, safekeeping or control of Bank or any entity under the
control of Silicon Valley Bank or in transit to any of them. At any time after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, without demand
or notice, Bank may set off the same or any part thereof and apply the same to
any liability or obligation of Borrower and any guarantor even though unmatured
and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing the Obligations.
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE BANK TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH
RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS, PRIOR TO
EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER
PROPERTY OF THE BORROWER OR ANY GUARANTOR, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.

12. JURISDICTION/VENUE. Borrower accepts for itself and in connection with its
properties, unconditionally, the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in any
action, suit, or proceeding of any kind against it which arises out of or by
reason of this Loan Modification Agreement; provided, however, that if for any
reason Bank cannot avail itself of the Courts of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, then venue shall lie in Santa Clara County, California.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE BANK SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION WHICH THE BANK DEEMS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE
ON THE COLLATERAL OR TO OTHERWISE ENFORCE THE BANK'S RIGHTS AGAINST THE BORROWER
OR ITS PROPERTY.

13. COUNTERSIGNATURE. This Loan Modification Agreement shall become effective
only when it shall have been executed by Borrower and Bank (provided, however,
in no event shall this Loan Modification Agreement become affective until signed
by an officer of Bank in California).
