                  held less any amounts otherwise received from the Company in
                  the form of dividends, management fees or otherwise.

in such Non-Defaulting Shareholder the Defaulting Shareholder's Shares.

      (c)   Notice of Intention

The Non-Defaulting Shareholder shall not exercise its recourse under Clause
12.02(a) against the Defaulting Shareholder unless and until it shall have given
to the Defaulting Shareholder written notice of its intention to do so and the
Defaulting Shareholder shall fail to cure its Default within fifteen (15) days
from the date of receipt of such notice.

      (d)   Set-Off

A Non-Defaulting Shareholder may deduct by set-off from the price to be paid for
the Defaulting Shareholder's Shares under Clause 12.02(a) any amount owing by
the Defaulting Shareholder to the Non-Defaulting Shareholder.

12.03 Consequences of Default

      (a)   Status of Defaulting Shareholder

A Shareholder in Default shall, upon the occurrence of the Event of Default,
lose all rights to vote at any Shareholders' meeting. The voting rights of the
Defaulting Shareholder shall be vested in the Non-Defaulting Shareholder or its
nominees and the Defaulting Shareholder shall have no further right to take part
in the management of the Company or decide matters in connection therewith and
the Non-Defaulting Shareholder may decide any matter which is reserved for the
Shareholders hereunder.

      (b)   Forfeiture of Dividends

If a Defaulting Shareholder shall be in Default, so long as any contribution
which such Defaulting Shareholder is required to make pursuant to this Agreement
remains outstanding, such Defaulting Shareholder shall be forfeited of its right
to any dividends from the Company and such dividends shall be held by the
Company in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the Defaulting Shareholder's
delinquent contributions.

      (c)   Restatement in Certain Circumstances

If all contributions and amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement
are made good by a Defaulting Shareholder (with interest as required) within
fifteen (15) days as stipulated under Clause 12.02(c), the Defaulting
Shareholder shall, if it is then not otherwise in Default, be reinstated in its
rights as of the date of such cure.

      (d)   Payments by Non-Defaulting Shareholder

Any amounts paid by the Non-Defaulting Shareholder to make up a delinquent
contribution or payment of the Defaulting Shareholder and not recovered shall,
without prejudice to any other provisions of this Agreement, constitute a debt
due and payable by the Defaulting Shareholder and shall bear interest from the
date the payment was made until the date of payment by the Defaulting
Shareholder at an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate in effect from time to
time during the period plus five (5%) per cent. per annum.

      (e)   Supervision of Operations

Without prejudice to any other right or recourse, if either Shareholder shall be
in Default under Clause 12.01(a), the Non-Defaulting Shareholder may,
immediately reduce, curtail or suspend any Business of the Company. If the
Defaulting Shareholder is not reinstated in its rights under Clause 12.03(c)
within the period allowed for reinstatement, the Non-Defaulting Shareholder may
if it chooses, take such action to protect its interest as it shall deem
appropriate including, without limitation, suspending or ceasing any operations
of the Company or liquidating any Business or property of the Company or any
other action permitted to it under this Agreement or at law.

12.04 Interest

Any sum at any time owing by any party to any other party or to the Company or
otherwise payable under this Agreement between the parties which is not paid
when due shall, without prejudice to any other right or recourse from the
creditor under this Agreement or at law, bear interest from its due date until
payment in full at the Prime Rate plus five (5%) per cent. per annum.

                                     GENERAL

13.01 Remedies Not Exclusive

Any remedy given under this Agreement to a any party shall be in addition to any
other remedy now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or at law. All such
remedies shall be cumulative and the exercise of one shall not be deemed a
waiver of the right to exercise any other or others. No delay or omission in the
exercise of any such remedy and no extension of the time allowed for the making
of any payment due shall impair any such remedy or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any default, Event of Dissolution or Event of Default or any
acquiescence.

13.02 Survival and Indemnity

Each party to this Agreement hereby severally, and not jointly, indemnifies and
saves harmless the other party from and against any loss, liability, damage or
expense arising out of the failure of such party to strictly comply with the
provision of this Agreement. All Clauses required to give full effect to the
meaning and intent of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Clause 7.01 and
Clause 7.02 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Each party hereto agrees with the other party that on receiving notice of, or
becoming aware of any action, cause of action, proceeding, claim or other matter
to which it claims to be entitled to recover against or seek indemnity from the
other party as hereinbefore provided:

      (a)   it shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party
            hereto; and

      (b)   in the event that such matter is an action, cause of action,
            proceeding, claim or demand with respect to which such entitlement
            or indemnity is admitted by the other party, such other party, at
            such other party's election, shall be entitled and permitted to
            assist in or undertake the defence of the same.
