     signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent.

          9. Severability; Headings. Any provision of this Amendment which is
     prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
     jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
     unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
     any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
     invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
     jurisdiction. The section and subsection headings used in this Amendment
     are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the
     construction hereof or to be taken into consideration in the interpretation
     hereof.

     Agreement not expressly referred to herein and shall not be construed as a
     waiver or consent to any further or future action on the part of the
     Borrower that would require a waiver or consent of the Lenders or the
     Administrative Agent. Except as expressly amended, modified and
     supplemented hereby, the provisions of the Credit Agreement are and shall
     remain in full force and effect.

          11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
