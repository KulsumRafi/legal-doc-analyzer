sets forth the terms and conditions of the agreement between Fox Broadcasting Company ("Fox"), on behalf of itself, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Fox Children's
Network,&nbsp;Inc. ("FCN"), and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;("Licensee"), for the carriage of programming over the facilities of
Licensee's television station&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;("Station"). As used in this
Agreement, the terms "program", "programming" and "Fox programming" and any derivations thereof shall mean, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the programming of Fox and the programming of FCN,
and all terms of this Agreement shall apply to both. </FONT></P>

programming from the satellite and rebroadcast it shall be the sole responsibility of Licensee. Fox shall not simultaneously distribute or grant permission to another person or entity, for the simultaneous distribution of Fox programming over any
means of distribution other than over-the-air broadcasting within the DMA of Station; provided, however, if Licensee elects not to grant consent for the retransmission of any Fox programming to any multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD")
within the DMA, Fox may then grant permission for the simultaneous distribution of Fox programming to the homes served by such MVPD. In the event that Fox gives any other affiliate boarder exclusivity protection, Licensee will be entitled to the same
protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee shall be entitled to such broader protection only if Licensee pays or provides to Fox the same consideration, if any, which such other affiliate paid or provided to Fox in exchange for the broader
exclusivity protection.</FONT></TD>

broadcasting programming pursuant to (and within the specific limits of) a commitment expressly set forth on Exhibit&nbsp;A (for non-sports programming) or Exhibit&nbsp;B (for sports programming) to this Agreement (but not including any extension or
renewal of such commitment by option extension or otherwise if such renewal or extension would conflict with the in-pattern clearance of any Fox programming). If any Fox programming is not broadcast in its Programmed Time Period due to any such
commitment, Licensee shall broadcast that Fox programming in the "make good" time period specified in Exhibit&nbsp;A or B, as applicable.</FONT></TD>

Without limiting subparagraph (b)&nbsp;above, each time that Licensee for any reason fails to (or advises Fox it will not) telecast any Fox programming as provided for in this Agreement, then upon Fox's request, Licensee shall telecast that
programming (or replacement programming selected by Fox) and the commercial announcements contained in it, in a substitute time period that is within the same A.C. Nielsen broadcast ratings week as, and that is of a quality and rating value as nearly
as possible equal to that of, the time period during which the programming was not telecast. Licensee shall give Fox at least 72&nbsp;hours advance notice that it intends not to broadcast any Fox programming and in such notice shall identify the
substitute time period that Licensee selects, which time period shall be subject to Fox's prior approval. If Licensee does not fully comply with the foregoing, then, without limitation to any other rights of Fox under this Agreement or otherwise, Fox
shall have the right to license the broadcast rights to the applicable omitted programming (or replacement programming) to another television station located in Station's Community and shall advise Licensee in writing of any such action. In addition
to the foregoing, with respect to programming for broadcast within the New Programmed Time Periods (as defined in subparagraph 3(e) below), Fox will provide Licensee with written notice ("New Program Notice") for each program addition, and Licensee
shall be required to broadcast such program addition within said New Programmed Time Period, as soon as reasonably possible after such program addition is made available to Station, but no later than six (6)&nbsp;months following Licensee's receipt
of a New Program Notice; provided, however, if, prior to being advised by Fox of Fox's intent to expand into the New Programmed Time Period, Licensee has entered into a written contract, or has exchanged correspondence or memos that specifically
require the Station to broadcast programming in the New Programmed Time Period or has written programming commitments for a broadcast window that collectively preclude Station from broadcasting the Fox programming in the New Programmed Time Period,
then until expiration of its conflicting written commitments (which may not be renewed or extended except as otherwise provided herein), Licensee may broadcast the Fox programming outside the New Programmed Time Period at a time period mutually
acceptable to Fox and Licensee. If Licensee refuses to broadcast any program within a New Programmed Time Period for any reason other than those specified in Paragraph&nbsp;11 below, then either Licensee or Fox shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement upon six months prior notice to the other party.</FONT></TD>

preemption permitted by Paragraph&nbsp;11 below. Any other preemption or failure to broadcast any Fox programming is an "Unauthorized Preemption" and without limiting any other rights of Fox under this Agreement or otherwise, if within any 12-month
period during the Term of this Agreement, Station makes three (3)&nbsp;or more Unauthorized Preemptions of any Fox programming (or Licensee or Station states, either in general or specific terms, that Station intends to make such Unauthorized
Preemptions or Fox reasonably concludes, based upon Licensee's or Station's actions or otherwise, that such Unauthorized Preemptions will occur), Fox may, upon 30&nbsp;days prior written notice to Licensee, elect to either: (1)&nbsp;terminate
Station's right to broadcast any one or more series or other Fox programs, as Fox shall elect, and, to the extent and for the period(s) that Fox elects, thereafter license the broadcast rights to the applicable series or other Fox programs to any

Licensee shall broadcast over Station's facilities all Fox programming to be offered during time periods not presently programmed by Fox or FCN ("New Programmed Time Periods"), subject to Fox providing to Licensee at least six months notice prior to
delivering any additional programming within these time periods. Without limitation to any of Licensee's and Station's obligations to carry Fox programming, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that in-pattern clearance of Fox programming is critically
important to Fox and FCN, and Licensee: (1)&nbsp;agrees to act in good faith to fulfill its obligations as set forth in this Agreement to clear in pattern all Fox programming on Station, subject only to the preemption rights set forth in
Paragraph&nbsp;11 below; and (2)&nbsp;confirms that except as expressly set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A or Exhibit&nbsp;B to this Agreement, there is no obligation or commitment that would interfere or conflict with in-pattern clearance on Station of
existing Fox programming and that all agreements that require Licensee to broadcast programming in time periods that conflict with in-pattern clearance of existing Fox programming shall be permitted to expire on the earliest possible dates under such
agreements without renewal or extension by Licensee, unless any such renewal or extension would not conflict with in-pattern clearance of any Fox programming.</FONT></TD>

Fox will provide Licensee with on-air promotional announcements, which may be for any Fox programming ("Fox Promos"), including without limitation, any FCN programming, for broadcast in Station's non-Fox programming. Licensee shall use its good faith,
 best efforts to provide an on-air promotional schedule consistent with Fox's recommendations and in coordination with Fox, and to budget Station's annual advertising funds so as to enable Station to participate, on a year-round basis, in Fox's
"co-op" advertising plan. Without limitation to the foregoing, in each instance, if any, that Fox determines that Station's "Sweeps Rating" (as defined below) is below the average Sweeps Rating for all Fox affiliated stations, then Station shall be
deemed to be "Performing Below Average" and shall, within 15&nbsp;days of Fox giving Licensee written notice thereof, commence full compliance with the following: (1)&nbsp;Station shall not broadcast, during each one-half hour of all periods that
Station is not broadcasting Fox programming (the "Non-Fox Time Periods"), less than one (1)&nbsp;thirty (30)&nbsp;second promotional announcement (or promotional announcements aggregating 30 seconds, to the extent Fox so elects) for Station's local,
syndicated or Fox programming, and (2)&nbsp;during all Non-Fox Time Periods, Licensee shall broadcast Fox Promos for not less than 45% of 100% (the "Applicable Percentage") of the total, aggregate "gross ratings points" for all the promotional
announcements broadcast by Licensee ("Aggregate Promotional GRP's") within the Non-Fox Time Periods (the specific Fox Promos broadcast by Licensee and number of broadcasts of each Fox Promo shall be, to the extent Fox elects, as specified by Fox, and
the broadcasts of the Fox Promos shall be made so that the GRP's allocated thereto are distributed fairly and reasonably across the Non-Fox Time Periods); provided, however, that if Station's Sweeps Rating ranks Station within the bottom 50% (ranked
highest to lowest) of those Fox affiliated stations that are Performing Below Average, then the Applicable Percentage for Station shall be not less than 55% of 100% of said Aggregate Promotional GRP's. Licensee's full compliance with the immediately
foregoing sentence shall continue until Licensee is no longer Performing Below Average, as determined by the most recent Sweeps Rating. For purposes hereof, the "Sweeps Rating" shall mean for each station the average A.C. Nielsen rating for the
most-current completed "sweeps" period for Adults 18-49 for all prime time hours programmed by Fox. Licensee agrees to maintain complete and accurate records of all promotional announcements broadcast as provided herein. Within two (2)&nbsp;weeks
following each request by Fox therefor, Licensee will submit copies of all such records to Fox. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in (and without limitation to the above provisions of) this subparagraph 4(a), and as a material term of this
Agreement, Licensee shall, in coordination with Fox, cause Station to broadcast a total of 30 seconds in each of Station's prime-time access periods, promotional announcement for Fox programming provided by Fox hereunder.</FONT></TD>

Fox shall determine annually an A.C. Nielsen "Sweeps" co-op plan, including an amount determined by Fox in its sole discretion (the "Co-Op Commitment") in local cash expenditures to be made by Licensee to promote Fox on Station. Licensee agrees to
comply with these designated cash expenditures throughout the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that on occasion, Licensee may in its sole discretion spend less than the amounts designated by Fox due to Licensee's corporate financial
considerations. Subject to Licensee's full performance of its obligations under this Paragraph&nbsp;4, Fox will reimburse Licensee for 50% of such cash expenditures as are made in accordance with Fox's co-op plan, up to a maximum annual Fox
contribution equal to 50% of the Co-Op Commitment. For the 1997/1998 Fox network television season, the total Co-Op Commitment for Station that Fox determines shall not exceed

 February and May Sweeps (the "3 Sweeps")) for said 1997/1998 Fox network television season. Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, the total 3 Sweeps average Co-Op Commitment for the 1997/1998 broadcast season will not exceed
Licensee's total 3 Sweeps average for the 1996/1997 broadcast season by more than nine and six-tenths percent (9.6%) and, for the 1998/1999 season and each subsequent Fox network television season thereafter, the total 3 Sweeps average for such

control ("force majeure event"). If, due to any force majeure event(s), Fox substantially fails to provide the programming to be delivered to Licensee under Paragraph&nbsp;1 above, or Licensee substantially fails to broadcast such programming as
scheduled by Fox, for 4 consecutive weeks, or for 6 weeks in the aggregate during any 12-month period, then the other party hereto (the "unaffected party") may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior written notice to the party so
failing, which notice may be given at any time prior to the expiration of 7&nbsp;days after the unaffected party's receipt of actual notice that the force majeure event(s) has ended.</FONT></TD>

<U>Assignment</U>: This Agreement shall not be assigned by Licensee without the prior written consent of Fox, and any permitted assignment shall not relieve Licensee of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment by Licensee without such
consent shall be null and void and not enforceable against Fox. Licensee also agrees that if any application is made to the Federal Communications Commission pertaining to an assignment or a transfer of control of Licensee's license for the Station,
or any interest therein, Licensee shall immediately notify Fox in writing of the filing of such application. Except as to "short form" assignments or transfers of control made pursuant to Section&nbsp;73.3540(f) of the Rules and Regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, Fox shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, effective upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days notice to Licensee and the transferee or assignee of such termination, which notice may be given at any time within ninety
(90)&nbsp;days after the earlier of: (a)&nbsp;the date on which Fox learns that such assignment or transfer has become effective, or (b)&nbsp;the date on which Fox receives written notice of such assignment or transfer. Licensee agrees, that upon
Fox's request, Licensee shall procure and deliver to Fox, in form satisfactory to Fox, the agreement of the proposed assignee or transferee that, upon consummation of the assignment or transfer of control of the Station's authorization, the assignee
or transferee will assume and perform this Agreement in its entirety without limitation of any kind. If Licensee fails to notify Fox of the proposed assignment or transfer of control of said Station's authorization, or fails to procure the agreement
of the proposed assignee or transferee in accordance with this Paragraph, then such failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.</FONT></TD>

<U>Applicable Law</U>: The obligations of Licensee and Fox under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission) and this Agreement shall be deemed to have been negotiated and entered into in the State of California, and all matters or issues collateral thereto shall be governed by, the law of the
State of California applicable to contracts negotiated, executed and performed entirely within that state. With respect to programs offered or already contracted for pursuant to this Agreement, nothing in any other Paragraph hereof shall be construed
to prevent or hinder Licensee from (a)&nbsp;rejecting or refusing Fox programs which Licensee reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory, unsuitable or contrary to the public interest, or (b)&nbsp;substituting a program which, in Licensee's opinion, is
of greater local or national importance; provided, however, Licensee shall give Fox written notice of each such rejection or substitution, and the justification therefor, at least 72&nbsp;hours in advance of the scheduled broadcast, or as soon
thereafter as possible (including an explanation of the cause for any lesser notice). Programming will be deemed to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable only if it (i)&nbsp;is delivered in a form which does not meet accepted standards of good engineering
practice; (ii)&nbsp;does not comply with the rules and regulations of the FCC; or (iii)&nbsp;is programming which Licensee reasonably believes would not meet prevailing contemporary standards of good taste in its community of license. In view of the
limited nature of the Fox programming within each day-part as specified in subparagraph 3(b) above, Licensee does not foresee any need to substitute programming of greater local or national importance for Fox programming, except to present locally
originated, non-entertainment, non-religious timely public interest programming, such as election coverage, live coverage of fast-breaking news events, political debates, town hall-type meetings and telethons, which telethons (a)&nbsp;serve the
public interest and (b)&nbsp;are approved by Fox, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein, the parties acknowledge that Station has the ultimate responsibility to
determine the suitability of the subject matter of program content, including commercial, promotional or public service announcements, and to determine which programming is of greater local or national importance, consistent with 47 C.F.R.

<U>Station Acquisition By Fox</U>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Affiliation Agreement, and without limitation to any of Fox's rights, if, during the Term of this Agreement, FOX, or its affiliate, subsidiary or related companies,
or its parent, or any other entities in which any of the foregoing have an interest, consummates the acquisition of all of, or a controlling ownership interest in, another station in the Station's DMA, and Fox determines to operate the station
acquired as a Fox affiliate, Fox may terminate this Agreement as a result of such acquisition, only if Fox first offers Licensee or its designee in writing (accompanied by financials of the station reasonably sufficient to enable Licensee to perform
a valuation) the right to acquire Fox's interest (at a price which shall be the fair market value of the station), and Licensee rejects the offer in writing. If Licensee fails to respond to Fox's offer within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt,
Licensee shall be deemed to have rejected the offer. If Licensee wishes to purchase the station, it shall so notify Fox, in writing, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of Fox's offer, and each party will, within the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period
following Fox's receipt of Licensee's notice, specify what it believes to be the fair market value of the station. If the valuations are within ten percent of one another, the purchase price shall be the average of the two valuations. If the
difference is greater, the two valuations shall be submitted for final determination of the purchase price to a well-known and experienced television station appraiser/broker mutually agreeable to Fox and Licensee. In the event Fox and Licensee are
unable to agree on the appraiser/broker within five (5)&nbsp;business days, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration for final determination as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;7 of the August&nbsp;20, 1996 Letter Agreement between Fox and Licensee.
Licensee shall have ten (10)&nbsp;business days after determination of the purchase price by the appraiser/broker or arbitrator, as the case may be, to notify Fox that it still wishes to proceed with the purchase. If Licensee or its designee
purchases the station, it shall operate the station as a Fox affiliate pursuant to the instant Affiliation Agreement through the end of the Term, following the conclusion of any existing affiliation agreement for the station. If Licensee rejects the
offer, Fox may then terminate this Agreement.</FONT></TD>

after delivery of the programming to Station or (3)&nbsp;to the extent such programming is changed or otherwise affected by deletion of any material by any party other than Fox after delivery of the programming to Station. Fox agrees to indemnify and
