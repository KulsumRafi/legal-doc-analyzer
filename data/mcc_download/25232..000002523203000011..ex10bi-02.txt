                    Code ss.ss. 125, 457 and, for Plan years beginning on or
                    after January 1, 2001, elective amounts that are not
                    includable in gross income for such calendar year by reason
                    of Code ss. 132(f)(4).  Amounts under ss. 125 of the Code
                    include any amounts not available to a Participant in cash
                    in lieu of group health coverage because the Participant is
                    unable to certify that he or she has other health coverage.
                    An amount will be treated as an amount under the Code only
                    if the Company does not request or collect information
                    regarding the Participant's other health coverage as part of
                    the enrollment process for the health plan.

                    (2)      Special Rules.
                             -------------

                             (A)      A contribution made by or on behalf of an
                    Employee under any other defined contribution plan (as
                    defined in Code ss. 414(i)) which is maintained by a Company
                    or an Affiliate (which is not a Company) shall be treated as
                    made under this Plan by or on behalf of such Employee.

                             (B)      A contribution which is credited under a
                    welfare benefit fund maintained by a Company or any
                    Affiliate (which is not a Company) for any year to a reserve
                    for post-retirement medical benefits for an Employee who is
                    a "key employee" (as defined in Code ss. 416(i)) shall be
                    treated as part of the Company Contribution made on his or
                    her behalf  under this Plan when, and to the extent,
                    required under Code ss. 419A(d).

                    (3)      Excess Amount.  In the event thatss. 4.5(a)(1)
                             -------------
          actually restricts the amount otherwise allocable in any allocation
          step to any Account, the total amount which was unallocable in such
          step ("Excess Amount") shall be disposed of as follows.  First, the
          Participant's 401(k) Contributions, if any, (and any investment gain
          attributable to such contributions) shall be refunded to the extent
          that such refund would satisfy such limitation.  If an Excess Amount
          still exists after such refund, the amount otherwise allocable in any
          allocation step shall be deemed to be a Forfeiture and shall be
          allocated and reallocated (subject toss. 4.5(a)(1)) in successive
          allocation steps by the Plan Sponsor among the Accounts of the
          remaining Participants according to the allocation procedure
          describedss. 4.4(a) until such Excess Amount has been allocated in its
          entirety.  If the restriction set forth inss. 4.5(a)(1) applies to all
          Participants before such Excess Amount has been allocated in its
          entirety, the Plan Sponsor shall transfer such unallocable amount to
          a suspense account which (1) shall not be subject to any Adjustment,
          (2) shall be deemed to be a Forfeiture for purposes of the annual
          allocations for the succeeding calendar year and (3) shall be added
          to the Adjustment as an investment gain in the event that there is a
          termination of this Plan (within the meaning ofss. 9.2) before the
          date as of which such suspense account becomes allocable in its
          entirety as a Forfeiture.

                   (4)      Any 401(k) Contributions refunded under thisss.
          4.5(a)(3) shall be disregarded for purposes of the Codess. 402(g)
          limitations underss. 4.5(b) and the Codess. 401(k) limitations
          underss. 4.5(c).

          (b)      Dollar Limitations on 401(k) Contributions.

          3.6 and ss. 414(v) of the Code, no Participant shall be permitted to
          have Elective Deferrals made on his or her behalf under this Plan or
          any other qualified plan maintained by a Company or an Affiliate
          during any taxable year in excess of $11,000 (or, after 2002, the
          dollar limit under Code ss. 402(g) in effect at the beginning of such
          taxable year).  If a Participant's 401(k) Contributions under this
          Plan exceed such dollar limit, such Participant shall be deemed to
          have made a request for a refund under ss. 4.5(b)(2) and such excess
          shall be refunded in accordance with ss. 4.5(b)(3).

                  Although a Participant's 401(k) Contributions under this Plan
          cannot exceed such dollar limit, his or her aggregate Elective
          Deferrals nevertheless can exceed such dollar limit in a calendar year
          if he or she participates in at least one other plan that provides for
          Elective Deferrals.  In that event, such Participant may request a
          refund in accordance with ss. 4.5(b)(2) and his or her Excess
          Deferrals shall be refunded in accordance with ss. 4.5(b)(3).

          filing a claim with the Plan Sponsor on or before March 1 of the next
          taxable year.  Such claim shall be in writing, shall specify the
          dollar amount of the Participant's Excess Deferrals assigned to this
          Plan for such taxable year and shall include a written statement that
          such amounts, if not distributed to such Participant, will exceed the
          limit imposed on the Participant by Code ss. 402(g) for the taxable
          year in which the deferral occurred.

                  (3)      Distribution of Excess Deferrals.  Excess Deferrals,
                           --------------------------------
          plus any income and minus any loss allocable to such Excess Deferrals
          for the taxable year in which such Excess Deferrals were made (as
          determined in accordance with ss. 4.2 and the regulations under Code
          ss. 402(g)), shall be distributed no later than April 15 of any
          calendar year to Participants whose Excess Deferrals for the preceding
          Plan Year were assigned to this Plan under ss. 4.5(b)(2).

                  (4)      Treatment.  Any 401(k) Contributions that exceed the
                           ---------
          Code ss. 402(g) limit shall be taken into account for purposes of the
          limitations under ss. 4.5(c) even if the excess 401(k) Contributions
          are refunded in accordance with this ss. 4.5(b).  However, excess
          401(k) Contributions refunded to a Nonhighly Compensated Employee
          shall not be taken into account for purposes of ss. 4.5(c) to the
          extent the excess arises solely from 401(k) Contributions under this
          Plan and elective deferrals under all other qualified plus, contracts
          and arrangements maintained by a Company or an Affiliate pursuant to
          Code ss. 401(a)(3).  Excess 401(k) Contributions refunded under this
          ss. 4.5(b) shall not be taken into account for purposes of this Code
          ss. 415 limitations under ss. 4.5(a).

          shall not exceed the greater of

                            (A)      the Average Actual Deferral Percentage for
                   Participants who are Nonhighly Compensated Employees for the
                   preceding Plan Year  multiplied by 1.25, or

                            (B)      the Average Actual Deferral Percentage for
                   Participants who are Nonhighly Compensated Employees for the
                   preceding Plan Year  multiplied by 2, provided that the
                   Average Actual Deferral Percentage for Participants who are
                   Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the Average
                   Actual Deferral Percentage for Participants who are Nonhighly
                   Compensated Employees by more than 2 percentage points.

                   Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the
                   Plan Year and who is eligible to have "elective deferrals"
                   as described in Code ss. 402(g)(3)(A) allocated to his or her
                   account under two or more plans or arrangements described in
                   Code ss. 401(k) that are maintained by a Company or an
                   Affiliate shall be determined as if all such contributions
                   were made under this Plan.

                           (B)      Code ss. 410(b) Aggregation.  If this Plan
                                    ---------------------------
                   satisfies the requirements of Code ss.ss. 401(k), 401(a)(4)

          ------------------

          (a)      In order to compensate for a disability and to provide a
     measure of security to the disabled Participant and his or her family, the
     Company Account of a Participant whose employment with a Company or an
     Affiliate is terminated by reason of his or her being disabled shall become
     nonforfeitable on the date his or her employment is so terminated, and his
     or her Distributable Account shall be payable to such Participant in

     percentage of a Participant's Company Account as of the date his or her
     employment as an Employee terminates in accordance with the vesting
     schedule set forth in thisss. 5.4(b).  Such determination shall be made
     based on the Participant's Years of Service underss. 5.4(c).  The vested

     special Account until distributed by the Plan Sponsor underss. 6.  The
     balance, or the nonvested percentage, of his or her Company Account shall

         Employee has two or more periods of employment, the number of days in
         each such period in excess of the full years of employment in each such
         period shall be aggregated into additional full years of service on the
         assumption that 365 days of service equal one full year of service.

                 to a Former Employee of CREC II Inc. and Cousins Stone L.P.,
                 such Employee's employment by Faison-Stone, Inc. or one of its
                 affiliates shall be treated as employment by a Company under
                 this ss. 5.4(c) (but not for purposes of being eligible to
                 share in the allocations of the Forfeitures and Company
                 Contribution under ss. 4.5(c) for the 1999 Plan Year),  if such

                 L.P. on June 1, 1999 as part of the transactions contemplated

                 and others.

                 (3)      Breaks in Service.  If an Employee is reemployed
                          -----------------
         after he or she has 5 or more consecutive Breaks in Service and the
         vested  percentage of his or her Account before the first such Break
         in Service had been zero, Year of Service credit shall be carried
         forward from his or her prior period of employment only if the number
         of his or her full Years of Service completed before the first such
         Break in Service exceeds the number of consecutive Breaks in Service
         which such Employee had immediately before his or her reemployment.

         (d)     Reemployment.
                 ------------

                 (1)      If a Participant is reemployed before he or she has 5
         consecutive Breaks in Service and before the balance, or nonvested
         percentage, of his or her Company Account is treated as a Forfeiture
         under ss. 5.4(b), his or her vested interest in that part of his or her
         Company Account thereafter shall be determined in accordance with the
         formula set forth in ss. 5.4(d)(3).

                (2)      If a Participant is reemployed before he or she has 5
         consecutive Breaks in Service and while this Plan remains in effect
         but after the balance, or nonvested percentage, of his or her Company
         Account has been treated as a Forfeiture under ss. 5.4(b), the Plan
         Sponsor shall cause the Trustee, upon the Participant's completion of
         one Year of Service (after  his or her reemployment) to restore such
         balance to a special Company Account for such Participant (subject to
         the Adjustment which the Plan Sponsor determines would have been
         allocable to that balance on the assumption that such balance were
         invested in the Funds as described inss. 8.1(a) and not in a Brokerage
         Account as described inss. 8.1(b) or other individually directed
         investments as described inss. 8.1(c)), and his or her vested interest
         in such special Company Account thereafter shall be determined in
         accordance with the formula set forth inss. 5.4(d)(3).  Such
         restoration shall be made from appropriate Company Contributions or
         from an assessment against the appropriate Company, whichever the Plan
         Sponsor deems reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

                (3)      For purposes of ss. 5.4(d)(1) and ss. 5.4(d)(2),

                         X =     P (AB + D) - D, where
                         X =     the dollar amount, if any, of the vested
                                 percentage of the Participant's existing or
                                 restored special Company Account;
                         P =     the vested percentage of his or her existing
                                 or restored special Company Account as
                                 determined under the vesting schedule inss.
                                 5.4(b);
                         AB =    the then balance of his or her existing or
                                 restored special Company Account; and
                         D =     the dollar amount, if any, distributed to the
                                 former Employee from the vested percentage
                                 of his or her Company Account as a result of
                                 his or her previous termination of employment.

     5.5.  Missing  Claimant.  If no  Beneficiary  of a deceased  Participant is
           -----------------
identified and located pursuant to the procedure set forth in ss. 5.3(b),  or if
the Account of a  Participant  becomes  payable under ss. 5 for any reason other
than his or her death and the Plan Sponsor is unable to locate such  Participant
after sending  written  notice to his or her last known mailing  address and the
last  known  mailing  address of any  Beneficiaries  such  Participant  may have
designated, the Plan Sponsor, in its discretion, may treat his or her Account as
a Forfeiture as of the last day of the calendar  year which  includes the second
anniversary  of the date his or her Account first became  payable,  or as of the
last day of any subsequent  calendar year.  However, if such missing Beneficiary
or Participant in a subsequent calendar year files a written claim with the Plan
Sponsor  while this Plan remains in effect for the Account  forfeited and proves
to the  satisfaction  of the Plan Sponsor his or her identity as the person then
entitled to such benefit  under the terms of this Plan,  the Plan Sponsor  shall
direct the payment to such  Beneficiary or Participant in accordance  with ss. 6
of an amount which equals dollar for dollar the amount  treated as a Forfeiture.
Such payment at the Plan Sponsor's  discretion may come from appropriate Company
Contributions  or  directly  from one,  or more than  one,  Company,  or from an
assessment  against the  appropriate  Company,  whichever the Plan Sponsor deems
reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

                           ss.6. BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION

                   -------
     only as a result of an event described in ss. 5 or in ss. 6.4 and, further,
     shall be paid only to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death
     before payment has been made, only to his or her Beneficiary in a lump sum.

          (b)      Direct Rollovers.
                   ----------------

                    (1)      Election.  Notwithstanding any provision of the
                             --------
           Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's
           election under this ss. 6, a distributee (as described in ss. 6.1(b)
           (4)) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan
           Sponsor, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution
           paid directly to an eligible retirement  plan specified by the
           distributee in a direct rollover.

                    (2)      Eligible rollover distribution.  An eligible
                             ------------------------------
           rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of
           the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible
           rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one
           of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
           frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of
           the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
           the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for
           a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the
           extent such distribution is required under Code ss. 401(a)(9); the
           portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income
           (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
           appreciation with respect to employer securities); and a hardship
           distribution.

                    (3)      Eligible retirement plan.  An eligible retirement
                             ------------------------
           plan is an individual retirement account described in Codess. 408(a),
           an individual retirement annuity described in Codess. 408(b), an
           annuity plan described in Codess. 403(a), or a qualified trust
           described in Code ss. 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible
           rollover distribution.  An eligible retirement plan shall also
           include an annuity contract described in Code ss. 403(b) and an
           eligible plan under Code ss. 457(b) which is maintained by a state,
           political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of
           a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
           separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this
           Plan.  A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible
           rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
           after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross
           income.  However, such portion may be transferred only to an
           individual retirement account or annuity described in Code ss.ss.
           408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan described
           in Code ss.ss. 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for
           amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the
           portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and
           the portion of such distribution which is not so includable.

                    (4)      Distributee.  A distributee includes an employee or
                             -----------
           former employee.  In addition, the employee's or former employee's
           surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
           former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
           relations order, as defined in Code ss. 414(p), are distributees with
           regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

                    (5)      Direct rollover.  A direct rollover is a payment by
                             ---------------
           the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the
           distributee.

     6.2. Distribution Deadlines and Consent Requirement.
          ----------------------------------------------

          (a)      General Rule.  A Participant's Distributable Account
                   -------------

     consent requirements for a Distributable Account in excess of $5,000, have
     been satisfied with respect to such account or, if earlier, (2) when

     shall be made no later than the later of 60 days after the end of the
     calendar year in which a Participant reaches age 65 or retires unless such
     consent requirements prohibit such a distribution orss. 6.2(b) requires an
     earlier distribution.

                  -------------------

                  (1)      Participant.

                  (1) reaches age 70-1/2 or (2) for a  Participant who is not a
                  5% owner (as defined in Code ss. 416), terminates employment,
                  whichever is last.

                           (B)      Additional Contributions.  Any contributions
                                    ------------------------

                  date payment is required to be made to such Participant under
                  this ss. 6.2(b)(1) shall be paid to such Participant in a lump
                  sum in cash no later than 270 days after the date as of which

                  (2)      Beneficiary.  If a distribution is made to a
                           -----------
          Participant's Beneficiary, such distribution shall be made by December
          31 of the calendar year cotaining the fifth anniversary of the date of
          the Participant's death.

     6.3. Distributions Procedure.
          -----------------------

          (a)      General.  The amount of a Distributable Account to be
                   -------
     distributed under this ss. 6 shall be determined by the Plan Sponsor on
     the basis of the Valuation Date which immediately precedes the date that
     such distribution is made, and no distribution shall be made to a
     Participant or Beneficiary on the basis of a Valuation Date which comes
     before the event which triggers such distribution under ss. 5.

          (b)      Special Rule.  A Participant may elect (subject to ss.
                   ------------
     6.3(c)) that the Plan Sponsor pay the Participant's Distributable Account
     in whole or in part in common stock issued by the Plan Sponsor (to the
     extent such Distributable Account is invested in such stock) if the
     Participant satisfies such reasonable requirements as the Plan Sponsor may
     set for such an election.

          (c)      Exception to Special Rule.  If either the Plan Sponsor or the
                   -------------------------
     Trustee determines that a distribution of common stock issued by the Plan
     Sponsor underss. 6.3(b) might result in "Excess Shares" under Article 11 of
     the Plan Sponsor's Articles of Incorporation or might violate any
     applicable law or any other provision in the Plan Sponsor's Articles of
     Incorporation, or might cause the Plan Sponsor to lose its status as a real
     estate investment trust under the Code, such distribution shall be made in
     cash or in cash and other property (in lieu of such stock) in accordance
     with thisss. 6.3(c).  If such a determination is made, the Trustee shall as
     of the first day of the calendar month which follows such determination set
     aside the Participant's entire Distributable Account in a Brokerage
     Account.  Only the Trustee shall have the right to make investment
     decisions regarding buying or selling of the Plan Sponsor's common stock in
     such Brokerage Account, and the Trustee shall begin an orderly liquidation
     of the Plan Sponsor's common stock allocated to such account with a view
     towards completing such liquidation on or before the third anniversary of
     the establishment of such Brokerage Account.  The affected Participant
     shall have the right to direct the Trustee respecting the timing of
     distributions from such account.

          (d)      Statutory Restrictions.  The Plan Sponsor shall have the
                   ----------------------
     right to unilaterally direct the Trustee to make part or all of any
     distribution under this ss. 6.3 in the form of common stock issued by the
     Plan Sponsor and held by the Funds if the Plan Sponsor determines (on the
     advice of counsel) that any statute, rule or regulation makes it
     impermissible or imprudent for the Trustee to sell such common stock in
     order to effect a distribution or transfer.

          (e)      No Annuities.  In no event shall a Participant's
                   ------------
     Distributable Account be distributed to such Participant in the form of a
     life annuity.

     6.4. Hardship Distributions.
          ----------------------

          (a)      Hardship Distribution of Contributory Account.  Upon the
                   ---------------------------------------------
     request of an Employee who has a Contributory Account, the Plan Sponsor may
     distribute all or a part of a Participant's Contributory Account to such
     Participant during any calendar month (based on the immediately preceding
     Valuation Date) to the extent that the Plan Sponsor determines that such a
     distribution (1) is necessary in order to avoid a hardship due to a death,
     serious illness or accident in his or her immediate family or (2) is for
     use by the Participant in acquiring a personal residence or (3) is needed
     to pay his or her educational expenses of educating members of his or her
     immediate family.

          (b)      Hardship Distribution of 401(k) Account.  A Participant shall
                   ---------------------------------------
     have the right to request a withdrawal of all or any portion of his or her
     401(k) Account (other than the investment gains or losses allocated to such
     401(k) Account) at any time before he or she terminates employment with a
     Company and all Affiliates, and the Plan Sponsor shall grant such request
     if, and to  the extent that, it determines (based on all the relevant facts
     and circumstances and in accordance with the regulations under Code ss.
     401(k)) that the withdrawal is "necessary" (as described in ss. 6.4(b)(1))
     to satisfy an "immediate and heavy financial need" (as described in
     ss. 6.4(b)(2)).

          Any request for a withdrawal for a financial hardship shall be made
     in writing and shall set forth in detail the nature of such hardship and
     the amount of the withdrawal needed as a result of such hardship, and the
     Participant shall supplement such request with such additional information
     as the Plan Sponsor requests consistent with this ss. 6.4(b).

                   (1)      Amount Necessary to Satisfy Need.  A withdrawal
                            --------------------------------
          shall be deemed to be "necessary" to satisfy an immediate and heavy
          financial need only if

                            (A)      the withdrawal is not in excess of the
                   amount of such need, including any amounts necessary to pay
                   any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties
                   reasonably anticipated to result from such withdrawal, and

                            (B)      the Participant has obtained all
                   distributions (other than hardship distributions, including
                   distributions under ss. 6.4(c)) and all nontaxable loans
                   currently available from this Plan and all other plans
                   maintained by a Company and all Affiliates.  Notwithstanding
                   the foregoing, a Participant will not be required to obtain
                   a loan from  this Plan or any other plan maintained by a
                   Company or an Affiliate if the effect of the loan would be to
                   increase the amount of the need.

                   A Participant who receives a withdrawal for a financial
          hardship under this ss. 6.4(b) shall not be eligible to make any
          401(k) Contributions under this Plan or any elective contributions or
          employee contributions under any other qualified plan or nonqualified
          plan of deferred compensation maintained by a Company or an Affiliate
          for the six month period following the date of such withdrawal.
          Further, such Participant's 401(k) Contributions under this Plan and
          any elective contributions under any other plan maintained by a
          Company or an Affiliate for the calendar year immediately following
          the calendar year in which such withdrawal occurred shall not exceed
          the dollar limitation under Code ss. 402(g) for such following
          calendar year (as described in ss. 4.5(b)) reduced by the amount of
          his or her 401(k) Contributions under this Plan and any elective
          contributions under any other plan maintained by a Company or an
          Affiliate for a calendar year in which such withdrawal occurred.

                   (2)      Immediate and Heavy Financial Need.  An "immediate
                            ----------------------------------

     6.5. Minimum Distributions Requirements.
          ----------------------------------

          (a)      General Rules.
                   -------------

                   (1)      Effective Date.  The provisions of thisss. 6.5 will
                            --------------
          apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions
          beginning September 1, 2002.

                   (2)      Coordination with Minimum Distribution Requirements
                            ---------------------------------------------------
          Previously in Effect.  Required minimum distributions for 2002 under
          --------------------
          this ss. 6.5 will be determined as follows:  If the total amount of
          2002 required minimum distributions under the Plan  made to the
          distributee prior to September 1, 2002 equals or exceeds the required
          minimum distributions determined  under this ss. 6.5, then no
          additional distributions will be required to be made for 2002 on or
          after such date to the distributee.  If the total amount of 2002
          required minimum distributions under the Plan made to the distributee
          prior to September 1, 2002 is less than the amount determined under
          this ss. 6.5, then required minimum distributions for 2002 on and
          after such date will be determined so that the total amount of
          required minimum distributions for 2002 made to the distributee will
          be the amount determined under this ss. 6.5.

                   (3)      Precedence.  The requirements of thisss. 6.5 will
                            ----------
          take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan other
          than the first sentence ofss.6.2(a).

                   (4)      Requirements of Treasury Regulations Incorporated.
                            -------------------------------------------------
          All distributions required under thisss. 6.5 will be determined and
          made in accordance with the Treasury regulations underss. 401(a)(9) of
          the Code.

                   (5)      TEFRA ss. 242(b)(2) Elections.  Notwithstanding the
                            -----------------------------
          other provisions of this ss. 6.5, distributions may be made under a
          designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with ss. 242(b)
          (2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility  Act (TEFRA) and the
          provisions of the Plan that relate to ss. 242(b)(2) of TEFRA.

         (b)      Time and Manner of Distribution.
                  -------------------------------

                  (1)      Required Beginning Date.  The Participant's entire
                           -----------------------
         interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the
         Participant no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date.

                  (2)      Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin.  If
                           -----------------------------------------------
         the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's
         entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no
         later than as follows:

                           (i)      If the Participant's surviving spouse is the
                  Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, distributions
                  to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the
                  calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which
                  the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year
                  in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2, if
                  later.

                           (ii)     If the Participant's surviving spouse is not
                  the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then,
                  distributions to the Designated Beneficiary will begin by
                  December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the
                  calendar year in which the Participant died.

                           (iii)    If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of
                  September 30 of the year following the year of the
                  Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be
                  distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the
                  fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.

                           (iv)     If the Participant's surviving spouse is the
                  Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving
                  spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to
                  the surviving spouse begin, this ss. 6.5(b)(2), other than
                  ss. 6.5(b)(2)(i), will apply as if the surviving spouse were
                  the Participant.

                  For purposes of this ss. 6.5(b)(2) and 6.5(d), unless ss. 6.5
                  (b)(2)(iv) applies, distributions are considered to begin on
                  the Participant's Required Beginning Date.  If ss. 6.5(b)(2)
                  (iv) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the
                  date distributions are required to begin to the surviving
                  spouse under ss. 6.5(b)(2)(i) .  If distributions under an
                  annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably
                  commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required
                  Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse
                  before the date distributions are required to begin to the
                  surviving spouse under  ss. 6.5(b)(2)(i), the date
                  distributions are considered to begin is the date
                  distributions actually commence.

                  (3)      Forms of Distribution.  Unless the Participant's
                           ---------------------
         interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
         insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required
         Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year,
         distributions will be made in accordance with ss. 6.5(c) and ss.
         6.5(d).  If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of
         an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions
         thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of ss.
         401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations.

         (c)      Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime.
                  ------------------------------------------------------------

                  (1)      Amount of Required Minimum Distribution For Each
                          ------------------------------------------------
         Distribution Calendar Year.  During the Participant's lifetime, the
         --------------------------
         minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar
         Year is the lesser of:

                          (i)      the quotient obtained by dividing the
                  Participant's Account Balance by the distribution period in
                  the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in ss. 1.401(a)(9)-9 of
                  the Treasury regulations, using the Participant's age as of
                  the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year;
                  or

                          (ii)     if the Participant's sole Designated
                  Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the
                  Participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the
                  Participant's Account Balance by the number in the Joint and
                  Last Survivor Table set forth in ss. 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
                  Treasury regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's
                  attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays
                  in the Distribution Calendar Year.

                  (2)      Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue
                           ------------------------------------------------
         Through Year of Participant's Death.  Required minimum distributions
         -----------------------------------
         will  be determined under this ss. 6.5(c) beginning with the first
         Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution
         Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death.

         (d)      Required Minimum Distributions After Participant's Death.
                  --------------------------------------------------------

                  (1)      Death On or After Date Distributions Begin.

                           ------------------------------------------
                           (i)      Participant Survived by Designated
                                    ----------------------------------
                  Beneficiary.  If the Participant dies on or after the date
                  -----------
                  distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the
                  minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution
                  Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the
                  quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account
                  Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the
                  Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the
                  Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows:

                           (A)      The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy
                  is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of
                  death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.

                           (B)      If the Participant's surviving spouse is the
                  Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life
                  Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each
                  Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's
                  death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's
                  birthday in that year.  For Distribution Calendar Years after
                  the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining Life
                  Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age
                  of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the
                  calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each
                  subsequent calendar year.

                           (C)      If the Participant's surviving spouse is not
                  the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated
                  Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using
                  the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of
                  the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent
                  year.


                           (ii)     No Designated Beneficiary.  If the
                                    -------------------------
                  Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and
                  there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the
                  year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum
                  amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar
                  Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient
                  obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the
                  Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the
                  age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one
                  for each subsequent year.

                  (2)      Death Before Date Distributions Begin.

                                    ----------------------------------
                  Beneficiary.  If the Participant dies before the date
                  -----------
                  distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the
                  minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution
                  Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the
                  quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account
                  Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's
                  Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in ss.
                  6.5(d)(1).

                           (ii)     No Designated Beneficiary.  If the
                                    -------------------------

                  -------------------------------------------------------
                  the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the
                  Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole
                  Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before
                  distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse
                  under ss. 6.5(b)(2), this ss. 6.5(d)(2) will apply as if the

                           --------------------------
         which a minimum distribution is required.  For distributions beginning
         before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is
         the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which
         contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date.  For distributions
         beginning after the Participant's death, the first Distribution
         Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required
         to begin under ss. 6.5(b)(2).  The required minimum distribution for
         the Participant's first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or
         before the Participant's Required Beginning Date.  The required minimum
         distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the
         required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in
         which the Participant's Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on

                               -----------------------

     8.1. Trust Funds.
          -----------

          (a)      General.  The assets of this Plan shall be held in one or
                   -------
     more separate Funds, as determined by the Plan Sponsor.   Each of the
     Funds shall be held and managed by the Trustee appointed by the Plan
     Sponsor pursuant to a separate Trust Agreement and may be invested up to
     100% in the common stock of the Plan Sponsor, or any successor to the Plan
     Sponsor.  No Participant's 401(k) Account or Contributory Account may be
     invested in the common stock of the Plan Sponsor.  A Participant who is an
     Employee may exercise his or her right under ss. 8.1(b) to direct the
     investment of his or her Account through a Brokerage Account or in other
     individually directed investments underss. 8.1(c).    The Plan Sponsor
     shall determine how assets of this Plan are to be allocated among the
     Funds and shall have the power to direct the Trustee of any Fund to
     transfer assets of such Fund to the Trustee of any other Fund or Funds.
     No Participant's Catch-Up Account may be invested in the common stock
     of the Plan Sponsor.

         (b)      Brokerage Account.  A Participant who desires to manage the
                  -----------------
     investment of his or her own Account may file a written election to do so
     with the Plan Sponsor, and the Plan Sponsor will direct the Trustee to
     establish a Brokerage Account on behalf of such Participant and to
     transfer the assets of his or her Account to such Brokerage Account as of
     the first day of the calendar month which follows the date the Plan
     Sponsor actually receives such Participant's election.  The cash or other
     assets to be transferred to a Participant's Brokerage Account shall be
     determined underss. 6.3 as if the Participant's employment had terminated
     on the date the Plan Sponsor receives his or her election under thisss.
     8.1(b).  A Participant upon the establishment of his or her Brokerage
     Account shall be exclusively responsible for the management of the assets
     of such  Brokerage Account subject to the following terms and conditions:

                  (1)      All investments shall be made through the broker
         designated by the Plan Sponsor as the broker for all Brokerage
         Accounts,

                  (2)      Investments shall be made only in securities which
         are ordinarily and customarily available through the brokerage firm
         which maintains the Brokerage Account,

                  (3)      No investment shall be made under any circumstances
         on "margin" or in any "naked" option,

                  (4)      Investments shall be made only if such investments
         will be shown on the standard monthly account statements prepared by
         the brokerage firm which maintains the Brokerage Account, and

                  (5)      The Participant agrees to such other terms and
         conditions as the Trustee, the Plan Sponsor and the brokerage firm
         (whether individually or collectively) shall establish from time to
         time for Brokerage Accounts.

         All  transaction  fees,  commissions  and any annual  maintenance fee
     for a Participant's  Brokerage  Account  will be paid  directly  from  such
     Brokerage Account.  If a  Brokerage  Account  is  maintained  for a
     Participant  and  the Participant  desires  that  the  Trustee  resume  the
     management  of his or her Account,  a Participant can request the Plan
     Sponsor in writing that the Trustee does so, and the Plan Sponsor shall
     direct the Trustee to do so on the Valuation Date which first  follows the
     date the  Participant  converts  all of his or her investments  in his or
     her  Brokerage  Account to cash[;  provided,  however,  a Participant
     shall not have the right to make more than one such  request in any 12
     consecutive  month period.] No part of an Adjustment  shall be allocated to
     a Brokerage  Account,  but all investment  gains and losses  (whether
     realized or unrealized)  from the  investment of the assets of a Brokerage
     Account shall be allocated  exclusively to such account as of each
     Valuation Date.  Finally, if a Participant's  employment  terminates as an
     Employee (for any reason,  including death) while he or she has a Brokerage
     Account,  his or her  Brokerage  Account shall be payable under ss. 6
     subject to the following special rules:

                           (A)      if such Participant's Account exceeds
                  $5,000, and is fully vested, he or she shall have the right to
                  maintain his or her  Brokerage Account or to request a
                  distribution of the assets of his or her Brokerage Account
                  when his or her employment terminates, and

                           (B)      if such Participant's Account is less than
                  $5,000, and is fully vested, he or she shall have the right to
                  request a distribution of the assets of his or her Brokerage
                  Account when his or her employment terminates but, if he or
                  she fails to do so, the Plan Sponsor shall convert the assets
                  in his or her Brokerage Account to cash, and

                           (C)      if his or her Account is less than fully
                  vested, the Participant shall, within 20 days after the end of
                  the calendar month in which his or her employment terminates,
                  convert assets in his or her Brokerage Account to cash in an
                  amount equal to no less than the dollar amount of the
                  nonvested portion of his or her Company Account (as determined
                  as of the end of such calendar month).  If the Participant
                  fails to convert sufficient assets in his or her Brokerage
                  Account within such time period, the Plan Sponsor shall
                  direct the Trustee to convert sufficient assets to cash by
                  selling assets in such amounts and at such times as it
                  determines in its sole discretion as necessary or appropriate
                  to effectuate the Forfeiture of the Participant's nonvested
                  Company Account.  The Plan Sponsor thereafter shall direct the
                  Trustee to transfer cash equal to the nonvested portion of the
                  Participant's Account from his or her Brokerage Account to one
                  or more of the funds described inss. 8.1(a) as soon as
                  practicable after such cash is available in such Brokerage
                  Account, and such transferred  amounts shall remain in the
                  Participant's Account until it becomes a Forfeiture under ss.
                  5.4(b).

                  A Beneficiary of a Participant described in clause (A) above
          shall also have the right to maintain and direct the investment of a
          Brokerage Account.

          (c)      Other Individually Directed Investments.  The Plan Sponsor
                   ---------------------------------------
     shall establish procedures to allow individuals to direct the investment of
     their Account.  The Plan Sponsor as part of establishing any such
     procedures shall direct the Trustee to establish the investment
     alternatives designated by the Plan Sponsor and to accept directions to
     invest all or any specified portion of the individual's Account among such
     alternatives.  The Plan Sponsor shall establish as part of such procedures
     such rules for effecting the investment elections as it deems necessary or
     appropriate, which rules shall be applied on a uniform and
     nondiscriminatory basis to all similarly situated individuals.  Except as
     required under ERISA, neither a Company nor the Trustee shall be
     responsible for any investment decisions made by an individual with
     respect to his or her Account.  If an individual fails to direct the
     investment of his or her Account, the Trustee shall assume the investment
     responsibility for such Account.

          (d)      ERISA 404(c).  To the extent that the Plan Sponsor chooses
                   ------------
     to do so, the Plan Sponsor may take advantage of any relief afforded to
     Plan fiduciaries under ERISAss. 404(c) and the related regulations.  If
     Participants, Beneficiaries or alternate payees are permitted to direct the
     investment of their Accounts, the Plan Sponsor shall designate a fiduciary
     who shall implement such individuals' directions and shall determine the
     manner and frequency of investment instructions, any limitations on such
     instructions and such other procedures as may be necessary or appropriate
     to implement such individuals' directions or to satisfy the requirements of
     ERISAss. 404(c).  Any such procedures may be amended or modified from time
     to time by the Plan Sponsor in its discretion and all such procedures and
     any amendments or modifications to such procedures are incorporated into
     and made a part of this Plan.

     8.2.  Notification to Trustee.  Any action of the Plan Sponsor  pursuant to
           -----------------------
any of the  provisions  of this Plan  shall be  communicated  to the  Trustee in
accordance with such procedures as the Plan Sponsor deems  appropriate under the
circumstances.

     8.3. Loans.
          -----

          (a)      Administration and Procedures.  The Plan Sponsor shall
                   -----------------------------
     establish objective nondiscriminatory procedures for the administration of
     the loan program under this Plan and such procedures and any amendments to
     such procedures are incorporated by this reference as a part of this Plan.
     Such procedures shall include, but are not limited to:

          eligible for a loan;

                   (2)      the identity of the person or position authorized to

                   (3)      the procedures for applying for a loan;

                   (4)      the basis on which loans will be approved or denied;

                   (5)      the limitations, if any, on the types and amounts of
         loans offered;

                   (6)      the procedures for determining a reasonable rate of
         interest;

                   (7)      the types of collateral that may be used as
         security for a loan; and

                   (8)      the events constituting default and the steps that
         will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event of such default.

         (b)      General Statutory Requirements.  All loans made under this
                  ------------------------------
     Plan will comply with the provisions ofss. 408(b)(1) of ERISA and shall

                  (1)      be made available to Participants and Beneficiaries
         who are eligible for a loan on a reasonably equivalent basis;

                  (2)      not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees
         in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Employees;

         regarding loans set forth in this Plan and the procedures described
         above;

                  (4)      bear a reasonable rate of interest; and

                  (5)      be adequately secured.

         (c)      Other Conditions.  All loans made under this Plan shall be
                  ----------------
     subject to the following additional conditions.

                  (1)      Principal and interest on the loan shall be repaid
         in substantially level installments with payments not less frequently
         than quarterly over a period of 5 years or less.  However, if so
         provided in the loan procedures described above, the repayment period
         may exceed 5 years if the loan is classified as a "home loan" (as
         described in Code ss. 72(p)).

                  (2)      If the loan is secured by any portion of the
         Participant's Account, the Account balance shall not be reduced as a
         result of a default until a distributable event occurs under the Plan.

                  (3)      The Participant or Beneficiary must agree to any
         other terms and conditions required under the procedures described
         above.

         (d)      Statutory Limitation on Amounts.  The principal amount of any
                  -------------------------------
     loan to a Participant (when added to the outstanding principal balance of
     any outstanding loans made to the Participant under this Plan and all other
     plans maintained by a Company or an  Affiliate that are tax exempt under
     Code ss. 401) may not exceed the lesser of:

                  (1)      $50,000 reduced by the excess, if any, of

                           (A)      the highest outstanding principal balance of
                  previous loans to the Participant from the Plan (and all other
                  plans described above) during the one year period ending
                  immediately before the date the current loan is made, over

                          (B)      the current outstanding principal balance of
                  those previous loans on the date the current loan is made; or

                 (2)      50% of the vested interest in the Participant's
          Account at the time the loan is made.

         (e)      Distributions.  The vested Account balance actually payable to
                  -------------
     an individual who has an outstanding loan shall be determined by reducing
     the vested Account balance by the amount of the security interest in the
     Account (if any).  The Trustee may cancel the Plan's security interest in
     the Account and distribute the note in full satisfaction of that portion of
     the Participant's Account equal to the outstanding balance of the loan or
     the amount that would have been outstanding but for a discharge in
     bankruptcy or through any other legal process.  Notwithstanding anything
     to the  contrary in this Plan or the loan procedures described above, in
     the event of default, foreclosure on the note and execution of the Plan's
     security interest in the Account shall not occur until a distributable
     event occurs under this Plan and interest shall continue to accrue only to
     the extent permissible under applicable law.

                ss.9. AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

     9.1.  Amendment.  The Plan Sponsor  reserves the right at any time and from
           ---------
time to time to amend this Plan in writing,  provided that no amendment shall be
made which would divert any of the assets of the Funds to any purpose other than
the exclusive benefit of Participants and Beneficiaries unless such amendment is
necessary  to cause this Plan to continue  to be exempt from income  taxes under
the Code.

     9.2.  Termination.  The Plan  Sponsor  expects  this  Plan to be  continued
           -----------
indefinitely  but, of  necessity,  reserves the right to completely or partially

Board.

     If this Plan is completely or partially  terminated  under this ss. 9.2, or
if the  Plan  Sponsor  or a  Company  declares  a  permanent  discontinuance  of
contributions to this Plan, the Company Account of each affected Participant who
then is an Employee  shall become  fully vested on the date of such  complete or
partial termination or on the date of such declaration of discontinuance, as the
case may be.

     In the case of such a complete termination of this Plan or such a permanent
discontinuance of contributions, the Trustee shall liquidate Fund investments as
necessary and distribute  Accounts to Participants and  Beneficiaries  after the
receipt of a favorable  determination  letter from the Internal  Revenue Service
respecting such termination or discontinuance.

     9.3.  Indemnification.  Each  Company  (to  the  extent  permissible  under
           ---------------
applicable  law) shall  indemnify  each of its officers and  Employees  from and
against any liability,  assessment,  loss,  expense or other cost of any kind or
description whatsoever,  including legal fees and expenses, actually incurred by
such person on account of any action or proceeding,  actual or threatened, which
arises as a result of his or her acting on behalf of a Company  under this Plan,
provided (1) such action or proceeding  does not arise as a result of his or her
own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith and (2) such protection
is not otherwise provided through insurance.

be entitled to receive a benefit from such other employee benefit plan, if it is
then terminated, which is equal to or greater than the benefit such person would
have been entitled to receive  immediately  before the merger,  consolidation or
transfer, if this Plan had been terminated.

     10.10.  Agent for Service of Process.  The agent for service of process for
             ----------------------------
this Plan shall be the person  currently  listed in the records of the Secretary
of State of Georgia as the agent for service of process for the Plan Sponsor.

     10.11.  Qualified  Domestic Relations Order. In accordance with uniform and
             -----------------------------------
nondiscriminatory  procedures established by the Plan Sponsor from time to time,
the Plan Sponsor upon the receipt of a domestic  relations  order which seeks to
require the  distribution of a  Participant's  Account in whole or in part to an
"alternate payee" (as that term is defined in Code ss. 414(p)(8)) shall

             (a)      promptly notify the Participant and such "alternate payee"
     of the receipt of such order and of the procedure which the Plan Sponsor
     will follow to determine whether such order constitutes a "qualified
     domestic relations order" within the meaning of Code ss. 414(p),

             (b)      determine whether such order constitutes a "qualified
     domestic relations order", notify the Participant and the "alternate
     payee" of the results of such determination and, if the Plan Sponsor
     determines that such order does constitute a "qualified domestic relations
     order",

             (c)      direct the Trustee to transfer such amounts, if any, as
     the Plan Sponsor determines necessary or appropriate from the Participant's
     Account to a special Account for such "alternate payee", and

             (d)      direct the Trustee to make such distribution to such
     "alternate payee" from such special Account as the Plan Sponsor deems
    called for under the terms of such order in accordance with Code ss. 414(p).

     An "alternate  payee's"  special Account shall be distributed in accordance
with ss. 6 as if the "alternate  payee" was a Beneficiary as soon as practicable
after that Account has been established under this ss. 10.11,  without regard to
whether  the date of such  distribution  is prior to the  earliest  date  that a
distribution  could be made to a  Participant  under  the terms of this Plan and
prior to a Participant's  "earliest  retirement  age" under Code ss. 414(p).  An
"alternate  payee"  shall have the right to  designate  (in the same manner as a
Participant  who has no  spouse) a  Beneficiary  for the  payment  of his or her
special Account in the event of the alternate  payee's death before such special
Account is paid.

     The  determinations  and the distributions made by, or at the direction of,
the Plan  Sponsor  under  this ss.  10.11  shall be  final  and  binding  on the
Participant,  the  "alternate  payee" and all other  persons  interested in such
order.

     10.12. Top Heavy Rules.
            ---------------

            (a)      Determination.  The Plan Sponsor as of each Determination
                     -------------
     Date shall determine the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits
     of Key Employees and the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits
     of all other Employees in accordance with the rules in Code ss. 416(g) or
     shall take such other action as the Plan Sponsor deems appropriate to
     conclude that no such determination is necessary under the circumstances.
     If the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of Key Employees
     exceeds 60% of the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of all
     Employees as of any Determination Date, this Plan shall be "top heavy" for
     the immediately following Plan Year.

            (b)      Special Top Heavy Contribution.  If the Plan Sponsor
                     ------------------------------
     determines that this Plan is top heavy for any Plan Year, a contribution
     shall be made for such Plan Year for each Participant who is a Non-Key
     Employee and who is employed by a Company on the last day of such Plan Year
     (regardless of such Participant's Hours of Service or compensation level
     for such Plan Year) which, when added to the Company Contribution actually
     credited to such Participant's Account for such Plan Year, equal to the
     lesser of

                     (1)      3% of his or her W-2 Compensation for such Plan
            Year or

                     (2)      the largest percentage of Company Contributions
            and 401(k) Contributions allocated on behalf of any Key Employee (as
            expressed as a percentage of his or her W-2 Compensation) for such
            Plan Year.

         (c)      Coordination.  The contribution required for a Participant
                  ------------
     under this ss. 10.12, if any, shall not be made to the extent that the
     contribution made or the benefit accrued on behalf of such Participant
     under any other plan maintained by an Affiliate satisfies the minimum
     requirements of Code ss. 416(c).

         (d)      Special Rules and Definitions.  For purposes of this ss.
                  -----------------------------
     10.12, the following special rules and definitions shall apply:

                  (1)      "Determination Date" means the last day of the
         immediately preceding Plan Year.

                  (2)      "Key Employee" means any Employee or former Employee
         (and the Beneficiaries of such Employee) who at any time during the
         Plan Year containing the Determination Date or any of the four
         immediately preceding Plan Years was

                           (i)      an officer of a Company or an Affiliate
                  whose W-2 Compensation for such Plan Year exceeds 50% of the
                  dollar limitation under Codess. 415(b)(1)(A) for such Plan
                  Year,

                           (ii)     an owner (or considered to be an owner
                  within the meaning of Code ss. 318) of one of the 10 largest
                  interests in a Company or an Affiliate whose W-2 Compensation
                  for such Plan Year exceeds 100% of the dollar limitation under
                  Code ss. 415(c)(1)(A); provided that the value of such
                  ownership interest is more than one-half of one percent,

                           (iii)    a 5% owner of a Company or an Affiliate, or

                           (iv)     a 1% owner of a Company or an Affiliate
                  whose W-2 Compensation for such Plan Year exceeds $150,000.

         For purposes of this ss. 10.12, a 1% owner or 5% owner shall be
         determined without regard to the aggregation rules under Code ss.
         414(b), (c) and (m).

                  (3)      "Non-Key Employee" means any Employee or former
         Employee who is not a Key Employee, including any Employee who is a
         former Key Employee.

                  (4)      When two or more plans constitute an aggregation
         group in accordance with Code ss. 416(g)(2), the present value of the
         accrued benefits (including distributions) is determined separately
         for each plan as of each plan's determination date and the results for
         each plan as of the determination dates for such plans that fall within
         the same calendar year are added together to determine whether the
         aggregated plans are top heavy.

                  (5)      The value of any account balance and the present
         value of any accrued benefit shall include the value of any
         distributions made during the five year period ending on such
         determination date and any contributions due but as yet unpaid as of
         the determination date which are required to be taken into account on
         that date under Code ss. 416.

                  (6)      The account balance or accrued benefit of a
         Participant who is not a Key Employee for the current Plan Year but
         who was a Key Employee in a prior Plan Year or who has not performed an
         Hour of Service for a Company or any Affiliate at any time during the
         five year period ending on the Determination Date shall be disregarded.

        (e)      Rules for the Plan After December 31, 2001.  Section 13.5(e)
                 ------------------------------------------
     shall apply for purposes of determining whether the Plan is a top-heavy
     plan under Code ss. 416(g) for Plan Years beginning after December 31,
     2001, and whether the Plan satisfies the minimum benefits requirement of
     Code ss. 416(c) for such years.  This ss. 10.12(e) amends ss.ss. 10.12(a)
     through (c) of the Plan to the extent required by applicable law.

                 (1)      Determination of Present Values and Amounts.
                          -------------------------------------------
        Paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall apply for purposes of determining the
        present  values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances
        of Employees as of the Determination Date.

                          (i)      Distributions During Year Ending on
                                   -----------------------------------
                 Determination Date.  The present values of accrued benefits and
                 ------------------
                 the amounts of Account balances of an Employee as of the
                 Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions made
                 with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan
                 aggregated with the Plan under Codess.416(g)(2) during the
                 1-year period ending on the Determination Date.  The preceding
                 sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated
                 plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been
                 aggregated with the Plan under Codess.416(g)(2)(A)(i).  In the
                 case of a distribution made for a reason other than separation
                 from service, death, or disability, this provision shall be
                 applied by substituting "5-year period" for "1-year period."

                                   --------------------------------

                 performed services for the Employer or an Affiliate during the
                 1-year period ending on the determination date shall not be
                 taken into account.

                 (2)      Contributions Under Other Plans.  The Plan Sponsor may
                          -------------------------------
        provide in the records of the Plan (or may amend the Plan to reflect)
        that the minimum benefit requirement shall be met in another plan
        (including another plan that consists solely of a cash or deferred
        arrangement which meets the requirements of Code ss. 401(k)(12) and
        matching contributions with respect to which the requirements of Code
        ss. 401(m)(11)).

                 (3)      Key employee.  For purposes of this section, Key
                          ------------
        employee shall mean any Employee or former Employee (including any
        deceased Employee) who at any time during the Plan Year that includes
        the Determination date as an officer of the Employer having annual

        for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2002), a five percent owner
        of the Employer, or a one percent owner of the Employer having annual
        Compensation of more than $150,000.  For this purpose, annual
        Compensation means compensation within the meaning of Codess.415(c)(3).
        The determination of who is a Key employee will be made in accordance
        with Codess.416(i)(1) and the applicable regulations and other guidance
        of general applicability issued thereunder.
