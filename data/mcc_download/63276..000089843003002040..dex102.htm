with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-38625) for the registration of the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and the
offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the Rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the
Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit), including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or
supplemented by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), the Securities Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the &#147;Registration Statement.&#148; The Company
proposes to file with the Commission from time to time, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, supplements to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement that will describe certain terms of the Notes. The prospectus in the form in
which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Basic Prospectus.&#148; The term &#147;Prospectus&#148; means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement or supplements (each a &#147;Prospectus
Supplement&#148;) specifically relating to Notes, as filed with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. As used herein, the terms &#147;Basic Prospectus&#148; and &#147;Prospectus&#148; shall include in each case the
documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. If the Company elects to rely on Rule 434 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, all references to the Prospectus shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the form of prospectus and
the term sheet, taken together, provided to the Agents by the Company in reliance on such Rule 434 (the &#147;Rule 434 Prospectus&#148;). Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to documents, financial statements and
schedules and other information which is &#147;contained,&#148; &#147;included,&#148; &#147;stated,&#148; &#147;described in,&#148; or &#147;referred to&#148; in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all

incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be. If the Company files a registration statement to register a portion of the Notes and relies on Rule 462(b) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act for
such registration statement to become effective upon filing with the Commission (the &#147;Rule 462 Registration Statement&#148;), then any reference to &#147;Registration Statement&#148; herein shall be deemed to be to both the registration
