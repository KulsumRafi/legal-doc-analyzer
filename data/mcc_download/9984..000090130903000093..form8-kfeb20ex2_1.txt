will be Seventy-eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($78,500,000) (the

                       (a) At the Closing, the Canadian Buyer shall deliver to

Consideration"; the aggregate of the Canadian Cash Consideration and the US Cash
Consideration is sometimes referred to herein as the "Closing Payment");

                       (c) At the Closing, the US Buyer shall deliver to the US
Seller that whole number (with any fractional shares to be paid in cash, unless
US Buyer elects to round up the number of shares) of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of the common stock of US Buyer ("Barnes Common
Stock") bearing the Restricted Legend, that when multiplied by the Stock Value
(as determined on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date) equals Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($15,500,000) (the
"US Stock Consideration"); and

                       (d) At the Closing, the US Buyer shall issue in the name
of the US Seller that whole number (with any fractional shares to be paid in
cash, unless US Buyer elects to round up the number of shares) of shares of
Barnes Common Stock that when multiplied by the Stock Value (as determined on
the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) equals Three
Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (including amounts distributed in respect thereof,
if any, as contemplated by clause (ii) below, the "Retainage"). The Retainage
will be held by the US Buyer in escrow pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) until
delivered to US Seller as follows:

                            (i) Subject to Section 2.5(d) and the provisions of
the Registration Rights Agreement, US Seller shall remain the record owner of
all Retainage and shall have the right to exercise any and all voting rights
that may attach thereto.

                            (ii) US Seller authorizes the US Buyer (A) to
receive any increase in or non-cash profits on the Retainage, including
securities or other non-cash distributions, and to hold the same as part of the
Retainage; and (B) to hold the cash receipts from any payment or distribution
with respect to the Retainage as part of the Retainage.

                            (iii) Until the Retainage is delivered to US Seller
pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(iv), US Seller (A) will defend the Retainage against
the claims and demands of all other parties, and will keep the Retainage free
from all Liens other than Permitted Liens, (B) will not sell, transfer, assign,
or otherwise dispose of the Retainage or any interest therein, and (C) will pay
all Taxes which may be levied or assessed against the Retainage.

(iv) Subject to Section 2.5(d), the US Buyer shall deliver to the US Seller the
Retainage within five (5) Business Days of the later of (i) the final
determination of the Closing Balance Sheets, and (ii) in the event any amount is
owed by Sellers to Buyers under Section 2.5(c), final payment by the Sellers of
all amounts due by the Sellers, if any, pursuant to Section 2.5(c).

                  2.4 Inventory Inspection.

                       (a) The Sellers shall provide to the Buyers the results
of the physical count of the inventory of the Companies performed by the
Companies on January 2 - 3, 2003 (the "Year-end Count"), as soon as such results
are available.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

                       (b) For purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheets,
the Buyers may, at their sole option, either (i) use the Year-end Count as
adjusted by reference to the inventory purchase and sale records of the
Companies (in which case the Year-end Count shall be binding on the parties for
purposes of the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets), or (ii) at the
Buyers' sole expense, conduct a physical count, or test counts, of the inventory
of the Companies within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date as of the
Closing Balance Sheet Determination Date, which count, or test counts, the
Sellers and their representatives may observe and in which the Sellers and their
representatives may participate. In the event the Buyers conduct such a physical
count or test counts as set forth under this Section 2.4(b), the Buyers shall
provide the results and the supporting detail related to any such physical
count, or test counts, to the Sellers, and the results of such physical count,
or test counts, shall (rather than the Year-end Count), to the extent not
disputed by the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by the
Sellers of such results, be binding on the parties for purposes of the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof.

                  2.5  Post Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price.

                       (a) As soon as reasonably practical following the Closing
(but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), taking into
account the inventory count performed in accordance with Section 2.4(a) or
2.4(b), as appropriate, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers (i)
the Closing Balance Sheets, which Buyers may, at their sole option and expense,
have audited within such ninety (90) day period; and (ii) based on the Closing
Balance Sheets, a calculation of the US Net Worth and the Canadian Net Worth.
Sellers shall cooperate fully with Buyers in the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheets. All expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheets shall be the responsibility of the Buyers.

                       (b) The Closing Balance Sheets and the Net Worths shall
become final and binding upon the parties unless, within sixty (60) days
following delivery to the Sellers by the Buyers of the Closing Balance Sheets
and the Net Worths, the Sellers notify the Buyers of their objection thereto,
which objection may only be that the Closing Balance Sheets or the Net Worths
were not properly computed in accordance with the Accounting Methodology and
this Section 2.5. Any notice of objection shall specify in reasonable detail the
reasons for objection. If the Sellers so notify the Buyers of their objection to
the Closing Balance Sheets and/or the Net Worths, the Sellers and the Buyers
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences. If, within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of such notice by the Buyers (the "Resolution
Period"), any of such differences have not been resolved, then the parties shall
submit the dispute to KPMG LLP or another mutually agreed independent accounting
firm selected by Buyers and the Sellers (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). The
Independent Accounting Firm will conduct its own review and evaluate those items
or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheets relevant to the calculation of the Net
Worths and shall determine only those items still in dispute at the end of the
Resolution Period and shall determine whether such items have been prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, with respect to both Closing
Balance Sheets, with US generally accepted accounting principles, consistently
applied. The Independent Accounting Firm will be granted reasonable access to
all records of the Companies necessary for the conduct of such review, and the
parties hereto agree to follow such procedures

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

and make such submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm as it may request
in conducting its review and making its determination under this Section 2.5(b).
Buyers and Sellers shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to not assign
a value to any item in dispute greater than the highest value for such item
assigned by Buyers or Sellers, or less than the lowest value for such item
assigned by Buyers or Sellers. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the
Independent Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter. The Independent
Accounting Firm's determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after
its engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the end of the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as possible,
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Sellers and the
Buyers and shall be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all
purposes hereunder. In the event the Sellers object to the Closing Balance
Sheets and the Net Worths in accordance with this Section 2.5(b), the Closing
Balance Sheets and the Net Worths, adjusted to reflect the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items and the agreed
resolutions with respect to items for which the Sellers and the Buyers have
reached a resolution, shall become final and binding upon the parties. The
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall not be deemed an award
subject to review under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other statute. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in resolving any
differences pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be paid one-half by the
Sellers and one-half by the Buyers.

                       (c) Within ten (10) days following the final
determination of the Closing Balance Sheets and the Net Worths in accordance
with Section 2.5(b):

                            (i) If the sum of the US Net Worth plus the Canadian
Net Worth is greater than $29,061,000 (which amount was computed by reference to
the June 2002 Financial Statements and the September 2002 Financial Statements
in accordance with the Accounting Methodology, and which amount is subject to
adjustment as set forth therein), the US Buyer shall deliver to the US Seller,
at the sole option of the US Buyer, either (1) that whole number (with any
fractional shares to be paid in cash, unless Buyers elect to round up the number
of shares) of shares of Barnes Common Stock that when multiplied by the Stock
Value (as determined on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date) equals the amount of such excess, or (2) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to such excess; or

                            (ii) If the sum of US Net Worth plus the Canadian
Net Worth is less than $29,061,000 (which amount was computed by reference to
the June 2002 Financial Statements and the September 2002 Financial Statements
in accordance with the Accounting Methodology, and which amount is subject to
adjustment as set forth therein), the US Seller shall deliver to the US Buyer,
at the sole option of US Seller, either (1) that whole number (with any
fractional shares to be paid in cash, unless Sellers elect to round up the
number of shares) of shares of Barnes Common Stock that when multiplied by the
Stock Value (as determined on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date) equals the amount of such deficiency, or (2) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to such deficiency.

<PAGE>

                       (d) In the event Sellers shall not have paid any amount
due to Buyers under this Section 2.5 when due (or shall not have authorized the
delivery of the applicable number of shares out of the Retainage to Buyers),
then, upon not less than five (5) days written notice to Sellers, Buyers shall
be permitted to offset amounts due to Buyers from Sellers under Section
2.5(c)(ii), if any, against the Retainage. As soon as practicable following any
such offset, Buyers shall provide Sellers with notice of such offset. In the
event of, and to the extent of, any such offset, ownership of that portion of
the Retainage so off-set shall revert to US Buyer, and all rights of US Seller
to the off-set portion of the Retainage set forth in Section 2.3(d) shall
terminate.

                  2.6. Allocation of Purchase Price. The parties shall allocate
the sum of the Canadian Cash Consideration and Canadian Assumed Liabilities to
the purchase and sale of the Canadian Assets, and allocate the sum of the US
Cash Consideration, the US Stock Consideration and the Retainage to the purchase
and sale of the Interests. However, such allocations shall be adjusted
appropriately based on any adjustment in US Net Worth and Canadian Net Worth,
such adjustment to be allocated as between the Canadian Assets and the Interests
based on Canadian Net Worth and US Net Worth, as shall be agreed among the
Buyers and Sellers. US Seller and Canadian Seller agree to keep each other whole
so that as between US Seller and Canadian Seller, US Seller enjoys the benefit
or burden of any changes in the US Net Worth and the Canadian Seller enjoys the
benefit or burden of any changes in the Canadian Net Worth. US Buyer and
Canadian Buyer agree to keep each other whole so that as between US Buyer and
Canadian Buyer, US Buyer enjoys the benefit or burden of any changes in the US
Net Worth and the Canadian Buyer enjoys the benefit or burden of any changes in
the Canadian Net Worth. Each party agrees to report such allocation on its Tax
Returns and not to take a position on any Tax Return that is in any manner
inconsistent with such allocation without the written consent of the other
parties or unless required by Law. US Buyer and the US Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to jointly complete a Form 8594 so that each
such party may separately file such form with its federal income Tax Return for
the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs. Canadian Buyer and Canadian
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare a schedule of the
allocation of the total Canadian consideration among the Canadian Assets. If
Buyers and the Sellers are unable to reach agreement with respect to such
allocations, then each such party shall make its own determination of such
allocations for tax reporting purposes.

                  2.7. Reconciliation of Cash. On the Closing Date, but prior to
the Closing, the US Seller shall prepare and deliver to the US Buyer a good
faith estimate of the Book Cash of the US Company (the "Estimated US Book Cash")
as of the Closing Balance Sheet Determination Date. At the Closing, the US Buyer
shall deliver to US Seller, via wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account specified by US Seller no less than five (5) Business Days prior to
Closing, an amount equal to the Estimated US Book Cash. Within ten (10) days
following the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheets, if the
difference between the Book Cash of the US Seller set forth on the US Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated US Book Cash is:

                       (a) positive, then the US Buyer shall deliver to the US
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal
to such difference; and

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

                       (b) negative, then the US Seller shall deliver to the US
Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal
to such difference.

applied (with respect to both the US Company and the Canadian Company)
throughout the periods indicated, and (C) fairly present in accordance with US
generally accepted accounting principles the financial condition of the US
Company and the Canadian Company at the respective dates thereof and for the
periods indicated. The accounting treatment used in the Annual Financial
Statements is materially consistent with that used by Ernst & Young, LLP, in
preparation of the audited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated
statements of income and cash flow for such periods for GC-Sun Holdings II, L.P,
and all notes and schedules thereto.

otherwise, and whether due or to become due that would be required to be
reflected on the balance sheet of such Company prepared in conformity with US
generally accepted accounting principles, including, without limitation, any
liability for Taxes and interest, penalties and other charges payable with
respect to any such liability or obligation.

                       (c) The books of account and other financial records of
the Companies: (i) reflect all items of income and expense and all assets and
liabilities required to be reflected therein in accordance with US generally
accepted accounting principles, (ii) are in all material respects complete and
correct, and do not contain or reflect any material inaccuracies or
discrepancies, and (iii) have been maintained in accordance with good business
and accounting practices. Each Company makes and keeps accurate (in all material
respects) books and records reflecting its assets and maintains internal
accounting controls that provide reasonable assurance that, in all material
respects (x) transactions are executed in accordance with management's

                                      -23-

preparation of each Company's Financial Statements and to maintain
accountability for the assets of each of the Companies.

Companies have delivered to the Buyers true, accurate, and complete copies of
each written Contract (and a summary of each oral Contract) listed on Schedules
4.10(a) and 4.10(b) (excluding any purchase orders).

                       (d) On the date hereof, and, subject to the receipt of
those consents and approvals set forth on Schedule 4.5, as of the Closing (i)
each Contract listed on Schedules 4.10(a) and 4.10(b), except as expired by its
terms, is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the US Company or the
Canadian Company, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, the
other party or parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' or landlords' rights and
remedies generally) and is in full force and effect, (ii) the Companies have
each fully performed their respective obligations under the Contracts listed on
Schedules 4.10(a) and 4.10(b) and there exists no default by, or event of

                  4.11. Real Property.

                       (a) Schedule 4.11(a) lists and describes in reasonable
detail all interests in real property owned, whether legally or beneficially, by
any Company (the "Owned Real Property"). Except as set forth on Schedule
4.11(a), the Companies do not own and, to the

                                      -30-
<PAGE>
Knowledge of the Sellers, have never owned any real property other than the
Owned Real Property.

                       (b) Schedule 4.11(b) describes in reasonable detail the
real property leased by either Company from a third party (the "Leased Real
Property"). With respect to the Leased Real Property, except as set forth on
Schedule 4.11(b):

                            (i) the party identified on Schedule 4.11(b) has a
valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens);

                            (ii) no Seller Party has received written notice of
any condemnation or expropriation proceedings, lawsuits or administrative
actions relating to the Leased Real Property;

                            (iii) no Seller Party has received written notice
that the use or occupancy of the Leased Real Property violates any covenants,
conditions or restrictions that encumber such property, or that any such
property is subject to any restriction for which any Permits necessary for the
current use thereof have not been obtained;

                            (iv) there are no subleases, licenses, concessions
or other agreements granting to any Person the right of use or occupancy of any
portion of the Leased Real Property; and

                            (v) Sellers have delivered to the Buyers true,
correct and complete copies of the real property leases for the Leased Real
Property (including without limitation any amendments and underlying leases)
(the "Real Property Leases"). The Real Property Leases contain the entire
agreement between the landlord of each Leased Real Property and the appropriate
Company (and Seller or Parent if applicable) and there are no other agreements
between the landlord and any Seller Party affecting such Leased Real Property.
The Real Property Leases are in full force and effect. No material default of
the appropriate Company (and Seller or Parent if applicable) has occurred under
any of the Real Property Leases nor has any event occurred which, with the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a material
default of the appropriate Company (and Seller or Parent if applicable)
thereunder. Any default under the Real Property Leases has been cured within
applicable cure periods provided in the Real Property Leases. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the appropriate Company (and Seller or Parent
if applicable) under the Real Property Leases is current in the payment of all
rent due under the Real Property Leases. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no
material default of the landlord has occurred under any of the Real Property
Leases nor has any event occurred which, with the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both would constitute a material default of the landlord
thereunder.

                  4.12. Intellectual Property.

                       (a) The Companies each own or have the right to use
pursuant to license, sublicense, agreement or permission all Intellectual
Property necessary for and material to the operation of their businesses as
presently conducted (the "Companies' Intellectual Property"). Each item of the
Companies' Intellectual Property immediately prior to the Closing

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

hereunder will be owned or available for use by the Buyers on identical terms
and conditions immediately after the Closing. The Companies have taken all
reasonably necessary action to maintain and protect each item of the Companies'
Intellectual Property. Schedule 4.12(a) is a true, correct and complete list of
each trade name, and registered and unregistered trademark and domain name owned
or available for use by the Companies (collectively, the "Trademarks").

                       (b) To the Knowledge of the Sellers (i) neither Company
has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into
conflict with any Intellectual Property rights of third parties, and (ii) since
December 31, 1996, none of the directors, managers, and officers (and any
employee with primary responsibility for Intellectual Property matters) of the
Seller Parties have ever received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice
alleging any such interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation
(including any claim that the Companies must license or refrain from using any
Intellectual Property rights of any third party). To the Knowledge of the
Sellers, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or
otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property rights of the
Companies.

                       (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(c), the
Companies have not granted any license, agreement, right or other permission to
any third party with respect to the Intellectual Property owned or licensed by
the Companies. With respect to each item of Intellectual Property owned or
licensed by the Companies: (i) with the exception of licenses relating to
commercial software products, the Companies possesses or will possess as of the
Closing Date, upon obtaining any consent set forth on Schedule 4.5, all right,
title and interest in and to the item, free and clear of any Lien other than
Permitted Liens, license or other restriction; (ii) the item is not subject to
any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge; (iii) no
proceeding, complaint, claim or demand is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened which challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, use
or ownership of the item; and (iv) the Companies have not agreed to indemnify
any Person for or against any interference, infringement, misappropriation or
other conflict with respect to the item.

                       (d) The Companies have fully performed their respective
obligations under each license, sublicense, or agreement relating to
Intellectual Property and there exists no default or event of default on behalf
of any of the Companies thereunder, nor has any event occurred which, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, with notice, the passage of time or both would constitute
a default thereunder by any of the Companies.

                  4.13. Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13, no
Seller or Company is (a) subject to any unsatisfied judgment, order, decree,
stipulation, injunction or criminal charge or regulatory proceeding (b) a party
to or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, has been threatened to be made a party
to any complaint, claim, action, suit, grievance, criminal charge, proceeding,
including, without limitation, a regulatory hearing or investigation, in any
court or quasi-judicial or administrative agency of any Governmental Entity or
(c) subject to any product liability or other claim made or in the process of
negotiation with the claimant thereof. There are no judicial, administrative
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened that question the validity of this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements or any action taken or to be taken by the Seller Parties in
connection with this

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements that, if adversely determined,
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies. To the Knowledge of the
Sellers, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any claim that would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies, or
material adverse effect upon the Seller Parties' ability to enter into or
perform their obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements to which any Seller Party is a party.

                  4.14. Employee Benefit Matters.

                       (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(a), the
Companies do not maintain or contribute to, or have any obligation to contribute
to or have any liability (including a liability arising out of an
indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) with respect to
any plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement, practice, or commitment which
is an employment, consulting, severance pay, termination pay, change in control
or deferred compensation agreement, or an executive compensation, incentive
bonus or other bonus or commission, employee pension, profit-sharing, savings,
retirement, early retirement, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, life, health, dental, disability or accident insurance plan, or other
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, agreement or commitment, including
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA or a Registered
Pension Plan as defined under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (individually, a
"Plan," or collectively, the "Plans"). Schedule 4.14(a) sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Plans. Each such Plan is identified on Schedule
4.14(a) to the extent applicable, as one or both of the following: an "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or an "employee
welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA). Plans maintained by the
Companies solely for current or former employees employed in Canada are hereby
referred to as "Canadian Plans." Plans maintained by the Companies which cover
United States or Puerto Rico current or former employees are hereby referred to
as "US Plans."

                       (b) Except for the 2001 Amendment and Restatement of KAR
Product Retirement Income Plan (the "KAR Retirement Plan"), the Companies are
not subject to any actual or contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA,
Section 302 of ERISA, Section 412 or 4971 of the Code and no fact or event
exists which could give rise to any such liability, whether in respect of any
pension plan maintained by such Company or by any other employer or Person or
otherwise and no outstanding defaults or violations exist under the Plans. The
KAR Retirement Plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency (as defined
under Section 412 of the Code), nor do the Companies have any current liability
with respect to such plan under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of
ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course).

                       (c) No event has occurred and no circumstance exists, in
connection with which one of the Companies, or any US Plan, directly or
indirectly, could be subject to any material liability under ERISA, the Code, or
any other Law applicable to any US Plan or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
under any Contract or Law pursuant to or under which either Company has agreed
to indemnify or is required to indemnify any Person against liability incurred
under, or for a violation or failure to satisfy the requirements of ERISA, the
Code or any other Law

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

applicable to any US Plan. The Companies are not in breach of any contractual or
fiduciary obligations with respect to the administration of the US Plans or the
funding media related thereto.

                       (d) With respect to each US Plan, (i) except as discussed
on Schedule 4.14(d), all payments, contributions or premiums due from the
relevant Company to date have been timely made, provided that, while to the
Knowledge of the Sellers all payments, contributions and premiums have been made
on a timely basis, if any contribution to a US Plan that is an employee pension
benefit plan were untimely, such failure could be corrected under the Department
of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program and Prohibited Transaction
Class Exemption 2002-51 without significant cost or penalty to the relevant
Company ; (ii) there are no taxes, penalties or fees owing or exigible under or
in respect of any US Plan; and (iii) there are no actions, examinations,
proceedings, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits)
or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened with respect to any such Plan or
against the assets of any such US Plan and to the Knowledge of the Sellers no
facts or circumstances exist which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such investigation, examination, proceeding, action, suit or claim (other
than routine claims for benefits).

                       (e) Each US Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and intended to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to such qualification, its
related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code, or the remedial amendment period for such Plan has not yet
expired and nothing has occurred that has or is likely to adversely affect such
qualification or exemption. Each US Plan has complied in all material respects
with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and each of the Plans
has been maintained and operated in material compliance with its terms.

                       (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(f), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement (alone or together with any other event) will not (i)
entitle any Person to any benefit or payment under any US Plan (including
without limitation bonus, golden parachute, retirement, severance, employment
compensation, or other benefit or enhanced benefit), (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation or other benefit
due to any Person under any US Plan, (iii) entitle any employee to any job
security or similar benefit or any enhanced benefits, or (iv) result in the
payment or series of payments by either Company to any Person of an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

                       (g) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.14(g), the
Companies do not have any liability with respect to an obligation to provide
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any Person beyond their
retirement or other termination of service other than (i) coverage under a US
Plan mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state law and which is fully paid for by the Person entitled to such
coverage, (ii) fully funded retirement benefits under any employee pension plan,
(iii) short-term disability and fully insured long-term disability benefits
(provided such coverage is not made available to employees

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

after their termination of employment with the Companies), or (iv) fully insured
death benefits (provided such coverage is not made available to employees after
their termination of employment with the Companies).

                       (h) Each Company has delivered to the Buyer, with respect
to each US Plan for which the following exists:

                            (i) a true, accurate and complete copy of the three
most recent Forms 5500 with respect to each Plan;

                            (ii) a true, accurate and complete copy of the
Summary Plan Description, together with each "Summary of Material
Modifications", required under ERISA with respect to such Plan, and, unless the
Plan is embodied entirely in an insurance policy to which the Company is a party
and which has been delivered to Buyer, a true and complete copy of such Plan;

                            (iii) if the Plan is funded through a trust or any
third party funding vehicle (other than an insurance policy), a copy of the
trust or other funding agreement;

                            (iv) the most recent determination letter received
from the IRS with respect to each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
under Section 401 of the Code;

                            (v) the two most recent actuarial reports and
financial statements prepared for each Plan; and

                            (vi) a written description of (i) each US Plan that
is not in writing, and (ii) each amendment to any US Plan that has not been
reduced to writing.

                       (i) The Companies have not announced any plan and do not
have any legally binding commitment to create any additional US Plans or to
amend or modify any existing US Plan, other than amendments required by Law or
those that would not materially increase costs under any such Plan and no event
has occurred which would entitle any Person (without the consent of the relevant
Company) to wind up or terminate any US Plan, in whole or in part.

                       (j) The Companies have complied in all material respects
with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and Sections 4980B, 9801 and
9802 of the Code.

                       (k) Except for the KAR Retirement Plan, the Companies do
not and have never sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an
obligation to contribute to any "Defined Benefit Plan", "Multiemployer Plan" or
"Multiple Employer Plan". For these purposes, "Defined Benefit Plan" has the
meaning set forth in Section 414 of the Code, "Multiemployer Plan" means a
multiemployer Plan as defined in Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA and
"Multiple Employer Plan" means any Plan sponsored by more than one employer,
within the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 or ERISA or Section 413(c) of the
Code.

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

                       (l) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not trigger a "reportable event" and there has been no "reportable event" as
that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations there under
which would require the giving of notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.

                       (m) Except as contemplated by Section 7.7, as of the
Closing, the US Plans will cover only employees and former employees of the US
Company and their dependents and beneficiaries, will not provide benefits to any
other employees or former employees of the Seller Parties or their Affiliates,
and, except for employees and former employees of the US Company and their
dependents and beneficiaries, no other individuals will have an interest in or
rights under the US Plans.

                       (n) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(n) and for the
benefits promised under such US Plan, each US Plan may be terminated without
additional further liability to any of the Companies.

                       (o) To the Knowledge of the Sellers, with respect to each
Plan that is a "welfare plan" as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA, there is no
event or circumstance that has occurred that could result in a material increase
in the premium costs of any insured Plan or a material increase in the benefits
costs of any self-insured Plan.

                       (p) Canadian Plans.

                            (i) Where required by Law, the Canadian Plans have
been established under, and are registered, maintained, invested and
administered in accordance with, Laws relating to such plans and the terms of
such Canadian Plans, and all filings, reports and disclosures with respect
thereto required by Law have been filed or distributed. All obligations of the
Sellers and the Canadian Company required by Law, the terms of the Canadian
Plans or by contract to be performed in connection with the Canadian Plans or
the funding media relating thereto, have been so performed or fulfilled.

                            (ii) All payments, contributions or premiums
required to be remitted or paid to or in respect of each Canadian Plan have been
remitted and paid in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms thereof, any
contract in respect thereof and all Laws. There are no outstanding defaults or
violations by any party to any Canadian Plan nor any Taxes, penalties or fees
owing or exigible under any Canadian Plan and to the Knowledge of the Sellers no
fact or circumstance exists which would adversely affect the tax-exempt status
of any Canadian Plan or result in or give rise to any liability to the Canadian
Company.

                            (iii) There is no investigation, examination,
proceeding, action, suit or claim (other than routine claims for benefits)
pending or threatened involving any Canadian Plan or its assets and to the
Knowledge of the Sellers no facts or circumstances exist which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any such investigation, examination, proceeding,
action, suit or claim (other than routine claims for benefits).

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

                            (iv) No event has occurred in respect of any
Canadian Plan which would result in the requirement of the Canadian Company
(without its consent) to wind up or terminate any applicable Canadian Plan,
either in whole or in part.

                            (v) None of the Canadian Plans, other than in
respect of pension plans, provides post-employment or post-retirement benefits
to or in respect of the employees or any former employees of the Canadians
Companies, or to or in respect of the beneficiaries or dependents thereof.

                            (vi) The Sellers have provided to the Buyers true
and complete copies of all Canadian Plans (or where such Canadian Plans are oral
commitments, written summaries of their terms), and any amendments thereto,
together with all related documents including without limitation, funding
agreements, investment contracts or guidelines, actuarial reports, insurance
policies, funding returns, annual returns, financial statements, plan summaries,
employee booklets and personnel manuals. All employee data necessary to
administer the Canadian Plans is in the possession and control of the Canadian
Company and is complete and accurate.

                            (vii) Where required by Law, under its terms or by
Contract, each Canadian Plan has been fully funded or fully insured. In respect
of each Canadian Plan that is funded, in whole or in part, no funds have been

policy is in full force and effect; (ii) neither the Companies nor, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, any other party to the policy is in material breach or
default (including with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of

to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business

bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles.

respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of
the US Buyer or the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association of the

any order, judgment or decree to which a Buyer is a party or by which either
Buyer or any of their respective assets or properties is bound or encumbered, or
give any Person the right to require either Buyer to purchase or repurchase any
notes, bonds or instruments of any kind, or (iv) violate any Law applicable to
one or both of the Buyers or any of their respective properties or assets,
except, with respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) for any such failures,
violations or conflicts that would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on either Buyer.

                  5.4. Litigation. There are no judicial or administrative
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Buyers' knowledge,
threatened that question the validity of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any action taken or to be taken by the Buyers in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or that, if adversely
determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Buyers or material
adverse effect upon the Buyers' ability to enter into or perform their
obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to which
either Buyer is a party.

                  5.5. Brokers' Fees. Neither Buyer has any liability or

account, for investment, and not with a view to any resale or "distribution"
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

                       (c) The US Buyer understands that because the sale of the
Interests to the US Buyer has not been registered under the Securities Act, the
US Buyer cannot dispose of any of such Interests until such Interests are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Buyers, the US Company or

Agreement by the Sellers, the Parents, their agents, representatives,

prior to the Closing Date).

                       (d) No Competition. Sellers and Parents each agree that
for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, no Seller, Parent or
any of their subsidiaries shall have any interest, either directly or
indirectly, in any entity, whether as shareholder (other than the ownership of
less than ten percent (10%) of the stock of a publicly-held corporation whose
stock is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter
market), partner, member, manager, independent contractor, consultant, agent,
principal, franchisee, franchisor, creditor, officer, director, employee,
individual owner or proprietor, or otherwise, either on behalf of such Seller or
Parent or on behalf of any other Person, that engages, either directly or
indirectly in the Business; provided, however, that the Sellers and Parents or
any of their Affiliates shall be permitted to retain their ownership interests
in C&J Fasteners, Inc., Brafasco Holdings, Inc., and Brampton Fastener Co.
Limited provided C&J Fasteners, Inc., Brafasco Holdings, Inc., and Brampton
Fastener Co. Limited only conduct their business using those types of sales
channels as they have used in the conduct of their businesses over the twelve
(12) month period prior to the Closing Date. The restrictions in this Section
7.2(d) shall apply to a geographic region that coincides with the North
American-wide scope of the Business.

                       (e) Remedies Upon Breach. The Sellers and the Parents
each hereby acknowledge and agree that a material breach or threatened breach
thereby of any of the provisions contained in this Section 7.2 will cause
irreparable injury to the US Company and the Buyers. Sellers and Parents
therefore agree that, in addition to any other right or remedy the Buyer Parties
may have under this Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to a
temporary restraining order and to a preliminary and permanent injunction
enjoining or restraining the breach or threatened breach of this Section 7.2 by
a Seller or Parent. The Sellers and the Parents further agree that the Buyer
Parties shall have the right to have the provisions of this Section 7.2
specifically enforced.

                       (f) Authority of the Court. Consistent with the intent of
the parties, if it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that any covenant or agreement set forth in this Section 7.2, or
any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power
to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified, and that any covenants and agreements not subject to judicial
modification shall be given their full effect according to their terms.

                       (g) Termination. Notwithstanding any provision herein to
the contrary, the provisions of Sections 7.2(c) and 7.2(d) shall terminate with
respect to any Person otherwise bound thereby at such time as such Person ceases
to be affiliated with Glencoe Capital, LLC.

                  7.3 Acquisition Bonuses. Sellers shall pay directly any
bonuses to be paid to employees of the US Company in connection with completion
of the transaction contemplated by

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

this Agreement and shall hold Buyers and US Company harmless from and indemnify
Buyers and US Company with respect to any Damages related to such bonuses
(including, without limitation, failure of Sellers to pay such bonuses).

                  7.4 Certain Financial Information. The Seller Parties shall,
at Buyer's expense and during reasonable business hours, provide the Buyers and
their representatives with access to relevant books and records of the Sellers
for, and cooperate with and assist the Buyers in, the preparation by Buyers of
audited and unaudited financial and other information required for the
preparation of selected and summary financial data and pro forma financial
information regarding the business of the Companies for all periods ending prior
to the Closing Date required by applicable provisions of Regulations S-X and S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and shall provide such management representation letters
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller Parties'
outside independent public accountants to deliver such consents and comfort as
are customary under applicable accounting standards, as promptly as reasonably
practicable but in no event later than forty-five days following the request of
Buyers therefore. The US Company and Canadian Buyer shall be responsible for the
preparation of and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, review and audit of the financial statements of the Companies for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

                  7.5  D&O Indemnitees.

                       (a) The US Company shall, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Person set forth on Schedule 7.5
(collectively, the "D&O Indemnitees" and individually, a "D&O Indemnitee") from
and against any and all Damages that arise out of, relate to or are in
connection with the management or conduct of the business or affairs of the US
Company or the D&O Indemnitees' activities with respect thereto, except for any
such Damages that have resulted from willful misconduct or recklessness by the
D&O Indemnitee seeking indemnification.

                       (b) Nothing in clause (a) above shall limit the coverage
of or otherwise be deemed to replace or be in lieu of any insurance otherwise
available to any D&O Indemnitee. Any D&O Indemnitee shall make a good faith
effort to recover any insurance proceeds that may be available to cover any
Damages (including, without limitation, under the D&O Policy described in clause
(d) below). The amount which the US Company is required to pay to, for, or on
behalf of any D&O Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be reduced
(including, without limitation, retroactively) by any insurance proceeds
actually recovered by or on behalf of such D&O Indemnitee and other amounts paid
by any person in reduction of the related Damages. If a D&O Indemnitee shall
have received or shall have paid on its behalf any amounts in respect of Damages
and shall subsequently receive directly or indirectly insurance proceeds or
other amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnitee shall promptly
pay to the US Company a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or
other amounts provided the same does not exceed an amount equal to the payment
actually made by the US Company under this Section 7.5.

                       (c) Effective upon consummation of the Closing, the Buyer
Parties, and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, shall
be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged the D&O Indemnitees
of and from any and all Damages which the Buyer Parties, and each of their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, or any of them, has or ever had,
or hereafter can, shall or may have, arising out of the actions or inactions of
any such D&O Indemnitees in their capacities as officers, managers or directors
of the US Company; provided, however, that this Section 7.5(c) shall not apply
to Damages that (i) arise from the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of any
of the D&O Indemnitees, or (ii) may arise from the breach by any of the D&O
Indemnitees of, or the failure to perform, any obligation or duty arising on the
part of any of the D&O Indemnitees after the date hereof under this Agreement,
any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any other agreement to be entered into after
the date hereof and contemplated hereby to which any of the D&O Indemnitees is a
party.

                       (d) Sellers and the Parents, or any of them, shall
purchase or otherwise have in place, effective as of the Closing, a policy or
policies of insurance for errors and omissions of the D&O Indemnities in their
capacities as officers and directors of the Companies prior to the Closing with
limits of at least $3,000,000 (the "D&O Policy"). The D&O Policy shall be
maintained by the Sellers and the Parents, or any of them, for a period of not
less than six (6) years. The US Company shall be named as a named insured on a
direct and primary basis under such D&O Policy. The D&O Policy shall be written
such that the US Company will be notified by the insurer of the cancellation
(including cancellation for non-renewal) or restrictive amendment of the D&O
Policy at least thirty (30) days prior to the date that the cancellation or
restrictive amendment takes effect. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing,
Sellers shall provide the Buyers with certificates of insurance evidencing full
compliance with the above insurance requirements. Such certificates will be kept
current throughout the entire above-mentioned six (6) year period. Buyers'
acceptance of such certificates shall not relieve Sellers and the Parents of the
obligation to obtain and maintain the coverage set forth above, nor shall such
acceptance be deemed a waiver of the US Company's and Canadian Buyer's right to
such coverage.

                  7.6 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute such
 further documents and instruments and take such further actions as may
 reasonably be requested by one or more of the other parties hereto to
 consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
 Agreements, to vest the US Buyer with full title to the Interests, to vest the
 Canadian Buyer with full title to the Canadian Assets, to file all Tax Returns
 and make any elections related to Taxes, and to otherwise effect the purposes
 of this Agreement. Upon the reasonable request of the Canadian Buyer, the
 Seller Parties shall provide the Canadian Buyer with copies of any books or
 records of the Canadian Company related to the Canadian Assets or the business
 of the Canadian Company.

                  7.7 Agreement Regarding Company 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding
Section 6.6(a), it is understood that it may not be commercially reasonable for
the Seller Parties to cause the Kar Products LLC Savings and Investment Plan
(the "Company 401(k) Plan") to cover only employees and former employees of the
Companies and their beneficiaries on the Closing. As a result, in the event
employees and former employees of Affiliates of the Seller Parties, other than
employees and former employees of the Companies (the "Non-Company Participants")

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

participate in the Company 401(k) Plan on and after the Closing, Buyer and the
Seller Parties shall cooperate and take such action as is necessary to spin-off
the assets and liabilities of the Company 401(k) Plan relating to the
Non-Company Participants, in accordance with Code Section 414(l), to a successor
plan to be established by the Seller Parties or an Affiliate thereof (the "Plan
Spin-Off") as soon as commercially reasonable following the Closing. Until the
date of the Plan Spin-Off the Buyer shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to
continue to receive contributions and administer the Company 401(k) Plan on
behalf of the Non-Company Participants. It is specifically understood that after
the Closing Buyer and Kar shall have no obligation to make contributions to the
Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of any Non-Company Participant and that the Seller
Parties and their Affiliates shall be fully responsible for all contributions
for Non-Company Participants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the
Companies shall have no obligation to allow Non-Company Participants to
participate in the Company 401(k) Plan for payroll periods beginning 45 days
after the Closing and the Plan Spin-Off shall be completed within 60 days after
the Closing. Additionally, Seller Parties and their Affiliates shall pay and
indemnify Buyer, the Companies and the Company 401(k) Plan for all costs and
liabilities associated with covering Non-Company Participants, including but not
limited to on-going administrative costs associated with providing such
coverage, as well as the administrative, consulting and legal costs associated
with the Plan Spin-Off.

                  7.8 Transition Services. Effective upon the Closing, the
parties shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement, pursuant to which
they shall each provide certain services for a specified period following the
Closing and in consideration of the agreements, covenants and provisions
contained herein.

                  7.9 Misdirected Receivables. From and after the Closing,
Seller Parties shall remit promptly to Canadian Buyer any payments or other sums
received by the Canadian Company for an account receivable of the Canadian
Company that existed on or prior to Closing.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                   TAX MATTERS

                  8.1  Indemnity.

                       (a) Subject to Section 11.6(f), the Sellers and Parents
agree from and after the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Parties against the following Taxes (except to the extent reserves for such
Taxes have been specifically established on the Closing Balance Sheets) and
against any Damages incurred in contesting or otherwise in connection with any
such Taxes: (i) Taxes (but excluding any expenses incurred by Buyers in
participation in any audit where Sections 8.4(b) and 8.4(c) specifically
provides that such expenses of participation be paid by the Buyers) imposed on
the Companies or any predecessor with respect to taxable periods of such Person
ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to taxable periods
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, (A) Taxes
imposed on the US Company which are allocable, pursuant to Section 8.1(b), to
the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date, and (B) all such Taxes
imposed on the Canadian Company, except for Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the ownership or use of the Canadian

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

Assets, then only such Taxes allocable, pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), to the
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date; (iii) Taxes imposed on the
Canadian Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) under any bulk transfer law of any
jurisdiction or under common law doctrine of de facto merger or successor
liability as a result of the purchase, use and operation of the Canadian Assets;
(iv) Taxes imposed on any member of any affiliated group with which any of the
Companies or any predecessor file or have filed a Tax Return on a consolidated
or combined basis for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; and
(v) Taxes imposed on the Buyer Parties as a result of any breach of warranty or
misrepresentation under Section 4.9. The Buyers shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Parties for any Taxes of the Buyer Parties not allocated to
the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.1(a).

                       (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to
a taxable period that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends after the
Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of
the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

                            (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based
upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, as provided under Section 8.7), deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

                            (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the real, personal or intangible property of the
Companies, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days from the beginning of the period through
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

                  8.2 Returns and Payments.

                       (a) From the date of this Agreement through and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper
form to the appropriate Governmental Entity (or cause to be prepared and filed
or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the US Company
that are due on or before or relate to any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date (and the Buyers shall do the same for the US Company with
respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Tax Returns of the
US Company not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing
Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed with
respect to the US Company (except to the extent counsel for the Sellers or the
US Company renders a legal opinion that there is no reasonable basis in law
therefore or determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed
without being subject to penalties). With respect to any Tax Return required to
be filed by the Buyers or the Sellers with respect to the US Company and as to
which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other party under Section 8.1(b), the
filing party shall provide the other party and its authorized representatives
with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount
of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to such other party pursuant
to Section 8.1(b), together with appropriate supporting information and
schedules at

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension
thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and such other party and its
authorized representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Return and statement prior the filing of such Tax Return.

                       (b) The Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid when due
and payable all Taxes with respect to the US Company for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount,
if any, accrued for such Taxes as current Taxes payable on the Closing Balance
Sheets (subject to Section 11.6(f)), and the Buyers shall so pay or cause to be
paid Taxes for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (subject to its
right of indemnification from the Sellers by the date set forth in Section 8.5
for Taxes attributable to the portion of any Tax period that includes the
Closing Date pursuant to Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b)).

                  8.3 Refunds. Any Tax refund (including any interest with
respect thereto) relating to the US Company for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (except for any refund included on the Closing Balance
Sheets, which shall be the property of the Buyers, and if paid to the Sellers,
shall be paid over promptly to the Buyers) shall be the property of the Sellers
(and not the US Company), and if received by the Buyers or the US Company shall
be paid over promptly to the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to the Sellers through a reduction in Tax
liability) for a period ending on or before the Closing Date arising out of the
carryback of a loss or credit incurred by the US Company in a taxable year
ending after the Closing Date shall be the property of the Buyers and, if
received by the Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to the Buyers. The amount
or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the US
Company with respect to a taxable period that begins prior to the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date shall be equitably apportioned in a manner
consistent with the liability to pay such Taxes pursuant to Section 8.1(a).

                  8.4  Contests.

                       (a) After the Closing, each of the Buyers and the Sellers
shall promptly notify the other in writing of any written notice of a proposed
assessment, reassessment, or claim in an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for
indemnification under this Article 8, provided, however, that a failure to give
such notice will not affect the indemnified party's right to indemnification
under this Article 8 except to the extent, if any, that, but for such failure,
the indemnified party could have avoided all or a portion of the Tax liability
in question.

                       (b) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding with respect to the US Company that relates to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, provided that the Sellers acknowledge in writing their
liability under this Agreement to hold the Buyers and the US Company harmless
against the full amount of any adjustment which may be made as a result of such
audit or proceeding that relates to periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(or, in the case of any taxable year that includes the Closing Date, against an
adjustment allocable under Section 8.1(b) to the portion of such year ending on
or before the Closing Date), the Sellers shall have the right at their expense
to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

proceeding but only to the extent that such audit or proceeding relates solely
to a potential adjustment for which the Sellers have acknowledged their
liability; the Buyers also may participate in any such audit or proceeding at
their expense. If the Sellers do not assume the defense of any such audit or
proceeding, the Buyers may defend the same in such manner as they may deem
appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding
after giving five days' prior written notice to the Sellers setting forth the
terms and conditions of settlement (subject to Section 8.4(d)). In the event
that issues relating to a potential adjustment for which the Sellers have
acknowledged their liability pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) are required to be
dealt with in the same proceeding as separate issues relating to a potential
adjustment for which the Buyers would be liable, the Buyers shall have the
right, at their expense, to control the audit or proceeding with respect to the
latter issues. In such cases, Buyer and Seller will cooperate in deciding any
issue that must be decided jointly (including, without limitation, choice of
judicial forum).

                       (c) With respect to issues relating to a potential
adjustment in the Taxes of the US Company for which both the Sellers (as
evidenced by their acknowledgment under this Section 8.4) and the Buyers or the
Companies could be liable, (i) each party may participate in the audit or
proceeding, and (ii) the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party
which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment
and any corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future
Tax periods. The principle set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall
govern also for purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly
(including, without limitation, choice of judicial forum) in situations in which
separate issues are otherwise controlled under this Article 8 by the Buyers and
the Sellers.

                       (d) Neither the Buyers nor the Sellers shall enter into
any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or
proceeding with respect to the US Company which would adversely affect the other
party for such year or a subsequent year without the written consent of the
other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyers and the
Sellers agree to cooperate, and the Buyers agree to cause the US Company to
cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any audit or
proceeding.

                       (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Canadian Company or Sellers shall solely control any audit or
proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Canadian Company, and the Buyer Parties
shall have no right to participate in any such proceeding.

                  8.5 Time of Payment. Payment by the Sellers or Buyers of any
amounts due under this Article 8 in respect of Taxes shall be made (i) at least
three (3) Business Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final
Tax Return, and (ii) within three (3) Business Days following an agreement
between the Sellers and the Buyers that an indemnity amount is payable pursuant
to an assessment of a Tax by a taxing authority or for any other reason, and
(iii) within seven (7) Business Days following a "determination" as defined in
section 1313(a) of the Code.

<PAGE>

                  8.6 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Sellers and
the Buyers will provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a
right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or furnishing
information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase any of the Companies or
any assets of the Companies from the Buyers. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating
to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Sellers, Buyers and
the Companies shall make their employees available on a basis mutually
convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Each of the Sellers and the Buyers shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Companies (collectively, "Tax
Documents") for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for
all prior taxable periods in accordance with all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity, but in any event until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which
such Tax Documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such
Tax Returns. Each party agrees to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such Tax Documents and, if
the other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such Tax Documents. Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Any
information obtained under this Section 8.6 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with Section 7.2 except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding.

                  8.7 Conveyance Taxes. The Sellers shall be liable for and
shall hold the Buyers harmless against any sales, use, transfer (including,
without limitation, real property transfer or gains), value added, stock
transfer, and stamp taxes, recording, registration, and other fees, and any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the sale of the Interests,
and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to
be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure. The US Buyer shall execute and deliver all
instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Sellers to comply with the
foregoing.

                  8.8 Accounts Receivable Election. Upon finalization of the
Closing Balance Sheets, the Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall,
pursuant to Section 22 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), jointly elect to have the
provisions of Section 22 apply to the purchase and sale of those receivables
that are part of the Canadian Assets by completing form T2022. This form will be
filed by the Canadian Buyer pursuant to Section 22 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada).

<PAGE>

                  8.9 Canadian Sales and Transfer Taxes. Each party shall pay
direct to the appropriate Governmental Entity all sales and transfer taxes,
registration charges and transfer fees, other than the goods and services tax
and harmonized sales tax imposed under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada),
payable by it in respect of the purchase and sale of the Canadian Assets under
this Agreement.

                  8.10 Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax Election.
The Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall jointly elect, under subsection
167(1) of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada), and any equivalent or
corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial
legislation imposing a similar value added or multi-staged tax, that no tax be
payable with respect to the purchase and sale of the Canadian Assets under this
Agreement. The Canadian Buyer and the Canadian Seller shall make such
election(s) in prescribed form containing prescribed information and the
Canadian Buyer shall file such election(s) in compliance with the requirements
of the applicable legislation.

                  8.11 Self-Assessment of Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized
Sales Tax on Real Property. To the extent permitted under subsection 221(2) of
the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under
any applicable provincial or territorial legislation, the Canadian Buyer shall
self-assess and remit directly to the appropriate Governmental Entity any goods
and services tax and harmonized sales tax imposed under the Excise Tax Act
(Canada) and any similar value added or multi-staged tax imposed by any
applicable provincial or territorial legislation payable in connection with the
transfer of any interest in real property. The Canadian Buyer shall make and
file a return(s) in accordance with the requirements of subsection 228(4) of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any

                  11.4 Intentionally Omitted.

                  11.5 Procedures. Except as otherwise provided in Article 8,
the following provisions shall apply to claims for Damages arising from claims
by a third party (each a "Claim"). Promptly after receipt by any Person entitled
to indemnification under this Article 11 of notice of the commencement of a
Claim in respect of which such Person will seek indemnification hereunder, such
Person shall notify in writing the Person(s) from whom indemnification hereunder
is sought, which notice shall specify the nature of such Claim, the amount of
Damages sought in such Claim, if known, and the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. Failure to
so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it
may have under this Article 11 except to the extent that the indemnifying
party's ability to defend such Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to
give such notice. If the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder against any Damages that
may result from a Claim, the indemnifying party shall have the absolute right,
in its sole discretion and expense, to elect to defend, contest or otherwise
protect against any such Claim with legal counsel of its own selection so long
as the indemnifying party gives notice of its intention to so defend, contest or
otherwise protect against such Claim within five days of its receipt of notice
from the indemnified party regarding such Claim; provided that nothing herein
shall entitle the indemnifying party to control the defense or settlement of any
Claim to the extent the Claim if successful could materially interfere with the
business, operations, assets, conditions or prospects of the indemnified party.
The indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof through counsel of its
own choice and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and
all cross-claims or counterclaims it may have. The indemnified party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, agents and
employees), to at all times cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make their
relevant files and records available for inspection and copying by, or otherwise
render reasonable assistance to, the indemnifying party in its defense of any
action for which indemnity is sought under this Article 11. In the event the
indemnifying party fails to timely defend, contest or otherwise protect against
any Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to defend, contest, assert cross-claims or counterclaims or otherwise protect
against the same at the indemnifying party's expense. The indemnifying party may
not, without the consent of the indemnified party settle or compromise any Claim
if the settlement or compromise imposes equitable remedies or material
obligations on the indemnified party other than financial obligations for which
such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder.

                  11.6 Limitations on Indemnification; Additional
Indemnification Provisions.

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

                       (a) The indemnifying party shall have no obligation to
pay any claim for indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2(a) and (b) or
11.3(a) and (b) of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of all
such claims exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Threshold Indemnity
Amount"). In the event the aggregate amount of all such claims for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2(a) and (b) or 11.3(a) and (b) for
which an indemnified party seeks indemnification hereunder exceeds the Threshold
Indemnity Amount, the indemnifying party or parties shall be liable for the
entire indemnity amount with respect to such aggregated claims, including the
Threshold Indemnity Amount, up to a maximum amount equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000). The Threshold Indemnity Amount and the maximum amount of claim
for indemnification set forth herein shall not apply to any claims in the case
of fraud, an intentional misrepresentation or an intentional breach of any
warranty.

                       (b) The indemnification and equitable remedies provided
for in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties
and their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing herein is intended to waive or otherwise limit
any claims for Damages resulting or arising from fraudulent or willful
misconduct or to waive any equitable remedies to which a party may be entitled.

                       (c) The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or
other remedy based on any representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Schedules attached
hereto will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or
any notice or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with,
any such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect
the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

                       (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon
and after Closing, (i) the US Company shall cease to be a Seller Party and shall
cease to have any indemnification obligations as a Seller Party hereunder and
shall be treated as a Buyer Party, and the Seller Parties shall have no rights
of recourse, whether for contribution, by virtue of subrogation, section 2.2 of
that certain Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of KAR Products,
LLC, dated as of August 30, 2000, or otherwise, against the US Company for any
payments such Seller Party make, or are obligated to make, under this Article 11
or any other section of this Agreement, and (ii) the Seller Parties and each of
their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns shall be deemed to have
remised, released and forever discharged the D&O Indemnitees of and from any and
all Damages which the Seller Parties and each of their respective Affiliates,
successors and assigns, or any of them, has or ever had, or hereafter can, shall
or may have, arising out of the actions or inactions of any such D&O Indemnitees
in their capacities as officers or directors of the US Company; provided,
however, that this Section

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

11.6(d)(ii) shall not apply to Damages that arise from the fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of any of the D&O Indemnitees.

                       (e) Subject to Section 11.6(d), upon making an indemnity
payment pursuant to this Agreement, the indemnifying party will, to the extent
of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party against
any third party in respect of the Damages to which the payment related. Without
limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, each such indemnified
party and indemnifying party will duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation
rights.

                       (f) The Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any matters to the extent of a Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.5 for such matter.


                       (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision
of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party or its Affiliate has
been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement or the Schedules attached hereto (including, without limitation, any
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.5), or any document executed
in connection with this Agreement or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event any
Damages related to a claim by a party are covered by insurance, such party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such
insurance and such party shall not be entitled to recovery from any other party
(and shall refund amounts received up to the amount of indemnification actually
received) with respect to such Damages to the extent of such recovery under such
insurance policy.

                       (h) Each party agrees to use reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages which form the basis of any claim for indemnification
hereunder.

                       (i) In the case any event shall have occurred which would
otherwise entitle either party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder,
no Damages shall be deemed to have been sustained by such party to the extent of
any actual Tax savings realized by such party with respect thereto (the "Tax
Benefit"). Where an indemnified party has Tax losses, deductions, credits or
other items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any Tax loses, deductions,
credits or other items result from Damages shall be deemed realized only after
the utilization of such Tax losses, deductions, credits or other items. Each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for
which it is entitled to indemnification from any other party under this
Agreement.

                       (j) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all
indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for
all tax purposes, and no party shall take any position inconsistent with such
characterization.

                  12.1. Press Releases and Announcements. No party will issue
any press release or announcement relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement prior to the Closing Date without the prior approval of the other
party; provided that any party may make any public disclosure it believes in
good faith is required in order to secure a Permit, consent or other third party
approval, by Law or the rules of any national securities exchange or any
automated inter-dealer quotation system on which the securities of either party
(or any Affiliate thereof) are listed or admitted for trading (in which case the
disclosing party will advise the other party at least one (1) Business Day prior
to making such disclosure).

                  12.2. Expenses. The Sellers or the Parents, with respect to
the Sellers, the Parents and the Companies, and the Buyers, with respect to the
Buyers, will bear all legal, accounting, investment banking and other expenses
incurred by the Sellers, the Parents and the Companies, or the Buyers,
respectively, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

                  12.3. Amendments; Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement
may be amended or waived only by a written agreement executed and delivered by
the Sellers and the Buyers (which amendments shall be binding on the Companies
and the Parents). No other course of dealing between the parties to this
Agreement or any delay in exercising any rights hereunder will operate as a
waiver of any rights of such parties.

                  12.4. Successors and Assigns. No party hereto may assign or
delegate any of such party's rights or obligations under or in connection with
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
provided that the Buyers may assign to an Affiliate or Affiliates thereof the
obligation to purchase the Interests or the Canadian Assets, in which event the
Buyers shall have joint and several liability with such Affiliates with respect
to such obligation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto will be binding upon and enforceable against the respective successors
and assigns of such party and will be enforceable by and will inure to the
benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of such party.

                  12.5. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to
the extent of such prohibition of invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of this Agreement.

                  12.6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain
the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same Agreement.

                  12.7. Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this
Agreement.

                  12.8. Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to
be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement
will be in writing and will be

                  12.9. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

permitted assigns; provided, however, that the D&O Indemnitees shall be third
party beneficiaries of the rights to indemnification and release set forth in
Section 7.5 and Section 11.6(d) hereof.

                  12.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the schedules hereto,
and the documents referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties and supersede any previous agreement between the
parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that in entering into this Agreement, and the documents
referred to in it, it does not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of
any statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether negligently or
innocently made) of any Person (whether party to this Agreement or not) other
than as expressly set out in this Agreement.

                  12.11. Construction. The language used in this Agreement will
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party. The
use of the word "including" in this Agreement means "including without
limitation" and is intended by the parties to be by way of example rather than
limitation.

                  12.12. Incorporation of Schedules. The Schedules identified in
this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

                  12.13. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
New York.

                  12.14. Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in the State of Connecticut in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each Party also
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and
waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other
party with respect thereto. Any party may make service on the other parties by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the parties to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 12.8
above. Nothing in this Section 12.14, however, shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or in equity.
Each party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law or in equity.

                  12.15. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY

                                      -74-
<PAGE>

HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED
IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.15.
