&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT, dated as of the 21st day of January, 2003
(this &#147;Agreement&#148;), by
and between The Chubb Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and John D. Finnegan (the
&#147;Executive&#148;).

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company
(the &#147;Board&#148;), has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders
to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control
(as defined herein). The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the
inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties
and risks created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to encourage
the Executive&#146;s full attention and dedication to the current Company and in the
event of any threatened or pending Change in Control, and to provide the
Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control
that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive
will be satisfied and that are competitive with those of other corporations.
Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the
Company to enter into this Agreement.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;1. Certain Definitions. </B>(a) &#147;Effective Date&#148; means the first
date during the Change in Control Period (as defined herein) on which a Change
in Control occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if a Change in Control occurs and if the Executive&#146;s employment with the
Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs,
and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of
employment (1)&nbsp;was at the request of a third party that has taken steps
reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (2)&nbsp;otherwise arose in
connection with or anticipation of a Change in Control, then &#147;Effective Date&#148;
means the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &#147;Change in Control Period&#148; means the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that, commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on
each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary
thereof, the &#147;Renewal Date&#148;), unless previously terminated, the Change in
Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate three years
from such Renewal Date, unless, at least 60&nbsp;days prior to the Renewal Date, the
Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change in Control Period
shall not be so extended.

Executive in its employ, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Effective Date (the &#147;Employment Period&#148;). The Employment
Period shall terminate upon the Executive&#146;s termination of employment for any
reason.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;3. Terms of Employment. </B>(a) <B>Position and Duties. </B>(1)&nbsp;During
the Employment Period, (A)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s position (including status, offices,
officer and board positions, titles and reporting relationships), authority,
duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate in all material
respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any
time during the 12-month period immediately preceding the Effective Date and
(B)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s services shall be performed at the office where the
Executive was employed immediately preceding the Effective Date or at any other
location less than 35 miles from such office.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation
and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to
devote reasonable attention and time during normal business hours to the
business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to discharge
the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the
Executive&#146;s reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and conscientiously
such responsibilities. During the Employment Period, it shall not be a
violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A)&nbsp;serve on corporate, civic
or charitable boards or committees, provided, that, the Executive shall not
serve on any corporate boards (other than as provided in this Agreement) prior
to December&nbsp;1, 2003, (B)&nbsp;deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or
teach at educational institutions and (C)&nbsp;manage personal investments, so long
as such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of the
Executive&#146;s responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with
this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that, to the extent that
any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective
Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities
similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not
thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive&#146;s
responsibilities to the Company.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <B>Compensation. </B>(1) <B>Base Salary. </B>During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall receive an annual base salary (the &#147;Annual Base Salary&#148;) at an
annual rate at least equal to 12 times the highest monthly base salary paid or
payable, including any base salary that has been earned but deferred, to the
Executive by the Company and the Affiliated Companies in respect of the
12-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Date
occurs. The Annual Base Salary shall be paid at such intervals as the Company
pays executive salaries generally. During the Employment Period, the Annual
Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually for increase (but not
decrease), beginning no more than 12&nbsp;months after the last salary increase
awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date. Any increase in the
Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to
the Executive under this Agreement. The Annual Base Salary shall not be
reduced after any such increase and the term &#147;Annual Base Salary&#148; shall refer
to the Annual Base Salary as so increased.

earned (and disregarding any amounts deferred either by the Company or by the
Executive) under the Company&#146;s Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, or any
comparable bonus under any predecessor or successor plan, for the last three
full fiscal years prior to the Effective Date (or for such lesser number of
full fiscal years prior to the Effective Date for which the Executive was
eligible to earn such a bonus, and annualized in the case of any bonus earned
for a partial fiscal year) (the &#147;Recent Annual Bonus&#148;). (If the Executive has
not been eligible to earn such a bonus for any period prior to the Effective
Date, the &#147;Recent Annual Bonus&#148; shall mean the Executive&#146;s target annual bonus
for the year in which the Effective Date occurs.) Each such Annual Bonus shall
be paid no later than the end of the third month of the fiscal year next
following the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded, unless the
Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) <B>Incentive, Savings and Retirement Plans. </B>During the Employment
Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all cash incentive
and equity incentive, plans, practices, policies, and programs applicable
generally to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies,
but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the
Executive with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to both regular
and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that such
distinction is applicable, but excluding for this purpose any such
opportunities set forth in Sections&nbsp;3(b)(iii), 3(b)(iv), 3(b)(v), 3(b)(vi),
3(b)(vii) and 3(b)(viii) of the Employment Agreement by and between the Company
and the Executive effective as of the 1st day of December, 2002 (the
&#147;Employment Agreement&#148;)), less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most
favorable of those provided by the Company and the Affiliated Companies for the
Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at
any time during the 12-month period immediately preceding the Effective Date
or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time
after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and the
Affiliated Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
event that the Executive has not received the benefits under Sections&nbsp;3(b)(iv)
and 3(b)(viii) of the Employment Agreement as of the Effective Date, the
Executive shall receive the benefits described therein at such time and on such
terms as are provided therein.

annual supplemental pension benefit from the Company equal to 6% of
the Executive&#146;s &#147;Final Average Compensation&#148; (as defined below) for
each full year (with fractional credit for partial years) that the
Executive serves as an employee of the Company, up to a maximum of
60% of the Executive&#146;s Final Average Compensation. This annual
benefit shall be reduced by (1)&nbsp;any amounts payable to the
Executive under the Pension Plan and the Pension Excess Plan or any
other additional, successor or replacement pension plan of the
Company, (2)&nbsp;any pension benefits payable to the Executive by the
entity that employed the Executive as of November&nbsp;3, 2002 or any of
its affiliates, and (3)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s primary Social Security

the discount (if any) for early commencement of payments, the
column in Table I of Section&nbsp;3.2 of the Pension Plan under the
heading &#147;At Least 25 Years&#148; shall be applied to the gross SERP
benefit prior to the application of any offsets. For purposes of
determining Pension SERP benefits payable in the form of a joint
and survivor annuity, the factors contained in Table A
(&#147;Subsidized&#148;) of the Pension Plan shall be used. &#147;Final Average
Compensation&#148; shall mean the annualized average of the Executive&#146;s
&#147;SERP Compensation&#148; (as hereinafter defined) during the
highest-paid five calendar years out of the last ten calendar years
of the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, or the final 60
months of the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company if higher.
&#147;SERP Compensation&#148; shall mean the sum of (x)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s
Annual Base Salary paid under Section&nbsp;3(b)(1), (y)&nbsp;Annual Bonus
paid under Section&nbsp;3(b)(2) and (z)&nbsp;profit-sharing payments made
under the Profit Sharing Plan, disregarding in each case any amount
deferred for any reason. The Pension SERP benefit shall be payable
in accordance with the payment option elected by the Executive, in
accordance with the election procedures set forth in the Pension
Excess Plan. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
the other terms and conditions of the Pension SERP shall be
governed by the terms of the Pension Excess Plan as if the benefits
under the Pension SERP were paid from the Pension Excess Plan.</FONT></TD>

incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the

times during the Change in Control Period and at all times after the Change in
Control Period, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment (as
defined below) would be subject to the Excise Tax (as defined below), then the
Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the &#147;Gross-Up
Payment&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes
(and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including,
without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any interest and
penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal
to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. The Company&#146;s obligation to make
Gross-Up Payments under this Section&nbsp;8 shall not be conditioned upon the
Executive&#146;s termination of employment.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;8(c), all determinations required
to be made under this Section&nbsp;8, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment
is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be
utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally
recognized certified public accounting firm selected by the Company and
approved by the Executive, with such approval not being unreasonably withheld
(the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of
the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such
earlier time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as
determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8, shall be paid by the Company to the
Executive within 5&nbsp;days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination.
Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and
the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section
4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting
Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been
made by the Company should have been made (the &#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with
the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section&nbsp;8(c) and the Executive thereafter is
required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed
in writing of such claim. The Executive shall apprise the Company of the
nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.
The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day

Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes
with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in
writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to
contest such claim, the Executive shall:
