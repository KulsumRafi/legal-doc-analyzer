        THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO MERGER AGREEMENT (this "Amendment No. 1"), dated
as of March 6, 2003, is being entered into by and among Cell Therapeutics, Inc.
a Washington corporation ("CTI"), PolaRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware

shareholders of PolaRx ("PolaRx Representative").

        WHEREAS, each of CTI and PolaRx are parties to that certain Merger
Agreement dated January 7, 2000 (the "Agreement");

        WHEREAS, Section 6.5 of the Agreement provides that the Agreement may be
amended at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of the parties thereto;

        WHEREAS, PolaRx Biopharmaceuticals Acquisition Corp. was created solely
for the purpose of effecting the merger and upon consummation of the merger
merged with and into PolaRx and therefore no longer exists as a separate entity;

        WHEREAS, each of CTI, PolaRx and the PolaRx Representative agree that
this Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement shall be considered in compliance with
Section 6.5 of the Agreement by virtue of the fact that PolaRx

Representative serves the interests of the former shareholders of PolaRx;

        WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend Section 1.4 of the Agreement,

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:
