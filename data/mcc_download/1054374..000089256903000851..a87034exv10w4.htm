appropriate for proper administration of the Discretionary Option Grant and
Stock Issuance Programs and to make such determinations under, and issue such
interpretations of, the provisions of those programs and any outstanding
options or stock issuances thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable.

under the Plan, then the number of shares of Common Stock available for
issuance under the Plan shall be reduced only by the net number of shares of
Common Stock issued to the holder of such option or stock issuance, and not by

Section&nbsp;III of Article&nbsp;Three, Section&nbsp;II of Article&nbsp;Five or Section&nbsp;III of

shall, immediately prior to the effective date of such Hostile Take-Over, vest
and become exercisable for all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject

fully-vested shares of Common Stock. The option shall remain so exercisable

thirty (30)-day period in which to surrender to the Corporation each
outstanding option granted him or her under the Salary Investment Option Grant
Program. The Optionee shall in return be entitled to a cash distribution from
the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i)&nbsp;the Take-Over Price of
the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to the surrendered option

the option to the Corporation. The Primary Committee shall, at the time the
option with such limited stock appreciation right is granted under the Salary
Investment Option Grant Program, pre-approve any subsequent exercise of that
right in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph&nbsp;C. Accordingly, no
further approval of the Primary Committee or the Board shall be required at the
time of the actual option surrender and cash distribution.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Each option which is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or

immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of
securities which would have been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of
such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such
Change in Control. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the exercise
price payable per share under each outstanding option, provided the aggregate
exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same. To the
extent the actual holders of the Corporation&#146;s outstanding Common Stock receive
cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in
Control transaction, the successor corporation may, in connection with the

Program, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair
market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common
Stock in such Change in Control transaction.

Each such stock issuance shall be evidenced by a Stock Issuance Agreement which

the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be fully and immediately vested upon
issuance or may vest in one or more installments over the Participant&#146;s period
of Service or upon attainment of specified performance objectives. The
elements of the vesting schedule applicable to any unvested shares of Common
Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program shall be determined by the Plan
Administrator and incorporated into the Stock Issuance Agreement. Shares of
Common Stock may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to
share right awards which entitle the recipients to receive those shares upon
the attainment of designated performance goals. Upon the attainment of such
performance goals, fully vested shares of Common Stock shall be issued in
satisfaction of those share right awards.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including
money paid other than as a regular cash dividend) which the Participant may
have the right to receive with respect to the Participant&#146;s unvested shares of
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the
outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation&#146;s receipt of
consideration shall be issued subject to (i)&nbsp;the same vesting requirements
applicable to the Participant&#146;s unvested shares of Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;such
escrow arrangements as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Participant shall have full shareholder rights with respect to any
shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance
Program, whether or not the Participant&#146;s interest in those shares is vested.
Accordingly, the Participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to
receive any regular cash dividends paid on such shares.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or
more unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program or
should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more
such unvested shares of Common Stock, then those shares shall be immediately
surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have
no further shareholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the
surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration
paid in cash or cash equivalent (including the Participant&#146;s purchase-money
indebtedness), the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the cash
consideration paid for the surrendered shares and shall cancel the unpaid
principal balance of any outstanding purchase-money note of the Participant
attributable to the surrendered shares.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and
cancellation of one or more unvested shares of Common Stock which would
otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant&#146;s Service or the
non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those shares. Such
waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant&#146;s interest in
the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver may be
effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant&#146;s cessation of
Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance
objectives.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Outstanding share right awards under the Stock Issuance Program shall
automatically terminate, and no shares of Common Stock shall actually be issued
in satisfaction of those awards, if the performance goals established for such
awards are not attained. The Plan Administrator, however, shall have the
discretionary authority to issue shares of Common Stock under one or more
outstanding share right awards as to which the designated performance goals
have not been attained.

The Plan became effective immediately on the Plan Effective Date.
However, the Salary Investment Option Grant Program and the Director Fee Option
Grant Program shall not be implemented until such time as the Primary Committee
may deem appropriate. Options may be granted under the Discretionary Option
Grant at any time on or after the Plan Effective Date, and the initial option
grants under the Automatic Option Grant Program shall also be made on the Plan
Effective Date to any non-employee Board members eligible for such grants at
that time. However, no options granted under the Plan may be exercised, and no
shares shall be issued under the Plan, until the Plan is approved by the
Corporation&#146;s shareholders. If such shareholder approval is not obtained
within twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the Plan Effective Date, then all options
previously granted under this Plan shall terminate and cease to be outstanding,
and no further options shall be granted and no shares shall be issued under the
Plan.

Predecessor Plans after the Section&nbsp;12 Registration Date. All options
outstanding under the Predecessor Plans on the Section&nbsp;12 Registration Date
shall be incorporated into the Plan at that time and shall be treated as
outstanding options under the Plan. However, each outstanding option so
incorporated shall continue to be governed solely by the terms of the documents
evidencing such option, and no provision of the Plan shall be deemed to affect
or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of such
incorporated options with respect to their acquisition of shares of Common
Stock.

2000 Restatement&#148;) to increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved
for issuance under the Plan by an additional 15,000,000 shares, and such
increase was approved by the shareholders at the 2000 Annual Shareholders
Meeting.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. The Plan was amended by the Board on April&nbsp;21, 2000 (the &#147;April 2000
Restatement&#148;) to revise the provisions of the Automatic Option Grant Program to
reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the automatic option
grant made to each newly elected or appointed non-employee Board member from

Restatement&#148;) to increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance under the Plan by an additional 25,000,000 shares and such increase
was approved by the shareholders at the 2001 Annual Shareholders Meeting.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. The Plan was amended by the Board on March&nbsp;7, 2002 in order to (i)
increase the number of shares of Common Stock for which each individual who is
to continue to serve as an Eligible Director shall receive an annual automatic
option grant under such program from 12,000 shares of Common Stock to 15,000
shares of Common Stock and eliminate the requirement that the non-employee
Board member must complete at least 6&nbsp;months of service in such capacity before
he or she would be eligible to receive the first such annual option grant, (ii)
increase the number of shares of Common Stock for which a newly elected or
appointed Eligible Director is to receive as his or her initial annual
automatic option grant under such program from 80,000 shares of Common Stock to
100,000 shares of Common Stock and (iii)&nbsp;provide for additional 100,000-share
option grants to be made to each Eligible Director periodically upon his or her
completion of each four (4)-year period of continued service as an Eligible
Director. The amendment was approved by the shareholders at the 2002 Annual
Meeting.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. The Plan was amended by the Board on March&nbsp;21, 2003 (the &#147;March 2003
Restatement&#148;) to (a)&nbsp;expand the types of acceptable consideration for which
shares may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program to include all items of
valid consideration permissible under the California General Corporate Law and
(b)&nbsp;increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under
the Plan by an additional 13,000,000 shares. No option grants made on the basis
of the 13,000,000-share increase authorized by the March 2003 Restatement shall
become exercisable in whole or in part unless and until the March 2003
Restatement is approved by the shareholders at the 2003 Annual Shareholders
Meeting. Should such shareholder approval not be obtained, then each option
grant made pursuant to the 13,000,000-share increase authorized by the March
2003 Restatement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, and no further
option grants shall be made on the basis of that share increase. However, the
provisions of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to that 13,000,000-share
increase shall remain in effect, and option grants and direct stock issuances
may continue to be made pursuant to those provisions of the Plan.
