(the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries and other related entities (each of which is referred to herein as a &#147;Subsidiary&#148;) by encouraging their ownership of the Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company (the
&#147;Stock&#148;) and (ii) to aid the Company in retaining such key employees, directors, consultants and other individuals upon whose efforts the Company&#146;s success and future growth depends, and attracting other such employees, directors,
consultants and other individuals.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>2.</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><i><b><font

time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;) and shall consist of not fewer than two of its members. In the event that no such Committee exists or is appointed, then the powers to be exercised by the Committee
hereunder shall be exercised by the Board of Directors.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>For purposes of administration, the Committee, subject to the terms of the Plan, shall have plenary

be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including those granted options hereunder (&#147;Optionees&#148;) and their legal representatives and beneficiaries.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;).</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Committee shall hold its meetings at such times and places as it

if it had been made by a majority vote at a meeting duly called and held. The Committee may appoint a secretary (who need not be a member of the Committee). No member of the Committee shall be liable for any act or omission with respect to his
service on the Committee, if he acts in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font

employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, including officers or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary, and to consultants and other individuals providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary. On and after June 5, 2000, options may no
longer be granted under this Plan to &#147;non-employee directors&#148; within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Act. Options may be granted to eligible persons whether or not they hold or have held options previously granted under the Plan or
otherwise granted or assumed by the Company; provided, however, that the maximum number of shares of Stock with respect to which options may be granted under the Plan to any person during any calendar year shall be 500,000 shares of Stock (subject
to adjustment in the same manner as provided in Section 5(f) with respect to shares of Stock subject to options then outstanding). In selecting recipients for options, the Committee may take into consideration any factors it may deem relevant,
including its estimate of the individual&#146;s present and potential contributions to the success of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Service as a director, officer or consultant of or to the Company or any Subsidiary shall be considered
employment for purposes of the Plan (and the period of such service shall be considered the period of employment for purposes of Section 5(d) of the Plan); provided, however, that incentive stock options may be granted under the Plan only to an
individual who is an &#147;employee&#148; (as such term is used in Section 422 of the Code) of the Company or a Subsidiary which constitutes a &#147;subsidiary corporation&#148; within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code.</font></p> <p style='

of grant of the option. In the case of any option intended to be an incentive stock option granted to an individual owning (directly or by attribution as provided in Section 424(d) of the Code), on the date of grant, stock possessing more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary (which individual shall hereinafter be referred to as a &#147;10% Stockholder&#148;), the price at which each share of Stock may be purchased upon exercise
of the option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value per share of Stock on the date of grant of the option. The date of the grant of an option shall be the date specified by the Committee in its grant of the option. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 5(f) of this Plan, the option price of an outstanding option under this Plan may not be repriced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an option may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth above if such option is
granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font

Optionee to exercise an option, the Company may make loans to the Optionee or guarantee loans made by third parties to the Optionee, on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may authorize. The purchase price may be paid in (i) cash (or
a certified or bank cashier&#146;s check payable to the order of the Company); (ii) shares of Stock owned by the Optionee, (iii) nonstatutory options granted under the Plan and held by the Optionee (provided, however, that the purchase price of
Stock acquired under an incentive stock option may not be paid in options); or (iv) any combination of the foregoing methods. Shares of Stock tendered in payment on the exercise of an option shall be valued at their fair market value determined as
described in Section 5(a) above, provided that the date of determination shall be the date of exercise. The fair market value of options tendered in payment upon exercise of other options shall be the fair market value of the underlying Stock,
determined as aforesaid, less the total exercise price of the options. In addition, at the request of the Optionee, and subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Company may (but shall not be required to) cooperate in a &#147;cashless
exercise&#148; of an option (i.e., the assignment to the Company of the proceeds from a sale of Stock acquired upon exercise of the option or from the proceeds of a loan from a brokerage firm). If the Optionee so requests, shares of Stock purchased
upon exercise of an option may be issued in the name of the Optionee or another person. An Optionee shall have none of the rights of a stockholder until the shares of Stock are issued to him.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;
