payable under the Plan shall become payable only after the Participant, Disabled Participant or a Spouse, as the case may be, has made an application with the Committee for such benefit on a form
prepared by or on behalf of the Committee for this purpose. In the event any benefit becomes payable under this Plan and no application therefor has been filed by any such person within two

reasonable efforts to locate the person legally entitled to receive such benefit within two (2)&nbsp;years of the date such benefit first becomes payable under the Plan, then such benefit also shall
be forfeited. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to any Participant who is designated by the Committee as entitled to the benefits described in this Article&nbsp;9, the Company shall provide
continuation of health care, dental and pharmacy coverage for the Participant and his or her dependants on terms and conditions substantially similar to those provided to executive employees of the
Company from time to time, which coverage shall terminate as of the date of such Participant's death. The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate its health care coverage, and each
Participant entitled to benefits under this Article&nbsp;9 shall be affected by any such amendment or termination in substantially the same fashion as executive employees of the Company are so
affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Plan shall be interpreted to require the Company to provide to any Participant tax treatment relating to health care coverage that is
substantially similar to the tax treatment provided by the Company to its executive employees. </FONT></P>
