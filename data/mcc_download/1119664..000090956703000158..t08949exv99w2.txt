                  in Euros, CDN$, or Sterling, or in such other currencies as
                  EDC may agree to support (or any combination thereof),

                  guarantee type documents issued to financial institutions in
                  connection with the purchase of accounts receivable or
                  securitizations by such financial institutions or through the

                  facility described in this Section 2.1(b)(i) is hereinafter
                  referred to as the "RECEIVABLES BONDING FACILITY". Receivables
                  supported under the Receivables Bonding Facility shall be
                  payable no later than the Termination Date. The Receivables
                  Bonding Facility shall automatically terminate at the close of
                  business on the day immediately preceding the Termination
                  Date. EDC will approve or decline coverage for transactions
                  requested by the Principal on a case-by-case basis.

         (ii)     General Support Facility. EDC agrees, on the terms and
                  conditions set forth in the Agreement and subject to the

                  EDC may agree to support (or any combination thereof)
                  (including, for the purpose of calculating the amount of such
                  Support, the amount of support outstanding from time to time
                  under the EDC Agreements described under the heading "General
                  Support Facility" in the EDC Agreement List). Such Support
                  shall be provided on a non-revolving basis through: (i) the
                  provision of guarantee bonds or guarantee type documents
                  issued to financial institutions in connection with the
                  purchase of accounts receivable or securitizations by such
                  financial institutions; (ii) the purchase of accounts
                  receivable or securitizations by EDC, or (iii) the provision
                  of guarantee bonds or guarantee type documents in


                                       14

                  request of the Principal, of Instruments in support of

                  mature no later than the Termination Date. The facility
                  described in this Section 2.1(b)(ii) is hereinafter referred

                  Facility shall automatically terminate at the close of
                  business on the day immediately preceding the Termination
                  Date. The General Support Facility shall be non-revolving and,
                  for greater certainty, EDC will approve or decline coverage
                  for transactions requested by the Principal on a case-by-case
                  basis.

         (iii)    Discretion. For greater certainty, the Principal hereby
                  acknowledges that EDC shall be under no obligation at any time
                  to permit any use to be made of the Receivables Bonding
                  Facility or the General Support Facility, notwithstanding that
                  the conditions precedent to the provision of any such Support
                  shall all have been satisfied, it being further acknowledged
                  and agreed by the Principal that the provision of such
                  Facilities is at the total and unfettered discretion of EDC.

nature of the Receivables Bonding Facility or the General Support Facility, EDC
may terminate or suspend the Receivables Bonding Facility or General Support
Facility at any time and at its sole discretion, upon written notice to the
Principal, and EDC may terminate or suspend the Small Bonds Facility at any time
after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, provided that
the termination or suspension of a Facility shall not affect any Support as is
then outstanding thereunder, but no further Support will be provided under such
Facility following a termination or during a suspension thereof.

2.3      FEES. The Principal shall pay to EDC, within 30 days of the Closing
Date, the up front fee separately agreed by the Principal and EDC in writing. In

effect that a fee is payable to EDC by a third party under any of the EDC
Agreements that the Principal may, pursuant to an agreement with such third
party or with EDC, be liable for the payment of such fee.

all Support given in connection with the EDC Agreements) are part of the "EDC

                                    ARTICLE 4
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

4.1      The Principal represents and warrants that:

    (a)  CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER. Each Credit Party is a corporation duly
         incorporated and validly existing (and, in the case of the Principal
         and NNI, in compliance or good standing, as applicable) under the laws
         of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has all corporate powers
         and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
         required to carry on its business as now conducted, the absence of
         which would have a material adverse effect on the ability of such
         Credit Party to perform its obligations under the Facility Documents.

    (b)  CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The
         execution, delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the
         Facility Documents to which it is a party (i) are within such Credit
         Party's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
         corporate action, (ii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing
         with,


                                       19

<PAGE>

         any governmental body, agency or official and (iii) do not contravene
         any provision of applicable law or regulation or any provision of the
         certificate of incorporation or by-laws of such Credit Party or any
         contractual restriction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
         such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of
         clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such action, filing or contravention
         which would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of such
         Credit Party to perform its obligations under the Facility Documents.

    (c)  BINDING EFFECT. Each of the Facility Documents constitutes or, when
         executed, will constitute valid and binding agreements of the Credit
         Parties which are parties to them, in each case enforceable in
         accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by
         bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
         generally, by general principles of equity (it being understood that
         the enforceability thereof in Canada may be limited by the Currency Act
         (Canada), which precludes Canadian courts from awarding a judgment for
         an amount expressed in a currency other than Canadian dollars, and to
         the extent that any requirement to pay interest at a greater rate after
         than before default may not be enforceable in Canada if the same is
         construed by a Canadian court to constitute a penalty).

    (d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         (i)      Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or any of the
                  Principal's Exchange Act filings filed after December 31,
                  2001, the (A) consolidated balance sheet of the Principal and
                  its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and the
                  related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
                  retained earnings for the fiscal year then ended, reported on
                  by Deloitte & Touche LLP and set forth in the Principal's 2001
                  Form 10-K, and (B) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
                  the Principal and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of
                  September 30, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of
                  operations, cash flows and retained earnings for the three
                  quarters then ended, and set forth in the Principal's 2002 Q3
                  Form 10-Q, fairly present, in conformity with GAAP, the
                  consolidated financial position of the Principal and its
                  Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
                  consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such
                  fiscal year or such portion of such fiscal year, as
                  applicable, subject, in the case of the statements as of and
                  for the period ended September 30, 2002, to normal year-end
                  adjustments.

         (ii)     Since December 31, 2001, except as set forth in the Disclosure
                  Schedule or any of the Principal's Exchange Act filings filed
                  after December 31, 2001, there has been no material adverse
                  change in


                                       20

<PAGE>

                  the business, financial position or results of operations of
                  the Principal and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
                  whole.

    (e)  LITIGATION. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or
         to the knowledge of the Principal threatened against or affecting, the
         Principal or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or
         any governmental body, agency or official in which there is a
         reasonable possibility of an adverse decision (i) which could have a
         material adverse effect on the ability of a Credit Party to perform its
         obligations under the Facility Documents to which it is party, except
         as disclosed in any of the Principal's Exchange Act filings, or (ii)
         which in any manner draws into question the validity of any of the
         Facility Documents.

    (f)  TAXES. Each of the Principal and its Consolidated Subsidiaries has
         timely filed or caused to be filed all tax returns and reports required
         to have been filed by it and has paid or caused to be paid all taxes
         required to have been paid by it, except (i) any taxes that are being
         contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the
         relevant obligor has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii)
         to the extent that failures to do so, in the aggregate, could not
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

    (g)  SOLVENCY.

         (i)      As of the date hereof, and as of the first day of each
                  Collateral Period, with respect to each party named below and
                  based on the most recent monthly financial information
                  available to the Principal, (A) the fair value of the assets
                  of each Credit Party organized under the laws of a
                  jurisdiction within the United States (a "U.S. Credit Party"),
                  at a fair valuation viewing such Person as a going concern,
                  will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
                  contingent or otherwise; (B) the present fair saleable value
                  of the property of each U.S. Credit Party will exceed the
                  amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
                  its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
                  otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute
                  and matured; (C) each U.S. Credit Party will be able to pay
                  its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
                  otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
                  matured; and (D) no U.S. Credit Party will have unreasonably
                  small capital with which to conduct the business in which it
                  is engaged as such business is now conducted and proposed to
                  be conducted after each date this representation is made.

         (ii)     As of the date hereof, and the first day of each Collateral
                  Period, with respect to any Credit Party that is subject to
                  the insolvency laws of Canada and based on the most recent
                  monthly financial


                                       21

<PAGE>

                  information available to the Principal, (A) the aggregate
                  property of such Person at fair valuation, or if disposed of
                  at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, is sufficient
                  to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing
                  due; (B) the property of such Person is, at a fair valuation,
                  greater than the total amount of liabilities, including
                  contingent liabilities, of such Person; (C) such Person has
                  not ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary
                  course of business as they generally become due; and (D) such
                  Person is not for any reason unable to meet its obligations as
                  they generally become due.

    (h)  SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

         (i)      Each of the Principal, each Lien Grantor and each Subsidiary
                  Guarantor has complied with all of its respective obligations
                  under each of the Security Documents (other than the Foreign
                  Security Documents except the Specified Foreign Subsidiary
                  Guarantees) to which it is a party;

         (ii)     the representations and warranties set forth in the Security
                  Agreements and the Specified Foreign Subsidiary Guarantees
                  required to be made on each Drawdown Date (as defined in the
                  Security Agreements) by each of the Principal, each Lien
                  Grantor and each Subsidiary Guarantor party thereto are true
                  and correct; and

         (iii)    upon the designation by the Principal of any indemnity,
                  reimbursement or guarantee obligation owing by a Lien Grantor
                  to EDC as a Secured Obligation or Guaranteed Obligation (other
                  than with respect to a Guaranteed Obligation, such indemnity,
                  reimbursement or guarantee obligation of the Principal), or
                  both, as applicable, in accordance with section 21(c)(iii) of
                  the Canadian Security Agreement or section 22(c)(iii) of the
                  U.S. Security Agreement, EDC will be a Secured Party, provided
                  that EDC is the holder of such Secured Obligation or
                  Guaranteed Obligation.

    (i)  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Principal is not aware of any failure on its
         part or on the part of any of the other Credit Parties to comply in all
         material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws other than
         where failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

    (j)  COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Credit Party is in compliance with all
         applicable laws, judgments, orders, rulings and guidelines and
         decisions having force of law, in each case other than (except in the
         case of laws relating to corruption and bribery) where failure to
         comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect.

    (k)  WAIVER OF SET-OFF RIGHTS. The Principal maintains only deposit accounts
         in the United States separate from those of NNI and its Subsidiaries;
         such accounts are in its name only and such accounts are not
         consolidated with the accounts of any other Person. The primary account
         (other than collection and "lock-box" accounts maintained for the
         purpose of clearing payments and receipts prior to sweeping out the
         funds represented thereby and accounts related to the sale or
         securitization of accounts receivable) maintained in the United States
         by the Material Subsidiaries organized under the laws of any state in
         the United States for the consolidation of their deposit accounts in
         the United States is account number 30463444 (the "Citibank Account")
         at Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") in the name of NNI. Such account is
         subject to the Deposit Account Control Agreement dated as of September
         12, 2002 (the "Citibank Deposit Account Control Agreement") among NNI,
         the Collateral Agent and Citibank, a true and complete copy of which
         has been delivered to EDC.

    (l)  INSURANCE. The certificate of insurance held by or for the benefit of
         the Principal and its Material Subsidiaries delivered to EDC on January
         23, 2003 is accurate and complete in all material respects and such
         insurance, subject to reduction in the amounts thereof in November,
         2002 to reflect the then current business environment and consistent
         with industry practice, is consistent with the insurance that was in
         place on the date of execution and delivery of the credit agreements
         entered into by the Principal, NNI and other Material Subsidiaries with
         banks for whom the Collateral Agent acted as administrative agent in
         December, 2001 and collateral agent in April, 2002.

    (m)  PERFECTION CERTIFICATES. The information contained in each of the
         Perfection Certificates delivered by the Lien Grantors pursuant to
         Section 4(i) of the Canadian Security Agreement and Section 3(i) of the
         US Security Agreement in January, 2002, true copies of which have been
         delivered to EDC, is correct and complete as of the respective dates
         thereof and has not been amended or supplemented as at the date hereof.

4.2      BRING-DOWN. As long as any Support is outstanding under the Small Bonds
Facility, the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (other
than Section 4.1(l)) shall be deemed to have been made again as at the last day
of each calendar month regardless of when they are expressed to be made.


                                    ARTICLE 5
                                    COVENANTS

         and retained earnings, in comparative form the figures for the
         corresponding quarter and the corresponding portion of the Principal's
         previous fiscal year;

    (c)  simultaneously with the delivery of each set of financial statements

         to the best of such Person's knowledge, after having conducted a
         reasonable investigation, any Default exists on the date of such
         certificate and, if any Default then exists, setting forth reasonable
         details thereof and (ii) setting forth reasonably detailed information
         concerning any assets excluded from the Collateral pursuant to section
         31(c) of the US Security Agreement or Section 32(c) of the Canadian

         been delivered pursuant to this Section 5.1(c), since the date of the
         last certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 5.1(c);

    (d)  contemporaneously with the delivery of any notice to the Collateral

         Agreement or section 21 of the Canadian Security Agreement, a copy of
         such notice; and

    (e)  from time to time such additional information regarding the financial
         position or business of the Principal and its Subsidiaries as EDC may
         reasonably request to enable EDC to protect its rights under the
         Facility Documents; provided that neither the Principal nor NNI shall
         be under any


                                       24

<PAGE>

         obligation to supply any information the supply of which would be
         contrary to any confidentiality obligation binding on the Principal or
         NNI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or which, in the
         Principal's opinion, is unpublished price sensitive information or the
         supply of which would, in the Principal's opinion, be contrary to any
         applicable securities laws or the regulations of any relevant stock
         exchange.

5.2      NOTICE OF MATERIAL EVENTS. As soon as practicable, and in any event
within the earlier of five Domestic Business Days and seven days, after an
Executive Officer acquires knowledge thereof, the Principal will furnish to EDC
prompt written notice of the following:

    (a)  the occurrence of any Default and the action that the Principal
         proposes to take, or has taken, to cure such Default;

    (b)  the filing or commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by or
         before any arbitrator or governmental authority against or affecting
         the Principal or any Subsidiary that has a reasonable possibility of
         being adversely determined and, if adversely determined, could
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

    (c)  any change in any Debt Rating with negative implications; and

    (d)  the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice delivered under this Section (other than clause (c) above) shall be
accompanied by a statement of an Executive Officer setting forth the details of
the event or development requiring such notice and any action taken or proposed
to be taken with respect thereto.

5.3      INFORMATION REGARDING COLLATERAL.

    (a)  During a Collateral Period and any other period when the Debt Rating is
         not BBB (stable outlook) or higher by S&P and Baa2 (stable outlook) or
         higher by Moody's (a "Low Investment Grade Period"), the Principal will
         furnish to the Collateral Agent and EDC prompt written notice of any
         change in (i) any Credit Party's corporate name or any trade name used
         to identify it in the conduct of its business or any Credit Party's
         chief executive office, its principal place of business, or any office
         or facility at which Collateral owned by it is located (including the
         establishment of any such new office or facility), (ii) any Credit
         Party's identity or corporate structure (including, without limitation,
         its jurisdiction of organization) or (iii) any Credit Party's U.S.
         Federal Taxpayer Identification Number.

    (b)  Each year during a Collateral Period or a Low Investment Grade Period,
         at the time annual financial statements with respect to the preceding
         fiscal year are delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(a), the Principal
         will deliver to


                                       25

<PAGE>

         the Collateral Agent and EDC a certificate of an Executive Officer
         setting forth the information required pursuant to Section A of the
         Perfection Certificate or confirming that there has been no change in
         such information since January 15, 2002 (the date of delivery of the
         latest Perfection Certificate prior to the date hereof) or the date of
         the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this subsection.

5.4      EXISTENCE; CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. The Principal will, and will cause its
Material Subsidiaries to, preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its
legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges, franchises,
patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names necessary or desirable to the
normal conduct of the business of the Principal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any amalgamation, merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 5.10.

5.5      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES; PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. The Principal will,
and will cause its Material Subsidiaries to, maintain all property material to
the conduct of the business of the Principal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The
Principal will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations,
including tax obligations, that, if not paid, could result in a Material Adverse
Effect, before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a)
the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, (b) the Principal, NNI or such Subsidiary has set aside on its
books adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, and (c)
the failure to make payment pending such contest could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.6      INSURANCE.

    (a)  The Principal will, and will cause each of its Material Subsidiaries
         to, maintain, with reputable insurance carriers, insurance in such
         amounts and against such risks as are customarily maintained by
         companies engaged in the same or similar business, owning similar
         properties, and located in the same general areas in which the
         Principal or such Material Subsidiary, as the case may be, operates,
         provided that insurance coverage against terrorist acts shall be
         required only so long as such coverage is available on commercially
         reasonable terms. It is understood that the insurance policies
         maintained by the Principal and its Material Subsidiaries on the date
         hereof shall be deemed adequate for purposes of this subsection.

    (b)  In addition, during the Collateral Period, the Principal shall mail
         notice to EDC of any cancellation, material reduction in amount or
         material change in any casualty insurance covering the Collateral at
         least 20 days prior to such cancellation, reduction or change, and any
         such casualty insurance shall (x) name the Collateral Agent as insured
         party or loss payee with respect to its interest, as applicable
         (provided that so long as no Specified Event of Default has occurred
         and is continuing the Collateral Agent shall


                                       26

<PAGE>

         make such proceeds available to the Principal and the Principal shall
         use such proceeds for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of the
         damaged property provided that the Principal, acting reasonably,
         determines it is commercially reasonable to effect such repair,
         reconstruction or replacement), (y) if reasonably requested by the
         Collateral Agent or EDC, include a breach of warranty clause and (z) be
         reasonably satisfactory in all other respects to the Collateral Agent
         and EDC.

5.7      PROPER RECORDS; RIGHTS TO INSPECT. The Principal will, and will cause
NNI to, record, summarize and report all financial information in accordance
with GAAP, which information will include information on such Person's
Subsidiaries prepared on a consolidated basis. Each Credit Party will permit any
representatives designated by EDC, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit and
inspect its properties (including, without limitation, the Collateral during a
Collateral Period), to examine and make extracts from its books and records, and
to discuss its affairs, finances and condition and the Collateral with any
officers designated for such purpose by an Executive Officer and (after
reasonable prior notice to the Principal and subject to the right of such
designated officers to be present during such discussions) independent
accountants, all at such reasonable times during normal business hours and as
often as reasonably requested; provided that unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, EDC may take such actions only once during each
fiscal quarter of the Principal.

5.8      DEBT. The Principal will not, and will not permit any Material
Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Debt constituting
Secured Obligations in excess of the amount permitted under the Security
Agreements.

5.9      LIENS. The Principal will not, and will not permit any Material
Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist any Lien on any Collateral now owned or
hereafter acquired by it, or, except as permitted by the Security Agreements,
assign or sell any income or revenues (including accounts receivable) or rights
in respect of any thereof, except Permitted Liens.

5.10     FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES.

    (a)  The Principal will not, and will not permit any Material Subsidiary to,
         amalgamate, merge or consolidate with or into any other Person, or
         liquidate or dissolve, or permit any other Person to amalgamate, merge
         or consolidate with or into it, provided that, if at the time thereof
         and immediately after giving effect thereto no Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, (i) any Subsidiary may amalgamate, merge or
         consolidate with or into the Principal in a transaction in which the
         Principal (which shall include the successor of any such amalgamation
         of the Principal and any Subsidiary) is the surviving or resulting
         corporation, (ii) the Principal may amalgamate with NNC, (iii) any
         Subsidiary may amalgamate, merge or consolidate with or into any
         Subsidiary in a transaction in which the surviving or resulting entity
         is a Subsidiary and, if any party to such


                                       27

<PAGE>

         transaction is a party to a Security Document as a Subsidiary
         Guarantor, a Lien Grantor or both, then if such surviving or resulting
         entity shall, as a matter of law, or pursuant to confirmation
         agreements or other instruments acceptable to EDC, acting reasonably,
         also be a Subsidiary Guarantor, Lien Grantor or both, as applicable,
         and (iv) any Subsidiary (except NNI) may liquidate or dissolve if the
         Principal determines in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution
         is in the best interests of the Principal and would not materially and
         adversely affect the ability of the Principal to perform its
         obligations under this Agreement. It is understood that an asset sale
         permitted by Section 5.11 which is effected through an amalgamation,
         merger or consolidation shall not contravene this Section 5.10.

    (b)  The Principal will not, and will not permit any Material Subsidiary to,
         engage to any material extent in any business except businesses of the
         types conducted by the Principal and its Subsidiaries on the date of
         this Agreement and businesses reasonably related thereto.

5.11     SALES. If the aggregate book value of any assets of the Principal
and/or any Material Subsidiary which are sold, leased, transferred, subjected to
put/call arrangements or otherwise disposed of (other than pursuant to any of
the transactions described in subsections (a) to (g) hereof) during a fiscal
year of the Principal, exceeds 40% of the book value of Consolidated Tangible
Assets, each such book value to be calculated by reference to the most recently
available audited consolidated financial statements of the Principal, then the
Principal shall (i) cause the Net Cash Proceeds arising from any such sales,
leases, transfers, put/call arrangements or other dispositions in excess of such
40% threshhold to be used, within 10 days after receipt of such amounts, to
provide to EDC or third parties designated by EDC to whom EDC has liability
under any EDC Agreements, a first priority security interest in cash collateral
(including deposits of cash) equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds and
(ii) obtain from such third parties, to the extent that cash collateral has been
provided to such third parties, releases of EDC from its obligations under such
EDC Agreements; such cash collateral security arrangements and any releases
shall be in form and substance satisfactory to EDC and such third parties;
provided that if any such third party refuses to accept such cash collateral or
to so release EDC, then such cash collateral, in form and substance satisfactory
to EDC, shall be provided to, and accepted by, EDC, except that no such cash
collateral and no such releases shall be required in respect of the following
transactions:

    (a)  sales of inventory, used or surplus equipment or Permitted Investments
         or sales, assignments or licenses (or abandonments) of intellectual
         property or technology, all in the ordinary course of business;

    (b)  sales, transfers and other dispositions to the Principal or a
         Subsidiary; provided that any such sales, transfers or dispositions to
         a Subsidiary that is not a Material Subsidiary shall be at prices not
         less favourable than could be obtained on an arm's-length basis from
         unrelated third parties, it being understood that prices determined in
         accordance with the Principal's


                                       28

<PAGE>

         policies and relevant tax or regulatory requirements as customarily
         applied by the Principal will be deemed to be on arm's-length basis;

    (c)  sales, transfers and other dispositions under consideration on the
         Closing Date or on the date hereof and the possibility of which was
         disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule;

    (d)  sale and leaseback transactions and sales of accounts receivable or
         rights in respect thereof, not otherwise prohibited under any of the
         Facility Documents;

    (e)  (i) easements or other similar covenant agreements that relate to
         and/or benefit the operation of the property of the Principal or any
         Subsidiary, do not materially or adversely affect the use and operation
         of the same and are granted in the ordinary course of business within
         reasonable commercial standards and (ii) leases or subleases pursuant
         to arm's-length transactions;

    (f)  sales, transfers or other dispositions of assets or property (including
         Debt, Equity Interests or rights thereto) acquired or made pursuant to
         vendor financings permitted under the Security Documents; or

    (g)  other individual sales, transfers, leases or dispositions that yield
         Net Cash Proceeds less than or equal to US$5,000,000 (including
         dispositions for which no Net Cash Proceeds are received);

provided that all sales, transfers, put/call arrangements, leases and other
dispositions contemplated by this Section (except those referenced in clause (b)
above) shall be made for fair value as determined by the Principal or as
necessary to comply with relevant tax or regulatory requirements as customarily
applied by the Principal and provided further that all proceeds arising
therefrom, after deduction of reasonable expenses associated therewith, after
and during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default, shall be deposited
and maintained in accounts of the Principal or such Material Subsidiary, as
applicable, subject to a perfected security interest in favour of the Collateral
Agent and EDC pursuant to the Security Documents. The Principal shall promptly
take or cause to be taken all such actions as are necessary to ensure that such
perfection is achieved. EDC acknowledges and agrees that any action, or any
request or demand by it to the Collateral Agent to take any action, to exercise
rights or remedies under the Security Documents to satisfy any obligations owed
by the Principal in respect of any Support in respect of which cash collateral
has been provided in accordance with this Section 5.11, will be taken, requested
or demanded, as applicable, only to the extent that such cash collateral does
not satisfy the amount of such obligations.

5.12     RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. The Principal will not, and will not permit any
Material Subsidiary to, declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or
indirectly, any prepayment or early retirement of all or any part of (i) any New
Secured Obligations, or any provisions of the Person to whom such New Secured
Obligations are owed, in


                                       29

<PAGE>

respect thereof unless, contemporaneously therewith, the Principal or such
Material Subsidiary makes a proportionate payment on any outstanding
non-contingent obligations then owing to EDC and provides cash collateral by way
of the grant of a first priority perfected security interest in cash (including
deposits of cash) on a proportionate basis for the outstanding contingent
obligations under the Facilities, on terms and conditions satisfactory to EDC
acting reasonably (it being understood that any such cash to be applied for the
benefit of EDC under this Section 5.12 shall be applied, first, to outstanding
non-contingent obligations and second, to outstanding contingent obligations) or
(ii) any Secured Obligation or New Secured Obligation if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. EDC acknowledges and agrees that any action, or any
request or demand by it to the Collateral Agent to take any action, to exercise
rights or remedies under the Security Documents to satisfy any obligations owed
by the Principal in respect of any Support in respect of which cash collateral
has been provided in accordance with this Section 5.12, will be taken, requested
or demanded, as applicable, only to the extent that such cash collateral does
not satisfy the amount of such obligations.

5.13     ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. If any additional Subsidiary is formed or
acquired after the date hereof, the Principal will, within five Domestic
Business Days after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired, notify EDC thereof
and will comply with, and cause each such additional Subsidiary to comply with,
the provisions of section 31 and, if applicable, section 5(h) of the Canadian
Security Agreement or section 30 of the U.S. Security Agreement, as applicable.

5.14     HEDGING. The Principal will not, and will not permit any Material
Subsidiary to, secure any obligations with respect to any Hedging Agreements if,
as a result thereof, the aggregate of (i) any such obligations which are
designated as Designated Hedging Agreements (as defined in the Security
Agreements) and (ii) the amount of any cash, cash equivalents and Permitted
Investments on which Liens are granted as security for any such obligations
would at any time exceed US$1 billion.

5.15     FURTHER ASSURANCES.

    (a)  During the Collateral Period, the Principal, at its expense, shall
         execute and deliver, and cause the Lien Grantors to execute and
         deliver, any and all further documents, financing statements,
         agreements and instruments and shall, from time to time, at its expense
         register, file or record the Security Documents (or instruments
         granting at least equivalent security) in the appropriate office in
         each province of Canada and in all other offices and jurisdictions
         where such documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments
         or such registration, filing or recording is in the opinion of EDC or
         the Collateral Agent from time to time necessary or of advantage to the
         creation or perfection of the Transaction Liens under the Security
         Documents created thereby or intended so to be and the Principal shall
         deliver to EDC and the Collateral Agent, on demand, certificates and
         other evidence reasonably satisfactory to EDC and the Collateral Agent
         as to the perfection and priority of the Transaction Liens constituted
         or intended to be constituted by the Security Documents. The Principal
         shall do, observe and perform, at the Principal's expense, all matters
         and things necessary or expedient to be done, observed and performed
         for the purpose of creating, maintaining and preserving as valid and
         effective security the Transactions Liens


                                       30

<PAGE>

         constituted or intended to be constituted by the Security Documents and
         creating, maintaining and preserving the priority thereof.

    (b)  If any assets (including any real property or improvements thereto or
         any interest therein) are acquired by any Lien Grantor after the date
         hereof (other than assets constituting Collateral that become subject
         to Transaction Liens upon acquisition thereof) which, in the case of
         real property, has a fair market value of US$5 million or more, or, in
         the case of personal property, is required by the terms of any Security
         Document to be subject to the Lien thereof, without limiting any
         obligations of any Lien Grantor or the Principal under any of the
         Security Documents, the Principal will promptly notify the Collateral
         Agent and EDC thereof, and, if requested by the Collateral Agent or EDC
         during a Collateral Period, the Principal will cause such assets to be
         subjected to a Transaction Lien securing the Secured Obligations
         (reasonably structured for any jurisdiction imposing mortgage recording
         or similar taxes) and will take, or cause the relevant Lien Grantor to
         take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by the
         Collateral Agent to grant and perfect or record such Transaction Lien,
         including actions described in this Section 5.15, all at the
         Principal's expense. For the purpose of this Section 5.15(b), the
         Principal will cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent or, if
         there is no Collateral Agent, EDC, Mortgages on real property acquired
         by it or any Material Subsidiary to the extent such owned real property
         has a fair market value of US$5,000,000 or more within 30 days of the
         date of acquisition of such real property.

5.16     BANKING PROCEDURES. The Principal shall not, and shall not permit NNI
to, (i) make any amendment of any waiver by Citibank or waive the enforcement of
any such waiver, of rights of set-off under the Citibank Deposit Account Control
Agreement or (ii) make any change which would result in the Citibank Account no
longer being the primary account (other than collection and "lock-box" accounts
maintained for the purpose of clearing payments and receipts prior to sweeping
out the funds represented thereby and accounts related to the sale or
securitization of accounts receivable) maintained in the United States by the
Material Subsidiaries organized under the laws of any of the states of the
United States for the consolidation of their deposit accounts, in each case,
without the prior express written consent of EDC (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that if such change occurs as a
result of the termination by Citibank of the Citibank Account, such prior
consent shall not be required; provided further, however, that the Principal
shall promptly notify EDC of such termination and shall have 60 days from the
date upon which Citibank provides notice of such termination to obtain the
waiver and effect the perfection hereinafter described in this Section. The
Principal agrees that, without limiting the foregoing, EDC shall be


                                       31
<PAGE>

deemed to be acting reasonably in withholding its consent to any change
described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.16 if it does not receive evidence
satisfactory to it, acting reasonably, of the obtaining of an irrevocable waiver
of rights of set-off (except for rights of set-off of the bank with respect to
amounts due to it in respect of customary fees and expenses for routine
maintenance and operation of the account, any misposted credits and the face
amount of any cheques that have been credited to the account but are
subsequently returned unpaid) from any institution to which it is proposed that
such account will be transferred or with whom any new account in replacement of
the Citibank Account is to be opened, such waiver to be effective
contemporaneously with any such transfer or account opening. Upon the request of
EDC and subject to the second proviso above in the circumstances set forth
therein, the Principal shall cause each of its Material Subsidiaries organized
under the laws of any state of the United States to, promptly take such actions
as EDC may reasonably request to ensure the perfection of any security interest
held by the Collateral Agent or otherwise held by or on behalf of EDC in any
such alternate accounts pursuant to the Security Documents (including without
limitation the execution and delivery of any account control agreement) prior to
any such change.

5.17     ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. The Principal will, and will cause each other
Credit Party to, (i) comply with all applicable Environmental Laws, including
obtaining and maintaining all relevant environmental permits necessary to ensure
that there is no Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) promptly notify EDC of any
environmental claim, notice or order against it which if adversely determined to
such Credit Party, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.18     CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS. If a Specified Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Principal shall cause each relevant Lien Grantor
who owns Pledged Equity Interests not held in a Cash Collateral Account (as
defined in the Security Agreements) to establish a Cash Collateral Account for
the deposit of Cash Distributions (as defined in the Security Agreements)
contemplated by Section 12 of the Canadian Security Agreement or Section 13 of
the U.S. Security Agreement, as applicable.

6.1      EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If one or more of the following events ("Events of
Default") shall have occurred and be continuing:

    (a)  the Principal shall fail to pay when due any amount payable under any
         of the EDC Agreements within three Domestic Business Days after demand
         therefor;

    (b)  the Principal shall fail to observe or perform any covenant contained
         in Section 5.2 or 5.4 (with respect to the existence of the Principal)
         or in Sections 5.8 through 5.10 or Section 5.14 or 5.16;


                                       32

<PAGE>

    (c)  the Principal or any Material Subsidiary shall fail to observe or
         perform any covenant contained in Section 5.11, 5.12 or 5.18;

    (d)  the Principal shall fail to observe or perform any covenant or
         agreement contained in the Facility Documents (other than those covered
         by clause (a), (b) or (c) above) and does not remedy the failure on or
         before thirty days after notice thereof has been given to the Principal
         by EDC;

    (e)  any representation or warranty made (or, pursuant to Section 3.2 or
         4.2, deemed made) by any Credit Party in the Facility Documents (other
         than the Foreign Security Documents, except the Specified Foreign

         than a Foreign Security Document, except a Specified Foreign Subsidiary
         Guarantee) relating to one or more items of Collateral (other than
         Foreign Collateral, as defined in the Security Agreements) with an
         aggregate value determined by the Collateral Agent or, if there is no
         Collateral Agent, EDC, in its sole discretion (which determination may
         be based solely upon information furnished by the Principal or the
         Collateral Agent or, if there is no Collateral Agent, EDC) to exceed
         US$5,000,000 shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Credit
         Party not to be, a valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral, with the
         priority required by the applicable Security Document, except (i) as a
         result of a sale or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in a
         transaction permitted under the Facility Documents, (ii) as a result of
         the Collateral Agent's or, if there is no Collateral Agent, EDC's,
         failure to maintain possession of any stock certificates, promissory
         notes or other documents delivered to it under the Security Agreement

         fail to constitute a valid and binding agreement of NNI or any party
         shall so assert in writing;

    (m)  any obligation of the Principal under any Indemnity Agreement is not
         Designated Bank Debt or any obligation of the Principal with respect to
         any of the Facilities is not a Secured Obligation (unless Replacement
         Security has been provided to secure such obligation); or

    (n)  EDC's aggregate exposure, at any time, under the EDC Agreements (as
         determined by EDC), at the exchange rates then prevailing, shall exceed

<PAGE>

         the equivalent of US$750 million unless the Principal has pledged to
         EDC, by way of a first priority security interest satisfactory to EDC,
         an amount of cash (including deposits of cash) equal to the amount of
         any such excess;

then, and in every such event, in addition to any other right or remedy
available to it or to anyone acting on its behalf under any of the Security
Documents or otherwise, or arising at law or in equity, EDC may, by notice to
the Principal, terminate any commitment it may have hereunder to allow any
further use of the Facilities, and may, if such Event of Default is a Specified
Event of Default, enforce or require anyone holding security on its behalf to
enforce such security and require the Principal to cash collateralize the
amounts of any Support outstanding under the Facilities.


                                    ARTICLE 7
                                  Miscellaneous

7.1      NOTICES. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices,
requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing
(including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing and, with
respect to the reports and other information referred to in the next sentence,
by e-mail or other electronic means) and shall be given to such party: (a) in
the case of the Principal or EDC, at its address, facsimile number or telex
number set forth on the signature pages hereof, or (b) in the case of any party,
such other address, facsimile number, telex number or e-mail address as such
party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to EDC and the Principal.
All reports and other information required to be delivered to EDC pursuant to
Section 5.1(a), (b) or (c) may be delivered by e-mail (either as an e-mail
attachment or by including an appropriate internet link to such reports or other
information). Each such notice, request or other communication shall be
effective (i) if given by telex, when such telex is transmitted to the telex
number specified in this Section and the appropriate answerback is received,
(ii) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile
number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (iii)
if given by e-mail, when such e-mail is transmitted to the e-mail addressed
specified in this Section, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered
at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to EDC under
Article 2 shall not be effective until received.

7.2      NO WAIVERS. No failure or delay by EDC in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any EDC Agreement or any of the Facilities shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

7.3      EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

    (a)  The Principal shall promptly pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
         expenses of EDC, including fees and disbursements of special counsel
         for EDC, in


                                       35

<PAGE>

         connection with the preparation and administration of any of the
         Facility Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment
         hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event
         of Default occurs, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
         EDC, including (without duplication) the fees and disbursements of
         outside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and
         collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings
         resulting therefrom.

    (b)  The Principal agrees to indemnify EDC, its affiliates and the
         respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing
         (each an "INDEMNITEE") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and
         against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of
         any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
         disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in
         connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
         proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party
         thereto) brought or threatened by a Person which is not a party hereto
         or an affiliate of a party hereto relating to any actual, proposed or
         potential use of the Facilities; provided that no Indemnitee shall have
         the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross
         negligence or wilful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction.

7.4      AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed
by the Principal and EDC.

7.5      TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the
later of the Termination Date and the date on which all obligations in respect
of any outstanding Support and any EDC Agreements shall have been satisfied in
their entirety and (ii) the date on which Replacement Security is provided;
provided, however, that no such termination shall affect any agreements
hereunder which are intended to survive any such termination, including without
limitation Sections 7.3, 7.6, 7.7, 7.9 and 7.10 hereof or any indemnity,
guarantee or reimbursement obligations under any Indemnity Agreements.

7.6      SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Principal may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of EDC and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.

7.7      GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. This Agreement and each
Indemnity Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein. The
Principal hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
Province of Ontario and the federal courts of Canada, for purposes of all legal
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Principal irrevocably


                                       36

<PAGE>

waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

7.8      COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement, together with the other Facility Documents, constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any
and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof except as may be expressly set forth or referred to
herein. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by EDC of
counterparts hereof signed by each of the Principal and EDC (or, in the case of
any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received,
receipt by EDC in form satisfactory to it of telegraphic, telex, facsimile or
other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof
by such party).

7.9      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PRINCIPAL AND EDC HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

7.10     SUBORDINATED LIENS. Nothing in the Security Agreements shall be
construed to require EDC to agree to accept any Subordinated Lien (as therein
defined) or, if it at its sole discretion, EDC agrees to accept any such
Subordinated Lien, to agree to do so on the terms set out in the Security
Agreements or in Annex D thereto.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
