                  Representations and Warranties of the Company

      The Company represents and warrants to the Executives that:

      2.1 Organization and Standing. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.
<PAGE>
      2.2 Authorization. All corporate action on the part of the Company
necessary for the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company, and for the authorization, issuance and delivery of
the Shares being sold under this Agreement, has been taken. This Agreement, when
executed and delivered by all parties hereto, shall constitute the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, except to the extent the

reorganization laws, moratorium laws or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

      2.3 Validity of Shares. The Shares, when issued, sold and delivered in

and fully paid and nonassessable.

      2.4 Securities Act. The sale of Shares in accordance with the terms of

the Executive contained in Article III hereof) is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").

                                   ARTICLE III

                  Representations, Warranties and Agreements of

                                 the Executives

      3.1 Authorization. Each Executive represents and warrants that this
Agreement, when executed and delivered by him or her, will constitute his or her
valid and legally binding obligation, except to the extent the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy laws, insolvency laws, reorganization laws,
moratorium laws or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by
general equitable principles.

      3.2 Investment Representations.

            (a) This Agreement is made with each Executive in reliance upon his
or her representation to the Company, which by his or her acceptance hereof,
each Executive hereby confirms, that (i) the Shares to be received by him or her
will be acquired by him or her for investment for his or her own account, not as
a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part
thereof in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws, (ii) he or
she has no current intention of selling, granting participation in or otherwise
distributing the same in violation of applicable federal and state securities
laws, and (iii) the information contained in the form of Purchaser Questionnaire
attached hereto as Exhibit A and completed by each Executive and delivered to
the Company is true, correct, accurate and complete both as of the date of such
Purchaser Questionnaire and as of the date hereof. By executing this Agreement,
each Executive further represents that he or she does not have any contract,
undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant
participation to such person, or to any third person, with respect to any of the
Shares in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
            (b) Each Executive understands that the Shares have not been
registered under the 1933 Act on the basis that the sale provided for in this
Agreement and the issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from registration
under the 1933 Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and regulations issued
thereunder, and that the Company's reliance on such exemption is predicated on
representations of the Executive set forth herein.

            (c) Each Executive represents that he or she has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of his investment. Each Executive further represents that he or
she has had access, during the course of the transactions contemplated hereby
and prior to his or her purchase of Shares, to the same kind of information that
is specified in Part I of a registration statement under the 1933 Act and that
he or she has had, during the course of the transactions contemplated hereby and
prior to his or her purchase of the Shares, the opportunity to ask questions of,
and receive answers from, the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the
offering and to obtain additional information (to the extent the Company
possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or
expense) necessary to verify the accuracy of any information furnished to him or
her or to which he or she had access. Each Executive understands that no federal
or state agency has passed upon this investment or upon the Company, nor has any
such agency made any finding or determination as to the fairness of this
investment.

            (d) Each Executive understands that the Shares may not be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of without registration under the 1933 Act or
an exemption therefrom, and that in the absence of an effective registration
statement covering the Shares or an available exemption from registration under
the 1933 Act, the Shares must be held indefinitely. Each Executive must be
prepared to bear the economic risk of this investment for an indefinite period
of time. In particular, each Executive acknowledges that he or she is aware that
the Shares may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act
unless all of the conditions of that Rule are met. Among the current conditions
for use of Rule 144 by certain holders is the availability to the public of
current information about the Company. Such information is not now available,
and the Company has no current plans to make such information available. Each
Executive represents that, in the absence of an effective registration statement
covering the Shares, he or she will sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
Shares only in a manner consistent with his representations set forth herein and
then only in accordance with the Stockholders' Agreement referred to in Article
VI.

            (e) Independent of the additional restrictions on the transfer of
shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock contained in the
Stockholders' Agreement referred to in Article VI, each Executive agrees that he
or she will not make a transfer, disposition or pledge of any of the Shares
other than pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act,
unless and until (i) he or she shall have notified the Company of the proposed
disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of the
circumstances surrounding the disposition, and (ii) if requested by the Company,
at the expense of such Executive or his transferee, he or she shall have
furnished to the Company an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and its counsel, to the effect that such transfer may be made without
registration of the Shares under the 1933 Act.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
            (f) Each Executive acknowledges that this investment is not
recommended for investors who have any need for a current return on this
investment or who cannot bear the risk of losing their entire investment. Each
Executive acknowledges that: (i) he or she has adequate means of providing for
his current needs and possible personal contingencies and has no need for
liquidity in this investment; (ii) his or her commitment to investments which
are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to his or her net worth; and
(iii) his or her investment in the Shares will not cause his or her overall
financial commitments to become excessive.

      3.3 Legends; Stop Transfer.

            (a) Each Executive acknowledges that all certificates evidencing the
Shares shall bear the following legend:

                              "TRANSFER RESTRICTED

            The securities represented by this Certificate have not been
            registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not
            be sold, offered for sale, pledged or hypothecated in the absence of
            an effective registration statement as to the securities under said
            Act or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company and its
            counsel that such registration is not required.

            (b) The certificates evidencing the Shares shall also bear any
legend required by any applicable state securities law.

            (c) The Company shall make a notation regarding the restrictions on
transfer of the Shares in its stock books, and the Shares shall be transferred
on the books of the Company only if transferred or sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the 1933 Act covering such Shares or pursuant to
and in compliance with the provisions of Section 3.2(e) hereof. All shares of
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of the Company hereafter issued to
each Executive shall bear the same endorsement, shall be subject to all the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. A copy of this Agreement, together with
any amendments thereto, shall remain on file with the Secretary of the Company
and shall be available for inspection to any properly interested person without
charge within five (5) days after the receipt of a written request therefor by
the Company.

hold harmless the Company from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, fines
and expenses, including, without limitation, any present or future withholding
tax obligations (collectively, the "Liabilities"), resulting from the failure to
