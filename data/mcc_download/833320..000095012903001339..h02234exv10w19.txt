                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                  1998, as amended and restated as of December 7, 2001 (the
                  "Credit Agreement"), among BURLINGTON RESOURCES INC., a
                  Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the financial
                  institutions (the "Lenders") listed on the signature pages

                  Citibank, N.A. and Fleet National Bank, as co-syndication
                  agents, and Bank of America, N.A. and Toronto Dominion
                  (Texas), Inc., as co-documentation agents.

         The Borrower has advised the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that
it desires to amend Sections 1.01, 4.01(a), and 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement,
and has requested in connection therewith that the Credit Agreement be amended
as set forth in Section 1 below, and the parties hereto are so willing to amend

Agreement.

herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, as follows:

         SECTION 1.        Amendment and Waiver. (a) Upon the effectiveness of

be amended as follows:

         (i) Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to change the
         definition of "Majority Lenders." The defined term "Majority Lenders"
         shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "MAJORITY LENDERS" means i) for purposes of acceleration of

                  hereof, Lenders holding at least 51% of the then aggregate
                  unpaid principal amount of the Advances held by Lenders or
                  (ii) for all other purposes of this Agreement, Lenders having
                  at least 51% of the Commitments.

         (ii) Section 4.01 (a) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read

                  existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
                  Delaware. Each Material Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
                  existing and in good standing in the jurisdiction of its
                  formation. The Borrower and each Material Subsidiary possess
                  all applicable Business Entity powers and all other
                  authorizations and licenses necessary to engage in its
                  business and operations as now conducted, the

                  Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary which is, on and as of the
                  Effective Date, a Material Subsidiary is listed on Schedule I

         (iii) Section 4.01 (b) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read
         in its entirety as follows:

                  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
                  this Agreement and the Notes, if any, are within the
                  Borrower's applicable Business Entity powers, have been duly
                  authorized by all necessary applicable Business Entity action,
                  and do not contravene the Borrower's organizational documents
                  or law or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting
                  the Borrower.

         (iv) Section 5.01 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to delete
         the word "Corporate" from the title thereof.

         (b)      The Lenders hereby waive any Default or Event of Default, if
any, arising under Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement
that may exist or have existed at or prior to the date of effectiveness hereof
and that would not have existed had the amendments effected hereby been
effective at the time the Credit Agreement was originally executed and
delivered.

         SECTION 2.        Representations and Warranties. The Borrower
represents and warrants as of the effective date of this Amendment to each of
the Lenders that:

         the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
         earlier date or period.

                  (b)      Immediately before and immediately after giving
         effect to this Amendment, no Event of Default or Default has occurred
         and is continuing that would not be cured by effectiveness of this
         Amendment No 2.

         SECTION 3.        Conditions to Effectiveness. This Amendment No. 2 and
the amendment and waiver contained herein shall become effective as of the date
hereof when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this
Amendment No. 2 that, when taken together, bear the signatures of the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, and the Majority Lenders.

         SECTION 4.        Agreement. Except as specifically stated herein, the
provisions of the Credit Agreement are and shall remain in full force and
effect. As used therein, the terms "Credit Agreement", "herein", "hereunder",
