         1. Section 1(b) of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

              (b) The Building Purchase. In accordance with the Building
                  Purchase Agreement, WKBC shall transfer and convey the
                  Building Purchase Assets to WTC for the consideration
                  specified therein. WTC's obligations to WHBC under the

                  and (ii) a short term note in the accreted principal amount of

                  The obligations under the Building Purchase Notes will be
                  secured by the following (the documents evidencing the

                  Purchase Collateral Documents"): (a) a first priority mortgage
                  on and lien in the Building Purchase Assets (specifically
                  including all furniture, fixtures and equipment (other than
                  certain equipment related to or used in connection with WCG's
                  network)), and (b) a fully subordinated, second priority lien
                  on 66% of the stock of Wiltel Communications Pty Limited, an
                  Australian subsidiary of a new, domestic, wholly owned
                  subsidiary of WCLLC, which lien shall be subject to a mutually
                  agreeable Intercreditor Agreement between WHBC and the
                  Administrative Agent (as defined in the Plan) on behalf of the
                  Lenders. In connection with the closing of the Building
                  Purchase Agreement, the Administrative Agent for the benefit
                  of the secured parties,

                  including, without limitation, the Lenders, shall be granted a
                  fully subordinated, second priority lien and mortgage on the
                  Building Purchase Assets (the "Lender Second Mortgage").

         2. The definition of "Building Purchase Agreement" in the Glossary of
Settlement Agreement Defined Terms shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced
with the following:

                  "Building Purchase Agreement" means the agreement dated as of
                  July 26, 2002, a true and correct copy of which is annexed
                  hereto as Exhibit 4, pursuant to which, as a component of the
                  TWC Settlement, WTC shall purchase, the Building Purchase
                  Assets from WHBC, as such agreement is amended from time to
                  time.

         3. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

         4. Except as specifically amended hereby, the Agreement is in all
respects confirmed, ratified and approved.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Amendment on
and as of the date and year first above written.
