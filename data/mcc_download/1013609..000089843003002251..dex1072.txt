                                AMENDMENT TO THE
                      SUPPLEMENTAL EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN
                            FOR SELECTED EMPLOYEES OF
                            SCPIE MANAGEMENT COMPANY
            (As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2001)

     This Amendment to the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan for Selected
Employees of SCPIE Management Company (the "Plan") is effective as of October
23, 2002.

     1. Section 8.2 of the Plan is amended in its entirety to provide the
following:

        8.2 Termination; Amendment. The Board shall have the right at any time
to declare the Plan terminated completely; provided, however, that the
termination of the Plan shall not decrease the accrued interest of any
Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan or adversely
affect the rights of such individual therein. The Plan may be wholly or
partially amended by the Compensation Committee in any manner from time to time,
including retroactive amendments necessary to conform to the provisions and
requirements of ERISA or the Code or regulations pursuant thereto; provided,
however, that no amendment shall decrease the accrued interest of any
Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan or adversely
affect the rights of such individual therein.

     2. The following shall be added as Appendix A to the Plan:

                                   APPENDIX A
                             GUARANTY OF OBLIGATIONS

        1. The undersigned, SCPIE HOLDINGS, INC. ("Guarantor"), shall
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to each Participant, or if applicable,
to such Participant's Beneficiary, the payment of all benefits (the
"Obligation") payable to such Participant pursuant to the terms of the Plan.

        2. No provision of this Guaranty or right of a Participant or a
Beneficiary hereunder can be waived in whole or in part, nor can Guarantor be
released from its obligations hereunder, except by a writing duly executed by
the Participant or the Beneficiary, as applicable.

        3. Except as provided in any other written agreement now or at any time
hereafter in force between a Participant or, if applicable, Beneficiary and
Guarantor, this Guaranty shall constitute the entire agreement of Guarantor with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and no representation, understanding,
promise or condition concerning the subject matter hereof shall be binding upon
the Participant, the Beneficiary or Guarantor unless expressed herein.

<PAGE>

        4. The Guarantor shall not secure or fund this Guaranty by any of the
assets of the Guarantor. A Participant's or Beneficiary's rights pursuant to
this Guaranty shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general
creditor of the Guarantor. No rights of any Participant (or Beneficiary)
pursuant to this Guaranty shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of other than by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution, and any such purported sale, exchange, transfer,
assignment, pledge, hypothecation or disposition shall be void. The Guarantor
shall not recognize any purported sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge,
hypothecation, or disposition by any Participant (or Beneficiary) of all or part
of his interest hereunder, and such interest shall not be subject in any manner
to transfer by operation of law, and shall be exempt from the claims of
creditors or other claimants from all order, decrees, levies, garnishment and/or
executions and other legal or equitable process or proceedings against the
Participant (or Beneficiary) to the fullest extent which may be permitted by
law.

        5. Other than as provided above, this Guaranty, where applicable, will
be subject to the terms of the Plan.

        EXECUTED as of this 23rd day of October, 2002.

                                  "Guarantor"
