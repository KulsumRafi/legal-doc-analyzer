to Serono, to the attention of such person(s) as Serono shall designate, any
inquiries to which it cannot respond as well as any inquiries related to

such records as required to respond to such inquiries in accordance with the Act
and all other applicable Laws and shall allow representatives of Serono to

        6.1. Initial Fee. In consideration of the grant of rights hereunder and

the other payments


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

provided for in this Agreement, OSI shall pay to Serono **, a non-creditable and
nonrefundable payment of **.

        6.4. Net Sales Report. Serono shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to OSI within forty-five (45) days, but in no event later than sixty

applicable Calendar Year, including (i) an accounting of the deductions from Net
Sales permitted by the definition thereof, and (ii) adjustments, if any, to Net
Sales permitted by the definition thereof.

        6.5. Net Sales Determination. To determine Net Sales, Serono must
distinguish sales of the Product in the Field from sales of the Product outside
the Field. To distinguish such sales, Serono shall contract with a third-party
vendor, which third party vendor shall periodically, but no less often than each
Calendar Quarter, establish, as accurately as is reasonably possible, the
percentage of Product sales in the Field. Such percentage shall then be applied
in an appropriate manner to sales of the Product in the Territory to determine
Net Sales. Exhibit C describes a method for such measurement. The parties agree
that as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, and in any event within
thirty (30) days thereafter, they will review and, if necessary, optimize the
method described in Exhibit C; provided, however, that Serono shall have the
right finally to determine such method. Thereafter either party shall from time
to time have the right, upon written notice to the other party and following
consultation with the other party, to request a review of such method to ensure
its continuing accuracy and such review shall then be performed. Following the
performance of such review, Serono shall have the right finally to determine any
modifications to such method. The parties shall share equally the out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Serono in selecting and contracting with such third-party
vendor and performing any of the aforementioned reviews. This amount shall be
invoiced to OSI at the end

Calendar Quarter and shall be payable by OSI within thirty (30) days after the
date of invoice. The determination of the third party as to the sales of the

error, and shall not be subject to audit under this Agreement.

        6.6. Commission Payment. During the Term, Serono shall pay to OSI ** the
amounts set forth in this Section 6.6 (each, a "Commission Payment"). The
Commission Payment is calculated based on a percentage of the Net Sales in each
Calendar Year during the Term, and the applicable percentage shall change upon
the occurrence of certain events and as Net Sales in the applicable Calendar
Year exceed certain increments as follows:

such notice was last provided. OSI shall notify Serono's treasurer, or such
other party as Serono's treasurer shall designate in writing, by facsimile
transmission as to the date and amount of any payment that OSI shall make prior
to such transfer. Serono shall notify OSI's treasurer, or such other party as
OSI's treasurer shall designate in writing, by facsimile transmission as to the
date and amount of any payment that Serono shall make prior to such transfer.
All payments under this Agreement shall bear interest from the date due and
payable until paid at an annual rate equal to **.

        6.9. Taxes. Unless otherwise required by law, each party shall be
responsible for paying and reporting all of its own taxes (including VAT or
withholding taxes) and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement.

        6.10. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding Section 6.9 each party shall be
indemnified against and held harmless by the other party (or its assignee) from
any incremental tax liability (including VAT or withholding taxes) imposed on
such party as the result of an assignment by the other party of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.5. In the event of any
such assignment, (i) the assignee shall gross up any payments it makes to the
extent

necessary so that the net payment received by the non-assigning party after any
such incremental tax liability equals the amount due under this Agreement; and
(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, the non-assigning party shall not be required
to pay any gross up or other amounts to the assigning party on account of any
taxes (including VAT or withholding taxes) that would not have been imposed but
for such assignment.

        7.1. Books and Records. Serono shall keep and shall cause to be kept
accurate records in sufficient detail to enable the Commission Payments
described in Section 6.6 to be determined and to be verified by OSI.

        7.2. Audit. Upon the written request of OSI, at OSI's expense and not
more than once in any Calendar Year, Serono shall permit an independent
accountant of national prominence selected by OSI, and approved by Serono (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), to have access during normal
business hours to those records of Serono or its Affiliates as may be reasonably
necessary to verify the accuracy of the reports furnished by Serono pursuant to
Section 6.4, in respect of any Calendar Quarter ending not more than two (2)
years prior to the date of such notice. Such accountant shall not disclose any
information except that which should properly be contained in a report required
under Section 6.4 of this Agreement. Upon the expiration of two (2) years
following the end of any Calendar Quarter, the calculation of amounts payable
with respect to such Calendar Quarter shall be binding and conclusive upon OSI,
and Serono and its Affiliates shall be released from any liability or
accountability with respect to payments for such Calendar Quarter. The report
prepared by such independent accountant, a copy of which shall be sent or
otherwise provided to Serono by such independent accountant at the same time it
is sent or otherwise provided to OSI, shall contain the conclusions of such
independent accountant regarding the audit and will specify that the amounts
paid to OSI


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

for the period under audit were correct or, if incorrect, the amount of any
underpayment or overpayment. If such independent accountant's report shows any
underpayment, Serono shall remit or shall cause its Affiliates to remit to OSI
within thirty (30) days after Serono's receipt of such report, (i) the amount of
such underpayment with interest as set forth in Section 6.8, and (ii) if such
underpayment exceeds ** of the total amount owed for the period then being
audited, the reasonable and necessary fees and expenses of such independent
accountant performing the audit, subject to reasonable substantiation thereof.
Any overpayments shall be fully creditable against amounts payable in subsequent
payment periods or remitted to Serono, at Serono's request. OSI agrees that all
information subject to review under this Section 7.2 shall be deemed
Confidential Information of Serono and that OSI shall retain and cause its
accountant to retain all such information in confidence in accordance with
Article IX hereof.

        7.3. Sales Force Efforts. In addition to those records that OSI is
required to maintain pursuant to Section 2.11 or Law, for two (2) years
following each Calendar Year, OSI shall keep records relating to the Promotion
and Detailing activities reported in the Activities Reports for such Calendar
Year. Upon reasonable prior written notice to OSI, such records shall be
available for inspection and audit by Serono once per year to determine
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

Serono shall design the packaging and labeling for the Product. OSI shall
reimburse Serono for all costs incurred by Serono in connection with modifying
the existing packaging and labeling for the Product to incorporate OSI's logo.
The Product will be packaged using the redesigned packaging and labeling only
after the stock of packaging and labeling materials in existence or production
on the Effective Date is exhausted, unless OSI agrees to pay for the replacement
of such unused stock of packaging and labeling materials. Serono agrees to
promptly provide to OSI upon reasonable request an estimated cost for the
replacement of the then-current stock of packaging and labeling materials. Any
amounts payable by OSI pursuant to this Section 8.1.1 shall be invoiced to OSI
and payable within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice. All training
materials utilized by OSI hereunder and Promotional Materials shall bear the OSI
corporate logo and the Serono corporate logo. Serono shall provide to OSI an
electronic copy of Serono's corporate logo for use on the Promotional Materials
and the training materials. OSI shall provide to Serono an electronic copy of
OSI's corporate logo for use on the Product. During the Term, Serono grants to
OSI the non-exclusive right to use the Serono corporate logo in the Territory

reasonable period of time thereafter as described below, OSI grants to Serono
the non-exclusive right to use the OSI corporate logo in the Territory solely
for the purpose of Serono's promotion of the Product. Except as contemplated
herein, neither party shall otherwise have any rights in or to the other party's
trademarks or corporate logo or the goodwill pertaining thereto. OSI agrees that
upon termination or expiration of this Agreement it will discontinue forthwith
all use of the Trademark and the Serono corporate logo. Serono agrees that
following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, it will promptly
discontinue all use of the OSI corporate logo; provided, however, that Serono

to sell all Product inventory in existence or in production at the time of such
termination or expiration.

                8.1.2 Infringement. OSI shall inform Serono promptly of any
infringement of or challenge to the Trademark in the Territory, in each case
whether actual or threatened, which comes to the notice of OSI. As between OSI
and Serono, Serono shall have the exclusive right, at its sole cost and expense,
to take action in respect of the registration, defense, infringement and
maintenance of the Trademark, and OSI shall provide reasonable assistance and
cooperation with such activities as Serono may reasonably request, at Serono's
sole cost and expense.

        8.2. Copyrights. Subject to Sections 2.7 and 2.10, Serono shall own all
copyrights relating to the Promotional Materials and to the training materials
for the Sales Representatives and the Medical Science Liaisons, and such
copyrights shall be deemed Copyrights. As between OSI and Serono, Serono shall
have the exclusive right, at its sole cost and expense, to take action in
respect of the registration, defense, and infringement of the Copyrights, and
OSI shall provide reasonable assistance and cooperation with such activities as
Serono may reasonably request, at Serono's sole cost and expense.

Field which is not known to the public and is developed during the Term, by or
on behalf of either party acting alone or jointly, in connection with the
co-promotion or other activities contemplated under this Agreement shall be
owned by Serono and shall be deemed Know-How; provided, however, that Know-How
shall not include any data or information that compose the regulatory approvals
relating to the Product, including the NDA, or any data, results or other
information relating to the Product and arising from the Clinical Trials. Serono
shall have the exclusive right, at its sole cost and expense, to take action in
respect of the maintenance, protection, defense, and infringement of the

        8.4. Patent. OSI will not make any admission or take any action that
would reasonably be expected (such expectation to be as of the time such
admission is made or such action is taken) to (i) render a Valid Claim under the
Patent invalid or unenforceable, or (ii) materially limit Serono's or the Patent
owner's ability to prosecute, defend or enforce the Patent. OSI shall inform
Serono promptly of any infringement of or challenge to the Patent in the
Territory, in each case whether actual or threatened, which comes to the notice
of OSI. As between OSI and Serono, Serono shall have the exclusive right, at its
sole cost and expense, to take action in respect of the prosecution,
maintenance, defense and enforcement of the Patent, and OSI shall provide
reasonable assistance and cooperation with such activities as Serono may
reasonably request, at Serono's sole cost and expense.

        8.5. License Agreement and Manufacturing Agreement. Serono covenants and
agrees with OSI that Serono: (i) shall not execute, or otherwise permit to be
made, any amendment, modification or waiver to the License Agreement or
Manufacturing Agreement that would have a material adverse effect on OSI's
Promotion and Detailing of the Product, without the prior written consent of
OSI; (ii) shall not terminate the License Agreement, without the prior written
consent of OSI; and (iii) shall not take any action that might reasonably be
expected to result in the termination of the License Agreement or the
Manufacturing Agreement by the counterparties thereto.

                            CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

        9.1. Treatment of Confidential Information. During the Term and for
seven (7) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each
party shall maintain Confidential Information of the other party in confidence,

Information to third parties or use it for any purpose other than performance of
this Agreement.

        9.2. Disclosure to Affiliates and Agents. Each party may disclose
Confidential Information to its Affiliates and its and their officers,
directors, employees, consultants and agents, and Serono may disclose
Confidential Information to the counterparties to the Manufacturing Agreement
and the License Agreement, in connection with performance of this Agreement, but
only to the extent necessary to enable such parties to perform their obligations
hereunder or under the applicable agreement, as the case may be; provided that
such officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents have entered into
appropriate confidentiality agreements for secrecy and non-use of such
Confidential Information containing provisions no less onerous than those set
forth herein.

        9.3. Injunctive Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
provisions of this Article IX are reasonable and necessary to protect the other
party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the
provisions of this Article IX may result in irreparable harm to such other
party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate.
Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions
of this Article IX by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other
relief available to it at law in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from
engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this
Article IX, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or
other security.

by proper corporate action on the part of Serono.

                (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
performance hereof by Serono requires Serono to obtain any permits,
authorizations or consents from any Governmental Authority or from any other

such execution, delivery and performance will not result in the breach of or
give rise to any termination of any agreement to which Serono may be a party and
which relates to the Product, including the License Agreement and the
Manufacturing Agreement.

                (c) There are no actions (including class actions), suits,
proceedings or claims pending or, to the knowledge of Serono, threatened against
Serono or any of its Affiliates at law or in equity or before or by any
Governmental Authority in the Territory, relating to the Product.

                (d) Serono has not received written notice of any orders,
investigations, actions or proceedings, or of any alleged violations or
noncompliance with the NDA, or any warning letters, in each such case, that
would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension or material
adverse modification of the NDA or otherwise would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) OSI's ability to Promote and Detail the
Product or (ii) Net Sales.

                (e) Other than **, there are no agreements that have been

Governmental Authorities.

                (f) The License Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement, in
the form provided by Serono to OSI, are in full force and effect and have not be
modified or amended and there exists no default under either agreement by
Serono, or to Serono's knowledge, any other party to either agreement or any

default thereunder by Serono or, to Serono's knowledge, any other party to
either such agreement.

                (g) Serono has not intentionally withheld from OSI any material
information in Serono's possession with respect to the safety and effectiveness

<PAGE>

                (a) OSI has the corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized and approved by proper corporate action on the part of OSI.

                (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
performance hereof by OSI requires OSI to obtain any permits, authorizations or
consents from any Governmental Authority or from any other person; and such
execution, delivery and performance will not result in the breach of or give
rise to any termination of any agreement or contract to which OSI may be a
party, which termination would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on OSI's ability to perform hereunder.

        10.3. Indemnification of OSI.

                10.3.1 Indemnity. Serono shall indemnify, defend and hold OSI
and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents (the "OSI Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses
incurred, suffered or sustained by the OSI Parties, or to which the OSI Parties
become subject, to the extent arising out of any third party claims, actions,
suits, or proceedings ("Third Party Claims") resulting from or relating to **
(iv) the breach by Serono of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
herein; or (v) any gross negligence, bad faith, recklessness or willful
misconduct of any of the Serono Parties.

                10.3.2 Limitation. None of the obligations in Section 10.3.1
shall apply to the extent that any Loss results from any breach of this
Agreement by OSI or any gross negligence, bad faith, recklessness, or willful
misconduct of any of the OSI Parties.

        10.4. Indemnification of Serono.

                10.4.1 Indemnity. OSI shall indemnify, defend and hold Serono
and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents and the counterparties to the Manufacturing Agreement and the License
Agreement (the "Serono Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses
incurred, suffered or sustained by the Serono Parties, or to which the Serono
Parties become subject, resulting from or relating to ** (ii) the breach by OSI
of any of its representations, warranties or covenants herein; or (iii) or any
gross negligence, bad faith, recklessness, or willful misconduct of any of the
OSI Parties.

                10.4.2 Limitation. None of the indemnities in Section 10.4.1
shall apply to the extent that any Loss results from any breach of this
Agreement by Serono or any gross negligence, bad faith, recklessness, or willful
misconduct of the Serono Parties.

        10.5. Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims. The following
procedures shall apply to any Third Party Claim for which an OSI Party or a
Serono Party, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Party"), may be entitled to
indemnification under this Article X. To be eligible to be indemnified for a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (i) provide the party required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party (the "Indemnifying Party") with prompt written
notice of the Third Party Claim giving rise to the indemnification obligation
under this Article X, which notice shall include a reasonable identification of
the alleged facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any of its obligations under this Article X except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby; (ii) provide the Indemnifying
Party with the exclusive ability to defend (with the reasonable cooperation of
the Indemnified Party) against the Third Party Claim; and (iii) not settle,
admit (unless legally required to do so) or materially prejudice the Third Party
Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of any Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate and have counsel selected by it participate, at

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

the Indemnified Party's expense, in any action for which the Indemnified Party
seeks to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
not settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, any Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if
the settlement or compromise provides for an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party.

        10.6. Non-Duplicative Payment. In calculating amounts payable to an
Indemnified Party, the amount of the Losses shall not be duplicative of any
other Losses for which an indemnification claim has been made and shall be
computed net of (i) payments recoverable by the Indemnified Party under any
insurance policy with respect to such Losses; (ii) any prior or subsequent
recovery by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect to such
Losses; or (iii) any tax benefit receivable by the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Losses.

        10.7. Insurance. Subject to generally available and customary terms and
conditions of general liability insurance policies, each party shall as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Effective
Date, obtain, maintain and keep in force for the Term comprehensive general
liability insurance, including coverage for products and completed operations,
covering its indemnification obligations hereunder with a minimum limit of **
combined single limit for Bodily Injury and Property Damage. It is understood
that such insurance shall not be construed to limit a party's liability with
respect to such indemnification obligations. Such insurance shall be placed with
a first class insurance carrier with at least a BBB rating by Standard & Poor's.
Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party shall
furnish a certificate of insurance to the other party evidencing the foregoing
endorsements, coverage and limits, and providing that such insurance shall not
expire or be canceled or modified without at least thirty (30) days prior notice
to the other party.

        11.1. Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date
and shall continue in force until the expiration of the Term.

        11.2. Termination for Breach. Either party (the "Non-breaching Party")
may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party (the
"Breaching Party") if the Breaching Party is in default of any of its material
obligations hereunder and fails to remedy such default within ninety (90) days
(thirty (30) days in the case of a payment default) after written notice thereof
by the Non-breaching Party specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such
breach.

        11.3. Termination Upon Other Events. In the event that during the
Maintenance Term (i) the NDA (as it may be modified from time to time) is
revoked by the FDA or (ii) the License Agreement is terminated, OSI may
terminate immediately this Agreement. Within **, OSI may terminate this
Agreement with ** prior written notice to Serono if Net Sales ** during the
immediately preceding Calendar Year.

        11.4. Termination after the First Generic Date. OSI may terminate this
Agreement with ninety (90) days prior written notice to Serono at any time after

        11.5. Termination for Bankruptcy. This Agreement may be immediately
terminated by either party if the other party becomes insolvent, makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, is the subject of proceedings in
voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy instituted on behalf of or against such
party, or has a receiver or trustee appointed for all or substantially all of
its property, provided, however, that in the case of an involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding such right to terminate shall only become effective if the party
consents to the involuntary bankruptcy or such proceeding is not dismissed
within ninety (90) days after the filing thereof.

        11.6. Survival of Obligations. Notwithstanding any termination or
expiration of this Agreement, (i) neither party shall be relieved of any
obligations incurred prior to such termination or expiration, (ii) the
obligations of the parties with respect to the protection and nondisclosure of
Confidential Information (Article IX), Indemnification (Article X), as well as
any other Section of this Agreement which is required to give effect to such
termination or expiration or the consequences of such termination or expiration,
shall survive such termination or expiration, and (iii) unless this Agreement
expressly provides that termination shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for a
particular breach hereof, either party's right to terminate this Agreement shall
be in addition to and not in lieu of all other rights or remedies that the party
giving notice of termination may have at law, in equity or otherwise. If this
Agreement is terminated as a result of the termination of the License Agreement,
then this Agreement at the option of the counterparty to the License Agreement
shall be assigned by Serono to such counterparty. Upon termination or expiration
of this Agreement, each party shall within thirty (30) days thereafter destroy
all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession and/or under
its control; provided, however, that each party shall have the right to retain
one archival copy of Confidential Information for its legal files for the sole
purposes of establishing its rights and determining its obligations under this
Agreement. At the request of the other party, a party shall deliver a
certification, executed by an officer of such party, that all Confidential


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

Information of the other party has been destroyed as set forth in this Section
11.6, subject to the right to retain one archival copy as set forth in this
Section 11.6.

                                 NON-COMPETITION

        12.1. **. During the Maintenance Term or until the earlier termination
of this Agreement, without Serono's prior written approval, OSI shall not,
directly or indirectly, develop, manufacture, market, sell, detail, promote or
distribute **. Following the ** until the end of the Term, Serono shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement in the event OSI, directly or indirectly,
develops, manufactures, markets, sells, details, promotes or distributes **.

        12.2. **. During the Maintenance Term or until the earlier termination
of this Agreement, without Serono's prior written approval, OSI shall not,
directly or indirectly, develop, manufacture, market, sell, detail, promote or
distribute **. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on OSI set forth in
this Section 12.2 are in addition to, rather than in lieu of, those set forth in
Section 12.1.

The parties intend that, to the maximum extent practicable, that with respect to
matters subject to determination by the JMC, they shall reach decisions
hereunder cooperatively through the deliberations of the JMC and by consent of
its members as described in Section 3.3. In situations in which such cooperative
decision making does not occur, any two members of the JMC may institute the

the CEO of OSI and the CEO of Serono's Affiliate, Serono, S.A. The parties'
CEO's or, at their election, an executive officer of each party who has direct
reporting responsibility to the CEO of that party shall discuss the proposed JMC
action, and shall meet and attempt to resolve the matter by either approving in
writing the proposed JMC action (whether or not in a revised form) or agreeing
in writing to reject it within five (5) Business Days following the receipt by
them of the summary of the proposed action and the unresolved dispute (or such
lesser or longer period as they may agree is a useful period for their
discussions). In the event that the parties' CEO's or their designees are unable
pursuant to the preceding sentence to resolve any dispute **.

        13.2. Other Disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute
concerning any matter that is not specifically described herein as subject to
determination by the JMC, including a dispute asserting breach of this
Agreement, shall be submitted exclusively to the federal court in the State of
Delaware, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such
court.

Such notice, report or other communication will be deemed effective as of the

        14.4. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement
if there is any failure of performance under this Agreement (except for payment
of any amounts due hereunder) occasioned by any act of God, fire, act of
government or state, war, civil commotion, insurrection, terrorism, failure or
delay of transportation, embargo, prevention from or hindrance in obtaining
energy or other utilities, labor disputes of whatever nature or any other reason
beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the party affected
thereby (a "Force Majeure Event"). Such excuse shall continue as long as the
Force Majeure Event continues. Upon cessation of such Force Majeure Event, the
affected party shall promptly resume performance hereunder. Each party agrees to
give the other party prompt written notice of the occurrence of any Force
Majeure Event, the nature thereof, and the extent to which the affected party
will be unable fully to perform its obligations hereunder. The affected party
further agrees


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

to use reasonable efforts to correct the Force Majeure Event as quickly as
possible and to give the other party prompt written notice when it is again
fully able to perform such obligations.

        14.5. Assignment. Except as otherwise provided herein, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by
either party without the prior consent of OSI, in the case of any assignment by
Serono, or Serono, in the case of any assignment by OSI, except assignment, in
whole or in part, to an Affiliate of the assigning party or to any other party
who acquires all or substantially all of the business of the assigning party by
merger, sale of assets or otherwise, so long as such Affiliate or other party
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. To the extent any
rights or obligations of a party are assigned to an Affiliate of such party then
any business transaction, change in control or other event that, in each case,
causes such Affiliate to cease to be an Affiliate of the assigning party, shall
be deemed an assignment of the rights or obligations held by such former
Affiliate and shall require prior written consent of the other party. Any
attempted assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

        14.6. Performance by an Affiliate. Each of Serono and OSI acknowledge
that obligations under this Agreement may be performed by Affiliates of Serono
and OSI. Each of Serono and OSI guarantee performance of this Agreement by its
Affiliates, notwithstanding any assignment to Affiliates in accordance with
Section 14.5 of this Agreement.

        14.7. Amendments and Waivers. No terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall be varied or modified by any prior or subsequent statement, conduct or act
of either of the parties, whether oral or written, except that the parties may
amend this Agreement by written instruments specifically referring to, and
executed in the same manner as, this Agreement. No waiver of any right or remedy
hereunder shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the party to be
bound, nor shall any waiver in one instance constitute a waiver of the same or
any other right or remedy in any other instance. No delay or omission by a party
to exercise or avail itself of any right,


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

power or privilege that it has or may have hereunder shall operate as a waiver
of any right, power or privilege by such party.

        14.8. Severability. If any provision hereof should be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, then, to the
fullest extent permitted by law: (i) all other provisions hereof shall remain in
full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in
order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as is
possible; and (ii) such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are materially
altered as a result of this Section 14.8, the parties shall attempt to
renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in good faith, to
resolve any inequities.

        14.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, and all of such counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

        14.10. Relationship of the Parties. Each party shall bear its own costs
incurred in the performance of its obligations hereunder without charge or
expense to the other except as expressly provided in this Agreement. No employee
or representative of a party shall have any authority to bind or obligate the
other party to this Agreement for any sum or in any manner whatsoever, or to
create or impose any contractual or other liability on the other party without
such party's prior written approval. For all purposes, and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to establish a relationship of partners or joint venturers
between the parties.

        14.11. Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the Term, neither party
shall, directly or indirectly, recruit, or solicit any employee of the other
party or any of such other party's


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

Affiliates if such employee has been materially involved in the performance of
this Agreement, except pursuant to general solicitations not targeted at such
employees.

        14.12. Press Releases. The parties hereby each approve the form of joint
press release set forth in Exhibit D hereto, and will cooperate in the release
thereof as soon as practicable after the signature of this Agreement by the
parties. No other public announcement or other disclosure to third parties
concerning the existence or terms of this Agreement shall be made, either
directly or indirectly, by either party hereto, without first obtaining the
written approval of the other party, which shall include agreement upon the
nature and text of such announcement or disclosure; provided, however, that
Serono shall be permitted to disclose the terms of this Agreement to the
counterparty to the License Agreement. The party desiring to make any such
public announcement or other disclosure shall inform the other party of the
proposed announcement or disclosure by providing the other party with a written
copy thereof, and allowing reasonably sufficient time prior to public release to
permit such other party to comment upon such announcement or disclosure. Once
any such public announcement or disclosure has been approved in accordance with
this Section 14.12, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, then
either party may appropriately communicate information contained in such
permitted announcement or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may
make such disclosure where required by applicable Law or applicable stock
exchange regulation or order or other ruling of a competent court, provided,
however, that the disclosing party shall use reasonable efforts to notify the
other party prior to making such disclosure. Each party agrees that it shall
reasonably cooperate with the other with respect to all disclosures regarding
this Agreement to the Securities and Exchange Commission and any other
governmental or regulatory agencies, including requests for confidential
treatment of proprietary information of either party included in any such
disclosure.

        14.13. Third Party Beneficiaries. None of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any third party,
including any creditor of either party hereto. No


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

such third party shall obtain any right under any provision of this Agreement or
shall by reason of any such provision make any claim in respect of any debt,
liability or obligation (or otherwise) against either party hereto.

        14.14. Headings. The article and section headings contained herein are
for reference only and shall not be considered a part of this Agreement, nor
shall they in any way affect the interpretation hereof.

        14.15. Interpretation. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions
of this Agreement.

        14.16. Further Assurances; Covenant to Cooperate. Each of the parties
agree, during the Term, that it will execute and deliver any and all such
documents and instruments and take any and all such other actions as the other
party may reasonably request in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        14.17. No Set Off. No party shall have any right to set-off any amount
owed by it to the other party or an Affiliate thereof under this Agreement from
any amount owed by such other party or one of its Affiliates to the first party
under this Agreement, another agreement or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of the other party.


                                      -56-

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed and delivered this
Agreement to be effective as of the Effective Date.

                   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING; PRODUCT COMPLAINTS

This is to advise the parties of the requirements for data exchange between them
regarding reports of adverse experiences and product complaints related to the
use of the Product which will be marketed in accordance with this Agreement.

It is a requirement of the FDA that the parties record, investigate, summarize
and review all adverse experiences and product complaints associated with the
Product. The parties understand that reporting requirements differ from country
to country, and because at least one party is a multinational company often
subject to multiple jurisdictions, the reporting standards contained herein may
be more stringent than FDA requirements. The parties require compliance with the
higher standard contained herein. The parties agree to adhere to requirements of
local laws and regulations, which relate to the reporting and investigation of
adverse experiences and product complaints.

In order to ensure that all relevant safety data related to the Product will be
duly reported to appropriate regulatory authorities, the parties agree to
establish within sixty (60) days after the effective date a detailed
Pharmacovigilance Agreement, outlining the responsibilities of each party in
connection with collecting and reporting of adverse events and product
complaints in accordance with the following provisions:

(i) All Product complaints and reports of adverse experiences associated with
the use of the Product shall be promptly transmitted by OSI to Serono. OSI shall
provide Serono all necessary assistance to follow up and document such Product
complaints and reports of adverse experiences associated with the use of the
Product.

(ii) Serono shall promptly investigate all Product complaints and reports of
adverse experiences, associated with the use of the Product, upon receiving such
complaints or reports of adverse experiences associated with the use of the
Product.

(iii) Serono shall establish and maintain the global safety database for the
Product.


                                      B-1
<PAGE>

(iv) Serono shall submit reports of all adverse experiences associated with the
use of the Product and other required safety information, e.g., Field Alert
Reports, Periodic Safety Update Reports and Annual Safety Reports, to the FDA
and other Governmental Authorities, in accordance with the applicable legal
requirements, copies of which shall be promptly provided to OSI.

(v) Serono shall have the sole responsibility for revising the Product labeling,
as needed, to adequately warn of the potential risks identified by reports of
adverse drug experiences associated with the use of the Product and from Product
complaints, and shall notify OSI in writing of the approval of any such labeling
changes by the FDA or any other Governmental Authority.

          SERONO AND OSI PHARMACEUTICALS ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT FOR OSI TO

                        MARKET NOVANTRONE(R) IN ONCOLOGY

MELVILLE, NEW YORK AND GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - MARCH 12, 2003 - OSI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSIP) and Serono S.A. (virt-x: SEO and NYSE: SRA)
announced today that they have entered into an agreement by which OSI will
market and promote the drug Novantrone(R) (mitoxantrone concentrate for
injection) for the approved oncology indications in the United States. In
consideration for these exclusive rights, OSI will pay Serono initial fees
totaling $55 million plus maintenance fees in return for commissions on net
sales in oncology. To support Novantrone(R), OSI intends to build commercial
operations which will include a sales force and an associated marketing and
sales management infrastructure.

Novantrone(R) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), which includes myelogenous,
promyelocytic, monocytic and


                                      D-1
<PAGE>

erythroid acute leukemias, and the relief of pain associated with advanced
hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The drug is also approved for certain
advanced forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Serono will continue to be
responsible for the marketing of the multiple sclerosis indication for
Novantrone(R) and book all U.S. sales in all indications. Total sales of
Novantrone(R) in 2002, were approximately $80 million. Serono acquired from
Amgen the U.S. rights to Novantrone(R) for both MS and oncology in December
2002.

"Gaining access to a high-quality, marketed oncology product to both build a
revenue base and allow us to seed a commercial organization has been a key
corporate goal over the last two years," stated Colin Goddard, Ph.D., Chief
Executive Officer of OSI Pharmaceuticals. "We see Novantrone(R) as a well
established therapeutic product in oncology of about the right size that became
available at the right time, and we have moved aggressively to secure this
opportunity. We believe our new relationship with Serono represents a win-win
for both parties. Further, we believe this deal, coupled with our recently
announced intention to acquire Cell Pathways' pro-apoptotic pipeline and the
marketed oncology-care product Gelclair(TM), represent major steps forward in
continuing to build a high quality oncology organization."

"We have found an excellent partner in OSI, who have a significant commitment to
developing a commercial presence in the field of oncology," said Ernesto
Bertarelli, Serono's Chief Executive Officer. "This agreement enables Serono to
focus on Novantrone(R) in our specialist area of multiple sclerosis, while
ensuring that the product continues to be well supported in its oncology
indications."

Novantrone(R) is a synthetic antineoplastic anthracenedione used intravenously
as an anti-cancer agent. The product was approved by the FDA in 1987 for ANLL
and in 1996 for the relief of pain associated with HRPC. It was registered for
MS indications in October 2000. It is a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates
into DNA through hydrogen bonding, causing crosslinks and strand breaks.
Novantrone(R) also interferes with RNA and is a potent inhibitor of
topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA.

future experience and results to differ materially from the statements made.
Factors that might cause such a difference include, among others, the impact of
acquisitions and divestitures on the synergies of OSI's programs, the success of
research and development activities and of pre-clinical development thereof, the
completion of clinical trials, the FDA review process and other governmental
regulation, pharmaceutical collaborators' ability to successfully develop and
commercialize drug candidates, competition from other pharmaceutical companies,
product pricing and third party reimbursement, and other factors described in
OSI Pharmaceuticals' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of
Serono S.A. and affiliates to be materially different from those expected or
anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
based on Serono's current expectations and assumptions, which may be affected by
a number of factors, including those discussed in this press release and more
fully described in Serono's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21 2002. These factors include any
failure or delay in Serono's ability to develop new products, any failure to
receive anticipated regulatory approvals, any problems in commercializing
current products as a result of competition or other factors, our ability to
obtain reimbursement coverage for our products, and government regulations
limiting our ability to sell our products. Serono has no responsibility to
update the forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect
