underlined):

               9.1 Amendment. The Board may at any time amend the Plan in whole
        or in part. However, no amendment will decrease the amount of any then
        existing account or otherwise adversely affect a Participant's rights to
        existing Account balances or to benefits under any Addendum to this Plan
                                  ----------------------------------------------

                   --------------------------
        terminate the Plan, in which event no new Deferral Agreements shall be
        made, but the obligations of the Company under this Plan and existing
                                                 ---------------
        Deferral Agreements shall continue except to the extent that a
                                           ---------------------------
        Participant agrees otherwise with respect to his or her Account and
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        other rights under the Plan and existing Deferral Agreements.

        provide Termination Benefits and other amounts payable under this Plan
                                     -----------------------------------------
        through a trust or funding vehicle, provided, however, that the terms of
        any such trust or funding vehicle shall not alter the status of
        participants and Beneficiaries as mere general unsecured creditors of
        the Company or otherwise cause the Plan to be funded or benefits taxable
        to Participants except upon actual receipt.

     4. The first paragraph of Section 10.13 is amended to read as follows (new

        than 30 days following the Change in Control, make an irrevocable
        contribution to a trust or funding vehicle established pursuant to and
        consistent with Section 10.2, in an amount equal to the sum of the
        balances of all Accounts as of the date on which the Change of Control
        occurred and shall also transfer to such trust or funding vehicle all
                 ------------------------------------------------------------
        insurance policies held by the Company in connection with this Plan.
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Within 5 days after the end of each calendar quarter thereafter, the
        Company shall contribute to such trust or funding vehicle the amount, if
        any, by which the sum of the balances of all Accounts exceeds the value
        of the assets of such trust or funding vehicle other than any insurance
                                                       ------------------------
        policies held by such trust or funding vehicle.
        ----------------------------------------------
