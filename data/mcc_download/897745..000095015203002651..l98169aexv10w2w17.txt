Dear Ira:

     This letter will confirm our discussions regarding the Net Worth
Appreciation Participation Agreements between yourself and each of the executive
officers of WCI and the Net Worth Appreciation Plan for Key Managers. Due to the
extraordinary market conditions, cumulative net income as described in paragraph
2 in the individual Net Worth Agreements and in the Net Worth Appreciation Plan
was suspended effective November 1, 2001. Effective August 1, 2002 this
provision will be reinstated. For our records, please sign below indicating your
agreement with the above.

                                           Sincerely,

                                           /S/   EDWARD R. CAINE
                                           -----------------------------

                                           Edward R. Caine
                                           President & CEO
