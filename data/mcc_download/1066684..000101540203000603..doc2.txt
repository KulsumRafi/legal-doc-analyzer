                       LOAN AND PURCHASE OPTION AGREEMENT


     This Loan and Purchase Option Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of
the  ___  day  of  February,  2003  by  and among theglobe.com, inc., a Delaware
corporation  ("Buyer"), [                    *                  ],  a  New  York
corporation  ("Company"), and [              *              ], individually, and
[              *              ], individually and as power of attorney on behalf
of  all  of  the  remaining  holders of all of the issued and outstanding common
stock  of  the  Company as set forth on Schedule A (collectively, the "Sellers",
and including [              *              ] as the "Sellers' Representative").
[              *              ]  and  [              *              ]  are
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Operating Sellers."

          WHEREAS, the Company currently owes the Buyer the sum of $40,000, plus
interest,  under  an  outstanding  bridge  loan dated December 12, 2002, and was
subsequently  loaned  an additional $40,000 on the same terms (collectively, the
"Bridge  Loan");

          WHEREAS,  the  Buyer  has  agreed  to  loan the Company the additional
amount  of  $80,000  (the  "Additional Amount"), which will result in an overall
loan  in  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $160,000;

          WHEREAS,  the parties wish to replace the Bridge Loan by consolidating
all  the money owed by the Company thereunder into this Agreement subject to and
upon  the  terms  and  conditions  herein  set  forth;  and

          WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Buyer to make the Operating Loan, the
Sellers  wish  to  grant  the  Buyer  the option to acquire all of the shares of
capital  stock  owned  by  them in the Company under the terms set forth in this
Agreement.

          NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  mutual  covenants  and
agreements  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  and  for  other  good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties  hereto  agree  as  follows:

     A.   The  Operating  Loan.
          --------------------

          1.  The  Operating  Loan  and  Funding.  Within  two  business days of
execution  of  this  Agreement,  the  Buyer  will  loan  Forty  Thousand Dollars
($40,000)  to  the Company pursuant to a loan commitment in the aggregate amount
of  One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) (inclusive of the Bridge Loan)
(the  "Operating  Loan").  Subject to compliance by the Company and Sellers with
the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  the  Buyer  agrees to fund the remaining Forty
Thousand  Dollars  ($40,000)  of  the  Operating  Loan  on  March  12, 2003. The


<PAGE>
Additional  Amount  of  the  Operating  Loan  will  be used solely for operating
expenses  incurred  on  and after the date of this Agreement. The Operating Loan
will  mature  on  December 12, 2003, with all outstanding principal and interest
being  due in one lump sum on such date except as provided in the next sentence.
If the Buyer elects not to exercise the Purchase Option (as defined below), then
(i)  the  Operating Loan will mature twelve months following the earlier of: (a)
notice  at any time from the Buyer that it is not exercising the Purchase Option
or  (b)  the  expiration  of the Purchase Option, with equal monthly payments of
principal  and  interest  being  made on a straight amortization basis, and (ii)
sixty  thousand  dollars  of  the  amount  of  the Operating Loan will be deemed
forgiven  (the "Forgiven Amount"); provided, however, if within one year of such
date  the  Company  obtains  financing  from  any unrelated third party the full
amount of the Operating Loan (including the Forgiven Amount) will be immediately
due  and  payable.  The Operating Loan shall be represented by a Promissory Note
(which  shall  subsume  and supercede the promissory note relating to the Bridge
Loan)  in  the  form  attached  hereto  as Exhibit A which shall be executed and
delivered  by  the  Company  concurrent with the execution of this Agreement.

          2.  Security  for the  Operating Loan.  As  security for the Company's
obligations  to  the  Buyer,  the  Company  does  hereby grant the Buyer a first
priority  security  interest in and to all of the tangible and intangible assets
of the Company, including without limitation, "goodwill", intellectual property,
and  the  Company's  contractual  rights  with  third  parties,  all  as further
described  in the Security Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Security
Agreement").  Buyer will share, on a pro rata basis, the above security interest
with  [              *              ]  ("[              *              ]") and [
*              ]  ("[              *              ]") to the extent of the first
priority  security  interest  that each of [              *              ] and [
*              ]  has  in  the  above  property.  The  Company shall execute and
deliver  the Security Agreement concurrently with this Agreement.  Such Security
Agreement  will  included  a  joinder  by  [              *              ] and [
*              ] pursuant to which they consent to such shared security interest
and  the  provisions  of  Paragraph  C.2  hereof.  The Company further agrees to
promptly execute and deliver all other documentation reasonably requested by the
Buyer to further reflect, implement and perfect the foregoing security interest.
This  Agreement,  the  Promissory  Note and the Security Agreement are sometimes
collectively  referred  to  herein  as  the  "Loan  Documents."

          3.  Accrued Compensation Subordination. The Sellers (together with the
persons  identified  on Schedule D.1 hereof, each of which shall contemporaneous
with this Agreement execute and deliver a Subordination Agreement in the form of
Exhibit  C)  agree  to  subordinate  and defer payment of all accrued and unpaid
compensation,  if  any,  owed  to  them  (approximately  Two Hundred Twenty Four
Thousand  and  Five Hundred Dollars ($224,500) as of the date of this Agreement)
for services rendered (the "Accrued Compensation") to repayment of the Operating
Loan  (including  the  Bridge  Loan)  except  as  provided in the next sentence.
Notwithstanding repayment of the Operating Loan, in the event of exercise of the
Purchase  Option,  the  Sellers  and  other  persons  whom  are  owed  Accrued
Compensation further agree that they shall be entitled to payment of the Accrued
Compensation  only  to  the extent so provided in Section 5 of the Subordination
Agreement.

          4.  Election  to  Increase  Funding.  At its discretion, the Buyer may
elect  to  increase the amount of funding under the Operating Loan on a month to
month basis on the same terms as outlined above, including without limitation as
to security and the subordination. The Company and the Sellers agree to promptly


                                        2
<PAGE>
execute and deliver all other documentation reasonably requested by the Buyer to
further reflect, implement and document any such increased funding.

          5.  Conditions  Precedent to Additional Funding. The obligation of the
Buyer  to  fund  the Additional Amount of the Operating Loan shall be subject to
satisfaction  of the following conditions precedent at the time of each funding:
(i)  all representations, warranties, covenants and statements made by or behalf
of  the Company or any Seller in any of the Loan Documents or the Stock Purchase
Agreement  (as  defined below and incorporated herein) shall be true and correct
in  all  material  respects; (ii) there shall not have been any material adverse
change  in  the  condition  (financial  or  otherwise),  operations,  assets,
liabilities  or  prospects  of  the  Company, as determined in Buyer's sole good
faith  discretion;  and  (iii)  there  shall  not  be  voluntary  or involuntary
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings pending relating to the Company or
any  of  its  assets; provided, however, in the event Buyer believes that either
clause  (i) or (ii) above is not satisfied, it will so notify the Company and to
the extent curable, will afford it a period of fifteen (15) days to satisfy such
condition  to  Buyer's  satisfaction (and during such notice and cure period any
obligation  of  the Buyer to fund will be suspended). If requested by the Buyer,
the  Company  agrees  to  promptly  supply it with a certification signed by its
President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  that, to the best of their respective
knowledge  and  belief,  all  such  conditions  are  satisfied.

     B.     The Purchase Option.  The Sellers hereby jointly and severally grant
            -------------------
to  the Buyer the option to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common  stock  (together  with  any  Common  Stock  Equivalents,  as hereinafter
defined)  (the  "Common  Stock") now or hereinafter owned by them (the "Purchase
Option").  The  Sellers represent and warrant that they are the owners of all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The Purchase Option shall be
exercisable by written notice from the Buyer to the Sellers' Representative (the
"Election  Notice") at any time on or before the later of (i) March 31, 2003 and
(ii)  ten (10) days following the date of Buyer's receipt of written notice from
the  Company  that [              *              ].  The closing of the exercise
of  the Purchase Option (the "Option Closing") shall occur at the offices of the
Buyer on the 10th  business day following receipt by the Sellers' Representative
of  the  Election  Notice.  At  the  Option  Closing, the Buyer shall (i) pay an
aggregate  of  Forty  Thousand  Dollars  ($40,000)  (the  "Cash  Payment")  in
immediately  available  funds  to  [              *              ]  as  complete
payment  for  the shares owned by [              *              ] (and its other
undertakings  pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement described below) and (ii)
issue  to the balance of the Sellers (excluding [              *              ])
an  aggregate  of  two million (2,000,000) shares of its common stock, $.001 par
value  per  share  (the  "globe.com Shares")(together with the Cash Payment, the
"Purchase  Price").  The  globe.com  Shares  will be unregistered and constitute
restricted  securities for purposes of federal securities laws and shall contain
restrictive  legends prohibiting the transfer of the globe.com Shares, except in
compliance  with  applicable  state  and federal securities laws.  The globe.com
Shares  will  be  issued  pro rata to the Sellers (other than to and taking into
account  the  exclusion  of  [              *              ]) in accordance with
their  respective  ownership  percentages as set forth on Schedule A and will be
entitled to "piggy back" registration rights in the manner set forth in Schedule
III  of the form of Stock Purchase Agreement referred to below.  When and if the
Purchase  Option  is  exercised,  the  Company  and the Sellers shall sell their
shares  of  the Common Stock to the Buyer pursuant to the form of Stock Purchase


                                        3
<PAGE>
Agreement  attached  hereto as Exhibit D, which the Company and Sellers covenant
and  agree  to execute and deliver to Buyer at the Option Closing, together with
stock  certificates or other Common Stock Equivalents with stock powers or other
appropriate  instruments  of  transfer duly executed in favor of the Buyer.  For
purposes  of this Agreement, the term "Common Stock Equivalents" means shares of
Common  Stock issuable upon (i) the exercise of outstanding options, warrants or
rights  to  subscribe for the Common Stock or (ii) the conversion of outstanding
shares  of  preferred  stock,  debt  or other convertible instruments, in either
case,  whether  or  not  then  currently  exercisable  or  convertible.

     C.  Other  Agreements.  In  connection  with  the  Purchase  Option and the
         -----------------
Operating  Loan  the  parties  agree  as  follows:

          1.  Employment  Agreements.  If  and  when  the  Purchase  Option  is
exercised,  [              *              ]  and [              *              ]
agree  to  enter  into  the  forms  of  employment  agreements  (the "Employment
Agreements") attached hereto as Exhibits E-1 and E-2, respectively, effective as
of  the  Option  Closing;

          2.  Loan Matters. [              *              ] and [           *
    ] hereby agree to share  on a pro rata basis with the Buyer their respective
security  interests  in  the  property of the Company.  In addition, the parties
hereby  acknowledge  and agree that the Company will pay the aggregate amount of
Eighty  Thousand  Dollars ($80,000) (which the Company and Sellers represent and
warrant  to  be  the  only  indebtedness for borrowed money owed by the Company,
other  than the Bridge Loan) upon the sooner of (i) the date on which the Option
Closing occurs and (ii) the original maturity dates of the loans (all at various
dates  in  the  third  and fourth quarter of 2004) to such parties.  The Company
covenants  not  to  prepay  the  loans  to  [              *              ] or
[          *          ]  except as set forth in the preceding sentence.
