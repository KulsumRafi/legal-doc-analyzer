outstanding voting securities of which shall at the time be owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by such Person or one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries
of such Person, or by such Person and one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of
such Person, or (ii) any partnership, association, joint venture or similar

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDIT

     2.1 Commitments; Reduction or Increase in Aggregate Commitment.

     This facility ("Facility") is a two year single draw unsecured term loan in
the maximum amount of the Aggregate Commitment. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Lenders severally agree to make a single
disbursement through the Administrative Agent to Borrower. This is not a
revolving credit facility and, except as provided in Section 3.3, any part of
the Loans repaid may not be reborrowed. The commitment to lend hereunder shall
expire on May 31, 2002.

     2.2 Final Principal Payment.

     Any outstanding Advances and all other unpaid Obligations shall be paid in
full by the Borrower on the Facility Termination Date.

     2.3 Ratable Loans.

     Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made from the several Lenders
ratably in proportion to their respective Percentages. The Advances may be
Floating Rate Advances or LIBOR Advances, or a combination thereof, selected by
the Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.9 and 2.10.

     2.4 Applicable Margins.

     Both the ABR Applicable Margin and the LIBOR Applicable Margin to be used
in calculating the interest rate applicable to different Types of Advances shall
vary from time to time in accordance with the higher of the then-applicable
Moody's debt rating and S&P's debt rating, as the case may be, for the long-term
unsecured debt of Chateau Parent, unless one of such two ratings is more than
one rating category lower than the other, in which case the average of the two
different Applicable Margins shall be used. The Applicable Margins shall be
adjusted effective on the next Business Day following any change in Chateau
Parent's Moody's debt rating and/or S&P's debt rating, as the case may be.
Borrower shall provide prompt notice to Administrative Agent of any rating
change and promptly upon receipt of such notice Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Lenders, but the determination of the Applicable

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Margin shall not be dependent on the giving of such notice. The applicable debt
ratings and the Applicable Margins are set forth in the following table:

* In basis points per annum.

In the event that either S&P or Moody's shall discontinue its ratings of the
REIT industry or Chateau Parent, Chateau Parent shall seek a debt rating from a
substitute rating agency reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
Chateau Parent (the "Substitute Rating Agency"). For the period from the date of
such discontinuance until the first to occur of (i) the date Chateau Parent
receives a debt rating from the Substitute Rating Agency or (ii) a date 180 days
after such discontinuance, the single rating from S&P or Moody's, as the case
may be, shall be used to determine the Applicable Margin. If the debt rating of
Chateau Parent from the Substitute Rating Agency is not received within such 180
day period, or if both S&P and Moody's shall discontinue their ratings of the
REIT industry or Chateau Parent at a time when Chateau Parent has not secured a
rating from a Substitute Rating Agency, the Applicable Margin to be used for the
calculation of interest on Advances hereunder shall be the highest Applicable
Margin for each Type.

     2.5 Other Fees.

     The Borrower agrees to pay all other fees payable to the Administrative
Agent and the Arranger pursuant to the Borrower's prior letter agreement with
the Administrative Agent and the Arranger dated March 15, 2002.

     2.6 Minimum Amount of Each Advance.

     Each Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples
of $500,000 if in excess thereof).

     2.7 Optional Principal Payments.

     The Borrower may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all or
any part of outstanding Floating Rate Advances without prior notice to the
Administrative Agent. A LIBOR Rate Advance may be paid on the last day of the
applicable Interest Period or, if and only if the Borrower pays any amounts due
to the Lenders under Sections 3.4 and 3.5 as a result of such prepayment, on a
day prior to such last day.

     2.8 Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for the Advance.

     The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") (i) not later
than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date of a Floating Rate Advance,
and (ii) not later than 11:00

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing Date for a
LIBOR Advance, specifying:

          (i)  the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
               Advance,

          (ii) the aggregate amount of such Advance,

          (iii) the Type of Advance selected; and

          (iv) in the case of a LIBOR Rate Advance, the Interest Period
               applicable thereto.

     The Administrative Agent shall give telephonic notice to the Lenders of the
contents of any Borrowing Notice (i) requesting a LIBOR Advance not later than
3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) three Business Days prior to the applicable Borrowing
Date or (ii) requesting a Floating Rate Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
Borrowing Date (or 4:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Business Day immediately
preceding such Borrowing Date for Floating Rate Advances requested prior to 3:00
p.m. (Chicago time) on such immediately preceding Business Day). The
Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of each Borrowing Notice to the
Lenders on or promptly after the Borrowing Date. The Administrative Agent shall
give facsimile notice to the other Lenders of the LIBOR Rate applicable to a
LIBOR Advance promptly after determination thereof two Business Days prior to
the Borrowing Date. Each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, in funds
immediately available in Chicago to the Administrative Agent at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII on Borrowing Date not later than (i) 11:00
a.m. (Chicago time), in the case of a Floating Rate Advance which have been
requested by a Borrowing Notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than
3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Borrowing Date, or (ii) noon (Chicago time) in the case of all other Advances.
The Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders
available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

     No LIBOR Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date and,
unless the Lenders otherwise agree in writing, in no event may there be more
than four (4) different Interest Periods for LIBOR Advances outstanding at any
one time.

     2.9 Conversion and Continuation of an Outstanding Advance.

     A Floating Rate Advance shall continue as a Floating Rate Advance unless
and until such Floating Rate Advance is converted into a LIBOR Rate Advance. A
LIBOR Rate Advance shall continue as a LIBOR Rate Advance until the end of the
then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such LIBOR Rate Advance
shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless the
Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation
Notice requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such LIBOR Rate
Advance either continue as a LIBOR Rate Advance for the same or another Interest
Period or be converted to an Advance of another Type. Subject to the terms of
Section 2.7, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part
of an Advance of any Type into any other Type or Types of Advances; provided
that any conversion of any LIBOR Rate Advance shall be made on, and only on, the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or, if and only if the
Borrower pays any amounts due to the Lenders under Sections 3.4 and 3.5 as a
result of such conversion on a day prior to such last day. The Borrower shall
give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation
Notice") of each conversion of the Advance to a LIBOR Rate Advance or
continuation of a LIBOR Rate Advance

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to
the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

          (i) the requested date which shall be a Business Day, of such
     conversion or continuation;

          (ii) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
     converted or continued; and

          (iii) the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such Advance is
     to be converted or continued and, in the case of a conversion into or
     continuation of a LIBOR Rate Advance, the duration of the Interest Period
     applicable thereto.

     2.10 Changes in Interest Rate, Etc.

     A Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or
is converted from a LIBOR Rate Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.9 to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a
LIBOR Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to
the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion
of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each LIBOR Rate
Advance shall bear interest from and including the first day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest
Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such LIBOR Rate Advance.

     2.11 Rates Applicable After Default.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9,
during the continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default the Required Lenders
may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at
the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a LIBOR
Rate Advance. During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at
their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the
option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that (i) a LIBOR Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of
the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest
Period plus 2% per annum, and (ii) a Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate otherwise applicable to the
Floating Rate Advance plus 2% per annum.

     2.12 Method of Payment.

          (i) All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without
     setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the
     Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's address specified
     pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the
     Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to
     the Borrower, by noon (Chicago time) on the date when due and shall be
     applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders, except as
     otherwise expressly provided herein.

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

          (ii) Except as may be provided elsewhere herein, all Lenders'
     interests in the Advance and the Loan Documents shall be ratable undivided
     interests and none of such Lenders' interests shall have priority over the
     others. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account
     of any Lender or amount to be applied or paid by the Administrative Agent
     to any Lender shall be paid promptly (on the same day as received by the
     Administrative Agent if received prior to noon (Chicago time) on such day
     and otherwise on the next Business Day) by the Administrative Agent to such
     Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at
     its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending
     Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent
     from such Lender. Payments received by the Administrative Agent but not
     timely funded to the Lenders shall bear interest payable by the
     Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date due
     until the date paid. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to
     charge the account of the Borrower maintained with Bank One for each
     payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

     2.13 Notes; Telephonic Notices.

     Each Lender is hereby authorized to record the principal amount of each of
its Loans and each repayment on the schedule attached to its Note, provided,
however, that the failure to so record shall not affect the Borrower's
obligations under such Note. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue the Advance, effect
selections of the Types of Advance and to transfer funds based on telephonic
notices made by any Authorized Officer. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly
to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation of each telephonic notice
signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any
material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

     2.14 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.

     Interest accrued on a Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on the first
day of each calendar month. Interest accrued on any LIBOR Advance shall be
payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which
the LIBOR Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity, Interest accrued on each LIBOR Advance having a LIBOR Interest Period
longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each
three-month interval during such LIBOR Interest Period. Interest shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest
shall be payable for the day the Advance is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at
the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on the Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.

     2.15 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.

     Promptly after receipt thereof and within any specific time periods
established herein, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender by
facsimile of the contents of each Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation
Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent
will notify by facsimile each Lender of the interest rate applicable to a

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

LIBOR Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will
give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

     2.16 Lending Installations.

     Subject to Section 3.5, each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation
from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending
Installation and the Loans, and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender
for the benefit of such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written or
telex notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending
Installation through which Loans will be made and for whose account Loan
payments are to be made.

     2.17 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

     Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the
Administrative Agent prior to the time at which it is scheduled to make payment
to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a
Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or
fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does
not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in
reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may
be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient
of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the
Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon
in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was
so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative
Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of
payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in
the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the
relevant Loan. If such Lender so repays such amount and interest thereon to the
Administrative Agent within one Business Day after such demand, all interest
accruing on the Loan not funded by such Lender during such period shall be
payable to such Lender when received from the Borrower.

     2.18 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.

     The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender which (a) is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax pursuant to Section 3.5, or (b) cannot maintain its
LIBOR Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Installation pursuant to Section 3.3,
with a replacement bank or other financial institution; provided that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any applicable legal or regulatory
requirements affecting the remaining Lenders, (ii) no Default or (after notice
thereof to Borrower) no Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing
at the time of such replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall repay (or the
replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other
amounts owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (iv) the
Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Sections 3.4 and 3.6 if
any LIBOR Rate Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be prepaid (or
purchased) other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto,
(v) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender, and the terms
and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, (vi) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such
replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3 (provided that the
Borrower

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

shall be obligated to pay the processing fee referred to therein), (vii) until
such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall continue
to pay all amounts payable hereunder without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or
withholding and (viii) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any rights which the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender
shall have against the replaced Lender.

     2.19 Application of Moneys Received.

     All moneys collected or received by the Administrative Agent on account of
the Facility directly or indirectly, shall be applied in the following order of
priority:

          (i)  to the payment of all reasonable costs incurred in the collection
               of such moneys of which the Administrative Agent shall have given
               notice to the Borrower;

          (ii) to the reimbursement of any yield protection due to any of the
               Lenders in accordance with Section 3.1;

          (iii) to the payment of all fees to the Administrative Agent, if then
               due;

          (iv) first to interest until paid in full and then to principal for
               all Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders) if a Default exists,
               in accordance with the respective Funded Percentages of the
               Lenders;

          (v)  any other sums due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
               under any of the Loan Documents;

          (vi) to the payment of all amounts due to Defaulting Lenders; and

          (vii) any remaining amount to Borrower.

     2.20 Usury.

     (a) This Agreement and each Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject any Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If by the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, Borrower is at
any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due
hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the interest rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to any Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under its
Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

     3.1 Yield Protection.

     If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any law or any
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or
directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

          (i)  subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any
               Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than
               with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its
               LIBOR Loan or participations therein, or

          (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment,
               insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against
               assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
               extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
               (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in
               determining the interest rate applicable to a LIBOR Advance), or

          (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
               the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
               making, funding or maintaining its LIBOR Loan, or reduces any
               amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending
               Installation in connection with its LIBOR Loan or participations
               therein, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending
               Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the
               amount of its LIBOR Loan or participations therein held or
               interest, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation, of making or maintaining its LIBOR Loan or to
reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in
connection with such LIBOR Loan, or participations therein, then, within 30 days
of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction in amount received.

     3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.

     If a Lender in good faith determines the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a
Change (as hereinafter defined), then, within 30 days of demand by such Lender,
the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any
shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which
such Lender in good faith determines is attributable to this Agreement, its
outstanding Loan or its obligation to make a Loan hereunder (after taking into
account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any
change after the date of this Agreement in the

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) any adoption of
or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation
or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means
(i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date
of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding
capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United
States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any
amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3 Availability of Types of Advances.

     If any Lender in good faith determines that maintenance of any of its LIBOR
Rate Loan at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law,
rule, regulation or directive, whether or not having the force of law, the
Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance and require any LIBOR Rate Advance of the affected Type to be repaid; or
if the Required Lenders in good faith determine that (i) deposits of a type or
maturity appropriate to match fund a LIBOR Rate Advance are not available, the
Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance with respect to any LIBOR Rate Advance made after the date of any such
determination, or (ii) an interest rate applicable to a Type of Advance does not
accurately reflect the cost of making a LIBOR Rate Advance of such Type, then,
if for any reason whatsoever the provisions of Section 3.1 are inapplicable, the
Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance with respect to any LIBOR Rate Advance made after the date of any such
determination. If the Borrower is required to so repay a LIBOR Rate Advance, the
Borrower may concurrently with such repayment borrow from the Lenders, in the
amount of such repayment, a Loan bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

     3.4 Funding Indemnification.

     If any payment of a LIBOR Rate Advance occurs on a date which is not the
last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration,
prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBOR Rate Advance is not made on the date
specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders or as
a result of unavailability pursuant to Section 3.3, the Borrower will indemnify
each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including,
without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits
acquired to fund or maintain a LIBOR Rate Advance and shall pay all such losses
or costs within fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor.

     3.5 Taxes.

          (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Lender
     or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free
     and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower
     shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
     payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum
     payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
     deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
     under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the
     case may

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

     be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
     deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) the
     Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in
     accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish to the
     Administrative Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment
     thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

          (ii) In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
     future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
     charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
     under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with
     respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

          (iii) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent
     and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,
     without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable
     under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and
     any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
     therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification
     shall be made within 30 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such
     Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

          (iv) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
     States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees that
     it will, not more than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
     (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly
     completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
     W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
     payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
     United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the
     Borrower and the Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form
     W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an
     exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender
     further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any
     successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes
     obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in
     the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
     amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
     Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding
     sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments
     under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States
     federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any
     change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on
     which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such
     forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing
     and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such
     Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not
     capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of
     United States federal income tax.

          (v) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
     provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (d), above
     (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or
     any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
     governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
     originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
     entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes
     imposed by the United States.

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

          (vi) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
     withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
     pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
     deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
     time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
     executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
     payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate following
     receipt of such documentation.

          (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
     authority of the United States or any other country or any political
     subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not
     properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
     (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed,
     because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change
     in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective,
     or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative
     Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
     Administrative Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including
     penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
     amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, together
     with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and
     time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may
     be employees of the Administrative Agent). The obligations of the Lenders
     under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations
     and termination of this Agreement.

     3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.

     To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate
Lending Installation with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loan to reduce any liability
of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the
unavailability of a LIBOR Rate Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such
designation is not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous
to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to
the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if
any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth
in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such
amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence
of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its LIBOR Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
LIBOR Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.
Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement
of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such
written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this
Agreement.

partnership interest in, CCF Financing Partnership.

     5.4  Authorization and Validity.

     The Borrower has the power and authority and legal right to execute and
deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The
execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance
of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper proceedings,
and the Loan Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and general principles
of equity.

     5.5  No Conflict; Government Consent.

     Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents,
nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance
with the provisions thereof will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or the General Partners or the partnership agreement, articles of
incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents, as the case may be,
of such entities, or the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to
which the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any General Partner is a party or
is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, except where such violation, conflict or
default would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary
or a General Partner pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or
agreement. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization, or validation
of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, any governmental
or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of any of the Loan
Documents other than the filing of a copy of this Agreement, or the filing of

     5.6  Financial Statements; Material Adverse Change.

     All consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with GAAP in
effect on the preparation date of such statements and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and operations of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their
operations for the period then ended, subject, in the case of interim financial
statements, to normal and customary year-end adjustments. From the preparation
date of the most recent financial statements delivered to the Lenders through
the Agreement Execution Date, there was no change in the business, Property, or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

     5.7  Taxes.

     The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States federal tax
returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid
all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries except such taxes, if any, as are being
contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. No
tax liens have been filed and remain outstanding. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

     5.8  Litigation and Guarantee Obligations.

     Except as set forth on Schedule 3 hereto or as set forth in written notice
to the Administrative Agent from time to time, there is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has no material contingent obligations not
provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 6.1
or as set forth in written notices to the Administrative Agent given from time
to time after the Agreement Execution Date on or about the date such material
contingent obligations are incurred.

     5.9  Subsidiaries.

     Schedule 1 hereto contains, as of the Agreement Execution Date, an accurate
list of all of the presently existing Subsidiaries of the Borrower, setting
forth their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the percentage of
their respective equity securities owned by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of equity securities of such
Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable.

     5.10 ERISA.

     The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans as of the Agreement
Execution Date do not in the aggregate exceed $1,000,000 or, subsequent to the
Agreement Execution Date, exceed in the aggregate an amount which could have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the
Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any
withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans in excess of $250,000 in the
aggregate as of the Agreement Execution Date, or subsequent to the Agreement
Execution Date, exceed in the aggregate an amount which could have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) complies in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations (other
than those the failure with which to comply would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect), no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan
(other than a Multiemployer Plan), neither the Borrower nor any other members of
the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan or initiated
steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any
Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     5.11 Accuracy of Information.

     All factual information heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on
behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby is, and all other such

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

factual information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or any Lender will be, to the
knowledge of Borrower, true and accurate (taken as a whole) in all material
respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified and not
incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such
information (taken as a whole) not misleading in light of the circumstances and
purposes for which such information was provided at such time.

     5.12 Regulation U.

     The Borrower has not used the proceeds of any Advance to buy or carry any
margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) in violation of the terms of this
Agreement.

     5.13 Material Agreements.

     Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or
instrument or subject to any charter or other corporate restriction which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment
of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i) any
agreement to which it is a party, which default could have a Material Adverse
Effect, or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing
Indebtedness, which default would constitute a Default hereunder.

     5.14 Compliance With Laws.

     The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign
government or any instrumentality or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over
the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective
Property, except for any non-compliance which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the
effect that its operations are not in material compliance with any of the
requirements of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and
safety statutes and regulations or the subject of any federal or state
investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a
release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, which
non-compliance or remedial action could have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.15 Ownership of Properties.

     Except as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto, on the date of this Agreement,
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good and marketable (or the
equivalent) title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15,
to all of the Property and assets reflected in the financial statements as owned
by it.

     5.16 Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions.

     The Borrower is not an entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the
meaning of 29 C.F.R. (S) 2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code), and, assuming that no Lender's assets

its Subsidiaries or either General Partner to be due and payable or required to
be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled payment) prior to the stated

     7.7 The Borrower, either General Partner or any Subsidiary having a Market

notification), exceeds $2,000,000 or requires payments exceeding $1,000,000 per
annum.

     7.11 The Borrower or any other member of the Controlled Group shall have
been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of Title IV
of ERISA, if as a result of such reorganization or termination the aggregate

governmental order, after all administrative hearings and appeals have been
concluded (or within a reasonable time in light of the nature of the problem if

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

     8.1 Acceleration.

     If any Default described in Section 7.7 or 7.8 occurs with respect to the
Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder shall
automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately become due and
payable without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders, at any time
prior to the date that such Default has been fully cured, may terminate or
suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder or declare the
Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall
become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

     If after acceleration of the maturity of the obligations or termination of
the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans as result of any Default (other
than any Default as described in Section 7.7 or 7.8 with respect to the
Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the obligations
due shall have been obtained or entered, all of the Lenders (in their sole
discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the
Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.

     8.2 Amendments.

     Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII the Required Lenders (or the
Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and
the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of
adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any
manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
covenant, Unmatured Default, or Default hereunder; provided, however, that no
such supplemental agreement or waiver shall, without the consent of all Lenders:

          (i)  Extend the Facility Termination Date or forgive all or any
               portion of the principal amount of the Loan or accrued interest
               thereof, reduce the Applicable Margins (or modify any definition
               herein which would have the effect of reducing the Applicable
               Margins, or the underlying interest rate options or extend the
               time of payment of any such principal, interest or fees.

          (ii) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
               Lenders or release any Subsidiary Guaranty.

          (iii) Increase the Aggregate Commitment.

          (iv) Permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement.

          (v)  Amend Sections 2.3, 2.13(ii), 8.1, 8.2 or 11.2.

          (vi) Release the General Partners from any liability under the Loan
               Documents.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative
Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative
Agent.

     8.3 Preservation of Rights.

     No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to exercise
any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of the
Advance notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of the
Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Advance shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have
been paid in full.

Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and supersede all prior
commitments, agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof.

     9.6 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.

     The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not
joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the
extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The
failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not
relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement
shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and
assigns.

     9.7 Expenses; Indemnification.

     The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and Arranger for any
costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including, without

against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable expenses of litigation
or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender is
a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Projects, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder, except to the
extent that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

     9.8 Numbers of Documents.

that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all
Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

     9.11 Nonliability of Lenders.

     The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent, on the other, shall be solely that of borrower and
lender. Neither the Administrative Agent, Arranger nor any Lender shall have any
fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Administrative Agent,
Arranger nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review
or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the
Borrower's business or operations.

     9.12 CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     10.1 Appointment.

     Bank One, NA is hereby appointed Administrative Agent hereunder and under
each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender. The Administrative
Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions contained in this
Article X. The Administrative Agent shall not have a fiduciary relationship in
respect of the Borrower or any Lender by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Administrative Agent," it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any
fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the
contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its
capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Administrative Agent
(i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a
"representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of Section 9-102 of the
Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the
rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to
assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any
other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each
Lender hereby waives.

     10.2 Powers.

     The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. The Administrative

                                      -52-

Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall endeavor to administer this Agreement in the same manner and with
the same standard of care as it administers similar agreements for its own
account.

     10.3 General Immunity.

     Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents
or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender for (i)
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (ii) any determination by
the Administrative Agent that compliance with any law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) requires the Advances and Commitments
hereunder to be classified as being part of a "highly leveraged transaction".
The foregoing shall not limit the liability of the Administrative Agent for a
breach of its express obligations and undertakings to the Lenders hereunder
which continues after written notice to the Administrative Agent of such breach
and its failure to cure such breach within a reasonable time after such notice.

     10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.

     Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents
or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire
into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection
with any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan
Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish
information directly to each Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition
specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
therewith. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not
required to be furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such
time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
(either in its capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Administrative Agent shall make
available promptly after the Agreement Execution Date to any Lender copies of
all Loan Documents in its possession which are requested by any such Lender.
Administrative Agent shall also furnish to all Lenders promptly after such items
are available in final form copies of Default notices issued to the Borrower,
amendments to any Loan Documents being proposed by the Administrative Agent or
the Borrower, financial statements of the Borrower required hereunder,
compliance certificates from the Borrower required by this Agreement or any
other notice or communication from the Borrower specifically relating to this
Agreement which is actually received by the Administrative Agent. Promptly after
the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge of the occurrence of a Default
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Lenders.

     10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders.

     To the extent that the Administrative Agent is authorized hereunder to
request additional information from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall
do so at the request of any Lender unless the Administrative Agent deems such
request to be duplicative of other requests or

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

unreasonably burdensome on the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in so
acting, or refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document
in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders or all of
the Lenders, as the case may be, and such instructions and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant to such written instructions shall be binding on all of
the Lenders and on all holders of Notes and on the Administrative Agent.

     10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel.

     The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative
Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees,
agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except
as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the
default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it
with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its
duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

     10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel.

     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of
counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of
the Administrative Agent.

     10.8 Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.

     The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent
ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to
reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement of the Loan Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in
connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the
enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided
that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct or a breach of the
Administrative Agent's express obligations and undertakings to the Lenders which
is not cured after written notice and within the period described in Section
10.3. To the extent any amounts so paid by Lenders are thereafter recovered by
the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or otherwise, such recovered amount
shall be remitted to the Lenders making such payment on a pro rata basis in
accordance with their respective portions of such payment. The obligations of
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     10.9 Rights as a Lender.

     In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless
the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend
money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other
transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the
Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any
other Person. The Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, is not
obligated to remain a Lender but if the Administrative Agent is no longer a
Lender, the Administrative Agent shall resign and a successor shall be appointed
as described in Section 10.11. The rights and duties of the Administrative Agent
are separate from its rights and duties as a Lender and no transfer of all or
any part of the Administrative Agent's Commitment or its interest as a Lender in
the Loans hereunder shall be deemed to transfer any of its rights and duties as
Administrative Agent to its successor or successors as a Lender.

     10.10 Lender Credit Decision.

     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial
statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.11 Successor Administrative Agent.

     The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective upon
the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. Bank One (or any
successor Administrative Agent) may be removed as Administrative Agent by
written notice received by Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders (i) at
any time with cause (i.e., a breach by Bank One (or any successor Administrative
Agent) of its duties as Administrative Agent hereunder), and (ii) without cause
if Bank One (or any successor Administrative Agent) holds less than 16% of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans hereunder. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint,
after consultation with the Borrower, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders,
a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the
resigning Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then
the resigning or removed Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties
of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments
in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other
purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative
Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent
shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least
$100,000,000, and sophisticated in administration of similar credits. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

     10.12 Delegation to Affiliates.

     The Borrower and the Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent may
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any
such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees)
which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the
same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to
which the Administrative Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

     11.1 Setoff.

     In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under
applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any
Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether
provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to or for the credit or
account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the
Obligations owing to such Lender at any time prior to the date that such Default
has been fully cured, whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall
then be due.

     11.2 Ratable Payments.

     If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it
(other than payments received pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater
proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly
upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loan held by the other Lenders so that
after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of the Loan. If
any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject
to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its
Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees,
promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share
in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their respective
Funded Percentages. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or
otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

     12.1 Successors and Assigns.

     The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns, except that

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

(i) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations
under the Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in
compliance with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any
Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and its Notes to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no
such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations
hereunder. The Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such payee complies with
Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other
transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative
Agent. Any assignee or transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be
bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of
any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

     12.2 Participations.

          12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
     course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
     sell to one or more banks, financial institutions, pension funds, or any
     other funds or entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
     Loans owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of
     such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.
     In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
     Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
     remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
     parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall
     remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes under the Loan
     Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall
     be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests,
     and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely
     and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
     obligations under the Loan Documents.

          12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver which forgives principal, interest or
     fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan
     or extends the final maturity of the Facility; postpones any date fixed for
     any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on,
     any Loan, or releases any guarantor of such Loan.

          12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
     which has previously advised the Borrower in writing of its purchase of a
     participation in a Lender's interest in its Loans shall be deemed to have
     the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its
     participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the
     same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
     directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents. Each Lender shall
     retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the
     amount of participating interests sold to each Participant, provided that
     such Lender and Participant may not each setoff amounts against the same
     portion of the Obligations, so as to collect the same amount from the
     Borrower twice. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each
     Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1,
     agrees to share with each

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

     Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
     setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if
     each Participant were a Lender.

     12.3 Assignments.

          12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course
     of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
     to any of such Lender's affiliates or to one or more banks, financial
     institutions or pension funds, or with the prior approval of the Borrower,
     which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except Borrower's
     consent shall not be required following the occurrence of a Default), any
     other entity ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations
     under the Loan Documents. Each such assignment shall (unless each of the
     Borrower and Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in the amount not
     less than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining principal
     amount of the Loans due to the assigning Lender (calculated as of the date
     of such assignment). Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
     Exhibit D hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties
     thereto. The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to
     an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a
     Lender or an Affiliate thereof. Such consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld.

          12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative
     Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as
     Exhibit I to Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any
     consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee by
     the assignor or assignee to the Administrative Agent for processing such
     assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date
     specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall
     contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
     consideration used to make the purchase of the Loans under the applicable
     assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the
     rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will
     not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
     assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
     Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall
     have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents,
     to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further
     consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent
     shall be required to release the transferor Lender, and the transferor
     Lender shall automatically be released on the effective date of such
     assignment, with respect to the percentage of the Loans assigned to such
     Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant
     to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and
     the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes
     are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate,
     replacement Notes are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal
     amounts reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such
     assignment.

     12.4 Dissemination of Information.

     The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or
Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by
operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and
all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, subject to Section 12.6.

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

     12.5 Tax Treatment.

     If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which
is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or
any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the
provisions of Section 3.5.

     12.6 Confidentiality.

     The Administrative Agent and Lenders agree to take normal and reasonable
precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all
non-public information provided to them by the Borrower or by any other Person
on the Borrower's behalf in connection with the Loan Documents and agree and
undertake that neither they nor any of their Affiliates shall disclose any such
information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms
contemplated by the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent and each Lender may
disclose such information (1) at the request of any regulatory authority with
jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders or in connection
with an examination of such Person by any such authority, (2) pursuant to
subpoena or other process of a court having jurisdiction over the Administrative
Agent and/or the Lenders, (3) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable law, (4) at the express direction of any other
governmental authority, with jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent and/or
the Lenders, of any State of the United States of America or of any other
jurisdiction in which such Person conducts its business, (5) to such Person's
independent auditors, attorneys and other professional advisors, (6) if such
information has become public other than through disclosure by such Person or
any Lender, (7) in connection with any litigation involving such Person, and (8)
to any Affiliate of such Person which agrees to be bound by this Section 12.6.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower authorizes each of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender to disclose to any prospective or actual
Transferee such financial and other information in its possession (i) which has
been delivered to such Person pursuant to the Loan Documents or which has been
delivered to such Person by the Borrower prior to entering into the Loan
Documents, or (ii) which is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of
this Agreement and the Loan Documents; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by
the Borrower, such Transferee shall agree to keep such information confidential
to the same extent required to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as
applicable, hereunder.

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may

                 FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (TERM LOAN)

     This First Amendment to Credit Agreement (this "Amendment") is made as of
this 31st day of December, 2002 by and among CP Limited Partnership, a Maryland
limited partnership ("the Borrower"), Bank One, NA, having its principal office
in Chicago, Illinois and the several banks, financial institutions and other
entities from time to time parties to this Agreement (the "Lenders"), and Bank
One, NA, not individually, but as "Administrative Agent".

                                    RECITALS

     A. Borrower, Administrative Agent, and the Lenders are parties to a Credit
Agreement (Term Loan) dated as of May 28, 2002, (the "Credit Agreement"). All
capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings described as such terms in the Credit Agreement.

     B. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders made
available a term loan of $125,000,000 to the Borrower.

     C. Borrower has requested a change in certain terms contained in the Credit
Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   AMENDMENTS

          14.1.1 The foregoing recitals to this Amendment are incorporated into
     and made part of this Amendment.

          14.1.2 Article I of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding
     the following definitions:

     "Borrower's Moody's Rating" means the rating assigned by Moody's to
Borrower's long term unsecured debt.

     "Borrower's S&P Rating" means the rating assigned by S&P to Borrower's long
term unsecured debt.

     "Level I Status" exists at any date if, the Leverage Ratio is less than
35%, and the Borrower' Moody's Rating is Baa1 or better, and the Borrower's S&P
Rating is BBB+ or better.

     "Level II Status" exists at any date if, (i) the Borrower has not qualified
for Level I Status and (ii) the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 45% and
the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa2 or better and the Borrower's S&P Rating is
BBB or better.

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

     "Level III Status" exists at any date if (i) the Borrower has not qualified
for Level I Status or Level II Status and (ii) the Leverage Ratio is less than
or equal to 50% and the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa3 and the Borrower's S&P
Rating is BBB- or better.

     "Level IV Status" exists at any date if the Borrower has not qualified for
Level I Status, Level II Status or Level III Status and (ii) the Leverage Ratio
is less than or equal to 55% and the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa3 or and
the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB- or better.

     "Level V Status" exists at any date if the Borrower has not qualified for
Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status or Level IV Status.

     "Leverage Ratio" means, as of any date of calculation, the ratio of (i)
Consolidated Outstanding Indebtedness outstanding on such date to (ii)
Consolidated Market Value, expressed as a percentage.

     "Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status,
Level IV Status or Level V Status.

          14.1.3 Article I of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by amending
     the existing LIBOR Interest Period definition by adding the following at
     the end of such definition:

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may not select a LIBOR Interest
     Period of longer than three months until such time as the outstanding
     principal balance of Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement is
     $90,000,000 or less.

          14.1.4 Section 2.4 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the existing terms and shall be restated as follows:

     Both the ABR Applicable Margin and the LIBOR Applicable Margin to be used
in calculating the interest rate applicable to different Types of Advances shall
vary from time to time in accordance with the then applicable Status. The
Applicable Margins shall be adjusted effective on the next Business Day
following any change in the applicable Status. Borrower shall provide prompt
notice to Administrative Agent of any Status or rating change and promptly upon
receipt of such notice Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders,
but the determination of the Applicable Margin shall not be dependent on the
giving of such notice. The Applicable Margins are set forth in the following
table:

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

                   LIBOR Applicable Margin   ABR Applicable Margin
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Level I Status             1.10%                    0.10%
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level II Status             1.20%                    0.20%
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level III Status            1.40%                    0.40%
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level IV Status             1.55%                    0.55%
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Level V Status             1.75%                    0.75%
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event that either S&P or Moody's shall discontinue its ratings of the
REIT industry or Borrower, Borrower shall seek a debt rating from a substitute
rating agency reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and Borrower
(the "Substitute Rating Agency"). For the period from the date of such
discontinuance until the first to occur of (i) the date Borrower receives a debt
rating from the Substitute Rating Agency or (ii) a date 180 days after such
discontinuance, the single rating from S&P or Moody's, as the case may be, shall
be used to determine the ratings component of the Status determination. If the
debt rating of Borrower from the Substitute Rating Agency is not received within
such 180 day period, or if both S&P and Moody's shall discontinue their ratings
of the REIT industry or Borrower at a time when Borrower has not secured a
rating from a Substitute Rating Agency, the Applicable Margin to be used for the
calculation of interest on Advances hereunder shall be the highest Applicable
Margin for each Type shown above.

          14.1.5 Section 6.20(i) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the existing terms and shall be restated as follows:

          Consolidated Outstanding Indebtedness divided by Consolidated Market
          Value (expressed as a percentage), based on reported results for the
          most recent full fiscal quarter, to exceed (i) fifty-nine percent
          (59%) for the quarters ending on or before September 30, 2003, (ii)
          fifty-seven percent (57%) for the quarters ending after September 30,
          2003 and on or before March 31, 2004 and (iii) fifty percent (55%) for
          quarters ending thereafter.

          14.1.6 Section 6.20(iii) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the existing terms and shall be restated as follows:

          The Value of Unencumbered Assets to be less than (i) 1.65 times the
          Consolidated Senior Unsecured Indebtedness for quarters ending on or
          before September 30, 2003, (ii) 1.75 times the Consolidated Senior
          Unsecured Indebtedness for the quarters ending after September 30,
          2003 and on or before March 31, 2004 and (iii) 1.85 times Consolidated
          Senior Unsecured Indebtedness for the quarters ending thereafter;

          14.1.7 Section 6.20(iv) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the existing terms and shall be restated as follows:

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

          EBITA to be less than (i) 1.65 times the Consolidated Debt Service for
          quarters ending on or before September 30, 2003, (ii) 1.75 times
          Consolidated Debt Service for the quarters ending after September 30,
          2003 and on or before March 31, 2004 and (iii) 1.85 times Consolidated
          Debt Service for the quarters ending thereafter;

          14.1.8 Section 6.24 of the Credit Agreement shall be added to read as
     follows:

          6.24 Common Stock Repurchase

          The Borrower will not, nor will it permit Chateau Parent or any of
          their Subsidiaries to repurchase any common stock of the Chateau
          Parent if (i) the Consolidated Outstanding Indebtedness divided by
          Consolidated Market Value (expressed as a percentage), based on
          reported results for the most recent full fiscal quarter, shall exceed
          fifty percent (50%) for the prior quarter preceding any such purchase,
          or (ii) if, as a result of such repurchase of common stock of the
          Chateau Parent, the Consolidated Outstanding Indebtedness divided by
          Consolidated Market Value (expressed as a percentage), shall exceed
          fifty percent (50%).

          14.1.9 Section 6.25 of the Credit Agreement shall be added to read as
     follows:

          6.25 Commitment Reductions and Mandatory Debt Repayment:

               Commencing at such time as the bond payments referenced in
               Section 6.22(a) in the Third Amended and Restated Credit
               Agreement (Revolver) have been made, Borrower will, and will
               cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use one hundred percent (100%)
               of net proceeds from the sale of any Project, the sale of any
               other assets, or the proceeds derived from the issuance of equity
               in Borrower, or any Subsidiary, to repay a portion of the then
               outstanding Obligations of the Borrower under the Credit
               Agreement, until the outstanding principal balance of Loans
               outstanding under the Credit Agreement is reduced from
               $125,000,000 to $90,000,000. In order to minimize any breakage
               costs in connection with LIBOR Advances, Borrower may make the
               payments required hereunder as applicable LIBOR Interest Periods
               expire following the occurrence of each applicable sale.

          14.1.10 Borrower hereby agrees that as compensation for approval of
     this Amendment, each Lender that approves this Amendment on or before
     January 10, 2003 shall be paid a fee equal to 0.10% of such Lender's
     Commitment (the "Amendment Fee") by Borrower prior to this Amendment
     becoming effective.

          14.1.11 Borrower hereby represents and warrants that:

          (a)  no Default or Unmatured Default will exist under the Loan
               Documents as of the effective date of this Amendment;

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

          (b)  the Loan Documents are in full force and effect and Borrower has
               no defenses or offsets to, or claims or counterclaims relating
               to, its obligations under the Loan Documents;

          (c)  there has been no material adverse change in the financial
               condition of Borrower as shown in its September 30, 2002
               financial statements;

          (d)  Borrower has full power and authority to execute this Amendment
               and no consents are required for such execution other than any
               consents which have already been obtained; and

          (e)  all representations and warranties contained in Article 5 of the
               Credit Agreement are true and correct as of the date hereof and
               all references therein to "the date of this Agreement" shall
               refer to "the date of this Amendment."

          14.1.12 Except as specifically modified hereby, the Credit Agreement
     is and remains unmodified and in full force and effect and is hereby
     ratified and confirmed. All references in the Loan Documents to the "Credit
     Agreement" or the "Revolving Credit Agreement" henceforth shall be deemed
     to refer to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

          14.1.13 This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts,
     all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the
     parties hereto may execute this Amendment by signing any such counterpart.
     This Amendment shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws (and
     not the law of conflicts) of the State of Illinois, but giving effect to
     federal laws applicable to national banks.

          14.1.14 This Amendment shall become effective when it is executed by
     Borrower, Administrative Agent, and the Required Lenders, and the Amendment
     Fee has been paid.

                      [Balance of Page Intentionally Blank]
