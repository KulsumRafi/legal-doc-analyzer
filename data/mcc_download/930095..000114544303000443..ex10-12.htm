provided in this Section, Sublessor shall not be subject to any liability for
such failure, the Expiration Date shall not be extended by the delay, and the
validity of this Sublease shall not be impaired, but Rent shall abate until

immediately thereafter deliver possession of the Quality Control Laboratory, the
adjacent wet chemistry area and the laboratory along the east side of the

Sublessee shall have the right to occupy the Initial Premises for set-up
purposes and/or for purposes of beneficial occupancy during the period ending
December 31, 2002 without payment of Rent. If for any reason Sublessor has not
delivered possession of the Initial Premises to Sublessee on or before February
28, 2003, then at any time thereafter and before delivery of possession of the
Initial Premises to Sublessee, Sublessee may give written notice to Sublessor of
Sublessee&#146;s intention to cancel this Sublease. Said notice shall set forth
an effective date for such cancellation which shall be at least ten (10) days
after delivery of said notice to Sublessor. If Sublessor delivers possession of
the Initial Premises to Sublessee on or before such effective date, this
Sublease shall remain in full force and effect. If Sublessor fails to deliver
possession of the Initial Premises to Sublessee on or before such effective
date, this Sublease shall be canceled, in which case all consideration
previously paid by Sublessee to Sublessor on account of this Sublease shall be
returned to Sublessee, this Sublease shall thereafter be of no further force or
effect, and Sublessor shall have no further liability to Sublessee on account of
such delay or cancellation. Sublessor and Sublessee shall both be entitled to
use the glass wash area and the media prep area as shown on <U>Exhibit D</U>
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference until exclusive possession

Rent the expenses of operating the building and/or project of which the Premises are a
part (&#147;Operating Expenses&#148;), including without limitation, taxes, assessments,
insurance premiums, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses and other expenses, all as

for the payment by Sublessor of Operating Expenses on the basis of an estimate thereof,
accordingly, as and when adjustments to such estimate or between estimated and actual
Operating Expenses are made under the Master Lease, the obligations of Sublessor and
Sublessee hereunder shall be adjusted in a like manner; if such adjustments result in a
refund to Sublessor, then Sublessor shall also make a refund to Sublessee in the
appropriate amount and if such adjustments result in a credit against rent to Sublessor,
then Sublessor shall also give a credit against rent to Sublessee in the appropriate
amount, and if any such adjustment shall occur after the expiration or earlier termination
of the Term, then the obligations of Sublessor and Sublessee under this Section 5(b) shall
survive such expiration or termination. Sublessor shall, within ten (10) days of receipt
furnish Sublessee with copies of all statements submitted by Lessor of actual or estimated
Operating Expenses during the Term and Sublessee or its representative shall have the
right to examine, within a reasonable time, the records supporting the statements, during
normal business hours, at the place where the records are kept, to the extent that such
records are made available to Sublessor. Sublessor&#146;s initial estimate of the
Operating Expenses is $.22 per square foot per month.</FONT></TD>

<B>Actions Upon Non-Renewal.</B>  Notwithstanding Section 6(c) above, upon Sublessee&#146;s receipt
of any notice from the issuing bank that it  will not renew or replace the Letter of
Credit in the scheduled amount, as  required hereunder, for the succeeding one-year

with a copy thereof. If  such Letter of Credit is not, in fact, renewed or replaced with
a Letter of  Credit from another qualified issuer pursuant hereto not later than
forty-five  (45) days prior to expiration of such Letter of Credit, such event shall also
be  an event of default hereunder, without the necessity of further written notice  or

prior to such forty-five (45) day period, Sublessor may draw upon such  existing Letter
of Credit and hold such funds as security until a new Letter of  Credit has been provided

Premises in accordance with the provisions of the Work Letter attached hereto as
<U>Exhibit F</U>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
<B>Assignment and Subletting.</B> Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or
further sublet all or any part of the Premises without the prior written consent
of Sublessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
the consent of Lessor, if such is required under the terms of the Master Lease
or Lessor&#146;s Consent to this Sublease, provided, that Sublessor will make a
good faith effort to obtain the written consent from the Lessor. If Sublessee
desires to assign this Sublease or sublet all or part of the Premises, then
Sublessee shall give Sublessor written notice thereof, and, in the case of a
sublet, such notice shall designate the portion of the Premises Sublessee
proposes to sublet. Sublessor shall have the prior right and option to terminate
this Lease (in the case of an assignment) or to terminate this Lease as it
pertains to the portion of the Premises Sublessee proposes to sublet (in the
case of a sublet) by giving Sublessee written notice to such effect to Sublessee
not more than fifteen (15) days after receipt of Sublessee&#146;s notice. In
connection with any assignment of this Sublease or further subletting of the
Premises Sublessee shall reasonably seek to obtain from the assignee or
sublessee consideration reflecting the then-current fair market rent for the
space subject to such assignment or subletting. Any rent or other consideration
realized by Sublessee in connection with or as a result of any such assignment
or subletting in excess of the Base Monthly Rent and Additional Rent payable
hereunder, after first deducting reasonable costs actually incurred by Sublessee
at the time of such assignment or subletting for tenant improvements and
brokerage commissions necessary to effect such assignment or subletting, shall
be split equally between Sublessor and Sublessee. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, provided that Sublessee is not in default under this
Sublease at the time of such transaction, Sublessee may assign this Lease, or
sublet the Premises, or any portion thereof, without Sublessor&#146;s consent,
and the provisions with respect to division of rent shall not apply, to: (a) a
wholly owned subsidiary of Sublessee; (b) an entity with which or into which
Sublessee may merge whether or not the Sublessee is the survivor of such merger;
or (c) any entity that is controlled by, controls or is under common control
with Sublessee (each, a &#147;Permitted Transferee&#148;). The term
&#147;control&#148; means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty
percent (50%) of all the legal and equitable interest in any business entity.
Sublessee must provide Sublessor with at least twenty (20 ) days prior written
notice of any transfer to a Permitted Transferee, together with such evidence as
Sublessor may reasonably request to establish that such transferee is a
Permitted Transferee. Any Permitted Transferee must assume the obligations of
Sublessee with respect to the Premises being so sublet or assigned. Any such
assignment or subletting shall not , in any way, affect or limit the liability
of Sublessee under this Sublease.</FONT></P>

<B>Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning.</B> Sublessor shall make heating,
ventilating and air conditioning utilizing the existing building systems in the

characteristics of the existing heating, ventilating and air conditioning
systems in the Building (the &#147;HVAC Systems&#148;) are set forth on
<U>Exhibit G</U> attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Sublessor
shall not modify or change the method of operation of the HVAC Systems so as to
reduce the performance characteristics of the HVAC systems without
Sublessee&#146;s prior written agreement to such modification or change, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sublessee shall
promptly reimburse Sublessor for an equitable share of the costs paid or
incurred by Sublessor to operate the HVAC Systems and the related repair,
replacement and maintenance expenses in accordance with the allocation
percentages shown in Section 5(c) through the last day of Month 04. From and
after the day after the last day of Month 04 these costs (which would otherwise
be included in Other Building Expenses and paid in accordance with Section 5(c))
will be allocated in accordance with the formula set forth on <U>Exhibit H</U>
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Sublessor shall provide
documentation to Sublessee to show that any expenses to be paid by Sublessor for
Operating Costs, Other Building Expenses, costs incurred by Sublessor under this
Section and costs incurred by Sublessor under any other Section of this Sublease
or the Master Lease do not overlap, and that the Sublessee is not charged more
than once for any particular item. Sublessee may install separate heating,
ventilating and air conditioning systems that exclusively serve the Premises. If
Sublessee installs such systems, then Sublessee shall operate, repair and
maintain such systems and shall bear and pay all costs of operation, repair and
maintenance of such systems.</FONT></P>

<B>Utilities and Services.</B> Sublessee shall arrange for, and cause to be

gas and any and all other utility services to the Premises, including
telecommunications and data communications services, telephone service, cable
television service, satellite transmission service, and computer cabling or
wiring, and janitorial services for the Premises. Sublessee shall pay any
required deposits for such utilities and services. Sublessee shall pay for such
utilities and services directly to the provider thereof, or, if Sublessor pays
for any of such utilities or services, then Sublessee shall promptly reimburse
Sublessor for all costs incurred or paid by Sublessor for such utilities or
services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
<B>Access.</B> Sublessee shall have access to the Premises and parking
facilities at all times during the Term. It is understood and agreed that in
order to access the Premises that Sublessee will have the right at all times to
access to and from that space in the Building on the first floor designated as
&#147;Shared Lobby Access&#148; in Exhibit B.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
<B>Parking.</B> Sublessee shall have the right to use without separate charge
(a) three (3) parking spaces per 1,000 rentable square feet of space in the
Premises from time to time, or (b) the minimum number of parking spaces per
1,000 rentable square feet of space in the Premises from time to time that is
required by the City of Bothell Municipal Code, whichever is greater. Such use
by Sublessee shall comply with all Laws and shall be subject to any reasonable
rules and regulations that may be established by Lessor and Sublessor and any
rules and regulations established pursuant to the CC&amp;Rs for such parking
facilities from time to time</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
<B>Rooftop Equipment.</B> Sublessor shall permit Sublessee to install and
maintain at Sublessee&#146;s sole expense communications equipment to be used
solely for communications from or to Sublessee (&#147;Communications
Equipment&#148;) and HVAC equipment (&#147;HVAC Equipment&#148;) serving the
Premises on the roof of the Building in locations acceptable to Lessor and
Sublessor and in strict compliance with all applicable governmental laws and
regulations and Lessor&#146;s roof warranty. The Communications Equipment may
not be leased or hired out to any third parties and shall not be used for
commercial purposes unrelated to Sublessee&#146;s business conducted in the
Premises. Sublessor makes no warranties or representations to Sublessee as to
the permissibility of any Communications Equipment on the Building under
applicable law. Sublessee must remove the Communications Equipment (including
any related cabling or wiring) upon the expiration or earlier termination of
this Sublease. Sublessee shall obtain all governmental permits, consents or
authorizations necessary for the erection and operation of the Communications
Equipment and HVAC Equipment. If installation of the Communications Equipment
and HVAC Equipment requires any roof penetrations, Sublessee shall use a
contractor approved by Lessor and Sublessor and shall cause such work to be done
in a manner that will preserve any roof warranty held by Lessor. The nature,
design and specifications of any HVAC Equipment shall be subject to
Lessor&#146;s and Sublessor&#146;s approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sublessee&#146;s insurance and indemnification
obligations shall apply to any rooftop installations made by Sublessee and any
activities of Sublessee in relation thereto. Sublessee&#146;s installation and
use of the Communications Equipment may not in any way materially interfere with
the systems of the Building or the quiet enjoyment of other tenants of the
Building. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease,
Sublessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall remove the Communications
Equipment, including any related cabling or wiring, and, if Sublessor so elects,
the HVAC Equipment and any related duct work or wiring, and restore the Building
to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to the installation
of such equipment ordinary wear and tear, and damage by casualty not caused by
Sublessee, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees, excepted. Sublessor
shall make the same election as to whether the HVAC Equipment is to remain in
place or be removed as the Lessor makes under Section 34 of the Master Lease. If
Sublessee&#146;s installation, maintenance, use, or removal of any equipment on
the rooftop causes any damage to the roof or roof membrane or any other portion
of the Building, then Sublessee shall be solely responsible for such damage and
shall ensure that the remaining useful life of the roof is the same as it would
have been but for the penetrations.</FONT></P>

Lessor and Sublessor. The number of spaces Sublessee has the right to use as
provided in Section 13 shall be reduced by the number of spaces used by the
chemical waste area. Sublessee shall remove such chemical waste area on or
before the Expiration Date or within thirty (30) days after the date of sooner
termination of this Sublease and promptly and properly repair any damage to such
portion of the parking area.</FONT></P>

<B>Right of First Opportunity.</B> Sublessor hereby grants to Sublessee the
right of first offer with respect to (a) the space on the first floor of the
Building previously leased by NEPCO (the &#147;NEPCO Space&#148;) and (b) any
space in the Building that is presently occupied by Sublessor that Sublessor
elects to make available for sublease during the Term (the &#147;RFO
Space&#148;). The NEPCO Space is currently vacant and available for sublease and
Sublessor may give Sublessee notice of the availability of the NEPCO Space at
any time during the Term. If Sublessor elects to make available any of the RFO
Space for sublease during the Term, then Sublessor shall give Sublessee notice
of the availability of the RFO Space. Any such notice with respect to either the
NEPCO Space or the RFO Space is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Offer
Notice&#148;. The Offer Notice shall set forth the terms on which Sublessor is
willing to lease the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space, provided, that such terms
shall represent bona fide market terms, and shall reflect a rent no higher than
the then-current fair market rent for the space as reasonably determined by
Sublessor. To exercise the right of first offer, Sublessee must within ten (10)
days after receipt of the Offer Notice give Sublessor notice of its acceptance
of Sublessor&#146;s offer to lease the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space (the
&#147;Acceptance Notice&#148;). If Sublessee gives the Acceptance Notice within
such ten (10) day period, then Sublessor shall lease the NEPCO Space and/or the
RFO Space to Sublessee on the terms set forth in the Offer Notice. If Sublessee
fails to give the Acceptance Notice within such ten (10) day period, then the
right of first offer shall immediately terminate as to the NEPCO Space and/or
the RFO Space, and Sublessor shall be free to lease the NEPCO Space and/or the
RFO Space, or portions thereof, to third parties. If the NEPCO Space is
thereafter leased, but subsequently again becomes vacant and available for
sublease during the Term, or if Sublessor elects subsequently to make available
any of the RFO Space for sublease during the Term, then Sublessor shall give
Sublessee notice of the availability of the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space, as
the case may be (the &#147;Offer Notice&#148;) and the terms on which Sublessor
is willing to lease the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space, provided, that such
terms shall represent bona fide market terms, and shall reflect a rent no higher
than the then-current fair market rent for the space, as reasonably determined
by Sublessor. To exercise this second opportunity for the right of first offer,
Sublessee must within ten (10) days after receipt of the Offer Notice give
Sublessor notice of its acceptance of Sublessor&#146;s offer to lease the NEPCO
Space and /or the RFO Space (&#147;Acceptance Notice&#148;). If Sublessee gives
the Acceptance Notice within such ten (10) day period, then the Sublessor shall
lease the NEPCO Space and /or the RFO Space to Sublessee on the terms set forth
in the Offer Notice. If the Sublessee fails to give the Acceptance Notice within
such ten (10) day period, then this second opportunity for the right of first
offer shall immediately terminate as to the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space,
and Sublessor shall be free to lease the NEPCO Space and/or the RFO Space, or
portions thereof, to third parties.</FONT></P>

<B>First Option to Extend.</B> Sublessee shall have the option to extend the
Term for one (1) period of approximately three (3) years from January 1, 2008 to
and including January 11, 2011 (the &#147;First Extended Term&#148;). This
option is referred to herein as an &#147;Extension Option&#148;. The Extension
Option may be exercised by Sublessee only by irrevocable written notice of
exercise delivered to Sublessor no later than twelve (12) months prior to the
expiration of the initial Term. If Sublessee does not deliver a notice of
exercise by the appropriate date, then the Extension Option shall immediately
terminate and be of no further force or effect and this Lease shall terminate on
the Expiration Date. Sublessee&#146;s Extension Option shall be personal to
Sublessee and may not be exercised by any assignee or subtenant (other than a
Permitted Transferee). Sublessee may not exercise the Extension Option if on the
date of such notice Sublessee is in default (after any required notice and
expiration of any applicable cure period) under this Sublease. If Sublessee
becomes in default (after any required notice and expiration of any applicable
cure period) under this Sublease after exercise of the Extension Option, but
before the commencement of the First Extended Term, Sublessor may, in its sole
discretion and in addition to its other remedies under this Lease, elect to
terminate such extension by notice in writing to Sublessee, whereupon the Term
shall expire without any such extension. Upon such exercise, the parties shall
be obligated under all the terms and conditions of this Lease through the First
Extended Term, except that (i) Sublessor shall have no obligation to alter the
Premises or pay any tenant improvement or refurbishment allowance for the
Extended Term, and (ii) Sublessee shall not have any additional rights to extend
the Term, except to the extent Extension Options remain to be exercised under
Section 20 and except as set forth in the Lessor&#146;s Consent to Sublease as
referenced above. Base Monthly Rent during the First Extended Term shall be as
set forth in Section 5(a).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.
<B>Second and Third Options to Extend.</B> If Sublessor in its sole discretion
intends to elect to exercise its first Extension Option under the Master Lease,
then Sublessor shall give notice to such effect to Sublessee not less then
fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the Term and Sublessee shall
have one (1) option to extend the Term of this Sublease for an additional five
(5) years (the &#147;Second Extended Term&#148;), provided, that if Sublessor
does not elect to exercise the first Extension Option under the Master Lease,
Sublessee will nevertheless have a right to lease the Premises directly from
Lessor according to the terms and conditions of the Lessor&#146;s Consent to
Sublease which is incorporated herein by reference. If Sublessor in its sole
discretion intends to elect to exercise its second Extension Option under the
Master Lease, then Sublessor shall give notice to such effect to Sublessee not
less then fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the Second Extended
Term and Sublessee shall have one (1) additional option to extend the Term of
this Sublease for an additional five (5) years from and after the last day of
the prior Extended Term (the &#147;Third Extended Term&#148;), provided,
however, if Sublessor does not elect to exercise the second Extension Option
under the Master Lease, Sublessee will nevertheless have a right to lease the
Premises directly from Lessor according to the terms and conditions of the
Lessor&#146;s Consent to Sublease which is incorporated herein by reference.
Each of such options is referred to herein as an &#147;Extension Option&#148;.
Each such option may be exercised by Sublessee only by irrevocable written
notice of exercise delivered to Sublessor no later than thirteen (13) months
prior to the expiration of the First Extended Term or the Second Extended Term,

Transferee). Sublessee may not exercise either Extension Option if on the date
of such notice Sublessee is in default (after any required notice and expiration
of any applicable cure period) under this Sublease. If Sublessee becomes in
default (after any required notice and expiration of any applicable cure period)
under this Sublease after exercise of an Extension Option, but before the
commencement of the Extended Term, Sublessor may, in its sole discretion and in
addition to its other remedies under this Lease, elect to terminate such
extension by notice in writing to Sublessee, whereupon the Term shall expire
without any such extension.</FONT></P>

<B>Option to Expand.</B> If Sublessee has exercised its option to extend the Term for the
First Extended Term by exercising the Extension Option provided in Section 19, and if and
provided that Sublessee has demonstrated a track record of financial success and
performance and has raised adequate capital to reasonably satisfy both Sublessor and
Lessor as to its ability to fulfill the additional financial obligations of payment of
rent and other charges for the Expansion Space (as hereinafter defined), and, thereby,
provide Sublessor reasonable assurance that Sublessor is not at risk by virtue of the fact
that Sublessor will increase its financial obligations by directly leasing the Alternate
Location (as hereinafter defined), Sublessor hereby grants to Sublessee the right, at
Sublessee&#146;s option, to expand the Premises to include the balance of the space in the
Building then occupied by Sublessor, except the Growth Chamber Area and Laboratory along
the east wall of the first floor of the Building as depicted on <U>Exhibit I</U> attached
hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the &#147;Expansion Space&#148;) by giving
Sublessor notice to such effect (the &#147;Expansion Notice&#148;) not less than one (1)
year before the date on which Premises would be expanded to include the Expansion Space
(the &#147;Expansion Space Commencement Date&#148;), which date shall be specified in the
notice. As of the Expansion Space Commencement Date, the Expansion Space shall be added to
the Premises, the Base Monthly Rent shall be increased by an amount equal to the rental
rate per rentable square foot of space then applicable under the Sublease times the number
of rentable square feet of space in the Expansion Space and Sublessee&#146;s Share shall
be appropriately adjusted. If Sublessee elects to exercise its option to expand, then
Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor (a) any differential in rent between (i) the rent per
square foot payable by Sublessor for the balance of the space in the Building then
occupied by Sublessor over (ii) the rent per square foot payable by Sublessor for the
Alternate Location (as hereinafter defined), times the number of square feet of space in
the Expansion Space, over (A) a period equal to the remaining term of the Master Lease,
including any Extended Terms, or (B) a period of ten (10) years from the date Sublessor
first occupies the Alternate Location, whichever period is shorter (the &#147;Rent
Differential&#148;), plus (b) the costs to be incurred by Sublessor to relocate its
business and laboratory operations from the Expansion Space to another location selected
by Sublessor (the &#147;Alternate Location&#148;), including (i) the costs of tenant
improvements in the Alternate Location substantially equivalent to the tenant improvements
and laboratory facilities then existing in the Expansion Space, leasing commissions and
cabling and wiring costs (the &#147;Tenant Improvement Costs&#148;), provided, however,
that if the number of square feet of space in the Alternate Location is greater than the
number of square feet of space in the Expansion Space then the Tenant Improvement Costs
shall only include the costs attributable to a portion of the space in the Alternate
Location equal to the number of square feet of space in the Expansion Space, as such costs
are reasonably determined by Sublessor, and (ii) moving costs and all other costs incident
to Sublessor&#146;s relocation of its business and laboratory operations from the
Expansion Space to the Alternate Location (the &#147;Moving Costs&#148;). The Alternate
Location (i) shall be reasonably satisfactory to Sublessor, (ii) shall be in close
proximity to the Building, and (iii) the terms of the lease on the Alternate Location,
including the amount of the security deposit, if any, shall be reasonably acceptable to
Sublessor. The Tenant Improvement Costs and the Moving Costs are sometimes hereinafter
collectively referred to as the &#147;Relocation Costs&#148;. If the rent payable by
Sublessor for either the Expansion Space or the Alternate Location is not fixed in the
relevant leases or determinable by reference to a formula or specified increases set forth
in the relevant lease (for instance, because rent during an extended term is determined
with reference to market rent as of the first day of the extended term), then for purposes
of calculating the Rent Differential the relevant rent(s) shall be projected through the
extended term(s) based on the rent payable during the last month as to which the rent is
so fixed or determinable. For instance, if Sublessee gave the Expansion Notice in 2006,
then the rent during the extended terms under the Master Lease would be projected based on
the rate of $24.50 per rentable square foot per year applicable to Months 91-120 of the
term of the Master Lease. The Rent Differential shall be calculated as provided in this
Section and the Relocation Costs shall be reasonably estimated by Sublessor as soon as
reasonably possible, but not later than the date six (6) months after the date of receipt
by Sublessor of the Expansion Notice, and Sublessor shall give notice to Sublessee setting
forth the estimated Relocation Costs. Within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt by
Sublessee of Sublessor&#146;s notice setting forth the Rent Differential and the estimated
Relocation Costs, Sublessee shall either (a) pay to Sublessor in cash or immediately
available federal funds an amount equal to the Rent Differential and the estimated
Relocation Costs, or (b) give notice to Sublessor revoking the Expansion Notice and
electing not to expand the Premises to include the Expansion Space. If Sublessee revokes
the Expansion Notice and elects not to expand the Premises, then Sublessee shall reimburse
Sublessor for the costs incurred by Sublessor to locate and negotiate a lease on the
Alternate Location and to develop the estimate of Relocation Costs, including leasing
commissions, attorney&#146;s fees, consultant&#146;s fees, fees payable to contractors,
estimators or the landlord of the Alternate Location relating to estimating the costs of
tenant improvements, and the cost of Sublessor&#146;s own managerial and other personnel
engaged in locating the Alternate Location, negotiating a lease on the Alternate Location
and developing the estimate of Relocation Costs. Within ninety (90) days after Sublessor
completes the relocation of its business and laboratory operations from the Expansion
Space to the Alternate Location, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable,
Sublessor shall deliver to Sublessee a written statement setting forth the actual
Relocation Costs. If the actual Relocation Costs exceed the estimated Relocation Costs,
then Sublessee shall pay the difference to Sublessor within thirty (30) days after receipt
of such statement by Sublessee, provided, however, that if the actual Relocation Costs are
more than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated Relocation Costs,
Sublessee shall only be required to pay the difference between an amount equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated Relocation Costs and the estimated
Relocation Costs to Sublessor, and Sublessor shall be responsible for and bear the
additional difference. If the actual Relocation Costs are less than the estimated
Relocation Costs, then Sublessor shall pay the difference to Sublessee at the time
Sublessor furnishes such statement to Sublessee.</FONT></P>

<B>Other Provisions of Sublease.</B> All applicable terms and conditions of the
Master Lease are incorporated into and made a part of this Sublease as if
Sublessor were the lessor thereunder, Sublessee the lessee thereunder, and the
Premises the Master Premises, except for the following: Sections 1.A through
1.E., 1.G. through 1.I., the first, third, fourth and fifth sentences of Section
2.1, Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, the first paragraph of
Section 6, Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4, the first sentence of Section 7.1,

18.1.1 and 24, the second sentence of Section 33.2, Sections 33.12, 33.16, 34,
35, 36 and 37, and Exhibit B, provided, however, that to the extent any of the
foregoing excluded Sections contain or set forth defined terms the portion of
such excluded Section(s) containing such definition(s) is incorporated into and
made a part of this Sublease solely for the purpose of defining such terms.
Sublessee assumes and agrees to perform the Sublessor&#146;s obligations under
the Master Lease during the Term to the extent that such obligations are
applicable to the Premises, except that the obligation to pay rent to Lessor
under the Master Lease shall be considered performed by Sublessee to the extent
and in the amount rent is paid to Sublessor in accordance with Section 5 of this
Sublease. Sublessee shall not commit or suffer any act or omission that will
violate any of the provisions of the Master Lease. Sublessor shall exercise due
diligence and good faith in attempting to cause Lessor to perform its
obligations under the Master Lease for the benefit of Sublessee. If for any
reason the Sublessor defaults under the Master Lease, so long as the Sublessee
is not in default under the Sublease, beyond the applicable notice and cure
periods, the Sublessee shall have such non-disturbance rights as set forth in
the Lessor&#146;s Consent to Sublease which is incorporated herein by reference.
At Lessor&#146;s option, if Sublessor is in default under the Master Lease,
Lessor may send notice of such default to Sublessee and thereafter Sublessee
shall pay rent and all other sums due under the Sublease directly to Lessor. If
Sublessee pays all sums due under the Sublease directly to Lessor such payment
shall satisfy Sublessee&#146;s obligations to Sublessor under the Sublease and
Lessor shall apply the sums so received against Sublessor&#146;s obligations as
tenant under the Master Lease. By entering into the Sublease, Sublessee and
Sublessor agree to this provision. If such default(s), result in the termination
of the Master Lease, or the Master Lease is terminated by the agreement or
consent of the Lessor and Sublessor, Sublessee shall have such rights of
non-disturbance, and to enter into a direct lease with the Lessor as set forth
in the Lessor&#146;s Consent to Sublease. Said Sublessor&#146;s Consent to
Sublease also provides that, so long as Sublessee is not in default beyond the
applicable notice and cure periods, Sublessee shall have non-disturbance rights
with respect to the rights of any mortgagee, lien holder, or beneficiary of a
deed of trust which affect the premises. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section, if the Master Lease terminates, this Sublease shall terminate and the
parties shall be relieved of any further liability or obligation under this
Sublease, provided, however, that if the Master Lease terminates as a result of
a default or breach by Sublessor or Sublessee under this Sublease and/or the
Master Lease, then the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting
party for the damage suffered as a result of such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Master Lease gives Sublessor any right to terminate the
Master Lease in the event of the partial or total damage, destruction, or
condemnation of the Master Premises or the building or project of which the
Master Premises are a part, the exercise of such right by Sublessor shall not
constitute a default or breach hereunder.</FONT></P>

CONSENT TO SUBLEASE</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Lessor&#146;s Consent to Sublease (&#147;Consent&#148;) is entered into between
Ditty Properties Limited Partnership, a Washington limited partnership
(&#147;Lessor&#148;) Landlord under that Lease (&#147;Master Lease&#148;) dated
January 12, 2001 with Eden Bioscience Corporation (&#147;Sublessor&#148;), and
CEPTYR, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Sublessee&#148;) under that Sublease
dated December 30, 2002 with the Sublessor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<U>Consent To Sublease</U>. Lessor under the Master Lease hereby consents to the
foregoing Sublease, including, but not limited to, Section 9 (granting rights of
assignment and subletting), Section 18 (granting rights of first opportunity),
19 (granting an option to extend), 20 (granting options to extend), and 21
(granting options to expand), without waiver of any restriction in the Master
Lease concerning further assignment or subletting. Lessor certifies, as of the
date of Lessor&#146;s execution hereof, that (i) Sublessor is not in default in
payment of rent or triple-net charges under the Master Lease, and (ii) to the
knowledge of the person executing this Consent on Lessor&#146;s behalf, without
investigation or inquiry, Sublessor is not in default or breach of any of the
other provisions of the Master Lease, and the Master Lease has not been amended
or modified except as expressly set forth in the foregoing Sublease. This
Consent shall apply only to the Sublease and shall not be deemed to be a consent
to any other assignment or sublease nor shall this consent constitute a waiver
of any restriction in the Master Lease concerning further subletting or
assignment by Sublessor or by Sublessee. Lessor&#146;s consent is issued on the
understanding that nothing contained in the Sublease shall modify, expand or
enlarge Lessor&#146;s obligations under the Master Lease nor release Sublessor
from any obligations thereunder. Unless and until the provisions of Sections 4
or 5 of this Consent become effective, nothing in this Agreement or the Sublease
shall be deemed to create a landlord/tenant relationship between Lessor and
Sublessee or obligate Lessor to perform any obligations under the Master Lease
for the benefit of Sublessee. Sublessor and Sublessee shall not amend, modify or
terminate the Sublease without Lessor&#146;s prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding three
sentences, Sublessee shall have, and may exercise its right under Section 9 of
the Sublease to assign the Sublease or sublet part or all of the Premises to a
Permitted Transferee without either Lessor&#146;s consent or Sublessor&#146;s
consent. No amendment or modification of the Sublease shall be binding on Lessor
unless Lessor has consented to such amendment or modification in writing.
Whether or not Sublessor and Sublessee seek Lessor&#146;s consent to any
amendment or modification of the Sublease, Sublessor and Sublessee shall give
notice to Lessor of any amendment or modification of the Sublease. Sublessor and
Sublessee acknowledge that the foregoing conditions are reasonable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
<U>Estoppel Certificates</U>. Sublessee shall upon request by Lessor
execute an Estoppel Certificate with respect to the Sublease. Lessor shall upon
request by the Sublessee execute an Estoppel Certificate with respect to the
Master Lease. The terms and conditions regarding such Estoppel Certificates
shall be the same as those set forth for the Lessor and Sublessor in Section 25
of the Master Lease.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
<U>Subordination/Attornment/Non-Disturbance</U>. Sublessee agrees that the
Sublease shall be subordinate to the lien of any mortgages, deeds of trust or
ground leases now or hereafter placed against the Property or Building (as those
terms are defined in the Master Lease), and to all renewals and modifications,
supplements, consolidations, and extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Lessor reserves the right, to subordinate, or cause to be
subordinated, any such mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease to the Sublease.
Upon a foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure under such mortgage or
deed of trust, or a termination of such ground lease, Sublessee shall attorn to
and recognize such successor as Lessor under the Master Lease. Sublessee shall
execute and deliver on request and in the form requested by Lessor, any
instruments reasonably necessary or appropriate to evidence, effect or confirm
such subordination provided that such agreement (i) shall provide
Sublessee&#146;s rights under the Sublease shall not be disturbed so long as
Sublessee is not in default under the Sublease beyond applicable notice and cure
periods, (ii) shall not materially modify the Sublease in any respect, (iii)
shall not materially increase Sublessee&#146;s obligations or decrease
Sublessee&#146;s rights under the Sublease. Should Sublessee fail to sign and
return any such documents that comply with this Section or to provide specific
written objections to such documents stating in particular how the documents
fail to comply with this Sublease within ten (10) days of request, Sublessee
shall be in default. Lessor agrees to make a good faith effort to obtain
nondisturbance agreements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
<U>Master Lease Default &#150; Attornment/ Non-Disturbance</U>. At Lessor&#146;s
option, if Sublessor is in default under the Master Lease, Lessor may send
notice of such default to Sublessee and thereafter Sublessee shall pay rent and
all other sums due under the Sublease directly to Lessor. If Sublessee pays all
sums due under the Sublease directly to Lessor such payment shall satisfy
Sublessee&#146;s obligations to Sublessor under the Sublease and Lessor shall
apply the sums so received against Sublessor&#146;s obligations as tenant under
the Master Lease. By entering into the Sublease, Sublessee and Sublessor agree
to this provision. In the event of default by the Sublessor under the Master
Lease, provided that (a) the Sublease is then in full force and effect, (b)
Sublessee is not then in default under the Sublease beyond any applicable grace
or cure periods provided in the Sublease, and (c) either Sublessor shall
transfer the Letter or Credit or any cash security deposit to Lessor, or
Sublessee shall provide comparable security to Lessor (provided that any Letter
of Credit shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor), in either case
as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after termination of the Master Lease, Sublessee&#146;s rights under the
Sublease shall not be disturbed. Notwithstanding Section 17.8 of the Master
Lease, in the event that by reason of said default(s) Lessor terminates the
Master Lease, or the Master Lease is terminated by mutual consent or agreement
of the Lessor and Sublessor, so long as Sublessee is not in default under the
Sublease beyond the applicable notice and cure periods, Sublessee shall attorn
to and recognize Lessor as Sublessor under the Sublease, and, except as provided
herein (i) Sublessee&#146;s rights shall not be disturbed, (ii) the Sublease
shall not be materially modified in any respect, and (iii) Sublessee&#146;s
obligations shall not be materially increased or it&#146;s rights decreased
under the Sublease, and (iv) the Sublease shall continue in full force and
effect as a direct lease between Lessor and Sublessee.</FONT></P>

<U>Sublessee&#146;s Right to Exercise Extension Options</U>. Under the Master
Lease, Section 3.3 gives the Sublessor (Tenant) the right to exercise two
successive options (each &#147;Extension Option&#148;) for five (5) years each.
Notwithstanding that Section 3.3 provides that a subtenant may not exercise the
Tenant&#146;s Extension Options, Lessor hereby gives Sublessee the right to
exercise both the first and second Extension Options if Sublessor does not do
so. If Sublessor does not elect to exercise the first Extension Option, then
Sublessee may itself exercise the first Extension Option during the period
provided in Section 3.3 of the Master Lease. Sublessee shall have the right to
exercise the first Extension Option at such time as it has not received from the
Sublessor a timely notice , as required under Section 20 of the Sublease, that
Sublessor intends to exercise Sublessor&#146;s first Extension Option. If
Sublessee elects to exercise the first Extension Option during the period
provided in Section 3.3 of the Master Lease, the parties shall be obligated
under all the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as if the Sublessee were
the Sublessor (Tenant) under the Master Lease including the determination of the
Rent as set forth in Sections 3.3.1, and subsequent Sections, and the right of
the Sublessee to exercise the second Extension Option as if the Sublessee were
the Sublessor (Tenant) under the Master Lease, except that the premises shall
include only the Premises then covered by the Sublease and Base Monthly Rent
shall not be less than the Base Monthly Rent under the Sublease for the last
month of the Term of the Sublease. If Sublessee does not elect to exercise the
first Extension Option during the period provided in Section 3.3 of the Master
Lease, then both the first and second Extension Options shall expire. If
Sublessor exercised the first Extension Option, but does not elect to exercise
the second Extension Option, then Sublessee may itself exercise the second
Extension Option during the period provided in Section 3.3 of the Master Lease.
Sublessee shall have the right to exercise the second Extension Option at such
time as it has not received from the Sublessor a timely notice ,as required
under Section 20 of the Sublease, that Sublessor intends to exercise
Sublessor&#146;s second Extension Option. If Sublessee elects to exercise the
second Extension Option during the period provided in Section 3.3 of the Master
Lease, the parties shall be obligated under all the terms and conditions of the
Master Lease as if the Sublessee were the Sublessor (Tenant) under the Master
Lease including the determination of the Rent as set forth in Sections 3.3.1,
and subsequent Sections, except that the premises shall include only the
Premises then covered by the Sublease and Base Monthly Rent shall not be less
than the Base Monthly Rent under the Sublease for the last month of the first
Extended Term. If Sublessee does not elect to exercise the second Extension
Option during the period provided in Section 3.3 of the Master Lease, then the
second Extension Option shall expire. Sublessee may not exercise the first
Extension Option or the second Extension Option, as the case may be, if
Sublessee is then in default under the terms of the Sublease or the Master
Lease, as the case may be, beyond applicable grace and cure periods.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Sublease becomes a direct lease between Lessor and Sublessee and if the
Premises then covered by the Sublease do not include the entire Building, then
Lessor shall perform the Premises Maintenance Obligations set forth in Section
9.1 of the Master Lease for all portions of the Property outside the Premises
and the Premises Services Obligations set forth in Section 9.2 of the Master
Lease (except to the extent relating to any specialized laboratory equipment or
any Building systems installed in the Premises by or on behalf of Sublessor) and
the full cost thereof shall be included in Operating Expenses to be allocated
among the Building tenants on a proportionate basis. Sublessee shall operate,
maintain and repair any specialized HVAC equipment and other specialized or
laboratory related equipment in the Premises (collectively, the
&#147;Specialized Equipment&#148;) for the benefit of Sublessee and any other
occupants in the Building, all of whom shall have the right to be served by the
Specialized Equipment to the same extent as Sublessor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that such Specialized Equipment is used by Lessor or
Building tenants other than Sublessee, then Sublessee shall be entitled to be
reimbursed for its actual costs based upon the methods set forth in Exhibits H
and J of the Sublease. Lessor shall have no responsibility or liability with
respect to the operation, maintenance or repair of any portion of the
Specialized Equipment. At Lessor&#146;s option, Lessor may elect to take over
operation, repair and maintenance of the Specialized Equipment (provided that
Lessor shall substantially maintain the general characteristics of the
Laboratory HVAC as set forth in Exhibit G to the Sublease) and the cost of such
services shall be an Operating Expense which shall be allocated among the
Building tenants on a proportionate basis based on the methods set forth in
Exhibits H and J to the Sublease in such a manner that the Building tenants pay
one hundred percent of the cost of such services. At Lessor&#146;s option, if
Sublessee becomes a direct tenant of Lessor, then Lessor and Sublessee shall
enter into a new lease on the essential terms and conditions set forth herein
and the cost of preparing the new lease shall be shared equally by the parties.</FONT></P>

<U>Limitations</U>. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Sublease to the
contrary, Lessor shall not be: (a) liable for any act or omission of Sublessor
or any prior landlord under the Sublease; (b) liable for the return of any
security deposit which Sublessee has paid to Sublessor or any prior landlord
under the Sublease except to the extent that Lessor receives directly or by a
transfer from Sublessor any such security deposit; (c) subject to any offsets or
defenses which Sublessee might have against Sublessor or any prior landlord
under the Sublease; (d) bound by any payments of rent or any other payments
which Sublessee might have paid to Sublessor or any prior landlord under the
Sublease after any notice given by Lessor to Sublessee under Section 4 of this
Consent; (e) bound by any amendment or modification of the Sublease made without
Lessor&#146;s prior written consent; (f) bound by any consent by Sublessor or
any landlord under the Sublease to any assignment or sublease of
Sublessee&#146;s interest in the Sublease made without Lessor&#146;s prior
written consent, provided, however, that this limitation shall not limit
Sublessee&#146;s right under Section 9 of the Sublease to assign the Sublease or
sublet part or all of the Premises to a Permitted Transferee without either
Lessor&#146;s consent or Sublessor&#146;s consent, (g) liable for any default
under the Sublease or any covenant or obligation on the part of Sublessor to be
performed thereunder, it being acknowledged that Sublessee&#146;s sole remedy in
the event of such default shall be to proceed against Sublessor; or (h) liable
for any fee payable to any broker in connection with the Sublease, the Lease, or
this Consent, and Sublessor and Sublessee shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Lessor from any claims by any broker, agent or other person claiming a
commission or compensation by virtue of having dealt with the indemnitor with
