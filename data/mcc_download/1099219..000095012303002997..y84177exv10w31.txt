                                AMENDMENT TO THE
                           METROPOLITAN LIFE AUXILIARY
                           SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN

1.       Article 3 of this Plan is hereby amended as follows:

         "Article 3 - Vesting and Payment of Benefits

                  Benefits under this Plan shall vest in accordance with the
         vesting schedule applicable to Company contributions under the Savings
         and Investment Plan and shall be payable to a Participant or the
         beneficiary of a deceased Participant in amounts equal to the
         difference between

                  (i)      the largest amount that would have been contributed
         by the Company under the Savings and Investment Plan, as amended, under
         one or more of the following (but without duplication of amount):

                           (a)      had the Savings and Investment Plan not been
         subject to the limitations of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code
         (disregarding the limitations under (b) herein); and/or

                           (b)      had the Savings and Investment Plan not been
         subject to the limitations of section 401(a)(17) of the Internal
         Revenue Code (disregarding the limitations under (a) herein and with
         respect only to benefits accruable under the Savings and Investment
         Plan on or after January 1, 1989), less

                  (ii)     the amounts of benefits that are actually payable
         under the Savings and Investment Plan.

                      Subject to the Company's consent, a Participant may make
         an election with respect to the investment allocation of future Company
         contributions as well as existing balances. Such allocation shall be
         pegged to the performance of one

<PAGE>

         or more of the following funds set forth under the Savings and
         Investment Plan: the Fixed Income Fund, the Equity Fund, the Common
         Stock Index Fund, the Small Company Stock Fund, the International
         Equity Fund, the Emerging Markets Equity Fund, the Value Equity Fund,
         the Blended Small Company Stock Fund and/or the MetLife Company Stock
         Fund thereunder. No investment allocation election shall represent an
         actual investment in any such fund, but shall merely reflect the
         performance of such fund. Thus, the Participant's account balance under
         this Plan shall be adjusted for income, gains and losses in the same
         manner as if such Participant had directed the investment of his or her
         account balance among one or more of the aforementioned funds under the
         Savings and Investment Plan. The Participant's ability to change the
         investment allocation of future contributions and existing balances
         shall be subject to the same rules and restrictions as apply under the
         Savings and Investment Plan; however, no Participant shall have the
         right to: (i) exercise voting, tender or exchange rights with respect
         to amounts treated as if they were invested in the MetLife Company
         Stock Fund or (ii) receive any distribution from the Plan in a form
         other than cash. If a Participant fails to specify the investment
         allocation of contributions to this Plan, then earnings and/or losses
         on such contributions shall be determined using the returns from the
         Fixed Income Fund until changed by the Participant or Beneficiary.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, it will be within the discretion of the
         Company whether contributions are actually invested according to each
         Participant's stated preferences.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a Participant
         may elect, subject to the consent of the Company, to receive benefits
         in the form of a single sum, installments or an annuity subject to the
         same duration, terms and conditions under which such methods of
         distribution are payable under the Savings and Investment Plan. Such
         election shall be made on a form prescribed by the Company and shall
         require the Participant to designate the mode of payment requested and
         the date on which benefits will commence to be paid. Benefits shall
         become payable in cash on the date elected by the Participant in the
         election form which date shall not be earlier than (i) twelve (12)
         months subsequent to the date on which the Participant files the
         election form with the Company; and (ii) the Participant's actual
         retirement date. If the Participant retired prior to attaining age 70
         1/2, and no benefit election form is received from a Participant by
         April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
         Participant attained age 70 1/2, such Participant will be deemed to
         have elected to receive his or her account balance in the form of a
         single sum in cash by April 1st of the calendar year following the
         calendar year in which he or she attains age 71 1/2, and such amount
         shall be paid no earlier than the January 1st of such later year nor
         later than the April 1st of such later year.

                  If a Participant's vested account balance does not exceed
         $5,000, such Participant's vested account balance will be distributed
         in a single sum in cash as soon as practicable following his or her
         death, disability, termination of employment or retirement.

                                       3

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 3, no
         benefits under this Plan will be eligible for any in-service withdrawal
         by a Participant.

                  If, at the time of the Participant's death, benefits had
         commenced but amounts remained undistributed to such Participant, then
         benefit payments shall continue to be made to the Participant's
         beneficiary in accordance with the method by which benefit payments
         were being made to the Participant. If, at the time of the
         Participant's death, benefit payments had not commenced to be made to
         him or her, then, except as otherwise provided in this Article, the
         Participant's designated beneficiary may elect, subject to the consent
         of the Company, to receive benefits in the form of a single sum,
         installments or an annuity subject to the same duration, terms and
         conditions under which such methods of distribution are payable to
         beneficiaries under the Savings and Investment Plan. Such election
         shall be made on a form prescribed by the Company and shall require the
         beneficiary to designate the mode of payment requested and the date on
         which benefits will commence to be paid. Benefits payable in any form
         shall become payable on the date elected by the beneficiary in the
         election form which date shall not be earlier than twelve (12) months
         subsequent to the date on which the beneficiary files the election form
         with the Company; however, the benefit selected must require the entire
         account balance to be paid to the beneficiary no later than the
         December 31 of the year which is the fifth anniversary of the
         Participant's death.

                      Except as provided below, the Participant's beneficiary
         shall be the beneficiary designated by the Participant under the
         Savings and Investment Plan.

                                       4

         However, if the Participant filed a beneficiary designation under this
         Plan, such designation shall supersede the Participant's beneficiary
         designation under the Savings and Investment Plan and upon the
         Participant's death, benefits shall be payable to the primary
         beneficiary(ies) designated under this Plan. If there is more than one
         beneficiary under the Savings and Investment Plan or more than one
         primary beneficiary under this Plan and the beneficiary designation
         does not specify the percentage of the Participant's benefit to be paid
         to each such beneficiary, each beneficiary shall share equally in the
         benefits under the Plan. If one or more beneficiaries predecease the
         Participant, the surviving beneficiary(ies) shall share equally in the
         deceased beneficiary's portion of the Plan benefits. If all primary
         beneficiaries predecease the Participant, benefits shall be payable to
         the contingent beneficiary(ies) upon the Participant's death. If there
         is more than one contingent beneficiary(ies), and the contingent
         beneficiary designation does not specify the percentage of the
         Participant's benefit to be paid to each such beneficiary, each
         contingent beneficiary shall share equally in the benefits under the
         Plan. If one or more contingent beneficiaries predecease the
         Participant, the surviving contingent beneficiary(ies) shall share
         equally in the deceased contingent beneficiary's portion of the Plan
         benefits. If all contingent beneficiaries predecease the Participant,
         or if there is no beneficiary designation in effect on the date of the
         Participant's death, benefits will be payable to the Participant's
         surviving spouse or, in the absence of such spouse, to the
         Participant's estate.

                                       5

                  The largest amount under subsection (i) above shall,
         notwithstanding the actual provisions of the Savings and Investment
         Plan, also include in the case of a salaried employee who has not
         received an otherwise final distribution under the Savings and
         Investment Plan, benefits with respect to any incentive award paid
         under the Short-Term Performance Compensation Plan after the date the
         individual retires for purposes of the Metropolitan Retirement Plan,
         whether paid for the twelve-month period directly preceding the
         employee's year of retirement and/or for the period running from
         January 1st of the year of retirement through the date of retirement.

                  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no similar
         benefit that is paid under this Plan shall be paid under any other
         deferred compensation plan(s) created by the Company or any of its
         affiliates."

2.       This amendment is effective November 8, 2002.
