  8.7     Anti-Stacking Royalty Reduction. If, in Amgen's reasonable opinion,
          Amgen is required to enter into any agreement with Third Parties for
          rights under patents for which but for a license the sale, manufacture
          or use of any Product by Amgen, its Affiliates and sublicensees would

          a.    Amgen hereby grants to GENE a non-exclusive, royalty-free
                license, without the right to sublicense, under the Amgen
                Technology solely to perform GENE's responsibilities under the
                Research Plan and, subject to GENE's election in accordance with
                Section 6.3, to Co-Detail Products in the U.S. and/or Canada.

          b.    GENE hereby grants to Amgen an exclusive (subject to GENE's
                option to Co-Detail in the U.S. and Canada as set forth in
                Section 6.3), royalty-bearing license, with a right to
                sublicense, under the *****, GENE Program Patent Rights related
                to the Research Field, GENE Program Know-How related to the
                Research Field, and GENE's interest in Joint Patent Rights and
                Joint Know-How, and a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, with
                a right to sublicense, under GENE Background Patent Rights and
                GENE Background Know-How to make, have made, use, sell, offer to
                sell, import, export or otherwise transfer physical possession
                of or otherwise transfer title in Products in the Field of Use
                in the Territory. Amgen hereby agrees that any sublicensee shall
                as a condition of such sublicense agree to be bound by the terms
                and conditions of this Agreement.

          c.    The Parties agree that GENE shall have the sole right to

                only upon the prior written approval of Amgen, which may be
                withheld if in Amgen's sole opinion the commercialization of
                such Diagnostic Uses would be detrimental to the Development or
                Commercialization of any Product, and retain any financial
                benefit realized in connection with such commercialization. Upon
                GENE's receipt of such written approval, Amgen shall be deemed

                its Affiliates and sublicensees have the right to develop
                Diagnostic Uses for the purposes of conducting human clinical
                trials and obtaining Regulatory Approvals of any Product.

  9.3     Other Intellectual Property Licenses.

          a.    Amgen hereby grants to GENE a ***** license under Amgen's entire
                right, title and interest in any copyrights and any other

                and display such promotional materials in connection with
                Products in the United States and Canada solely in compliance
                with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  9.4     Patent Prosecution.

          a.    Amgen shall have the first right (using mutually acceptable
                outside counsel), but not the obligation, for the preparation,
                filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense before all patent
                offices (and courts to the extent an appeal is taken from a
                patent office decision) of ***** and Joint Patent Rights at
                Amgen's expense.

                Amgen shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to
                prepare, file, prosecute, maintain and defend before all patent
                offices all Amgen Background Patent Rights and Amgen Program
                Patent Rights not related to the Research Field at Amgen's
                expense. GENE shall have the sole right, but not the obligation,
                to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain and defend before all
                patent offices all GENE Background Patent Rights and GENE
                Program Patent Rights not related to the Research Field at
                GENE's expense.

          b.    With respect to its activities pursuant to Section 9.4.a., Amgen
                shall instruct such outside counsel in writing to act in the
                best interests of both Parties under this Agreement and Amgen
                will keep GENE informed of the progress with regard to the
                preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense before
                all patent offices (and courts to the extent an appeal is taken
                from a patent office decision) of ***** and Joint Patent Rights
                and instruct such outside counsel to furnish to GENE copies of
                all relevant documents filed with the various patent offices
                around the world. GENE shall have the right to review and
                comment on any papers pertaining to proposed applications,
                responses, interferences and oppositions before the filing
                thereof by such outside counsel with any such patent office and
                Amgen will instruct such outside counsel to timely provide such
                papers and consider in good faith such comments of GENE relating
                to ***** and Joint Patent Rights.

          c.    GENE shall cooperate with Amgen and such outside counsel and
                render all reasonable assistance in filing, prosecuting,
                maintaining and defending all intellectual property licensed
                under this Agreement and shall sign any necessary legal papers
                and provide such outside counsel with data or other information
                in GENE's Control which is reasonably requested by Amgen in
                support thereof (and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
                the cooperation of any of its employees, consultants and agents
                as might reasonably be requested).

          d.    If Amgen determines in its sole discretion not to file,
                prosecute, defend or maintain any Patent Right within ***** and
                Joint Patent Rights referred to in Section 9.4.a. above in any
                country, and further providing that no other patent applications
                or patents claiming the same or similar subject matter are then
                pending or issued in that same country, then Amgen shall provide
                GENE with thirty (30) days prior written notice of such
                determination and GENE shall have the right and opportunity to
                file, prosecute, defend and/or maintain such Patent Right on
                behalf of the Parties at GENE's expense.

  9.5     Trademark Prosecution. Amgen shall be responsible (using mutually
          acceptable outside counsel) for the filing, prosecution, defense and
          maintenance before all trademark offices of the Product Trademarks at
          Amgen's expense.

  9.6     Patent and Trademark Prosecution Expenses. With respect to carrying
          out the activities under Sections 9.4 and 9.5, Amgen shall have the
          right to charge all of Amgen's external costs, expenses and fees (as
          documented by written invoices for

                                       26

<PAGE>

          legal services and receipts for filing, maintenance and other fees
          paid) to have outside counsel prepare, file, prosecute, maintain
          and/or defend *****, Joint Patent Rights, Amgen Background Patent
          Rights related to Products and Product Trademarks before all patent
          and trademark offices (and courts to the extent an appeal is taken
          from a patent office decision) as a Development Cost if incurred
          during Development and, if GENE elects to share profits pursuant to
          Section 6.2, to the extent such costs, expenses and fees pertain to
          such activities in the U.S. and/or Canada (as appropriate) as a
          Commercialization Expense.

  9.7     Patent Infringement by Third Parties.

          a.    GENE and Amgen will promptly notify the other in writing after
                becoming aware of any alleged or threatened infringement of any
                patent included in ***** and Joint Patent Rights or any right
                relating to ***** and Joint Know-How.

          b.    By counsel of its own choice, Amgen shall have the sole right
                but not the obligation to bring, defend, control and maintain
                (including the right to settle or compromise) any suit or action
                against a Third Party for infringement or declaratory relief of
                a claim of an issued patent within *****, Joint Patent Rights
                and Amgen Background Patent Rights and any right relating to
                ***** and Joint Know-How. In the event Amgen shall so engage in
                any such litigation, Amgen shall seek and reasonably consider
                GENE's comment before determining the strategy with respect to
                any such litigation. GENE shall cooperate and, if Amgen finds it
                necessary or desirable, join Amgen as a party in any such
                litigation (at Amgen's expense with respect to external costs
                and expenses incurred by GENE), including the signing of any
                necessary legal papers, and shall provide Amgen with data or
                other information in support thereof, and shall use reasonable
                best efforts to ensure the cooperation of any of its personnel
                as might reasonably be requested in any such matters.
                Notwithstanding the above, in any such settlement or compromise
                of any such litigation, Amgen will not admit the invalidity of
                any claim within ***** and Joint Patent Rights without the prior
                written approval of GENE, which approval shall not be
                unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          c.    Without the prior written approval of Amgen, GENE shall not
                bring any suit or action against a Third Party developing or
                commercializing any product which interacts with *****.

  9.8     Trademark Infringement by Third Parties. At its own expense and by
          counsel of its own choice, Amgen shall have the sole right but not the
          obligation to enforce the Product Trademarks against any actual,
          alleged or threatened infringement by Third Parties or from any unfair
          trade practices, trade dress imitation, passing off of counterfeit
          goods or like offenses. GENE shall cooperate in any such enforcement
          or defense and shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure the
          cooperation of any of its personnel as might reasonably be requested
          in any such matters.

  9.9     Infringement of Third Party Rights.

                                       27

<PAGE>

          a.    Each Party will promptly notify the other in writing of any
                allegation by a Third Party that the activity of either of the
                Parties pursuant to this Agreement infringes or may infringe the
                intellectual property rights of such Third Party.

          b.    Amgen shall have the sole right and responsibility to defend any
                actual, alleged or threatened claim or action which names Amgen
                and/or GENE and which claims the infringement of (i) Third Party
                Patent Rights or other intellectual property rights through the
                making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, importing
                exporting or otherwise transferring physical possession of or
                otherwise transferring title in a Product or (ii) any Third
                Party trade name, service mark, logo or trademark by the use of
                Product Trademark(s). In the event that GENE is a named Party in
                any such defense, Amgen shall seek and reasonably consider
                GENE's comment before determining the strategy of such defense.
                If necessary, GENE will assist and cooperate with Amgen in any
                such defense (at Amgen's expense with respect to external costs
                and expenses incurred by GENE).

  9.10    Infringement Expenses. Amgen, in bringing or defending a suit against
          infringers under Sections 9.7 and 9.8 and defending a suit pursuant to
          Section 9.9, shall be entitled to charge all external costs, fees and
          expenses (including attorneys' fees of outside counsel) incurred by
          such Party to carry out the activities described in Sections 9.7-9.9
          as a Development Cost if incurred during Development and, if GENE
          elects to share profits pursuant to Section 6.2, to the extent such
          costs, expenses and fees pertain to such activities in the U.S. and/or
          Canada (as appropriate) as a Commercialization Expense. Each Party
          shall bear its own internal costs and expenses incurred in carrying
          out the activities described in Sections 9.7-9.9. *****

  9.11    Third Party Licenses. Amgen shall have final decision making authority
          with respect to determining whether to enter into any agreement it (in
          its sole discretion) deems necessary for a license or other rights or
          to incur an obligation for any Third Party payments for a license to
          any Third Party of Patent Rights and other intellectual property
          rights necessary or useful to make, have made, use, sell, offer to
          sell, import, export or otherwise transfer physical possession of or
          otherwise transfer title in Products in the Field of Use in the
          Territory.

  9.12    Waiver. GENE, on behalf of itself and its directors, employees,
          officers, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns hereby waives
          any and all actions and causes of action, claims and demands
          whatsoever, in law or equity, of any kind it or they may have against
          Amgen, its directors, employees, officers, shareholders, agents,
          successors and assigns which may arise in any way in the performance
          of its rights or obligations under Sections 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8 and
          9.9, except as a result of Amgen's gross negligence, recklessness or
          willful misconduct.

                            PAYMENTS; RECORDS; AUDIT

  10.1    Payment; Reports. Beginning with ***** the First Commercial Sale of
          the first Product occurs until the expiration of Amgen's obligation to
          pay royalties, royalty payments and reports of the sale of Products
          for each ***** will be calculated and delivered to GENE under this
          Agreement within ***** days of the end of each such *****, unless
          otherwise specifically provided herein. Each payment of royalties will
          be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
          account as may be designated in writing by GENE to Amgen and followed
          up with a report of Net Sales of Products in sufficient detail to
          permit confirmation of the accuracy of the royalty payment made,
          including, without limitation and on a country-by-country basis, the
          number of Products sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Products,
          the royalties payable (in U.S. dollars), the method used to calculate
          the royalty and the exchange rates used. Amgen will keep complete and
          accurate records pertaining to the sale or other disposition of
          Products in sufficient detail to permit GENE to confirm the accuracy
          of all payments due hereunder.

  10.2    Exchange Rate. All payments hereunder will be payable in U.S. dollars.
          With respect to each *****, for countries other than the United
          States, whenever conversion of payments from any foreign currency will
          be required, such conversion will be made at the rate of exchange at
          the close of business on the 25th day (or the next business day
          thereafter) of each month in the ***** (or such other day as Amgen
          subsequently uses in consolidating its corporate accounts) for that
          particular month's Net Sales, as reported in Bloomberg Professional (a
          service of Bloomberg L.P.), or in the event Bloomberg Professional is
          not available then The Wall Street Journal, for the currency of the
          country in which the sale is made.

  10.3    Tax Withholding. If laws, rules or regulations require withholding of
          income taxes or other taxes, assessments and/or imposed upon payments
          set forth in Article 8, Amgen will make such withholding payments as
          required and will subtract such withholding payments from the payments
          set forth in Article 8. Amgen will promptly submit proof of payment of
          the withholding taxes to GENE in a form sufficient to permit GENE to
          document such tax withholding for purposes of claiming foreign tax
          credits and similar benefits.

  10.4    Blocked Currency. With respect to receipt of a foreign currency for
          sales of Products, if Amgen or its Affiliates are unable to convert
          such foreign currency into United States Dollars for reasons beyond
          their respective control, or are restricted by law or regulation from
          remitting funds from any country of sale, Amgen shall promptly notify
          GENE and cause such payment to be made by deposit to the credit and
          account of GENE (or their respective nominee(s)) in any commercial
          bank designated by GENE in the applicable country or if none is
          designated by GENE within thirty (30) days of such notice from Amgen,
          in a recognized banking institution selected by Amgen and identified
          in a written notice to GENE. Amgen shall promptly deliver to GENE
          proper evidence of such deposit.

                                       29

  10.5    Audits. Each Party will keep complete and accurate records pertaining
          to, with respect to Amgen, (i) the sale or other disposition of
          Products including payments pursuant to the Product Contribution, (ii)
          Development Costs and (iii) Detailing Costs, and with respect to GENE,
          (i) the number of FTEs actually engaged in activities under the
          Research Program, (ii) Development Costs and (iii) Detailing Costs, in
          each case in sufficient detail to permit the other Party to confirm
          the accuracy of all payments due hereunder, and such records will be
          open to inspection for ***** years following the end of the period to
          which they pertain. Not more than once per year, each Party will have
          the right, upon at least ***** business days' prior written notice, to
          cause an independent, certified public accountant reasonably
          acceptable to the other Party to audit such records to confirm such
          payments and associated costs therewith for a period covering not more
          than the preceding ***** years, such audit to be conducted during
          normal working hours on any business day. Such audit may take place no
          more than ***** during usual business hours for the sole purpose of
          and only to the extent necessary to verify the completeness and
          accuracy of the records and payments made under this Agreement. The
          independent certified public accountant(s) shall keep confidential any
          information obtained during such inspection and shall report to the
          Party conducting the audit (the "Auditing Party") only the amount of
          payment due and payable related to the subject matter of the audit,
          but may include, in the event the accountant shall be unable to verify
          the correctness of any or all of such payment, the unverifiable amount
          of such payment and information relating to why any or all of such
          payment is unverifiable. The Party being audited (the "Audited Party")
          shall receive a copy of each such report concurrently with receipt by
          the Auditing Party. The Auditing Party shall pay the fees and expenses
          of the accountant engaged to perform the audit, unless such audit
          reveals a net discrepancy of ***** or more for the period examined
          which is to the disadvantage of the Auditing Party, in which case the
          Audited Party shall pay such fees and expenses and any other payment
          due within thirty (30) days following the completion of such audit;
          provided however, that any estimates of revenues, costs, fees or
          expenses later reconciled to actuals shall not count toward such
          discrepancy. Upon the expiration of ***** years following the end of
          any particular Calendar Year, the calculation of any such amounts
          payable with respect to such particular Calendar Year shall be binding
          and conclusive upon the Auditing Party, and the Audited Party (and its
          Affiliates in the case of Amgen) shall be released from any liability
          or accountability with respect to such amounts for such Calendar Year,
          other than any liability related to fraudulent records or records
          fraudulently withheld by the Audited Party (and its Affiliates in the
          case of Amgen).

  10.6    Confidentiality. Each Party shall treat all financial information
          subject to review under Article 8 as the other Party's Confidential
          Information. Both Parties shall cause their respective accounting firm
          to be bound to obligations of confidentiality at least as restrictive
          as such Party's obligations of confidentiality in this Agreement.

                                  PUBLICATIONS

  11.1    Publications.

          a.    The Parties hereby acknowledge the publication rights granted
                pursuant to the *****. Amgen agrees that as between the Parties,
                GENE shall have the sole right to publish the identification of
                the ***** with the consultation of Amgen; provided however, GENE
                shall use its best efforts to prevent the publication of such
                results in a manner which would jeopardize Amgen's proprietary
                position in the Research Field such as *****.

          b.    Amgen shall have the sole right to publish the results of any
                and all pre-clinical and clinical studies of Products without
                the consultation of GENE, subject to its confidentiality
                obligations under Article 12.

          c.    Subject to Section 11.2.a. below, both Parties shall have the
                right to publish scientific results and other related
                Information of any and all work conducted during the Research
                Program related to the Research Field, excluding the results of
                pre-clinical studies of Products, which are publishable pursuant
                to Section 11.1.b.

          d.    Subject to Section 11.2.b. below, each Party shall have the sole
                right to publish their respective Program Know-How not related
                to the Research Field.

  11.2    Procedure.

          a.    For purposes of publication pursuant to Section 11.1.c. above,
                neither Party will publish without the prior review and written
                approval of *****. Each Party will submit to ***** any paper
                proposed for publication by such Party that relates to both the
                Research Program and to the Research Field, including oral
                presentations and abstracts. Before any such paper is submitted
                for publication or an oral presentation is made, the Party
                publishing or presenting will deliver a complete copy of the
                paper or abstract or materials for oral presentation to ***** at
                least ***** days prior to submitting the paper to a publisher or
                making the presentation. Notwithstanding the prior written
                approval of ***** to publish, upon the request of the other
                Party, the publishing Party will delete references to the other
                Party's Confidential Information in any such paper, materials
                and abstracts and agrees to withhold publication of same for an
                additional ***** days in order to permit the Parties to obtain
                patent protection, if either of the Parties deems it necessary,
                in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          b.    For purposes of publication pursuant to Section 11.1.d. above,
                each Party will have the right to review any paper proposed for
                publication by the other Party that relates to the other Party's
                Program Know-How not related to the Research Field, including
                oral presentations and abstracts. Before any such paper is
                submitted for

                                       31

<PAGE>

                publication or an oral presentation is made, the Party
                publishing or presenting will deliver a complete copy of the
                paper or abstract or materials for oral presentation to the
                other Party at least ***** days prior to submitting the paper to
                a publisher or making the presentation. The other Party will
                review any such paper and give its comments to the publishing
                Party within ***** days after the delivery of such paper to the
                other Party. Amgen may request, and GENE shall comply with such
                request, that any such publication or oral presentation of GENE
                is delayed, modified or withheld if it reasonably considers that
                such publication or oral presentation would be detrimental to
                Patent Rights or would have other detrimental consequences on
                the Development or Commercialization of any Product. With
                respect to oral presentation materials and abstracts, the other
                Party will make reasonable efforts to expedite review of such
                materials and abstracts, and will return such items as soon as
                practicable to the presenting Party with appropriate comments,
                if any, but in no event later than ***** days after the delivery
                to the other Party. The publishing Party will comply with the
                other Party's request to delete references to the other Party's
                Confidential Information in any such paper, materials and
                abstracts and agrees to withhold publication of same for an
                additional ***** days in order to permit the Parties to obtain
                patent protection, if either of the Parties deems it necessary,
                in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  11.3    Acknowledgment. Any such publication or presentation subject to
          Sections 11.1 and 11.2 will include recognition of the contributions
          of the other Party according to standard practice for assigning
          scientific credit, either through authorship or acknowledgment, as may
          be appropriate.

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

  12.1    Treatment of Confidential Information. The Parties agree that during
          the Term, and for a period of five (5) years after this Agreement
          expires or terminates, with respect to the other Party's Confidential
          Information, each Party shall (a) maintain in confidence such
          Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its
          own confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of
          similar kind and value (but at a minimum each Party shall use
          reasonable best efforts to maintain such Confidential Information in
          confidence); (b) not disclose such Confidential Information to any
          Third Party without prior written consent of the other Party, except
          for disclosures to its Affiliates and, pursuant to Section 17.7, to
          authorized subcontractors who agree to be bound by obligations of
          non-disclosure and non-use at least as stringent as those contained in
          this Article 12; and (c) not use such Confidential Information for any
          purpose except those purposes permitted by this Agreement. Neither
          Party shall knowingly disclose to the other Party any Third Party
          information or know-how that such Party does not have the legal right
          to disclose to the other Party and/or has a contractual obligation not
          to disclose to the other Party.

  12.2    Authorized Disclosure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
          Agreement, unless otherwise specified below, each Party may disclose
          Confidential Information of the other Party:

          a.    to the extent and to the persons and entities as required by an
                applicable law, rule, regulation, legal process, court order or
                the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers or
                of a Regulatory Authority;

          b.    as necessary to file, prosecute or defend those patent
                applications or patents for which such Party has the right to
                assume filing, prosecution, defense or maintenance, pursuant to
                Section 9.4 of this Agreement;

          c.    to prosecute or defend litigation or otherwise establish rights
                or enforce obligations pursuant to its rights under this
                Agreement, but only to the extent that any such disclosure is
                necessary;

          d.    (solely with respect to Amgen) in the event of a recall of a
                Product; or

          e.    to such Party's employees, consultants and agents who have a
                need to know and who have an obligation to treat such
                information as confidential.

  The Party required or intending to disclose the other Party's Confidential
  Information under Section 12.2.c. shall first have given prompt notice to such
  other Party to enable it to seek any available exemptions from or limitations
  on such disclosure requirement and shall reasonably cooperate in such efforts
  by the other Party.

  12.3    Publicity; Terms of Agreement. The Parties agree that the existence of
          and the material terms of this Agreement shall be considered
          Confidential Information of both Parties, subject to the special
          authorized disclosure provisions set forth below in this Section 12.3
          (in lieu of the authorized disclosure provisions set forth in Section
          12.2, to the extent of any conflict) and without limiting the
          generality of the definition of Confidential Information. The Parties
          will mutually agree on the text of a press release announcing the
          execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, if either Party desires to
          make a public announcement concerning this Agreement or the terms
          hereof, such Party shall give reasonable prior advance notice of the
          proposed text of such announcement to the other Party for its prior
          review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
          delayed. With respect to GENE's public announcement of the achievement
          of each of the milestones set forth in Section 8.9, GENE shall make
          such announcement within ***** working days of the achievement of such
          milestone as determined in accordance with the provisions of this
          Agreement. A Party shall not be required to seek the permission of the
          other Party to repeat any information as to the terms of this
          Agreement that has already been publicly disclosed by such Party in
          accordance with the foregoing or by the other Party. Either Party may
          disclose the terms of this Agreement to potential investors who agree
          to be bound by obligations of non-disclosure and non-use at least as
          stringent as those contained in this Agreement. The Parties
          acknowledge that Amgen and/or GENE

                                       33

<PAGE>

          may be obligated to file a copy of this Agreement and/or the Stock
          Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
          with its next quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an annual report on Form
          10-K or a current report on Form 8-K or with any registration
          statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
          pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and each such
          Party shall be entitled to make such filing, provided however, that it
          requests confidential treatment of the more sensitive terms hereof to
          the extent such confidential treatment is reasonably available to the
          filing Party under the circumstances then prevailing. In the event of
          any such filing, the filing Party will provide the non-filing Party
          with an advance copy of this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement
          marked to show provisions for which the filing Party intends to seek
          confidential treatment, and the filing Party shall reasonably consider
          the non-filing Party's timely comments thereon.

  12.4    Prohibition on Solicitation. Without the written consent of the other
          Party, neither Party nor its Affiliates shall, during the term of this
          Agreement or for a period of one year following the expiration or
          termination of this Agreement, solicit (directly or indirectly) any
          person who was employed by such Party or its Affiliates and
          participated in the Research Program at any time during the term of
          this Agreement. This provision shall not restrict either Party or its
          Affiliates from advertising employment opportunities in any manner
          that does not directly target the other Party or its Affiliates.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

  13.1    Indemnification by Amgen. Except for claims defended pursuant to
          Section 9.10, Amgen hereby agrees to defend, hold harmless and
          indemnify (collectively "Indemnify" or "Indemnified") GENE and its
          agents, directors, officers and employees (the "GENE Indemnitees")
          from and against any and all Losses resulting directly or indirectly
          from any Third Party (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude
          employees, agents or independent contractors of Amgen and/or GENE)
          claims, suits, actions or demands arising out of (a) any of Amgen's
          representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being
          untrue in any material respect when made; (b) any material breach or
          material default by Amgen of its covenants and obligations under this
          Agreement; (c) Amgen's negligence or intentional misconduct (or the
          negligence or intentional misconduct of any agent, independent
          contractor, Third Party engaged by Amgen, Affiliate or sublicensee of
          Amgen) in carrying out its activities set forth in the Research Plan
          and in Developing and Commercializing Product(s); and (d) the
          Development, manufacture, import, use or sale of any Product(s) by
          Amgen or any Affiliate, sublicensee, distributor or agent of Amgen,
          but excluding any Product(s) for which GENE shall have elected to
          contribute to any Development Costs pursuant to Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
          and 4.5 or share profits pursuant to Section 6.2.

  13.2    Indemnification by GENE. GENE hereby agrees to Indemnify Amgen and its
          Affiliates, agents, directors, officers and employees (the "Amgen
          Indemnitees") from

                                       34

<PAGE>

          and against any and all Losses resulting directly or indirectly from
          any Third Party (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude
          employees, agents or independent contractors of Amgen and/or GENE)
          claims, suits, actions or demands arising out of (a) any of GENE's
          representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being
          untrue in any material respect when made; (b) any material breach or
          material default by GENE of its covenants and obligations under this
          Agreement; (c) GENE's negligence or intentional misconduct (or the
          negligence or intentional misconduct of any agent, independent
          contractor, Third Party engaged by GENE or Affiliate of GENE) in
          carrying out its activities set forth in the Research Plan and in
          Co-Detailing Product(s); and (d) the development, manufacture, import,
          use or sale of any product(s) related to Diagnostic Uses by GENE or
          any Affiliate, sublicensee, distributor or agent of GENE.

  13.3    Indemnification Procedure. To be eligible to be so Indemnified as
          described in Section 13.1 or Section 13.2 above, each of the GENE
          Indemnitees or Amgen Indemnitees, as the case may be (the
          "Indemnitee(s)"), seeking to be Indemnified, shall provide the Party
          required to Indemnify the Indemnitee(s) (the "Indemnifying Party")
          with prompt notice of any claim (with a description of the claim and
          the nature and amount of any such Loss) giving rise to the
          indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 13.1 or Section 13.2,
          as the case may be, and the exclusive ability to defend such claim but
          for the differing interests exception set forth below (with the
          reasonable cooperation of Indemnitee(s)); provided however, that the
          failure to provide notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
          its obligations except to the extent any failure by the Indemnitee(s)
          to deliver prompt notice shall have been prejudicial to its ability to
          defend such action. Each Indemnitee(s) shall have the right to retain
          its own counsel, at its own expense, if representation of the counsel
          of the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or
          potential differing interests between such Indemnitee(s) and the
          Indemnifying Party. Neither the Indemnitee(s) nor the Indemnifying
          Party shall settle or consent to the entry of any judgment with
          respect to any claim for Losses for which indemnification is sought,
          without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be
          unreasonably withheld); provided however, the Indemnifying Party shall
          have the right to settle or compromise any claim for Losses without
          such prior written consent if the settlement or compromise provides
          for an unconditional release of the Indemnitee(s). The Indemnifying
          Party's obligation to Indemnify the Indemnitee(s) pursuant to this
          Section 13.3 shall not apply to the extent of any Losses (i) that
          arise from the negligence or intentional misconduct of any Indemnitee
          (including but not limited to, in the case of GENE Indemnitees, those
          Losses arising from Research Plan activities and the Co-Detailing of
          Product(s) by GENE, or, in the case of Amgen Indemnitees, those Losses
          arising from Research Plan activities and the Development or
          Commercialization of Product(s) by Amgen); or (ii) that, in the case
          of GENE Indemnitees, arise from the breach by GENE or, in the case of
          Amgen Indemnitees, arise from the breach by Amgen, of any
          representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement;
          or (iii) that arise from the failure of the Indemnitee(s) to take
          reasonable action to mitigate any Losses.

                                       35

  13.4    Insurance. Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, each
          Party shall at its own expense procure and maintain during the term of
          this Agreement insurance adequate to cover its obligations hereunder
          and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent
          companies similarly situated. Amgen may self-insure all or part of
          such insurance. GENE may self-insure part of any such insurance;
          provided however, that GENE shall at all times maintain the following
          minimum Third Party insurance coverage:

                        TYPE OF COVERAGE                      AMOUNT (AGGREGATE)

                                                                   *****
                Commercial General Liability Insurance

                                                                   *****
                Excess Liability Insurance

                Worker's Compensation                              *****

                Employer's Liability                               *****

          The Parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith the amount of
          product liability insurance that GENE shall maintain in the event that
          GENE elects to Co-Detail pursuant to Section 6.3. Each insurance
          policy required by and procured by a Party under this Section 13.4
          shall name the other Party as an additional insured except for
          Worker's Compensation. Such insurance shall not be construed to create
          a limit of the insuring Party's liability with respect to its
          indemnification obligations under this Article 13. Each Party shall
          provide the other Party with a certificate of insurance or other
          evidence of such insurance and/or self-insurance, upon request. Each
          Party shall provide the other Party with written notice at least
          thirty (30) days prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or a material
          change in such insurance or self-insurance, which materially adversely
          affects the rights of the other Party hereunder. An Indemnifying
          Party's insurance shall be primary and non-contributing.

  13.5.   Pre-Effective Date Losses. In connection with this Agreement, Amgen
          shall not assume or be liable for any Losses resulting from or arising
          in connection with the activities of GENE (or any agent, independent
          contractor or Third Party engaged by GENE) relating to Research Field
          on or prior to the Effective Date.

  13.6    Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES
          SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
          DAMAGES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR
          OTHERWISE INCURRED BY THE OTHER PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
          AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES MEASURING LOST PROFITS
          OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  14.1    Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each Party represents and
          warrants to the other that:

          a.    it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under
                the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has full
                power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry
                out the provisions hereof;

          b.    the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
                of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
                authorized by all necessary corporate action of such Party, and
                the person executing this Agreement on behalf of each Party has
                been duly authorized to do so by requisite corporate action;

          c.    the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
                of the transactions contemplated hereby will not violate such
                Party's corporate charter, bylaws or any other organizational
                document, other contractual obligations (express or implied) it
                has or may have, or any judgment of any court or governmental
                body applicable to such Party or its properties or, to such
                Party's knowledge, any statute, decree, order, rule or
                regulation of any court or governmental agency or body
                applicable to such Party or its properties, in each case, which
                violation, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
                likely have a materially adverse effect on its business or
                financial condition or its ability to perform its obligations
                hereunder;

          d.    the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not and will
                not require any consent or approval of any governmental entity
                or person;

          e.    this Agreement is a legally binding obligation of such Party and
                enforceable against such Party according to its terms; except as
                enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent
                conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
                laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by
                general equitable principles and public policy constraints
                (including those pertaining to limitations and/or exclusions of
                liability, competition law, penalties and jurisdictional issues
                including conflicts of law); and

          f.    except as disclosed in any documents filed with the Securities
                and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act as of the
                Effective Date, such Party is not aware of any facts or
                circumstances, individually or in the aggregate, which would be
                reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on such
                Party's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  14.2    Mutual Covenants. Each Party covenants to the other that:

                                       37

<PAGE>

          a.    all activities conducted by that Party under the Research
                Program will comply in all material respects with all applicable
                government laws, regulations and guidelines, including those
                relating to work with recombinant DNA;

          b.    it shall not enter into any collaboration with, or render
                services for, a Third Party whereby such collaboration or
                services with or for such Third Party will negatively impact the
                timely accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the
                Research Program; and

          c.    it shall not knowingly misappropriate the trade secret of a
                Third Party in connection with the performance of its activities
                under the Research Program.

  14.3    Additional Representations, Warranties and Covenants of GENE.

          a.    As of the Effective Date, GENE has provided Amgen with all
                Material Information (as defined below) which is necessary for
                Amgen to decide the merits of entering into this Agreement,
                including without limitation, all Material Information relating
                to the representations and warranties of this Section 14.3 and
                all Material Information concerning the ***** and GENE's efforts
                to date in identifying and characterizing the *****, and all
                such provided Material Information is, to the best knowledge of
                GENE, true in all material respects. For purposes of this
                Section 14.3, the term "Material Information" means all
                information required to make the disclosed information
                substantially complete and not misleading which is in GENE's
                possession and control and which GENE is permitted to share with
                Amgen without violating the terms of any agreement between GENE
                and any Third Party.

          b.    As of the Effective Date, and with respect to Material
                Information as defined in Section 14.3.a. above, GENE is not
                aware of any Third Party information that it has not disclosed
                to Amgen that would materially affect Amgen's decision regarding
                the merits of entering into this Agreement.

          c.    As of the Effective Date, GENE has sufficient legal and/or
                beneficial title and ownership under, or sufficient rights to
                use and license, the *****, GENE Background Patent Rights and
                GENE Background Know-How as is necessary to fulfill its
                obligations under this Agreement and to grant the licenses to
                Amgen pursuant to this Agreement. As of the Effective Date GENE
                has not granted, and shall not during the term of this
                Agreement, grant any right, license, covenant, consent or
                privilege to any Third Party or otherwise undertake any action,
                either directly or indirectly, which would conflict in a
                material respect with the rights granted to Amgen or interfere
                in any material respect with any obligations of GENE set forth
                in this Agreement.

          d.    *****

                                       38

<PAGE>

          e.    GENE has maintained and shall maintain and keep in full force
                and effect all agreements (including license agreements, e.g.
                *****) and filings (including patent filings) necessary to
                perform its obligations hereunder. GENE (i) shall not consent to
                any termination, modification, amendment or waiver of any of its
                rights under ***** that may materially and adversely affect
                Amgen's rights under this Agreement, without first obtaining
                Amgen's prior written consent, which, with respect to matters
                not related to the Research Field, such consent shall not be
                reasonably withheld or delayed, (ii) has not and will not take
                or fail to take any action that may lead to the termination,
                modification, amendment or waiver of its rights under ***** that
                would materially and adversely affect Amgen's rights under this
                Agreement, and (iii) has and will take all necessary actions,
                including without limitation payment of all fees to timely
                exercise its option with respect to the subject matter of this
                Agreement under *****. As of the Effective Date, GENE has not
                received any notice of default, and, to the best of its
                knowledge, is not in default of its obligations under *****.

          f.    As of the Effective Date, there is no pending or, to the best
                knowledge of GENE, threatened litigation, and GENE has not
                received any communication which alleges that GENE's activities
                with respect to the ***** or proposed activities under this
                Agreement would infringe or misappropriate any intellectual
                property rights of any Third Party.

          g.    GENE has disclosed to Amgen all Material Information (as defined
                above) of which GENE is aware and which GENE reasonably believes
                to be material to the validity of the *****. Exhibit 2 contains
                the complete list of ***** as of the Effective Date.

          h.    GENE has provided Amgen with a *****.

          i.    GENE covenants that during the term of this Agreement GENE shall
                work exclusively with Amgen regarding the Research Field.

  14.4    Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
          FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR
          WARRANTY TO THE OTHER PARTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, VALIDITY OF THE PATENT RIGHTS LICENSED HEREUNDER,
          OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD
          PARTIES. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a
          representation or warranty by either Party that any Product Developed
          or Commercialized is or will be effective, valuable, safe, non-toxic
          or patentable.

                              TERM AND TERMINATION

  15.1    Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and
          shall remain in full force and effect, unless earlier terminated
          pursuant to this Article 15, until such time as Amgen provides written
          notice to GENE that it no longer (i) intends to Develop or
          Commercialize Products or (ii) is Developing or Commercializing
          Products.

  15.2    Termination by Amgen.

          a.    If the ***** has not been identified, as that research milestone
                is defined in Section 8.4.a., on or before ***** months from the
                Effective Date, Amgen may, at its option, provide written notice
                of termination to GENE at any time thereafter until such time as
                the ***** is identified or Amgen elects to advance the Research
                Program to the ***** of the Research Plan pursuant to Section
                8.4.a., and the Agreement shall automatically terminate *****
                days after such prior written notice of termination is provided
                to GENE.

          b.    At any time after the ***** has been identified, Amgen shall
                have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this
                Agreement by providing ***** days prior written notice of
                termination to GENE.

          c.    The effects of any such termination under this Section 15.2 will
                occur in accordance with Section 15.6.

  15.3    Termination for Default.

          a.    In the event any material representation or warranty made
                hereunder by either Party shall have been untrue in any material
                respect ("Representation Default"), or upon any material breach
                or material default of a material obligation under this
                Agreement a Party ("Performance Default"), the Party not in
                default ("Non-Defaulting Party") must first give the other Party
                ("Defaulting Party") written notice thereof ("Notice of
                Default"), which notice must state the nature of the
                Representation Default or Performance Default in reasonable
                detail and must request that the Defaulting Party cure such
                Representation Default or Performance Default within ***** days.
                During any such ***** after receipt or delivery of a Notice of
                Default under this Section 15.3.a. for which termination of this
                Agreement is a remedy under Sections 15.3.b. and 15.3.c., all of
                the Party's respective rights and obligations under the affected
                parts of this Agreement, including but not limited to
                Development, manufacture and Commercialization, shall (to the
                extent applicable) remain in force and effect. If the Defaulting
                Party shall dispute the existence, extent or nature of any
                default set forth in a Notice of Default, the Parties shall use
                good faith efforts to resolve the dispute in accordance with
                Sections 2.4 and 2.5.

                                       40

          b.    GENE Default. In the event of a Performance Default by GENE that
                shall not have been cured within the period set forth in Section
                15.3.a. above after receipt of a Notice of Default, Amgen may,
                at its option, but in lieu of any right to terminate this
                Agreement, exercise the rights set forth in Section 15.4 upon
                prior written notice to GENE. In the event of a Representation
                Default by GENE that shall not have been cured within the period
                set forth in Section 15.3.a. above after receipt of a Notice of
                Default, Amgen may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon
                ***** days prior written notice to GENE and, in addition to any
                other remedies which may be available at law or equity, Amgen
                shall have the right to (i) *****, each with respect to a
                representation(s) other than the representations set forth in
                subparts a., c., e. and h. of Section 14.3, provided however,
                that Amgen shall have provided such Notice of Default within
                ***** months after the Effective Date or before the
                identification of the *****, whichever is later; (ii) *****,
                each with respect to a representation(s) set forth in subpart a.
                of Section 14.3, provided however, that Amgen shall have
                provided such Notice of Default ***** months after the Effective
                Date or before the identification of the *****, whichever is
                later; and (iii) *****.

          c.    Amgen Default. In the event of a Representation Default by Amgen
                that shall not have been cured within the period set forth in
                Section 15.3.a. above after receipt of a Notice of Default,
                GENE, at its option, may terminate this Agreement upon *****
                days prior written notice to Amgen. In the event that any
                Performance Default by Amgen arises out of (i) *****; (ii)
                *****; (iii) *****; or (iv) *****, that in each case shall not
                have been cured within the period set forth in Section 15.3.a.
                above after receipt of a Notice of Default, GENE, at its option,
                may terminate this Agreement upon ***** prior written notice to
                Amgen. The effects of such termination will occur in accordance
                with Section 15.6. In the event of a Performance Default by
                Amgen other than regarding subsections (i) through (iv) of this
                Section 15.3.c. that shall not have been cured within the period
                set forth in Section 15.3.a. above after receipt of a Notice of
                Default, GENE shall only be entitled to seek legal remedies, but
                shall not be entitled to terminate or seek termination of this
                Agreement, and all of Amgen's rights and obligations under this
                Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

  15.4    Effects of GENE Default. In addition to any other remedies which may
          be available at law or equity, but not the right to terminate or seek
          termination of this Agreement, upon any uncured Performance Default by
          GENE under Section 15.3(b), the following rights and obligations of
          the Parties shall apply:

          a.    In the event that such uncured Performance Default arises out of
                GENE's obligation to conduct the Research Program, (i) GENE's
                rights and obligations to participate in the Research Program
                pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 (including GENE's rights to
                participate in the Joint Research Committee and Joint Steering
                Committee to the extent that the JSC shall no longer have any
                oversight responsibility with respect to the Research Program)
                shall terminate, (ii) Amgen shall have the sole right and
                responsibility for all aspects of the Research Program

                                       41

<PAGE>

                going forward, and (iii) Amgen's obligations to fund GENE FTEs
                pursuant to Section 8.2 and pay GENE research milestone payments
                pursuant to Section 8.4 shall terminate.

          b.    In the event that such uncured Performance Default arises out of
                GENE's obligation to participate in Co-Detailing any Product,
                GENE's right to Co-Detail such Product pursuant to Sections 6.3
                and 6.4 (including its right to participate in the Joint Sales
                and Marketing Committee) shall terminate.

          c.    In the event that such uncured Performance Default arises out of
                GENE's failure to pay its share of Development Costs pursuant to
                Section 4.9, GENE's right to a Development Contribution Royalty
                under Section 8.6.b. shall terminate (but not its right to a
                Baseline Royalty under Section 8.6.a.). In addition, GENE's
                rights and obligations to contribute to Development Costs
                pursuant to Article 4 (including GENE's right to participate in
                the Joint Development Committee), GENE's right to share profits
                pursuant to Sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 and GENE's right to
                Co-Detail pursuant to Sections 6.3 and 6.4 shall terminate.

          d.    In the event that such uncured Performance Default arises out of
                GENE's failure to pay its share of Product Contribution pursuant
                to Section 6.8, GENE's right to share profits pursuant to
                Sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 shall terminate and GENE shall
                have no right to any royalty payments pursuant to Sections 8.6.a
                and 8.6.b with respect to the United States and/or Canada (as
                appropriate).

  15.5    Bankruptcy. All rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this
          Agreement by GENE are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for
          purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of
          rights to "intellectual property" as defined under Section 101 of the
          U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that Amgen shall retain and
          may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the U.S.
          Bankruptcy Code. The Parties further agree that, in the event of the
          commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by or against GENE under the
          U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Amgen shall be entitled to a complete duplicate
          of (or complete access to, as appropriate) any intellectual property
          and all embodiments of such intellectual property, and same, if not
          already in Amgen's possession, shall be promptly delivered to Amgen
          (i) upon any such commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding, upon
          Amgen's written request therefor, unless Gene (or a trustee on behalf
          of GENE) elects to continue to perform all of its obligations under
          this Agreement or (ii) if not delivered under (i) above, upon the
          rejection of this Agreement by or on behalf of GENE, upon written
          request therefor by Amgen.

  15.6    Effects of Termination. In addition to any other remedies which may be
          available at law or equity, upon termination of this Agreement under
          Section 15.2, Section 15.3.b. (except as specifically provided in
          Section 15.4) or Section 15.3.c., the following rights and obligations
          of the Parties shall apply:

                                       42

<PAGE>

          a.    In the event that Amgen terminates this Agreement (i) at any
                time as a consequence of an uncured Representation Default by
                GENE or (ii) in the event that GENE terminates this Agreement as
                a consequence of an uncured Performance Default by Amgen in
                accordance with Section 15.3.c. or Amgen terminates this
                Agreement in accordance with Sections 15.2.a or 15.2.b, which
                termination in any case occurs prior to the administration by
                Amgen of any Product to human subjects under a Phase I Study
                (the "Phase I Study Initiation"), the license granted by Amgen
                under Section 9.2.a. to GENE shall terminate.

          b.    In the event that GENE terminates this Agreement as a
                consequence of an uncured Performance Default by Amgen in
                accordance with Section 15.3.c. or Amgen terminates this
                Agreement in accordance with Section15.2.b, which termination in
                any case occurs after Phase I Study Initiation has occurred and
                no serious adverse events have been reported to Amgen, GENE may
                notify Amgen in writing, within thirty (30) days following any
                such termination, of its desire to obtain an *****, under the
                Amgen Technology to make, use or sell only Product which is
                identified as the clinical candidate in the applicable IND.
                Notwithstanding the above, Amgen shall be under no obligation to
                license to GENE *****.

          c.    Should GENE so notify Amgen pursuant to Section 15.6.b. above,
                the parties will negotiate in good faith commercially reasonable

                applicable to a product for a similar use and of similar market
                potential at a similar stage in its product life as that of such
                Product, taking into account *****. Such terms shall include,
                without limitation, *****, for all of which Amgen will be
                reasonably compensated. If the Parties are unable to agree upon
                such terms within said ***** days in the event that (i) Amgen
                terminates pursuant to Section 15.2.b., Amgen shall be free to
                dispose of such rights; *****.

          d.    Amgen shall within ***** days destroy (and provide GENE with a
                certification of such destruction signed by an officer of Amgen)
                all of GENE's Confidential Information (other than with respect
                to maintaining one (1) archival copy of Confidential Information
                related thereto for its legal files, for the sole purpose of
                determining its obligations under this Agreement) and Materials,
                and shall provide GENE with certification by an officer of Amgen
                that all such Confidential Information and Materials have been
                destroyed or returned to Amgen, as appropriate.

          e.    In the event that (i) GENE does not notify Amgen of its desire
                to obtain a license pursuant to Section 15.6.b.; or (ii) the
                parties are unable to agree upon the terms of such license
                pursuant to Section 15.6.c, GENE shall, within ***** days of the
                occurrence of either of such events in (i) or (ii) above,
                destroy (and provide Amgen with a certification of such
                destruction signed by and officer of GENE) all of Amgen's
                Confidential Information (other than with respect to maintaining
                one (1) archival copy of Confidential Information related
                thereto for its legal files, for the sole purpose of determining
                its obligations under this Agreement) and Materials, and shall
                provide Amgen with certification by an officer of GENE that

                                       43

<PAGE>

                all such Confidential Information and Materials have been
                destroyed or returned to Amgen, as appropriate.

          f.    The Parties shall immediately conduct a final accounting to
                reconcile and calculate Development Costs in accordance with
                Section 4.9 and/or Product Contribution in accordance with
                Section 6.8.

          g.    The following provisions shall remain in full force and effect

                                   ARTICLE 16

          Canada as soon as practicable.

                                   ARTICLE 17
                                     GENERAL

  17.1    Conditions to Closing. The obligations of each Party to the other
          Party under this Agreement are subject to fulfillment, on or before
          the Effective Date, of the execution and delivery of the Stock
          Purchase Agreement.

  17.2    Force Majeure. Both Parties shall be excused from the performance of
          their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such
          performance is prevented by Force Majeure and the nonperforming Party
          promptly provides notice of the prevention to the other Party. Such
          excuse shall be continued so long as the condition constituting Force
          Majeure continues. When such circumstances arise, the Parties shall
          discuss what, if any, modification of the terms of this Agreement may
          be required in order to arrive at an equitable solution.

  17.3    Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
          Agreement shall be in writing, shall specifically refer to this
          Agreement and shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given for all
          purposes if mailed by first class certified or registered mail,
          postage prepaid, express delivery service or personally delivered, or
          if sent by facsimile, electronic transmission confirmed. Unless

                               With a copy to:  Corporate Secretary

  17.4    Maintenance of Records. Each Party shall keep and maintain all records
          required by law or regulation with respect to Products and shall make
          copies of such records available to the other Party upon request.

  17.5    No Strict Construction. This Agreement has been prepared jointly and
          shall not be strictly construed against either Party.

  17.6    Performance by Affiliates. GENE acknowledges that obligations under
          this Agreement may be performed by Affiliates of Amgen and that Amgen
          may grant its Affiliates a license or sublicense to (or covenant not
          to sue) under GENE Technology, Joint Patent Rights and Joint Know-How,
          as applicable. Amgen guarantees performance of this Agreement by its
          Affiliates, notwithstanding any assignment to Affiliates in accordance
          with Section 17.8 below. Wherever in this Agreement Amgen delegates
          responsibility to Affiliates or local operating entities, Amgen agrees
          that such entities may neither make decisions inconsistent with this
          Agreement, amend the terms of this Agreement nor act contrary to its
          terms in any way.

  17.7    Subcontracting. GENE acknowledges and agrees that Amgen may
          subcontract any or all portions of its work involved in the Research
          Program and the Development, manufacture and Commercialization of
          Products to a Third Party, and that Amgen may as part of such
          subcontract grant to such Third Party a *****; provided however, that
          Amgen remains responsible for the satisfactory accomplishment of such
          work in

                                       47

<PAGE>

          accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that
          the subcontractor shall enter into a written agreement binding such
          subcontractor to the obligations Amgen has to GENE (and containing any
          other provisions normal and customary for similar types of
          agreements). GENE may subcontract certain support functions related to
          its work involved in the Research Program, including any work to be
          performed by *****, only upon the prior written approval of *****;
          provided however, that GENE remains responsible for the satisfactory
          accomplishment of such work in accordance with the terms and
          conditions of this Agreement and that the subcontractor shall enter
          into a written agreement binding such subcontractor to the obligations
          GENE has to Amgen (and containing any other provisions normal and
          customary for similar types of agreements).

  17.8    Assignment. Except as set forth in Sections 17.6 and 17.7, neither
          Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or
          obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other,
          except that a Party may make such an assignment without the other
          Party's consent to Affiliates or to an entity that acquires all or
          substantially all of the business of such Party or the business of
          such Party to which this Agreement relates, whether in a merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, acquisition, sale or otherwise. This
          Agreement shall be binding on the successors and assigns of the
          assigning Party, and the name of a Party appearing herein shall be
          deemed to include the name(s) of such Party's successors and permitted
          assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this
          Agreement. Any assignment or attempted assignment by either Party in
          violation of the terms of this Section 17.8 shall be null and void and
          of no legal effect. The assigning Party shall forward to the other
          Party a copy of those portions of each fully executed assignment
          agreement which relate to the assumption of the rights and
          responsibilities of the assigning Party, within sixty (60) days of the
          execution of such assignment agreement.

  17.9    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
          counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
          which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  17.10   Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement
          are held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
          jurisdiction from which no appeal can be or is taken, the provision
          shall be considered severed from this Agreement and shall not serve to
          invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The Parties shall make a
          good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision
          with a valid and enforceable one such that the objectives contemplated
          by the Parties when entering this Agreement, as evidenced by the terms
          of this Agreement in accordance with Section 17.19, may be realized.

  17.11   Headings. The headings for each Article and Section in this Agreement
          have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
          intended to limit or expand on the meaning of the language contained
          in the particular Article or Section. Unless otherwise specified, (a)
          references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, Exhibit or
          Schedule shall mean references to such Article, Section, Exhibit or
          Schedule of

                                       48

<PAGE>

          this Agreement, (b) references in any Section to any clause are
          references to such clause of such Section, and (c) references to any
          agreement, instrument or other document in this Agreement refer to
          such agreement, instrument or other document as originally executed
          or, if subsequently varied, replaced or supplemented from
          time-to-time, as so varied, replaced or supplemented and in effect at
          the relevant time of reference thereto.

  17.12   Further Actions. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver
          such further instruments and to do all such other acts as may be
          necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent
          of the Agreement.

  17.13   Independent Contractors. The relationship between GENE and Amgen
          created by this Agreement is solely that of independent contractors.
          This Agreement does not create any agency, distributorship,
          employee-employer, partnership, joint venture or similar business
          relationship between the Parties. Neither Party is a legal
          representative of the other Party, and neither Party can assume or
          create any obligation, representation, warranty or guarantee, express
          or implied, on behalf of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever.
          Each Party shall use its own discretion and shall have complete and
          authoritative control over its employees and the details of performing
          its obligations under this Agreement.

  17.14   No Benefit of Third Parties. The representations, warranties,
          covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are for the sole
          benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted
          assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring any rights on
          any Third Parties.

  17.15   Use of Names, Logos or Symbols. No Party hereto shall use, and no
          rights are granted in or to, the names or trademarks (including the
          names "Amgen" and "GENE"), physical likeness, employee names or other
          symbols of the other Party for any purpose (including, without
          limitation, private or public securities placements) without the prior
          written consent of the affected Party, such consent not to be
          unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such use is limited to
          objective statement of fact rather than for endorsement or publicity
          purposes. Neither Party shall use any trademark which either
          substantially resembles or is confusingly similar to, misleading or
          deceptive with respect to, or which dilutes any of the other Party's
          trademarks in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement.

  17.16   No Waiver. Any delay in enforcing a Party's rights under this
          Agreement or any waiver as to a particular default or other matter
          shall not constitute a waiver of such Party's rights to the future
          enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, except with respect to
          an express written and signed waiver relating to a particular matter
          for a particular period of time.

  17.17   Offset. Either Party shall be entitled to offset, against any payments
          due and payable to the other Party hereunder, all such amounts due and
          payable hereunder but not yet paid by the other Party to the Party
          seeking such offset. Prior to applying an offset

                                       49

<PAGE>

          under this Section 17.17, the Party seeking such offset shall first
          give the other Party written notice of such due and payable amounts
          and shall request the other Party to pay all such due and payable
          amounts within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice.

  17.18   Export Requirements. It is understood and acknowledged that the
          transfer of certain commodities and technical data is subject to
          United States laws and regulations controlling the export of such
          commodities and technical data, including all Export Administration
          Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce. Each Party
          hereby agrees and by entering into this Agreement gives written
          assurance that it shall comply with all United States laws and
          regulations controlling the export of commodities and technical data
          within Information and Materials, that it will be solely responsible
          for any violation of any such laws and regulations by itself, its
          Affiliates or its sublicensees, and that it will Indemnify, defend and
          hold the other Party harmless from any liability in the event of any
          legal action of any nature occasioned by such violation, pursuant to
          Section 13.1 (in the case of Amgen) or Section 13.2 (in the case of
          GENE).

  17.19   Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement (including all Exhibits
          and Schedules, including the Stock Purchase Agreement) set forth the
          complete, final and exclusive agreement and all the covenants,
          promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions and
          understandings between the Parties hereto and supersedes and
          terminates all prior agreements and understandings between the
          Parties; on the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Confidential
          Disclosure Agreement dated March 11, 2002 (Amgen Reference No.
          200201526) is hereby superseded, provided that all Confidential
          Information disclosed therein shall be treated as if disclosed under,
          and shall be subject to the terms of, this Agreement. There are no
          covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations,
          conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between the
          Parties other than as are set forth herein and therein. This Agreement
          may only be modified or supplemented in a writing expressly stated for
          such purpose and signed by an authorized officer of each Party (i.e.,
          it may not be modified by any purchase order, change order,
          acknowledgment, order acceptance, standard terms of sale, invoice or
          the like); except that the Joint Research Committee may amend or
          update the Research Plan as expressly permitted hereby.

  17.20   Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Schedules referenced herein
          and attached hereto are incorporated in this Agreement by reference.
          In case of any discrepancies between the language incorporated from
          the Exhibits and Schedules and the terms of the Sections, the terms of
          the Sections shall prevail; provided however, where Sections of the
          Agreement make explicit reference to a substantive matter contained in
          an Exhibit or Schedule, or with respect to definitions set forth in
          the Exhibits or Schedules, the substantive matter or definitions
          contained in such Exhibit and Schedules shall prevail.

  17.21   Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in
          accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without
          reference to the conflicts of law principles thereof. The parties
          hereby acknowledge their diversity (GENE having its principal place of
          business in Massachusetts and Amgen having its principal place of
          business in California) and each of the Parties hereby submits to the
          jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware, both state and
          federal. The venue for such proceedings shall be the state of
          Delaware. As between the Parties, any dispute, controversy or claim
          relating to the scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any
          licensed Patent Rights shall be submitted to a court of competent
          jurisdiction in the Territory in which such licensed Patent Rights
          were granted or arose.
