(the "Registration Statement") and the related Letter of Transmittal filed therewith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value

<P><FONT SIZE=2>

 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company and International agree to indemnify and hold harmless Value Partners and Ewing&nbsp;&amp; Partners, its general partner, and each person, if any, who controls
Value Partners or Ewing&nbsp;&amp; Partners within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or Section&nbsp;20(a) of the Exchange Act, against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), to which it may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus,
or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Company and International will not be liable in any such case to the extent but
only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made
therein in reliance upon </FONT></P>

and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of Value Partners expressly for use therein. This indemnification shall be the joint and several obligation of the
Company and International. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section, except to the extent such failure prejudiced the indemnifying party). In case any such action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate
therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such
case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by
one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii)&nbsp;the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within
a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, or (iii)&nbsp;such indemnified party or parties shall have received a written opinion of their counsel concluding that there may be
defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to
direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. Anything in this subsection
to the contrary notwithstanding, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that such consent was not unreasonably withheld. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribution.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for
in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified
thereunder, then upon the occurrence of such circumstance, the Company and International shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated
by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims
asserted) as incurred to which Value Partners may be subject. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if
any, who controls Value Partners or Ewing&nbsp;&amp; Partners within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act or Section&nbsp;20(a) of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to
contribution as Value Partners. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a
claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not
relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section or otherwise, except to the extent such failure prejudiced such party. No </FONT></P>

Company and International, and the controlling persons, directors, officers and others referred to in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Sections 1 and 2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, and their respective successors
and assigns, and no other person shall have or be construed to have any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of or by virtue of this Agreement or any provision herein
contained. The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser or acquiror, in its capacity as such, of common stock, Replacement Notes or Interest Notes from the Company. </FONT></P>

Delaware for contracts made and to be fully performed in such state without regard to principles of conflicts of law and by the laws of the United States of America. The parties recognize that it is
the position of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that indemnification for violations of the federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and may be unenforceable. </FONT></P>

constitute one and the same agreement. </FONT></P>

as a subsequent waiver of the same term, or a waiver of any other term, of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder will not constitute a waiver of any such
rights. </FONT></P>
