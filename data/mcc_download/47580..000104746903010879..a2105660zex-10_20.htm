<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Hilton Hotels Corporation (the "Company") established the Hilton Hotels Salaried Employees' Pension Plan (the "Plan"), effective in 1951; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
from time to time, certain other employers have adopted the Plan; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1976, to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and to rename the
Plan as Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Plan has since been amended from time to time; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
as a result of amendments to the Plan and in the interest of maintaining the Plan's tax-qualified status, it is desirable that the Plan be amended and restated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Hilton Hotels Pension Committee (the "Committee") and the Board of Directors of the Company have granted the Company the authority to adopt any amendments to the Plan
required to maintain the Plan's tax-qualified status under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
as a result of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Small Business Job
Protection Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Plan must be substantially amended; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
nothing in this amendment and restatement increases the duties of the Committee under the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Plan is hereby amended and restated as set forth herein effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2000 except where otherwise indicated. The provisions
of this amended and restated Plan shall apply with respect to Employees who retire or otherwise terminate employment on or after January&nbsp;1, 2000. The rights and benefits of Employees who retire
or otherwise terminate employment prior to January&nbsp;1, 2000 shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan in effect at the time of their retirement or termination of
employment. Notwithstanding the Effective Date of the Plan or of any amendment hereto, no Employee shall benefit from the Plan, or any amendment hereto, unless: (1)&nbsp;the Committee minutes
adopting the Plan or amendment specifically provide for the Employee to be benefited; or (2)&nbsp;the Employee is employed on or after the date of adoption of the Plan or amendment hereto, whichever
is applicable. Provided that, where the administrator determines that an amendment must be applicable to former Employees in order for the Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status, such
amendment shall apply to such Employees to the extent required for the Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, it is intended that this Plan constitute an accident and health plan so that amounts distributed on account of disability are excluded from income under
Section&nbsp;105(c) of the Code to the extent provided by law. </FONT></P>

reduction factors contained in Appendix&nbsp;A (with respect to a Participant described in clause&nbsp;(i) of the preceding sentence or a Participant described in clause&nbsp;(ii) of the
preceding sentence who has at least 20 Years of Vesting Service) or determining the Actuarial Equivalent benefit (with respect to a Participant described in clause&nbsp;(ii) of the preceding
sentence who has less than 20 Years of Vesting Service), such reduction factors or Actuarial Equivalent determination, as applicable, shall be applied as if the date that his Early Retirement Benefit

employment with the Participating Employers in accordance with uniform rules adopted by the Committee, subject to the following paragraph. If a Participant retires or otherwise incurs a Break in
Employment prior to age 65, the amount of his Primary Social Security Benefit shall be computed by assuming he receives no wages after such retirement or other Break in Employment. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

(i)&nbsp;an estimated wage history, or (ii)&nbsp;to the extent the Committee has records, such Participant's actual wages. The estimated wage history shall be calculated by projecting backwards
the Participant's wages during the Plan Year in which his Break in Employment occurs at a 6% annual rate. If the Participant provides evidence to the Committee of his actual wage history for the years
before his Break in Employment, the actual wages shall be used instead of the estimate. In order that it be taken into account, a Participant must provide the actual wage history no later than a
reasonable period of time (as determined by the Committee) after his Break in Employment or, if later, the date he is informed of the benefit to which he is entitled. </FONT></P>

forms provided by the Committee, each Eligible Employee who becomes a Participant shall designate in writing the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries whom such Eligible Employee desires to
receive any benefits payable under this Plan in the event of such Eligible Employee's death. A Participant may from time to time change his designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries without the consent
of such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries by filing a new designation in writing with the Committee. However, if a married Participant wishes to designate a person other than his Spouse as Beneficiary,
such designation shall be consented to in writing by the Spouse, which consent shall acknowledge the effect of the designation and be witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public. The
Participant may change any election designating a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries without any requirement of further spousal consent if the Spouse's consent so provides. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
spousal consent shall be unnecessary if it is established (to the satisfaction of a Plan representative) that there is no Spouse or that the required consent cannot be obtained because the Spouse
cannot be located, or because of other circumstances prescribed by Treasury Regulations. The Participating Employer, the Committee and the Trustee may rely upon his designation of Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries last filed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. Upon the dissolution of marriage of a Participant, any designation of the Participant's former Spouse as a Beneficiary shall be

anything to the contrary contained herein, the distribution options under the Plan shall comply with Code Section&nbsp;401(a)(9) and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Accordingly, unless otherwise permitted by law, in the case of a Participant (other than a 5% owner of the Company) who attains age 70<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL>, distribution of such Participant's entire
interest must commence not later than the first day of April following the later of the calendar year in which such Participant attains age 70<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> or the
calendar year in which the Participant retires. In the case of a Participant who is a 5% owner of the Company who attains age 70<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> (and, prior to January&nbsp;1, 2002, with respect
to all Participants), distribution of such Participant's entire interest must commence not later than the first day of April following the calendar year in which such Participant attains age

a Participant dies before the distribution of his interest has begun, his entire interest shall be distributed within five years after the date of his death unless
the requirements of one of the two following exceptions are satisfied: (A)&nbsp;the Participant's interest will be distributed to a Beneficiary over the life of such Beneficiary or over a period not

(B)&nbsp;the Participant's interest will be distributed to or for the benefit of his spouse over the life expectancy of such surviving spouse or over a period not extending beyond the life
expectancy of such spouse and the distributions begin no later than the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> (if the spouse dies before such distributions begin,
this second exception shall be applied as if the spouse were the Participant). For purposes of this paragraph and to the extent permitted by law, any amount paid to a Participant's child shall be
treated as if it had been paid to the Participant's spouse if such amount will become payable to the spouse upon such child reaching majority (or other designated event permitted by law). </FONT></P>

to Section&nbsp;4.13, effective January&nbsp;1, 1997, no further benefits shall be accrued by any Participant in this Plan. Accordingly, each Participant in this Plan shall
be entitled to the benefit he or she earned through and including December&nbsp;31, 1996, but shall not be credited with any additional benefit following December&nbsp;31, 1996. Thus, by way of
illustration and not limitation, Participants shall be entitled to benefits based only upon their Years of Benefit Service through December&nbsp;31, 1996, and shall not be entitled to benefits based
upon any portion of a Year of Benefit Service following December&nbsp;31, 1996; provided, however, that as specifically set forth in the definition of Years of Benefit Service, certain service
performed before January&nbsp;1, 1997 which would otherwise be excluded under the Hilton Property Exclusion and the Union Exclusion shall be included even if the conditions for inclusion of such
service are satisfied after December&nbsp;31, 1996. As a further illustration, and not a limitation, increases in a Participant's Average Monthly Compensation based upon Compensation paid after
December&nbsp;31, 1996 shall not be considered under the Plan. As a further illustration, and not a limitation, no portion of a Year of Benefit Service after January&nbsp;1, 1997 shall be included

apply to all Participants hereunder, whether employed by the Company or any Participating Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Plan become a top-heavy plan as set forth in
Appendix&nbsp;C, then the minimum accruals for Non-Key Employees shall continue to apply under Appendix&nbsp;C. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;None
of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant or Beneficiary shall be subject to any claim of any creditor and, in particular, the same shall not

assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds which he may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under this Plan or the Trust. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
provisions of this Section shall also apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a
domestic relations order, unless (1)&nbsp;such order is determined to be a "qualified domestic relations order," as defined in Section&nbsp;414(p) of the Code, or (2)&nbsp;the Committee
determines in its discretion to treat any domestic relations order entered before January&nbsp;1, 1985 as a qualified domestic relations order. The Committee shall establish reasonable procedures to
determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. In the event a qualified domestic relations order exists with respect to a
benefit payable under the Plan, the benefits otherwise payable to the affected Participant or Beneficiary shall be payable to the alternate payee specified in the qualified domestic relations order,
and the benefits otherwise payable to such Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan shall be reduced by the amounts payable to such alternate payee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
subsection (a), the Plan may offset against the accrued benefit of a Participant any amount that the Participant is ordered or required to pay under a
judgment, order, decree or settlement agreement described in ERISA Section&nbsp;206(d)(4), subject to the joint and survivor requirements of ERISA Section&nbsp;206(d)(4)(C) and ERISA

the event any amount is payable under the Plan to a person for whom a conservator has been legally appointed, the payment shall be distributed to the duly appointed

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event any amount is payable under the Plan to a minor, payment shall not be made to the minor, but instead shall be paid (1)&nbsp;to that person's then living
parent(s) to act as custodian, (2)&nbsp;if that person's parents are then divorced, and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such custodial parent, or (3)&nbsp;if no parent of that person
is then living, to a custodian selected by the Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction in which the minor resides. If
no parent is living and the Committee decides not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the
estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor
is duly appointed and currently acting within 60&nbsp;days after the date the amount becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the minor. </FONT></P>
