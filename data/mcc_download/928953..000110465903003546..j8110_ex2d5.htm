accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation of the Restricted
Shares, the holder of any Restricted Shares will at all times be entitled to
vote the Restricted Shares and to receive any dividends declared on the Trust&#146;s
Class A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares (the &#147;Preferred Shares&#148;).&#160; In addition, the holder of any Restricted
Shares may transfer the shares to any affiliate of Mastandrea subject to the
forfeiture and other provisions of this Agreement.&#160; However, the holder of any Restricted Shares may not otherwise
transfer, sell, assign or dispose of any of the Restricted Shares until they
have vested as provided for in this Agreement; provided further, that
notwithstanding whether or not some or all of the Restricted Shares have vested
as provided for in this Agreement, the holder of any Restricted Shares may not
transfer or sell any of the Restricted Shares until the second anniversary of
the date of this Agreement.&#160; The
Restricted Shares shall be converted into shares of the Trust&#146;s common stock
upon the closing of the exchange offer made to the holders of its Preferred
Shares pursuant to the registration statement to be filed by the Trust (the
&#147;Exchange Offer&#148;) pursuant to the same terms and conditions and based on the
same exchange ratio as offered to the other holders of Preferred Shares;
provided, however, that as long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, the
holders of Restricted Shares, in the aggregate, shall have the right to retain
the exchange ratio in the Exchange Offer and will not be required to convert at
the time of the Exchange Offer such number of Preferred Shares as equal 51% of
the then outstanding Preferred Shares.&#160;
The term &#147;affiliate&#148; shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 12b-2
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

OF RESTRICTED SHARES</font></b>.&#160; The risk of forfeiture will lapse for the
Restricted Shares and the Restricted Shares will vest upon the later of: (a)
The gross assets of the Trust equaling or exceeding $50 million; or (b) 174,019
shares on the first anniversary of this Agreement; 87,010 on the second
anniversary of this Agreement; and 87,010 on the third anniversary of this
Agreement.&#160; The vesting schedule shall
not be affected if Mastandrea dies or becomes &#147;disabled&#148; as such term is used
in the Employment Agreement. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the risk
of forfeiture will lapse for all of the Restricted Shares and they will vest in
full immediately:&#160; if a &#147;Shift in
Ownership&#148; is deemed to have occurred under the Employment Agreement, or if the
Employment Agreement otherwise provides for accelerated vesting.&#160; The holders of the Restricted Shares will
automatically and without notice be forfeited and cease to have any right,
title or interest to any of the Restricted Shares that remain subject to
forfeiture immediately if Mastandrea terminates his employment with the Trust
without &#147;Good Reason&#148;; or the Trust terminates Mastandrea&#146;s employment with the
Trust for Cause (other than the right to receive a dividend previously declared
but not yet paid with a record date for payment of the dividend prior to the
termination date).</p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">4) TAXES</font></b>.&#160; Under the general rule of Section 83 of the
Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;), Mastandrea will not be treated as receiving
the Restricted Shares until such time as he becomes substantially vested in the
Restricted Shares.&#160; Mastandrea will
become substantially vested in the Restricted Shares upon the expiration of any
forfeiture period described in Section 3 above.&#160; At that time, he will be taxed on the value of the Restricted
Shares as ordinary compensation income.&#160;
As an exception to this rule, Section 83 of the Code permits Mastandrea
to elect to be taxed on the value of the Restricted Shares as of the date of
the grant of the Restricted Shares.</p>

Paragon or any of its affiliates collectively own, beneficially or of record,
(a) a majority of the Preferred Shares, or (b) forty percent (40%) or more of
the sum of (i) the outstanding Restricted Shares issued or to be issued
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Restricted Share Agreement by

Common Shares of the Trust, if any, issued to Paragon or any of its affiliates
upon conversion of the Restricted Shares in accordance with Section 2 of this
Agreement, the holders of such Restricted Shares, Preferred Shares or Common
Shares shall have the right to appoint five (5) Trustees to the Board at all
times through the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) anniversary of this Agreement.&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mastandrea
is Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer of the Trust on the tenth
(10<sup>th</sup>) anniversary of this Agreement, then the right to appoint
Trustees will continue until the time that Mastandrea is no longer Chairman of
the Board or Chief Executive Officer of the Trust.&#160; The rights set forth in this paragraph are not transferable.</p>

acquiring the Restricted Shares for investment and not for immediate resale;
and (iii) he acknowledges that the Restricted Shares will be treated as taxable
income to him under the Code.</p>
