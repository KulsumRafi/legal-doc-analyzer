         (ii) Matters accepted by Purchaser set forth on the title
              report to be provided pursuant to Paragraph 3 herein
              below.

     (b) The Seller shall pay for the title insurance premium and
         search fees, all brokerage commissions due on this
         transaction, documentary stamps on the deed, and the
         Seller's attorney's fees.  The Purchaser shall pay for
         the cost of a survey and recording the deed, all costs
         associated with the Purchaser's inspection and
         examination of the Property, the costs of any financing
         of this transaction, and the Purchaser's attorney's fees.

                        3.  Evidence of Title

     Within twenty (20) days from the date upon which the latter
of the Seller and Purchaser has executed this Agreement (the
"Effective Date"), Seller shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser,
at Seller's expense, a commitment for title insurance (the
"Commitment") issued by a nationally known title insurance company
licensed to sell title insurance in the state of Florida, agreeing
to insure the fee-simple title to the Property in the Purchaser
upon recording of the deed from the Seller for the full amount of
the purchase price under an ALTA owner's policy.  Purchaser shall
notify Seller within ten (10) days of receipt of the Commitment of
any matters which Purchaser finds objectionable.  Seller shall
have five (5) days' time in which to cure such objections to title
and provide Purchaser with written notice of such cure or to
notify Purchaser in writing that Seller does not intend to cure
same, or in case of mortgage or other liens on the Property
requiring payment for release, confirm in writing its obligation
to make such payment(s) at closing, but shall not be obligated to
spend any money or file suit to do so except to pay at closing any
amounts required for the release of any mortgage or other lien on
the Property.  In the event Purchaser does not give notice of
defects of title within such ten (10) day period, then title shall
be considered acceptable.  If Seller elects in its sole discretion
not to cure or is unable to cure the defects during said five (5)
day curative period, then Purchaser shall have five (5) days after
receipt of Seller's written notice within which to elect whether
or not it will complete the purchase and accept title subject to
title defects, or whether it will elect to terminate this
Contract.  If Purchaser elects to terminate this Contract pursuant
to this paragraph, Escrow Agent will forthwith return the Deposit
to Purchaser, and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall thereupon terminate.

concerning the Property which it may have in its possession.  The

relieved of any further obligation hereunder.

indemnify and hold the other harmless from any other claim or

                          16.  Escrow Agent

parties concerned of such delivery, all liability on the part of
the Escrow Agent shall fully cease and terminate, except to the
extent of accounting for any monies theretofore delivered out of

wherein the Escrow Agent is made a party or if Escrow Agent
interpleads the subject matter of this escrow, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs
incurred, said fees and costs to be charged and assessed against
the non-prevailing party in any such dispute, but, if not paid by
the non-prevailing party then the prevailing party shall pay such
fees and costs with the right to recover from the non-prevailing
party for such payment.  All parties agree that the Escrow Agent
shall not be liable to any party or person whomsoever for
misdelivery to Purchaser or Seller of the Deposit, unless such
misdelivery shall be due to willful breach of this Agreement or
gross negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent.  Both Purchaser
and Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold
Escrow Agent harmless from all expenses, costs and damages
incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with or as a result of its
acting as Escrow Agent herein but excepting only such costs,
expenses and damages as result from the willful breach or gross
negligence of Escrow Agent.  Both parties recognize and
acknowledge that Escrow Agent has agreed to serve as Escrow Agent
only as a convenience to both parties.
