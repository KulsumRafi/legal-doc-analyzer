20,000,000.-  baht  (twenty  million  baht) has been  granted  making up a total
credit of  80,000,000.-  baht (eighty  million baht), it is mutually agreed that
the terms and  conditions  of such Credit  Facilities  be amended for the second
time as follows:

         We  shall  issue to  Company  one or many  promissory  notes in lieu of
repayment of such Credits.  We shall pay the interest  accumulated on the amount
of each promissory note at the rate shown on each respective  note. We shall pay
interest  on the last day normal  working  day of each month and on the day when
the principal sum under the note is due and payable. If Company does not receive
payment of principal sum and/or interest due and payable under one or many notes
issued by us and/or upon demand by Company  for payment  whichever  the case may
be,  we shall pay  Company  the sum under  each note with  interest  accumulated
thereon at the default rate set by Company prevailing at the time instead of the
rate under the note,  which on the date of application  such default rate is 19%
per annum and it is subject to future increase or decrease.  We acknowledge that
Company shall calculate interest at such default rate from the day when interest
is due and payable  and/or on the maturity date of each and every note and/or on
the due date when Company demands for payment until Company  receives payment in
full.

         In the event  that one or of such many notes is mature  and/or  Company
demands for payment,  we shall  forthwith  pay Company all the principal sum and
interest still owing.  If we intend to use the credit  facilities as approved by
Company,  we shall issue Company with new note having value,  interest rate, due
date and  other  particulars  as set  forth by  Company  in  replacement  of the
existing  note and  continue to do so until we have repaid  Company all the sums
hereunder in full by August 15, 2003.

         In the event that we are in arrears  with  payment of  interest on such
credit for more than a year, Company may calculate compound interest at the said
default rate.

         For the purpose of calculation, one year shall be regarded as 365 days.

securities:

         o  Pledge  of  note(s)  issued  by  Company  under  which  we  are  the
beneficiary.  We shall  endorse  on the back of one or many of such notes to put

Company. We agree that so long as each note is still valid we shall maintain the
value of note pledged  with  Company at lease 31.25% of the sums  borrowed by us
and still  owing to  Company.  Failure to do so shall be  regarded  as breach of
Credit Agreement in essence.

         o A guarantee of  80,000,000.-  baht (eighty  million baht) for all the
credits  granted to us under all notes to be put up  jointly,  severally  and on

         result in Joint  Guarantor  not being able to assume all or some of the
         rights granted to Company before or at the time of making Guarantee.
