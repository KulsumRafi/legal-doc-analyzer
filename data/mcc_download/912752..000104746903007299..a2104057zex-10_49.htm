other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to such terms and conditions that the court determines appropriate) restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of
such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court orders. The parties acknowledge and agree that judicial action, rather than arbitration, is appropriate </FONT></P>
