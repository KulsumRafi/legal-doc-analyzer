that makes a claim against the Agreement (the "Claimant") in writing, within 90
days of Claimant's written application for benefits, of his or her eligibility
or non-eligibility for benefits under the Agreement. If the Bank determines that

forth (1) the specific reasons for such denial, (2) a specific reference to the
provisions of the Agreement on which the denial is based, (3) a description of
any additional information or material necessary for the Claimant to perfect his
or her claim, and a description of why it is needed, (4) an explanation of the
Agreement's claims review procedure and other appropriate information as to the

decision is expected to be made, and may extend the time for up to an additional
90 days.

         7.2      Review Procedure. If the Claimant is determined by the Bank
not to be eligible for benefits, or if the Claimant believes that he or she is
entitled to greater or different benefits, the Claimant shall have the
opportunity to have such claim reviewed by the Bank by filing a petition for
review with the Bank within 60 days after receipt of the notice issued by the
Bank. Said petition shall state the specific reasons which the Claimant believes
entitle him or her to benefits or to greater or different benefits. Within 60
days after receipt by the Bank of the petition, the Bank shall afford the
Claimant (and counsel, if any) an opportunity to present his or her position to
the Bank in writing, and the Claimant (or counsel) shall have the right to
review the pertinent documents. The Bank shall notify the Claimant of its
decision in writing within the 60-day period, stating

Page 6

<PAGE>

specifically the basis of its decision, written in a manner to be understood by
the Claimant and the specific provisions of the Agreement on which the decision
is based. If, because of the need for a hearing, the 60-day period is not
sufficient, the decision may be deferred for up to another 60 days at the
election of the Bank, but notice of this deferral shall be given to the
Claimant.

SECTION 8 - Beneficiaries

         8.1      Beneficiary Designations. The Executive shall designate a
beneficiary by filing a written designation with the Bank. The Executive may
revoke or modify the designation at any time by filing a new designation.
However, designations will only be effective if signed by the Executive and
received by the Bank during the Executive's lifetime. The Executive's
beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the beneficiary
predeceases the Executive, or if the Executive names a spouse as beneficiary and
the marriage is subsequently dissolved. If the Executive dies without a valid
beneficiary designation, all payments shall be made to the Executive's estate.

         8.2      Facility of Payment. If a benefit is payable to a minor, to a
person declared incompetent, or to a person incapable of handling the
disposition of his or her property, the Bank may pay such benefit to the
guardian, legal representative or person having the care or custody of such
minor, incompetent person or incapable person. The Bank may require proof of
incompetence, minority or guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to
distribution of the benefit. Such distribution shall completely discharge the
Bank from all liability with respect to such benefit.

SECTION 9 - Amendments and Termination

         9.1      This Agreement may be amended or terminated only by a written
agreement signed by the Bank and the Executive.

         9.2      Notwithstanding Section 9.1, the Bank may amend or terminate
this Agreement at any time if, pursuant to legislative, judicial or regulatory
action, continuation of the Agreement would (i) cause benefits to be taxable to
the Executive prior to actual receipt, or (ii) result in significant financial
penalties or other significantly detrimental ramifications to the Bank or the
Holding Company, other than the financial impact of paying the benefits. In no
event shall this Agreement be terminated under this section without payment to
the Executive of the Deferral Account balance attributable to the Executive's
Deferrals and interest credited on such amounts.

SECTION 10 - Status as an Unsecured General Creditor.

         10.1     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: (i)
the Executive shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in or
to any specific property or assets of the Bank as a result of this Agreement;
(ii) none of the Bank's assets shall be held in or under any trust for the
benefit of the Executive or held in any way as

Page 7

<PAGE>

security for the fulfillment of the obligations of the Bank under this
Agreement; (iii) all of the Bank's assets shall be and remain the general
unpledged and unrestricted assets of the Bank; (iv) the Bank's obligation under
this Agreement shall be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise by the Bank to
pay money in the future; and (v) the Executive shall be an unsecured general
creditor with respect to any benefits which may be payable under the terms of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) through (v) above, the Bank
and the Executive acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a Change in
Control, upon request of the Executive, or in the Bank's discretion if the
Executive does not so request and the Bank nonetheless deems it appropriate, the
Bank shall establish, concurrent with this agreement, a Rabbi Trust or multiple
Rabbi Trusts (the "Trust" or "Trusts") upon such terms and conditions as the
Bank, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and in compliance with
applicable provisions of the Code, in order to permit the Bank to make
contributions and/or transfer assets to the Trust or Trusts to discharge its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. The principal of the Trust or Trusts and
any earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the
Bank to be used exclusively for discharge of the Bank's obligations pursuant to
this Agreement and shall continue to be subject to the claims of the Bank's
general creditors until paid to the Executive in such manner and at such times
as specified in this Agreement.

         10.2     Bank reserves the right to determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, whether, to what extent and by what method, if any, to provide for
the payment of the amounts which may be payable to the Executive, under the
terms of this Agreement. In the event that the Bank elects to fund this
Agreement, in whole or in part, through the use of life insurance or annuities,
or both, the Bank shall determine the ownership and beneficial interests of any
such policy of life insurance or annuity. The Bank further reserves the right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate any such policy, and any other
devise used to fund its obligations under this Agreement, at any time, in whole
or in part. Consistent with Section 10.1 above, the Executive shall have no
right, title or interest in or to any funding source or amount utilized by the
Bank pursuant to this Agreement, and any such funding source or amount shall not
constitute security for the performance of the Bank's obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Executive agrees to
execute such documents and undergo such medical examinations or tests which the
Bank may request and which may be reasonably necessary to facilitate any funding
for this Agreement including, without limitation, the Bank's acquisition of any
policy of insurance or annuity.

         10.3     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Bank or the Holding Company may, its sole and absolute
discretion: (i) accelerate the payment of the amounts due under the terms of
this Agreement, provided that the Executive consents to the revised payout terms
determined appropriate by the Board of Directors; (ii) modify other terms or
conditions of the Agreement, as the Board of Directors deems necessary or
appropriate, in response to changes in legislation, to rules, regulations or
rulings issued under the Internal Revenue Code, or to other similar events
having a substantial impact on the costs and benefits to the Bank of its
obligations under the Agreement, provided that the Executive shall receive a
substantially equivalent

Page 8

<PAGE>

benefit in the event that a benefit existing under the Agreement is canceled as
a result of such modification.

SECTION 11 - Miscellaneous

         11.1     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall bind the Executive and
the Bank, and their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, successors,
administrators and transferees.

         11.2     No Guarantee of Employment. This Agreement is not an
employment policy or contract. It does not give the Executive the right to
remain an employee of the Bank, nor does it interfere with the Bank's right to
discharge the Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an
employee nor interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any
time.

         11.3     Non-Transferability. Benefits under this Agreement cannot be
sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, attached or encumbered in any manner. In

amounts payable hereunder, nor, prior to payment in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, shall any portion of such amounts be: (i) subject to seizure by
any creditor of the Executive, by a proceeding at law or in equity, for the
payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance obligations
which may be owed by the Executive; or (ii) transferable by operation of law in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise. Any such attempted assignment
or transfer shall be void.

merge or consolidate into or with another corporation, or reorganize or sell

assume and discharge the obligations of the Bank under this Agreement. In the
alternative, the Holding Company may agree to assume and discharge the
obligation of the Bank under this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event,
the term "Bank" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such
surviving or successor firm, person, entity or corporation, or the Holding
Company, as the case may be.

         11.7     Unfunded Arrangement. The Executive and beneficiary are

benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner to anticipation,

garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life is a general
asset of the Bank to which the Executive and beneficiary have no preferred or
secured claim.

agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and contains all of the covenants and

Agreement acknowledges that no other representations, inducements, promises, or
agreements, oral or otherwise, have been made by any party, or anyone acting on

Executive acknowledges that he or she has been afforded the opportunity to
consult with independent advisors of his choosing including, without limitation,
accountants or tax advisors and counsel regarding both the benefits granted to
him under the terms of this Agreement and the (i) terms and conditions which may
affect the Executive's right to these benefits and (ii) personal tax effects of
such benefits including, without limitation, the effects of any federal or state
taxes, Section 280G of the Code, and any other taxes, costs, expenses or
liabilities whatsoever related to such benefits, which in any of the

Page 10

foregoing instances the Executive acknowledges and agrees shall be the sole
responsibility of the Executive notwithstanding any other term or provision of
this Agreement. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Bank
shall have no liability whatsoever related to any such personal tax effects or
other personal costs, expenses, or liabilities applicable to the Executive and
further specifically waives any right for himself or herself, and his or her

he or she has read, understands and consents to all of the terms and conditions

         11.14    Arbitration of Disputes. All claims, disputes and other
matters in question arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach
or interpretation thereof, other than those matters which are to be determined
by the Bank in its sole and absolute discretion, shall be resolved by binding
arbitration before a representative member, selected by the mutual agreement of
the parties, of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"),
located in Portland, Oregon. In the event JAMS is unable or unwilling to conduct
the arbitration provided for under the terms of this Paragraph, or has
discontinued its business, the parties agree that a representative member,
selected by the mutual agreement of the parties of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") located in Portland, Oregon, shall conduct the binding
arbitration referred to in this Paragraph. Notice of the demand for arbitration
shall be filed in writing with the other party to this Agreement and with JAMS
(or AAA, if necessary). In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made
after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such
claim, dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable
statute of limitations. The arbitration shall be subject to such rules of
procedure used or established by JAMS, or if there are none, the rules of
procedure used or established by AAA. Any award rendered by JAMS or AAA shall be
final and binding upon the parties, and as applicable, their respective heirs,
beneficiaries, legal representatives, agents, successors and assigns, and may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any arbitration hereunder
shall be conducted in The Dalles, Oregon, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties.

         11.15    Attorneys' Fees. In the event of any arbitration or litigation
concerning any controversy, claim or dispute between the parties hereto, arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach hereof, or the interpretation
hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party
reasonable expenses, attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection therewith
or in the enforcement or collection of any judgment or award rendered therein.
The "prevailing party" means the party determined by the arbitrator(s) or court,
as the case may be, to have most nearly prevailed, even if such party did not
prevail in all matters, not necessarily the one in whose favor a judgment is
rendered.
