payments shall be made at least ten (10)&nbsp;days prior to the delinquency date of such payment. Upon payment thereof, Tenant shall promptly furnish Landlord with satisfactory evidence that such
taxes have been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph&nbsp;5, if the holder of any mortgage then affecting Landlord's interest in the Premises requires that Landlord make
monthly or other periodic payments to an escrow or reserve for use in paying real property taxes as they fall due, Tenant shall, upon being so advised by Landlord and at the time of its making the

turn remit such amount to such holder. As used herein, the term "real property taxes" shall include any form of general or special assessment, license fee, commercial rental or gross receipts tax,
levy, penalty, duty, charge or tax (other than inheritance or estates taxes) imposed by an authority having the direct or indirect power to tax, including any city, county, state or federal

leasing the Premises or any tax imposed in substitution, partially or totally, of any tax previously included within the definition of real property taxes, or any additional tax the nature of which
was previously included within the definition of real property taxes. All expenses, including attorney's fees and disbursements, experts' and other witnesses' fees, incurred in contesting the validity
or amount of any taxes or in obtaining a refund of
taxes will be considered as part of the taxes for the tax year in which such expenses are incurred. If the Premises are not separately assessed, Tenant's liability shall be an equitable proportion of
the real property taxes for all of the land and improvements included within the tax parcel assessed, such proportion to be determined by Landlord from the respective valuations assigned in the
assessor's work sheets or such other information as may be reasonably available. Landlord's reasonable determination thereof, in good faith, shall be conclusive. Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency
all taxes assessed against and levied upon trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property of Tenant contained in the Premises or elsewhere. When possible, Tenant shall cause
said trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Landlord. </FONT></P>
