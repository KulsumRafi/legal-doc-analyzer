Grant to Bargained-for<br>and Certain

<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 1; page: 1" -->
<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the early
ratification of the collective bargaining agreement dated December 8, 2001,
between the Communications Workers of America and Southwestern Bell Yellow
Pages, Inc. (the <B><I>&#147;CWA Agreement&#148;</I></B><I></I>), SBC is pleased
to grant stock options to eligible employees covered by the Agreement as
described in this notice. <B>On December 31, 2001, eligible full-time employees
were granted 150 options to purchase common stock of SBC (<I>&#147;SBC
Stock&#148;</I>); eligible part-time employees were granted 75 options.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <B>option</B> gives you
the opportunity to buy a specified number of shares of stock at a fixed price
per share (grant price) for a specified period of time. For example, suppose you
are given a stock option with a grant price of $40 and the option lasts for five
years. If, after four years, the stock is worth $60 per share (market price),
you have the opportunity to turn your options into shares (exercise your
options) and purchase the shares for the original grant price of $40 per share.
You could then sell the shares and receive the $20 cash profit per share or keep
the shares as an investment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each option gives you the right to buy one share of SBC Stock on or after April 1, 2002, at the
December 31, 2001 closing market price of $39.17 per share (the &#147;grant
price&#148;).</I></B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That right will last until the close of business for option exercises on March 31, 2006 (see table below
for exceptions). <I>Options are not shares of stock and are not entitled to
dividends or voting rights. </I>Your options are subject to the terms and
conditions contained in this notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of your options
rises and falls with the value of SBC Stock. The ultimate value of your options
will depend on the price of SBC Stock at the time of exercise. You make the
decision whether or not to exercise your options (you are not required to
exercise them as part of your employment). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you decide to exercise
your options, you need to decide whether to:</FONT></P>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>simultaneously sell the SBC Stock received from the exercise and receive cash (a
<I>cashless exercise</I> &#150; you receive the cash proceeds without any
out-of-pocket cash from you), or</font></li>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2> keep the SBC Stock received from the exercise as an investment (a <I>cash
purchase exercise</I> - you provide the funds to purchase the options at the
grant price). </FONT></li>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant price of your

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Exercising
Your Options</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not have to exercise
your options, but if you do decide to exercise, <B><I>then</I></B><I> <B>all
options from this grant must be exercised at the same time and on or before
their expiration date.</B></I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options shall be exercised
by notifying the designated agent selected by SBC (if no agent has been
designated, then to SBC) in accordance with procedures established by SBC.
Options may only be exercised during certain business hours selected by SBC. You
decide how you want to exercise your options, depending on whether you want to
receive cash (a <I>Cashless Exercise</I>) or SBC Stock (a <I>Cash Purchase
Exercise</I>). Both methods are described below (also see section entitled
&#147;Tax Effects,&#148; on next page). The amounts used in the examples do not
represent actual amounts, and are only used for purposes of illustration. </FONT></P>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cashless Exercise:</B>
If you do not want to keep the SBC Stock purchased when you exercise your
options, you may sell the shares simultaneously with the exercise and receive
cash. You do not have to use any of your own money. You simply tell the agent to
sell all of the SBC Stock to be received upon the exercise of your options. The
agent will deduct the total grant price, tax withholding and brokerage fees from
the proceeds, and send you a check for the remaining profits. (In connection
with the sale of SBC Stock, the designated agent will be acting solely as your
agent, and SBC disclaims any responsibility for the actions of the agent in
making any such sales.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Example: </B>Assume you
are granted 150 options with a grant price of $39.17. You exercise your options,
sell the SBC stock purchased, and receive the net profits as shown below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cash Purchase Exercise:
</B>If you want to keep the SBC Stock acquired from the option exercise, you
must use your own money to pay the grant price. To use this method, you must

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Withholding Taxes:</B>
When you exercise your options, SBC may withhold from the proceeds the minimum
amount of Federal, state, and local taxes required by law to be withheld as a
result of such distribution, as determined by SBC. If you pay cash to exercise
your options, any fractional share of SBC Stock payable to you may be withheld
as additional Federal tax withholding, or, at the option of SBC, paid to you in
cash. In our Cash Purchase example, the fractional share (.8) was withheld as
additional tax withholding. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                                                   No SBC Stock will be issued until<br>

                                                for the exercise of options, including<br>

                                                    in the sole discretion of SBC.</FONT></H2>



<P align=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Further
details about exercising your options will be provided at a later date, but
prior to April 1, 2002 (the first date your options may be exercised).</B> </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Tax Effects</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC believes that, under
present law, the following are the Federal income tax consequences of this
grant. You should consult a qualified tax advisor to obtain current information
as well as advice that is tailored to your particular circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<b>Grant of Options:</b>  No income is  recognized  by you at the time the options are granted.  If you do not exercise the options,  you will
not recognize any income.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Sale of SBC Stock:</B>
Any subsequent sale of SBC Stock acquired upon the exercise of options will be
treated as capital gain (or loss). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Exercise of Option:</B>
Generally, when you exercise your options, you will realize taxable (ordinary)
income equal to the difference between the total grant price and the total
market price of SBC Stock at the time of exercise. In our $60 per share example
above (using 150 options), $3,125 would be recognized as ordinary income (using
the total market price of $9,000 for the SBC Stock less the total grant price of
$5,875). SBC will report the ordinary income on your W-2 for the year the
options are exercised, and will receive a tax deduction equal to the ordinary
income reported on your W-2. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Other Terms</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Administration:</B> The
Human Resources Committee of SBC (the
<B><I>&#147;Committee&#148;</I></B>) will administer the options and, in
its sole discretion, may interpret and construe any provisions of this grant.
The Committee may also establish, adopt or revise any rules and regulations as
it may deem necessary or advisable. All decisions of the Committee shall be
final and binding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Applicable Law:</B> Your
options are governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of
the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle
that might otherwise refer constructive interpretation of this grant to the
substantive law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the options are
granted and administered in Texas, SBC and the holders of options irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate federal or
state court in Bexar County, Texas, and no other. To promote consistency in
application of the law to the grants, claims arising out of the grant of options
shall be heard and determined in federal or state court in Bexar County, Texas,
and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties
and over the subject matter of any dispute relating to the grant of options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Change in
Capitalization:</B> In the event of a merger, reorganization, liquidation,
consolidation, recapitalization, separation, stock split, stock dividend, share
combination, or other change in SBC&#146;s corporate structure affecting shares
of SBC Stock, the Committee shall adjust, as it determines in its sole
discretion to be appropriate and equitable, the number and class of and/or price
of shares of stock subject to outstanding options granted under this grant,
and/or in the number of outstanding options, to prevent dilution or enlargement
of rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Employment Status:</B>
You shall not consider any statements in this notice or any action taken
hereunder as a contract of employment or as giving you any right to continued
employment with an SBC company. Terms of your employment are covered by your CWA
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Transferability:</B>
During your lifetime, your options may be exercised only by you or your guardian
or legal representative. If you die after March 31, 2002, your options may only
be transferred pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution, as
applicable. After you die, your options may be exercised only by the then owner
(including, but not limited to, the executor or administrator of your estate) or
the holder&#146;s guardian or legal representative. The new holder of your
options will have 90 days after your death to exercise your options or until
March 31, 2006, whichever occurs first. All other terms of your options will

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2001 Stock Option
Grant to Bargained-for<br>and Certain
Other Employees</FONT></H1>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the early
ratification of the collective bargaining agreements listed on page 2 between
the Communications Workers of America and certain subsidiaries of SBC
Communications Inc. (the&#160;<B><I>&#147;CWA Agreements&#148;</I></B>),
SBC is pleased to grant stock options to eligible employees covered by such
Agreements as described in this notice. <B>On April 2, 2001, eligible full-time
employees were granted 150 options to purchase common stock of SBC (<I>&#147;SBC
Stock&#148;</I>); eligible part-time employees were granted 75 options.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <B>option</B> gives you
the opportunity to buy a specified number of shares of stock at a fixed price
per share (grant price) for a specified period of time. For example, suppose you
are given a stock option with a grant price of $40 and the option lasts for five
years. If, after four years, the stock is worth $60 per share (market price),
you have the opportunity to turn your options into shares (exercise your
options) and purchase the shares for the original grant price of $40 per share.
You could then sell the shares and receive the $20 cash profit per share or keep
the shares as an investment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Each option gives you
the right to buy one share of SBC Stock on or after April 1, 2002, at the April
2, 2001 closing market price of $43.76 per share (the &#147;grant
price&#148;).</I></B> That right will last until the close of business
for option exercises on March 31, 2006 (see table below for exceptions).
<I>Options are not shares of stock and are not entitled to dividends or voting
rights. </I>Your options are subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of your options
rises and falls with the value of SBC Stock. The ultimate value of your options
will depend on the price of SBC Stock at the time of exercise. You make the
decision whether or not to exercise your options (you are not required to
exercise them as part of your employment). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     If you decide to exercise your options, you need to decide whether to:</FONT></P>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>simultaneously sell the SBC Stock received from the exercise and receive cash (a

<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2> keep the SBC Stock received from the exercise as an investment (a <I>cash

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options shall be exercised
by notifying the designated agent selected by SBC (if no agent has been
designated, then to SBC) in accordance with procedures established by SBC.
Options may only be exercised during certain business hours selected by SBC. You
decide how you want to exercise your options, depending on whether you want to
receive cash (a <I>Cashless Exercise</I>) or SBC Stock (a <I>Cash Purchase
Exercise</I>). Both methods are described below (also see section entitled
&#147;Tax Effects,&#148; on next page). The amounts used in the examples do not
represent actual amounts, and are only used for purposes of illustration. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cashless Exercise:</B>
If you do not want to keep the SBC Stock purchased when you exercise your
options, you may sell the shares simultaneously with the exercise and receive
cash. You do not have to use any of your own money. You simply tell the agent to
sell all of the SBC Stock to be received upon the exercise of your options. The
agent will deduct the total grant price, tax withholding and brokerage fees from
the proceeds, and send you a check for the remaining profits. (In connection
with the sale of SBC Stock, the designated agent will be acting solely as your
agent, and SBC disclaims any responsibility for the actions of the agent in
making any such sales.) </FONT></P>

When you exercise your options, SBC may withhold from the proceeds the minimum

your options, any fractional share of SBC Stock payable to you may be withheld
as additional Federal tax withholding, or, at the option of SBC, paid to you in
cash. In our Cash Purchase example, the fractional share (.8) was withheld as
additional tax withholding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<b>Grant of Options:</b>  No income is  recognized  by you at the time the options are granted.  If you do not exercise the options,  you will
not recognize any income.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Sale of SBC Stock:</B>
Any subsequent sale of SBC Stock acquired upon the exercise of options will be
treated as capital gain (or loss). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Exercise of Option:</B>
Generally, when you exercise your options, you will realize taxable (ordinary)
income equal to the difference between the total grant price and the total
market price of SBC Stock at the time of exercise. In our $60 per share example
above (using 150 options), $2,436 would be recognized as ordinary income (using
the total market price of $9,000 for the SBC Stock less the total grant price of
$6,564). SBC will report the ordinary income on your W-2 for the year the
options are exercised, and will receive a tax deduction equal to the ordinary
income reported on your W-2. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Other Terms</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Administration:</B> The
Human Resources Committee of SBC (the
<B><I>&#147;Committee&#148;</I></B>) will administer the options and, in
its sole discretion, may interpret and construe any provisions of this grant.
The Committee may also establish, adopt or revise any rules and regulations as
it may deem necessary or advisable. All decisions of the Committee shall be
final and binding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Applicable Law:</B> Your
options are governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of
the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle
that might otherwise refer constructive interpretation of this grant to the
substantive law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the options are
granted and administered in Texas, SBC and the holders of options irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate federal or
state court in Bexar County, Texas, and no other. To promote consistency in
application of the law to the grants, claims arising out of the grant of options
shall be heard and determined in federal or state court in Bexar County, Texas,
and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties
and over the subject matter of any dispute relating to the grant of options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Change in
Capitalization:</B> In the event of a merger, reorganization, liquidation,
consolidation, recapitalization, separation, stock split, stock dividend, share
combination, or other change in SBC&#146;s corporate structure affecting shares
of SBC Stock, the Committee shall adjust, as it determines in its sole
discretion to be appropriate and equitable, the number and class of and/or price
of shares of stock subject to outstanding options granted under this grant,
and/or in the number of outstanding options, to prevent dilution or enlargement
of rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Employment Status:</B>
You shall not consider any statements in this notice or any action taken
hereunder as a contract of employment or as giving you any right to continued
employment with an SBC company. Terms of your employment are covered by your CWA
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Transferability:</B>
During your lifetime, your options may be exercised only by you or your guardian
or legal representative. If you die after March 31, 2002, your options may only
be transferred pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution, as
applicable. After you die, your options may be exercised only by the then owner
(including, but not limited to, the executor or administrator of your estate) or
the holder&#146;s guardian or legal representative. The new holder of your
options will have 90 days after your death to exercise your options or until
March 31, 2006, whichever occurs first. All other terms of your options will
apply to the new holder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When options have been

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2001 Stock Option
Grant to Bargained-for<br> and Certain
Other Employees</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the
ratification of the 1998-2004 Ameritech IBEW Local 21 Collective Bargaining
Agreement between the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and
certain subsidiaries of Ameritech Corporation (the <B><I>&#147;IBEW
Agreement&#148;</I></B>), SBC is pleased to grant stock options to
eligible employees covered by the Agreement as described in this notice. <B>On
September 4, 2001, eligible full-time employees were granted 150 options to
purchase common stock of SBC (<I>&#147;SBC Stock&#148;</I>); eligible part-time
employees were granted 75 options.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>An <B>option</B> gives you
the opportunity to buy a specified number of shares of stock at a fixed price
per share (grant price) for a specified period of time. For example, suppose you
are given a stock option with a grant price of $40 and the option lasts for five
years. If, after four years, the stock is worth $60 per share (market price),
you have the opportunity to turn your options into shares (exercise your
options) and purchase the shares for the original grant price of $40 per share.
You could then sell the shares and receive the $20 cash profit per share or keep
the shares as an investment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B><I>Each option gives you
the right to buy one share of SBC Stock on or after September 3, 2002, at the
September 4, 2001 closing market price of $42.00 per share (the grant
price).</I></B> That right will last until the close of business for
option exercises on September 1, 2006 (see table below for exceptions).
<I>Options are not shares of stock and are not entitled to dividends or voting
rights. </I>Your options are subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of your options
rises and falls with the value of SBC Stock. The ultimate value of your options
will depend on the price of SBC Stock at the time of exercise. You make the
decision whether or not to exercise your options (you are not required to
exercise them as part of your employment). </FONT></P>

through the close of business on September 4, 2001, you met
<B><I>all</I></B> of the following criteria: </FONT></P>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>you held a job title that was subject to the IBEW Agreement, or you held a job

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Grant Price</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant price of your
options is $42.00 per share, which was the closing price on the New York Stock
Exchange (<B><I>&#147;NYSE&#148;</I></B>) on September 4, 2001. Once an
option is issued, the grant price does not change regardless of later changes in
the market price of SBC Stock. See the section entitled &#147;Change in
Capitalization&#148; on page 4 for other events that may affect your options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
When Options May Be Exercised</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first date you may
exercise your options is September 3, 2002 (also called the vesting date). You
will receive additional information about exercising your options and who to
contact with any questions prior to that date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     If you decide to exercise your options, you need to decide whether to:</FONT></P>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>simultaneously sell the SBC Stock received from the exercise and receive cash (a
<I>cashless exercise</I> &#150; you receive the cash proceeds without any
out-of-pocket cash from you), or</font></li>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2> keep the SBC Stock received from the exercise as an investment (a <I>cash

grant price).</FONT></li>
</ul>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>When Options May Not Be Exercised</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B><I>Your options may not

However, if your employment is terminated on or before September 1, 2006, you
may lose your options or the time period to exercise your options may be
shortened (see table below). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Termination of
employment</B> means you are no longer employed by any entity that is, directly

(1) Under no circumstances may any options be exercised after the close of business for

(2) If the 90<SUP>th</SUP> day falls on a

Your Options</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not have to exercise
your options, but if you do decide to exercise, then <B><I>all options from this
grant must be exercised at the same time and on or before their expiration date.</I></B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Options shall be exercised
by notifying the designated agent selected by SBC (if no agent has been
designated, then to SBC) in accordance with procedures established by SBC.
Options may only be exercised during certain business hours selected by SBC. You
decide how you want to exercise your options, depending on whether you want to
receive cash (a <I>Cashless Exercise</I>) or SBC Stock (a <I>Cash Purchase
Exercise</I>). Both methods are described below (also see section entitled
&#147;Federal Income Tax Effects,&#148; on next page). The amounts used in the
examples do not represent actual amounts, and are only used for purposes of
illustration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cashless Exercise:</B>
If you do not want to keep the SBC Stock purchased when you exercise your
options, you may sell the shares simultaneously with the exercise and receive
cash. You do not have to use any of your own money. You simply tell the agent to
sell all of the SBC Stock to be received upon the exercise of your options. The
agent will deduct the total grant price, tax withholding and brokerage fees from
the proceeds, and send you a check for the remaining profits. (In connection
with the sale of SBC Stock, the designated agent will be acting solely as your
agent, and SBC disclaims any responsibility for the actions of the agent in
making any such sales.) </FONT></P>

as additional Federal tax withholding, or, at the option of SBC, paid to you in
cash. In our Cash Purchase example, the fractional share (.75) was withheld as
additional tax withholding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<b>Grant of Options:</b>  No income is  recognized  by you at the time the options are granted.  If you do not exercise the options,  you will

the total market price of $9,000 for the SBC Stock less the total grant price of
$6,300). SBC will report the ordinary income on your W-2 for the year the
options are exercised, and will receive a tax deduction equal to the ordinary
income reported on your W-2. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Other Terms</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Administration: </B>The
Human Resources Committee of SBC (the
<B><I>&#147;Committee&#148;</I></B><I></I>) will administer the options and, in
its sole discretion, may interpret and construe any provisions of this grant.
The Committee may also establish, adopt or revise any rules and regulations as
it may deem necessary or advisable. All decisions of the Committee shall be
final and binding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Applicable Law:</B> Your
options are governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of
the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle
that might otherwise refer constructive interpretation of this grant to the
substantive law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the options are
granted and administered in Texas, SBC and the holders of options irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate federal or
state court in Bexar County, Texas, and no other. To promote consistency in
application of the law to the grants, claims arising out of the grant of options
shall be heard and determined in federal or state court in Bexar County, Texas,
and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties
and over the subject matter of any dispute relating to the grant of options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Change in
Capitalization:</B> In the event of a merger, reorganization, liquidation,
consolidation, recapitalization, separation, stock split, stock dividend, share
combination, or other change in SBC&#146;s corporate structure affecting shares
of SBC Stock, the Committee shall adjust, as it determines in its sole
discretion to be appropriate and equitable, the number and class of and/or price
of shares of stock subject to outstanding options granted under this grant,
and/or in the number of outstanding options, to prevent dilution or enlargement
of rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Employment Status:</B>
You shall not consider any statements in this notice or any action taken
hereunder as a contract of employment or as giving you any right<B> </B>to
continued employment with an SBC company. Terms of your employment are covered
by your IBEW Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Transferability:</B>
During your lifetime, your options may be exercised only by you or your guardian
or legal representative. If you die after September 2, 2002, your options may
only be transferred pursuant to a will or the laws of descent and distribution,
as applicable. After you die, your options may be exercised only by the then
owner (including, but not limited to, the executor or administrator of your
estate) or the holder&#146;s guardian or legal representative. The new holder of
your options will have 90 days after your death to exercise your options or
until September 1, 2006, whichever occurs first. All other terms of your options
will apply to the new holder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When options have been
transferred, SBC or its designated agent may require appropriate documentation
that the person exercising the option has the right to exercise the option. </FONT></P>
