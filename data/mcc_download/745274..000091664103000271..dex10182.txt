     Section 1.2 Purchase Procedures; Assignment of the Purchaser's Interests.

     (a)  Purchase Request. Each Purchase from the Seller by the Purchaser shall
be made on irrevocable notice from the Seller to the Agent (on behalf of the

     (c)  Assignment of Asset Interest. The Seller hereby sells, assigns and

     Section 1.3 Reinvestments of Certain Collections; Payment of Remaining
Collections.

     (a)  On the close of business on each day during the period from the date
of the first Purchase to the Termination Date, the Master Servicer will, out of
all Collections received on such day from Pool Receivables and Related Assets:

          (i)   determine the portion of the Collections attributable to the
     Asset Interest by multiplying (A) the amount of such Collections times (B)
     the Purchaser's Share;

          (ii)  out of the portion of such Collections allocated to the Asset
     Interest pursuant to clause (i), identify and hold in trust for the
     Purchaser an amount equal to the sum of the estimated amount (based on the
     rate information provided by the Agent pursuant to Section 2.5) of Earned
     Discount and CP Costs accrued in respect of each Asset Tranche, all other
     amounts due to the Purchaser or the Agent hereunder and the Purchaser's
     Share of the Servicer's Fee (in each case, accrued through such day) and
     not so previously accounted for; and

          (iii) apply the Collections allocated to the Asset Interest pursuant
     to clause (i) and not required to be identified and held in trust pursuant
     to clause (ii) to the purchase from the Seller of ownership interests in
     Pool Receivables and Related Assets (each such purchase being a
     "Reinvestment"); provided that:

                (A)  if (I) the then Asset Interest would exceed 100% or (II)
          the Invested Amount would exceed the Purchase Limit, then the Master
          Servicer shall not reinvest to the extent of such excess, but shall
          identify and hold in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser, a portion
          of such Collections which, together with other Collections previously
          so identified and then so held, shall equal the amount necessary to
          reduce the Invested Amount to the Purchase Limit and the Asset
          Interest to 100%; and

                (B)  if any of the conditions precedent to Reinvestment in
          clause (a), (b) and (d) of Section 5.2, subject to the proviso set
          forth in Section 5.2, are not satisfied, then the Master Servicer
          shall not reinvest any of such remaining Collections, but shall
          identify them and hold them in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser;

          (iv)  out of the portion of Collections not allocated to the Asset
     Interest pursuant to clause (i), pay to the Master Servicer the Seller's
     Share of the Servicer's Fee accrued through such day and not previously
     paid; and

                                        6

<PAGE>

          (v)  pay to the Seller (A) the remaining portion of Collections not
     allocated to the Asset Interest pursuant to clause (i) net of the amount
     paid to the Master Servicer pursuant to clause (iv) and (B) the Collections
     applied to Reinvestment pursuant to clause (iii).

     (b)  Unreinvested Collections. The Master Servicer shall identify and hold
in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser all Collections allocated to the Asset
Interest pursuant to clause (i) of Section 1.3(a) which, pursuant to clause
(iii) of Section 1.3(a), may not be reinvested in the Pool Receivables and
Related Assets, provided that unless otherwise requested by the Agent after a
Liquidation Event, such Collections need not be held in a segregated account.
If, prior to the date when such Collections are required to be paid to the Agent
for the benefit of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.3(c)(iv), (1) the amount
of Collections so identified exceeds the greater of (x) the amount, if any,
necessary to reduce the Invested Amount to the Purchase Limit and (y) the Asset
Interest to 100%, and (2) the conditions precedent to Reinvestment set forth in
clauses (a), (b) and (d) of Section 5.2, subject to the proviso set forth in
Section 5.2, are satisfied, then the Master Servicer shall apply such
Collections (or, if less, a portion of such Collections equal to the amount of
such excess) to the making of a Reinvestment.

     (c)  Payment of Amounts. Unless a Lock-Box Notice has been given and
alternate instructions have been given by the Agent pursuant thereto:

          (i)   The Master Servicer shall pay all amounts identified pursuant to
     Section 1.3(a)(ii) in respect of Earned Discount on an Asset Tranche funded
     by a Liquidity Funding to the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, on the last
     day of the then current Yield Period for an Asset Tranche, as provided in
     Section 3.1.

          (ii)  The Master Servicer shall pay all amounts of Collections
     identified pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii) in respect of CP Costs on any
     Asset Tranche funded by Commercial Paper Notes to the Agent, on the
     Purchaser's behalf, on the Settlement Date following the last day of the
     then current CP Accrual Period for such Asset Tranche, as provided in
     Section 3.1.

          (iii) The Master Servicer shall pay all amounts of Collections
     identified pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii) and not applied pursuant to
     clauses (i) or (ii) above to the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, on each
     Settlement Date for each Settlement Period, as provided in Section 3.1.

          (iv)  The Master Servicer shall pay all other amounts identified and
     held in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
     to the Agent for the account of the Purchaser (A) on the last day of the
     then current Yield Period for any Asset Tranche funded by a Liquidity
     Funding, as notified pursuant to Section 3.1(b), in an amount not exceeding
     the Purchaser's Tranche Investment of such Asset Tranche, and (B) on the
     last day of the then current CP Accrual Period for any Asset Tranche funded
     by Commercial Paper Notes, as notified pursuant to Section 3.1(b), in an
     amount not exceeding the Purchaser's Tranche Investment of such Asset
     Tranche; provided, however, no payment

                                        7

<PAGE>

     shall be made under clause (B) above unless the Purchaser's Tranche
     Investments of all Asset Tranches, if any, funded by Liquidity Fundings
     shall have been reduced to zero.

     (d)  Funds Under Sale Agreement. Upon the written request of the Agent, on
the Purchaser's behalf, given at any time when (i) based on the most recent
Settlement Report, the Asset Interest would exceed 100% or the Invested Amount
would exceed the Purchase Limit, or (ii) a Liquidation Event or Unmatured
Liquidation Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Seller shall hold
all funds that under the Sale Agreement would be applied to repay principal of
the Seller Notes owing to the Originators. The Seller may make withdrawals of
such funds only for the purposes of (i) at any time, purchasing Receivables from
any Originator in accordance with the Sale Agreement; (ii) on the Settlement
Date for any Settlement Period, making payments in accordance with the last
sentence of Section 3.1(c)(ii), and (iii) on the Settlement Date for any
Settlement Period, if, on the basis of the most recent Settlement Report, and
after giving effect to any payment made to the Master Servicer on such date
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.1(c)(ii), the Invested Amount does
not exceed the Purchase Limit and the Asset Interest does not exceed 100%, and
provided that no Liquidation Event or Unmatured Liquidation Event shall have
occurred and be continuing, repaying principal of the Seller Notes in accordance
with this Agreement and the Sale Agreement.

     (e)  If, on any day any payment is required to be made pursuant to any of
the provisions of Section 1.3(c), the Seller does not have sufficient funds
available to make any such payment, the Master Servicer may make a Servicer
Advance in an amount necessary for the payment, subject to the restrictions set
forth in Section 8.3.

     (f)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Master Servicer
may recover any Servicer Advance that it has made in respect of any Receivable
or related Contract from amounts received in respect of such Receivable or
related Contract. If the Master Servicer has previously made a Servicer Advance
which it later determines to be nonrecoverable, the Master Servicer may,
following delivery of an officer's certificate to the Agent detailing the Master
Servicer's determination that such Servicer Advance is nonrecoverable, recover
the amount of such Servicer Advance from Collections. Any amount so recovered by
the Master Servicer shall not be a Collection for purposes of this Section 1.3.

     Section 1.4 Asset Interest.

     (a)  Components of Asset Interest. On any date the Asset Interest will
represent the Purchaser's undivided percentage ownership interest in all then
outstanding Pool Receivables and all Related Assets with respect to such Pool
Receivables as at such date.

     (b)  Computation of Asset Interest. On any date, the Asset Interest will be
equal to a percentage equivalent of the following fraction:

                                     IA + RR
                                   -----------
                                       NPB

          where:

          IA   =   Invested Amount as of the time of such computation;

                                        8

<PAGE>

          RR   =   the then Required Reserve; and

          NPB  =   the then Net Pool Balance

provided, however, that the Asset Interest during the Liquidation Period shall
equal 100% and shall at no time exceed 100%.

     (c)  Frequency of Computation. The Asset Interest shall be computed (i) as
provided in Section 3.1, as of the Cut-Off Date for each Settlement Period, and
(ii) on the Settlement Date following each Reporting Date, after giving effect
to the payments made pursuant to Section 3.1. In addition, at any time, the
Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, may require the Master Servicer to provide a
Settlement Report, based on the information then available to the Master
Servicer, for purposes of computing the Asset Interest or the Purchase Limit as
of any other date, and the Master Servicer agrees to do so within five (5) (or
three (3), if a Liquidation Event has occurred and is continuing) Business Days
of its receipt of the Agent's request.

                                  ARTICLE II.
                               COMPUTATIONAL RULES

     Section 2.1 Selection of Asset Tranches.

          The Agent shall, from time to time for purposes of computing Earned
Discount on that portion of the Asset Interest funded with Liquidity Fundings,
divide the Asset Interest into Asset Tranches; in doing so, the Agent shall,
prior to the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, consult with the Seller. The
applicable Earned Discount Rate may be different for each Asset Tranche funded
by a Liquidity Funding. The total Invested Amount shall be allocated to the
Asset Tranches by the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, to reflect the funding
sources for the Asset Interest such that the total amount of the Purchaser's
Tranche Investments of such Asset Tranches shall equal the Invested Amount, so
that:

          (a)  there will be a single Asset Tranche with a Purchaser's Tranche
     Investment equal to the excess of the Invested Amount over the aggregate
     amount allocated at such time pursuant to clause (b) below, which Asset
     Tranche shall reflect the portion of the Asset Interest funded by
     Commercial Paper Notes; and

          (b)  there will be one or more Asset Tranches, selected by the Agent,
     on the Purchaser's behalf, reflecting the portion or portions of the Asset
     Interest funded by outstanding Liquidity Fundings.

     Section 2.2 Computation of Invested Amount and Purchaser's Tranche
Investment.

          In making any determination of the Invested Amount and any Purchaser's
Tranche Investment, the following rules shall apply:

                                        9

<PAGE>

     (a)  the Invested Amount shall not be considered reduced by any allocation,
setting aside or distribution of any portion of Collections unless such
Collections shall have been actually delivered hereunder to the Agent, on the
Purchaser's behalf;

     (b)  the Invested Amount shall not be considered reduced by any
distribution of any portion of Collections if at any time such distribution is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason; and

     (c)  if there is any reduction in the Invested Amount, there shall be a
corresponding reduction in the Purchaser's Tranche Investment with respect to
one or more Asset Tranches selected by the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, in
its discretion.

     Section 2.3 Computation of Concentration Limits and Unpaid Balance.

          The Obligor Concentration Limits and the aggregate Unpaid Balance of
Pool Receivables of any Obligor and its Affiliated Obligors (if any) shall be
calculated as if such Obligor and its Affiliated Obligors were one Obligor.

     Section 2.4 Computation of Earned Discount.

          In making any determination of Earned Discount, the following rules
shall apply:

     (a)  the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, shall determine the Earned
Discount accruing with respect to each Asset Tranche funded with a Liquidity
Funding for each Yield Period, in accordance with the definition of Earned
Discount;

     (b)  no provision of this Agreement shall require the payment or permit the
collection of Earned Discount in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable
law; and

     (c)  the Earned Discount for any Asset Tranche shall not be considered paid
by any distribution if at any time such distribution is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned for any reason.

It is the intent of the Purchaser to fund the Asset Interest by the issuance of
Commercial Paper Notes. If the Purchaser is unable, or determines that it is
undesirable, to issue Commercial Paper Notes to fund the Asset Interest, or is
unable to repay such Commercial Paper Notes upon the maturity thereof, the
Purchaser will draw on Liquidity Fundings to fund the Asset Interest to the
extent Liquidity Fundings are available. If the Purchaser funds or refinances
its investment in an Asset Tranche through a Liquidity Funding, in lieu of
paying CP Costs on the Invested Amount thereof, the Seller will pay Earned
Discount thereon at a Bank Rate selected in accordance with this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a commitment of the Purchaser to
issue Commercial Paper Notes.

     Section 2.5 Estimates of Earned Discount Rate, Fees, etc.

          For purposes of determining the amounts required to be identified and
held in trust by Master Servicer pursuant to Section 1.3, the Agent, on the
Purchaser's behalf, shall

                                       10

<PAGE>

notify the Master Servicer (and, if Cadmus is not the Master Servicer, the
Seller) from time to time of the Purchaser's Tranche Investment of each Asset
Tranche, the Earned Discount Rate applicable to each Asset Tranche funded by a
Liquidity Funding and the rates at which fees and other amounts are accruing
hereunder. It is understood and agreed that (i) the CP Costs for any Asset
Tranche funded through the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes are determined in
arrears and may change from one applicable CP Accrual Period to the next, (ii)
the Earned Discount Rate for any Asset Tranche funded through a Liquidity
Funding may change from one applicable Yield Period to the next, (iii) the Bank
Rate used to calculate the Earned Discount Rate may change from time to time
during an applicable Yield Period, (iv) certain rate information provided by the
Agent to the Master Servicer shall be based upon the Agent's good faith
estimate, (v) the amount of Earned Discount actually accrued with respect to an
Asset Tranche funded through a Liquidity Funding during any Yield Period may
exceed, or be less than, the amount identified with respect thereto by Master
Servicer, and (vi) the amount of fees or other amounts payable by the Seller
hereunder which have accrued hereunder with respect to any Settlement Period may
exceed, or be less than, the amount identified with respect thereto by the
Master Servicer. Failure to identify and hold in trust any amount so accrued
shall not relieve the Master Servicer of its obligation to remit Collections to
the Agent, for the benefit of the Purchaser, with respect to such accrued
amount, as and to the extent provided in Section 3.1.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                                   SETTLEMENTS

     Section 3.1 Settlement Procedures.

          The parties hereto will take the following actions with respect to
each Settlement Period:

     (a)  Settlement Report. On the Reporting Date, the Master Servicer shall
deliver to the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, a report in the form of Exhibit
3.1(a-1) or, in the case of a Reporting Date pursuant to clause (b) of the
definition of the Reporting Date, in the form of Exhibit 3.1(a-2) (each, a
"Settlement Report").

     (b)  Earned Discount and CP Costs; Other Amounts Due.

          (i)  (A) On or before 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) two (2)
     Business Days before the last day of each Yield Period, the Agent shall
     notify the Master Servicer of the amount of Earned Discount accrued with
     respect to any Asset Tranche corresponding to such Yield Period, and (B) on
     or before 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) five (5) Business Days before
     each Reporting Date, the Agent shall notify the Master Servicer of the
     amount of CP Costs accrued during the CP Accrual Period then most recently
     ended with respect to any Asset Tranche funded with Commercial Paper Notes
     during all or any portion of such CP Accrual Period.

          (ii) The Master Servicer shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of the
     Purchaser the amount of such Earned Discount before 12:00 noon (Atlanta,
     Georgia time) on the

                                       11

<PAGE>

     last day of such Yield Period and the amount of such CP Costs before 12:00
     noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) on each Settlement Date.

          (iii) On or before 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the Business
     Day before each Reporting Date, the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, shall
     notify the Master Servicer of all Broken Funding Costs, fees and other
     amounts accrued and payable by the Seller under this Agreement during the
     prior calendar month (other than amounts described in clause (c) below).
     The Master Servicer shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the
     Purchaser, the amount of such Broken Funding Costs, fees and other amounts
     on the Settlement Date for such month. Such payments shall be made out of
     amounts identified pursuant to Section 1.3 for such payment; provided,
     however, that to the extent that Collections attributable to the Asset
     Interest during such Settlement Period are not sufficient to make such
     payment, the shortfall shall be paid from amounts paid to the Seller
     pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(v) and, if such amounts are not sufficient to
     fully cover such shortfall, the Master Servicer may make a Servicer Advance
     in the amount of such remaining shortfall in accordance with, and subject
     to the provisions of Section 8.3.

     (c)  Asset Interest Computations.

          (i)   On the Reporting Date for each Settlement Period, the Master
     Servicer shall compute, as of the related Cut-Off Date and based upon the
     assumptions in the next sentence, (A) the Asset Interest, (B) the amount of
     the reduction or increase (if any) in the Invested Amount and the
     percentage interest represented by the Asset Interest since the immediately
     preceding Cut-Off Date, (C) the excess (if any) of the Asset Interest over
     100%, and (D) the excess (if any) of the Invested Amount over the Purchase
     Limit. Such calculations shall be based upon the assumptions that (x) the
     information in the Settlement Report is correct, and (y) Collections
     identified pursuant to Section 1.3(b) will be paid to the Agent, for the
     benefit of the Purchaser, on the Settlement Date for such Settlement
     Period.

          (ii)  If, according to the computations made pursuant to clause (i)
     above, either (x) the Asset Interest exceeds 100% or (y) the Invested
     Amount exceeds the Purchase Limit, then on the Settlement Date for such
     Settlement Period, the Master Servicer shall pay to the Agent, for the
     benefit of the Purchaser, (to the extent of Collections during the related
     Settlement Period attributable to all Asset Tranches and not previously
     paid to the Agent and from other funds of the Seller) the amount necessary
     to reduce the Invested Amount to the Purchase Limit and the Asset Interest
     to 100%, subject, however, to the proviso to Section 1.3(c)(iv). Such
     payment shall be made out of amounts identified pursuant to Section 1.3 for
     such purpose and, to the extent such amounts were not so identified, the
     Seller hereby agrees to pay such amounts to the Master Servicer to the
     extent of Collections applied to Reinvestment under Section 1.3 during the
     relevant Settlement Period.

          (iii) In addition to the payments described in clause (ii) above,
     during the Liquidation Period, the Master Servicer shall pay to the Agent,
     for the benefit of the Purchaser, all amounts identified pursuant to
     Section 1.3 (A) on the last day of the current

                                       12

<PAGE>

     Yield Period for any Asset Tranche funded by a Liquidity Funding, in an
     amount not exceeding the Purchaser's Tranche Investment of such Asset
     Tranche, and (B) after reduction to zero of the Purchaser's Tranche
     Investments of the Asset Tranches, if any, funded by Liquidity Fundings, on
     the last day of the each CP Accrual Period, in an amount not exceeding the
     Purchaser's Tranche Investment of the Asset Tranche funded by Commercial
     Paper Notes.

     (d)  Order of Application. Upon receipt by the Agent, on the Purchaser's
behalf, of funds distributed pursuant to this Section 3.1, the Agent shall apply
them to the items specified in the subclauses below, in the order of priority of
such subclauses:

          (i)   to accrued Earned Discount , CP Costs and Broken Funding Costs,
     plus any previously accrued Earned Discount, CP Costs and Broken Funding
     Costs not paid ;

          (ii)  to the Purchaser's Share of the accrued and unpaid Servicer's
     Fee (if the Master Servicer is not Cadmus or its Affiliate);

          (iii) to the Usage Fee and the Unused Fee accrued during such
     Settlement Period, plus any previously accrued Usage Fee and Unused Fee not
     paid on a prior Settlement Date;

          (iv)  to the reduction of Invested Amount, to the extent such
     reduction is required under Section 3.1(c);

          (v)   to other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to the Purchaser or
     the Agent hereunder (except Earned Discount on any Asset Tranche funded by
     a Liquidity Funding which has accrued but is not yet overdue under Section
     1.3(c)); and

          (vi)  to the Purchaser's Share of the accrued and unpaid Servicer's
     Fee (if the Master Servicer is Cadmus or its Affiliate);

     (e)  Non-Distribution of Servicer's Fee. The Agent hereby consents (which
consent may be revoked at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Liquidation Event), to the retention by the Master Servicer of
the amounts (if any) identified pursuant to Section 1.3 in respect of the
Servicer's Fee, in which case no distribution shall be made in respect of the
Purchaser's Share of the Servicer's Fee pursuant to clause (d) above.

     (f)  Delayed Payment. If on any day described in this Section 3.1 (or in
Section 1.3(c)), because Collections during the relevant CP Accrual Period or
Yield Period were less than the aggregate amounts payable, the Master Servicer
shall not make any payment otherwise required, the next available Collections in
respect of the Asset Interest shall be applied to such payment, and no
Reinvestment shall be permitted hereunder until such amount payable has been
paid in full.

     Section 3.2 Deemed Collections; Reduction of Invested Amount, Etc.

     (a)  Deemed Collections. If on any day

                                       13

<PAGE>

          (i)  the Unpaid Balance of any Pool Receivable is

               (A) reduced as a result of any defective, rejected or returned
          merchandise or services, any cash discount, or any other adjustment by
          any Seller Party or any Affiliate thereof, or as a result of any
          tariff or other governmental or regulatory action, or

               (B) reduced or canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of any
          claim by the Obligor thereof (whether such claim arises out of the
          same or a related or an unrelated transaction), or

               (C) reduced on account of the obligation of any Seller Party or
          any Affiliate thereof to pay to the related Obligor any rebate or
          refund, or

               (D) less than the amount included in calculating the Net Pool
          Balance for purposes of any Settlement Report (for any reason other
          than such Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable), or

          (ii) any of the representations or warranties of the Seller set forth
     in Section 6.1(l) or (p) were not true when made with respect to any Pool
     Receivable, or any of the representations or warranties of the Seller set
     forth in Section 6.1(l) are no longer true with respect to any Pool
     Receivable, or any Pool Receivable is repurchased by the applicable
     Originator pursuant to the Sale Agreement,

then, on such day, the Seller shall be deemed to have received a Collection of
such Pool Receivable

          (I)  in the case of clause (i) above, in the amount of such reduction
     or cancellation or the difference between the actual Unpaid Balance and the
     amount included in calculating such Net Pool Balance, as applicable; and

          (II) in the case of clause (ii) above, in the amount of the Unpaid
     Balance of such Pool Receivable.

Collections deemed received by the Seller under this Section 3.2(a) are herein
referred to as "Deemed Collections." The Purchaser shall, with respect to any
Pool Receivable as to which the full Deemed Collection due under clause II above
has been received by the Purchaser, upon receipt of such Deemed Collection by
the Purchaser, reconvey to the Seller, without recourse, representation or
warranty by the Purchaser, all of the Purchaser's right, title and interest in
such Pool Receivable. Such Pool Receivable shall be released from any Lien
thereon created hereby and the Seller shall be deemed to reconvey to the related
Originator, without recourse, representation or warranty by the Seller, all of
the Seller's right, title and interest in such Pool Receivable.

     (b) Seller's Optional Reduction of Invested Amount. The Seller may at any
time elect to reduce the Invested Amount as follows:

                                       14

<PAGE>

          (i)   the Seller shall provide the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf,
     with prior written notice in conformity with the Required Notice Period (a
     "Reduction Notice") of any proposed reduction of the aggregate Invested
     Amount. Such Reduction Notice shall designate (i) the date (the "Proposed
     Reduction Date") upon which any such reduction of aggregate Invested Amount
     shall occur (which date shall give effect to the applicable Required Notice
     Period), and (ii) the amount of aggregate Invested Amount to be reduced
     which shall be applied ratably to all Asset Tranches in accordance with the
     respective Invested Amounts thereof (the "Aggregate Reduction"). Only one
     (1) Reduction Notice shall be outstanding at any time.

          (ii)  on the Proposed Reduction Date, the Master Servicer shall
     refrain from reinvesting Collections pursuant to Section 1.3 until the
     amount thereof not so reinvested shall equal the desired amount of
     Aggregate Reduction, and

          (iii) the Master Servicer shall hold such Collections in trust for the
     Purchaser, pending payment to the Agent, as provided in Section 1.3;

provided that:

                (A) the amount of any such Aggregate Reduction shall be in (1)
          an amount of at least $10,000 or (2) an amount equal to the remaining
          Invested Amount,

                (B) the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to attempt to choose
          an Aggregate Reduction amount, and the date of commencement thereof,
          so that such reduction shall commence and conclude in the same
          Settlement Period,

                (C) unless the Invested Amount will be reduced to zero, after
          giving effect to such Aggregate Reduction, the Invested Amount will be
          at least $25,000,000,

                (D) Aggregate Reductions made pursuant to this Section 3.2(b)
          shall occur on Settlement Dates and on up to two (2) additional
          Business Days in any Settlement Period, and

                (E) the number of Purchases pursuant to Section 1.1 and
          Aggregate Reductions pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) shall not exceed,
          in the aggregate, three (3) in any Settlement Period (or two (2) in
          any Settlement Period in which at least one of such Purchases or one
          of such Aggregate Reductions does not occur on the applicable
          Settlement Date).

     Section 3.3 Payments and Computations, Etc.

     (a)  Payments. All amounts to be paid to the Agent or any other Person or

Collections as Earned Discount, accrued Servicer's Fee, repayment of Invested
Amount, and to other accrued amounts owing hereunder to the same extent as if
such Deemed Collections had actually been received on the date of such delivery
to the Master Servicer. If Collections are then being paid to the Agent, on the
Purchaser's behalf, or its designee, or lock boxes or accounts directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by the Agent, the Master Servicer shall forthwith
cause such Deemed Collections to be paid to the Agent, on the Purchaser's
behalf, or its designee or to such lock boxes or accounts, as applicable, or as
the Agent shall request. So long as the Seller shall hold any Collections
(including Deemed Collections) required to be paid to the Master Servicer, the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, it shall hold such Collections in trust for the
benefit of the Agent, on behalf of the Purchaser, and shall clearly mark its
records to reflect such trust; provided that unless the Agent shall have
requested it in writing to do so, the Seller shall not be required to hold such
Collections in a separate deposit account containing only such Collections.

               (A) shall subject an Affected Party to any tax, duty or other
          charge with respect to the Asset Interest or any Asset Tranche owned
          by or funded by it, or any obligations or right to make Purchases or
          Reinvestments or to provide funding therefor, or shall change the

          Tranche owned by or funded by it or its obligations or rights, if any,
          to make Purchases or Reinvestments or to provide funding therefor
          (except for (1) taxes based on, or measured by, net income, or changes
          in the rate of tax on or determined by reference to the overall net
          income, of such Affected Party imposed by the United States of
          America, or by the jurisdiction in which such Affected Party's
          principal executive office is located and, if such Affected Party's
          principal executive office is not in the United States of America, by
          the jurisdiction where such Affected Party's principal office in the
          United States is located or, (2) franchise taxes, taxes on, or in the
          nature of, doing business taxes or capital taxes); or

               (B) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
          (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Federal
          Reserve Board, but excluding any reserve included in the determination
          of Earned Discount), special deposit or similar requirement against
          assets of any Affected Party, deposits or obligations with or for the
          account of any Affected Party or with or for the account of any
          affiliate (or entity deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be an

          Party; or

               (C) shall change the amount of capital maintained or required or
          requested or directed to be maintained by any Affected Party; or

          to provide funding therefor; or

               (E) shall change the rate for, or the manner in which the Federal
          Deposit Insurance Corporation (or a successor thereto) assesses,
          deposit insurance premiums or similar charges;

and the result of any of the foregoing is or would be

          (x)   to increase the cost to or to impose a cost on (I) an Affected
     Party funding or making or maintaining any Purchases or Reinvestments, any
     purchases, reinvestments, or loans or other extensions of credit under the
     Liquidity Agreement, or any commitment of such Affected Party with respect
     to any of the

                                       17

<PAGE>

     foregoing, or (II) the Agent for continuing its or the Seller's
     relationship with the Purchaser, in each case, in an amount deemed to be
     material by such Affected Party,

          (y) to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by an
     Affected Party under this Agreement or under the Liquidity Agreement, or

          (z) in the reasonable determination of such Affected Party, to reduce
     the rate of return on the capital of an Affected Party as a consequence of
     its obligations hereunder or arising in connection herewith to a level
     below that which such Affected Party could otherwise have achieved,

then, within thirty days after demand by such Affected Party (which demand shall
be accompanied by a certificate setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
of such demand and the methodology for calculating, and the calculation of, the
amounts claimed by the Affected Party), the Seller shall pay directly to such
Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Affected Party for such additional or increased cost or such reduction.

     (b)  Each Affected Party will promptly notify the Seller and the Agent of
any event of which it has knowledge (including any future event that, in the
judgment of such Affected Party, is reasonably certain to occur) which will
entitle such Affected Party to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.2;
provided, however, no failure to give or delay in giving such notification shall
adversely affect the rights of any Affected Party to such compensation.

     (c)  In determining any amount provided for or referred to in this Section
4.2, an Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods
(consistent with its ordinary business practices) that it (in its discretion)
shall deem applicable. Any Affected Party when making a claim under this Section
4.2 shall submit to the Seller the certificate (referred to in subsection (a)
above) as to such increased cost or reduced return (including calculation
thereof in reasonable detail), which statement shall, in the absence of
demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding upon the Seller.

     (d)  The Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause any Affected Party
that makes a claim for payment under this Section 4.2 to take reasonable
measures to minimize the amounts payable by the Seller pursuant to this Section
4.2.

     (e)  For avoidance of doubt, any interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board shall constitute an
adoption, change, request or directive subject to this Section 4.2.

     Section 4.3 Funding Losses.

          In the event that any Liquidity Bank shall actually incur any loss or
expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Liquidity Bank to make
any Liquidity Funding or maintain any Liquidity Funding) as a result of (i) any
settlement with respect to the Purchaser's Tranche Investment of any Asset
Tranche funded by a Liquidity Funding being made on any day other

                                       18

<PAGE>

than the scheduled last day of an applicable Yield Period with respect thereto
(it being understood that the foregoing shall not apply to any portion of the
Purchasers' Tranche Investment that is accruing Earned Discount calculated by
reference to the Base Rate), or (ii) any Purchase not being made in accordance
with a request therefor under Section 1.2, then, upon written notice from the
Agent to the Seller and the Master Servicer, the Seller shall pay to the Master
Servicer, and the Master Servicer shall pay to the Agent for the account of such
Liquidity Bank, the amount of such loss or expense. Such written notice (which
shall include the methodology for calculating, and the calculation of, the
amount of such loss or expense, in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding upon the Seller and the Master
Servicer.

constitutes, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller Party,
enforceable against such Seller Party in accordance with its terms, except as

creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity, regardless of

not (i) conflict with, result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions
of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, its articles or certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or any material
indenture, loan agreement, receivables purchase agreement, mortgage, deed of
trust, or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or
any of its properties is bound, (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such material
indenture, loan agreement, receivables purchase agreement, mortgage, deed of

regulation applicable to it of any court or of any federal or state regulatory
body, administrative agency, or other governmental instrumentality having
jurisdiction over it or any of its properties; except where any such conflict,
breach, default, Lien or violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

       (f)     No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or investigations
against or affecting it which are pending, or, to its knowledge, threatened,
before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, or other tribunal or
governmental instrumentality (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or

         (iii) Other than the security interest granted to Agent for the benefit
of the Secured Parties pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller has not pledged,
assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
Collateral.

         (iv)  The Seller's jurisdiction of organization is a jurisdiction whose
law generally requires information concerning the existence of a nonpossessory

collateral.

         (v)   The Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of
any financing statements against the Seller that include a description of
collateral covering the Collateral other than any financing statement relating

hereunder or that has been terminated. The Seller is not aware of any judgment
or tax lien filings against the Seller.

         (vi)  Each Receivable is an "account", "instrument", "general
intangible" or "chattel paper" as defined in the UCC.

     (s) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. With respect to each Pool
Receivable, it has complied in all material respects with the Credit and
Collection Policy.

     (t) Payments to Originators. With respect to each Receivable transferred to
the Seller by the Originators pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Seller has
given reasonably equivalent value to each Originator in consideration for the
Receivables originated by it and the Related Assets with respect thereto and
such transfer was not made for or on account of antecedent debt.

names, trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed
this Agreement.

     (v) Ownership of the Seller. Cadmus owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants
or other rights to acquire securities of the Seller.

     (w) Investment Company. The Seller is not an "investment company" within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time,
or any successor statute.

     (x) Taxes. It has filed all material tax returns and reports required by
law to have been filed by it and has paid all taxes and governmental charges
thereby shown to be owing, except to the extent any failure to file such returns
or reports or pay such taxes or charges would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (y) Compliance with Laws. It is in compliance with all applicable laws,
including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws, except where any failure
to comply with any such laws would not, alone or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     other than its attorneys, auditors and other professionals, and a Master
     Servicer and any other agent contemplated by the Transaction Documents for
     the Receivables Pool, which the Master Servicer will be fully compensated
     for its services by payment of the Servicer's Fee, and certain
     organizational expenses in connection with the formation of the Seller;

                                       34

<PAGE>

          (v)    The Seller will contract with the Master Servicer to perform
     for the Seller all operations required on a daily basis to service the
     Receivables Pool. The Seller will pay the Master Servicer the Servicer's
     Fee pursuant hereto. The Seller will not incur any material indirect or
     overhead expenses for items shared with Cadmus (or any other Affiliate
     thereof) which are not reflected in the Servicer's Fee. To the extent, if
     any, that the Seller (or any other Affiliate thereof) share items of
     expenses not reflected in the Servicer's Fee, for legal, auditing and other
     professional services and directors' fees, such expenses will be allocated
     fairly and reasonably on the basis of actual use or the value of services
     rendered, and otherwise on a basis reasonably related to the actual use or
     the value of services rendered, it being understood that Cadmus shall pay
     all expenses relating to the preparation, negotiation, execution and
     delivery of the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation,
     legal, rating agency and other fees;

          (vi)   The Seller's operating expenses will not be paid by any other
     Seller Party or other Affiliate of the Seller and all of its liabilities
     will be paid out of its own funds;

          (vii)  The Seller will have its own stationery, invoices and checks;

          (viii) The books of account, financial reports and corporate records
     of the Seller will be maintained separately from any other Person;

          (ix)   Any financial statements of any Seller Party or Affiliate
     thereof which are consolidated to include the Seller will contain detailed
     notes clearly stating that (A) all of the Seller's assets are owned by the
     Seller, and (B) the Seller is a separate corporate entity with its own
     separate creditors that will be entitled to be satisfied out of the
     Seller's assets prior to any value in the Seller becoming available to the
     Seller's equity holders; and the accounting records and the published
     financial statements of each Originator will clearly show that, for
     accounting purposes, the Pool Receivables and Related Assets have been sold
     by such Originator to the Seller;

          (x)    The Seller's assets will be maintained in a manner that
     facilitates their identification and segregation from those of the Master
     Servicer and the other Affiliates;

          (xi)   The Seller will observe all corporate formalities required by
     its Certificate of Incorporation. Each Affiliate of the Seller will
     strictly observe corporate formalities in its dealings with the Seller,
     and, except as permitted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
     Collections, funds or other assets of the Seller will not be commingled
     with those of any other Person;

          (xii)  No Affiliate of the Seller will maintain joint bank accounts
     with the Seller or other depository accounts with the Seller to which any
     such Affiliate (other than in its capacity as the Master Servicer hereunder
     or under the Sale Agreement) has independent access, provided that prior to
     the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, Cadmus, in its capacity as Master
     Servicer and subject to the obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder,
     may manage Collections deposited into the Collection Account pursuant to

                                       35

<PAGE>

     centralized cash management procedures, including depositing Collections
     into general accounts of Cadmus;

          (xiii)  No Affiliate of the Seller shall, directly or indirectly, name
     the Seller or enter into any agreement to name the Seller as a direct or
     contingent beneficiary or loss payee on any insurance policy covering the
     property of any Affiliate of the Seller;

          (xiv)   Each Affiliate of the Seller will maintain arm's length
     relationships with the Seller, and each Affiliate of the Seller that
     renders or otherwise furnishes services or merchandise to the Seller will
     be compensated by the Seller at market rates for such services or
     merchandise;

          (xv)    No Affiliate of the Seller will be, nor will it hold itself
     out to be, responsible for the debts of the Seller or the decisions or
     actions in respect of the daily business and affairs of the Seller. Cadmus
     and the Seller will immediately correct any known misrepresentation with
     respect to the foregoing and they will not operate or purport to operate as
     an integrated single economic unit with respect to each other or in their
     dealing with any other entity. The Seller will not (i) guarantee or become
     obligated for the debts of any other person or hold out its credit as being
     available to satisfy the obligations of others, (ii) acquire obligations or
     securities of its shareholders or Affiliates or (iii) pledge its assets for
     the benefit of any other Person or make loans or advances to any other
     Person;

          (xvi)   The Seller will keep correct and complete books and records of
     account and minutes of the meetings and other proceedings of its
     stockholder and board of directors, as applicable, and the resolutions,
     agreements and other instruments of the Seller will be continuously
     maintained as official records by the Seller;

          (xvii)  The Seller, on the one hand, and each of the Originators, on
     the other hand, will conduct its business solely in its own corporate name
     and in such a separate manner so as not to mislead others with whom they
     are dealing and will correct any known misunderstanding regarding such
     Person's separate identity; and

          (xviii) The Seller will maintain adequate capital in light of its
     contemplated business operations.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.
                          ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION

     Section 8.1 Designation of Master Servicer.

     (a)  Cadmus as Initial Master Servicer. The servicing, administering and
collection of the Pool Receivables shall be conducted by the Person designated
as Master Servicer hereunder from time to time in accordance with this Section
8.1. Until the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, gives to Cadmus a Successor
Notice (as defined in Section 8.1(b)), Cadmus is hereby designated as, and
hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Master Servicer
pursuant to the terms hereof. Each of the Originators named in the Sale
Agreement, agrees to act as subservicer for the purpose of performing certain
duties and obligations with respect to all Receivables purchased by the Seller
from such Originator pursuant to the terms of the Sale Agreement. In so acting
as subservicer, each of such Originators shall comply with, and agrees to be
bound by, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement applicable to such
Originator in the performance of its duties as subservicer; provided, however,
that each such Originator (i) shall cease to act as subservicer upon the Agent's
delivery of a Successor Notice to Cadmus (with a copy to each such Originator),
(ii) shall not be entitled to receive any Servicer's Fee provided for herein,
and (iii) shall not be bound by, or be deemed to have made, any of the
representations, warranties or covenants in Articles V and VI applicable to the
"Seller Parties," except as expressly provided in the Sale Agreement.

     (b)  Successor Notice; Servicer Transfer Events. Upon Cadmus' receipt of a
notice from the Agent of the Agent's designation, on the Purchaser's behalf, of
a new Master Servicer (a "Successor Notice"), Cadmus agrees that it will
terminate its activities as Master Servicer hereunder in a manner that the Agent
believes will facilitate the transition of the performance of such activities to
the new Master Servicer, and the Agent (or its designee) shall assume each and
all of Cadmus' obligations to service and administer such Receivables, on the
terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and Cadmus shall use its
best efforts to assist the Agent (or its designee) in assuming such obligations.
Without limiting the foregoing, Cadmus agrees, at its expense, to take all
actions necessary to provide the new Master Servicer with access to all computer
software necessary or useful in collecting or billing Receivables, solely for
use in collecting and billing Receivables. The Agent agrees not to give Cadmus a
Successor Notice until after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Liquidation Event (any such event being herein called a "Servicer Transfer
Event"), in which case such Successor Notice may be given at any time in the
Agent's discretion. If Cadmus disputes the occurrence of a Servicer Transfer
Event, Cadmus may take appropriate action to resolve such dispute; provided that
Cadmus must terminate its activities hereunder as Master Servicer and allow the
newly designated Master Servicer to perform such activities on the date provided
by the Agent as described above, notwithstanding the commencement or
continuation of any proceeding to resolve the aforementioned dispute, if the
Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, reasonably determines, in good faith, that
such termination is necessary or advisable to protect the Purchaser's interests
hereunder.

     (c)  Subcontracts. The Master Servicer may, with the prior consent of the
Agent, subcontract with any other Person for servicing, administering or
collecting the Pool Receivables,

                                       37

<PAGE>

provided that the Master Servicer shall remain liable for the performance of the
duties and obligations of the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof and
such subservicing arrangement may be terminated at the Agent's request, on the
Purchaser's behalf, at anytime after a Successor Notice has been given.

     Section 8.2 Duties of Master Servicer.

     (a)  Appointment; Duties in General. Each of the Seller, the Purchaser and
the Agent hereby appoints as its agent the Master Servicer, as from time to time
designated pursuant to Section 8.1, to enforce its rights and interests in and
under the Pool Receivables and the Related Security. The Master Servicer shall
take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable to
collect each Pool Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations, with reasonable care and diligence, and
in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

     (b)  Allocation of Collections; Segregation. The Master Servicer shall
identify and hold in trust for the account of the Seller and Purchaser their
respective allocable shares of the Collections of Pool Receivables in accordance
with Section 1.3 but shall not be required (unless otherwise requested by the
Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, after the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Liquidation Event) to segregate the funds constituting such
portions of such Collections prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with
said Section. If instructed by the Agent, on the Purchaser's behalf, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Liquidation Event, the Master
Servicer shall segregate and deposit into the Collection Account, the
Purchaser's share of Collections of Pool Receivables, on the second Business Day
following receipt by the Master Servicer of such Collections in immediately
available funds.

     (c)  Modification of Receivables. So long as no Liquidation Event and no
Unmatured Liquidation Event shall have occurred and be continuing, Cadmus, while
it is Master Servicer, may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy,
(i) extend the maturity or adjust the Unpaid Balance of any Defaulted Receivable
as Cadmus may reasonably determine to be appropriate to maximize Collections
thereof, and (ii) adjust the Unpaid Balance of any Receivable to reflect the
reductions or cancellations described in the first sentence of Section 3.2(a).

     (d)  Documents and Records. Each Seller Party shall deliver to the Master
Servicer, and the Master Servicer shall hold in trust for the Seller and the
Purchaser in accordance with their respective interests, all documents,
instruments and records (including, without limitation, computer tapes or disks)
that evidence or relate to Pool Receivables.

     (e)  Certain Duties to the Seller. The Master Servicer shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt, turn over to the Seller (i) that portion of
Collections of Pool Receivables representing its undivided percentage interest
therein, less the Seller's Share of the Servicer's Fee, and, in the event that
neither Cadmus nor any other Seller Party or Affiliate thereof is the Master
Servicer, all reasonable and appropriate out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Master Servicer of servicing, collecting and administering the Pool Receivables
to the extent not covered by the Servicer's Fee received by it, and (ii) the
Collections of any Receivable which is not a

                                       38

<PAGE>

Pool Receivable. The Master Servicer, if other than Cadmus or any other Seller
Party or Affiliate thereof, shall, as soon as practicable upon demand, deliver
to the Seller all documents, instruments and records in its possession that
evidence or relate to Receivables of the Seller other than Pool Receivables, and
copies of documents, instruments and records in its possession that evidence or
relate to Pool Receivables.

     (f) Termination. The Master Servicer's authorization under this Agreement
shall terminate upon the Final Payout Date.

     (g) Power of Attorney. The Seller hereby grants to the Master Servicer an
irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of substitution, coupled with an
interest, to take in the name of the Seller all steps which are necessary or
advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or other
right of any kind held or transmitted by the Seller or transmitted or received
by the Purchaser (whether or not from the Seller) in connection with any
Receivable.

     (h) Rebill of Receivables. The Master Servicer may, prior to the Rebill
Termination Date, rebill one or more Pool Receivables due to one or more errors
in the original invoice or to reflect a discount given to the Obligor thereof
(each such Receivable being a "Rebilled Receivable"); provided, however, that
(i) for purposes of calculating the age of any such Rebilled Receivable, such
Rebilled Receivable shall be deemed to have been originated on the date of the
invoice of the related original receivable (each such Receivable being an
"Original Receivable"), (ii) no Pool Receivable may be rebilled after the
occurrence of the Rebill Termination Date and (c) if any such Pool Receivable is
so rebilled as a result of a discount given to the Obligor thereof, no such
rebill shall occur unless and until the related Originator has complied with the
provisions of Section 3.5 of the Sale Agreement and the Seller has complied with
the provisions of Section 3.2(a) hereof.

     Section 8.3  Servicer Advances.

          For each Settlement Period, if the Master Servicer determines that any
payment (or portion thereof) which was due and payable pursuant to a Contract in
the Receivables Pool during such Settlement Period was not received prior to the
end of such Settlement Period, the Master Servicer may make an advance in an
amount up to the amount of such delinquent payment (or portion thereof); in
addition, if on any day there are not sufficient funds on deposit in the
Collection Account to pay accrued Earned Discount or CP Costs on any Asset
Interest the Settlement Period of which ends on such day, the Master Servicer
may make an advance in the amount necessary to pay such Earned Discount or CP
Costs (in either case, any such advance, a "Servicer Advance"). Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, the Master Servicer need not make a Servicer Advance
with respect to any Contract if, the Master Servicer determines (such
determination to be conclusive and binding) in good faith that such Servicer
Advance will not ultimately be recoverable from future collections on, or the
liquidation of, the Receivables Pool. The Master Servicer will deposit any
Servicer Advances into the Collection Account on or prior to 12:00 p.m.
(Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date necessary to make any payment required to be
made under Section 3.1. All Servicer Advances shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds.

                                       39

     Section 8.4 Servicer Defaults.

          If any of the following events shall occur and be continuing, it shall
constitute a servicer default (each such event, a "Servicer Default"):

     (a) any failure by the Master Servicer to make any payment, transfer or
deposit as required by this Agreement including, without limitation, delivery of
any Settlement Report and, such failure shall remain unremedied for two (2)
Business Days after the earliest to occur of (A) written notice thereof shall
have been given by the Agent to the Master Servicer or (B) a Senior Officer of
the Master Servicer shall have actual knowledge thereof or should have had
knowledge thereof if such Senior Officer had exercised reasonable care in the
performance of his or her duties;

     (b) any failure on the part of the Master Servicer duly to observe or
perform any term, covenant or agreement of the Master Servicer set forth in this
Agreement or the Sale Agreement or to give instructions or notice to the Agent
as required by the Transaction Documents, which failure continues unremedied for
a period of five (5) days after the first to occur of (i) the date on which
written notice of such failure requiring the same to be remedied shall have been
given to the Master Servicer by the Agent and (ii) the date on which a Senior
Officer of the Master Servicer shall have actual knowledge thereof or should
have had knowledge thereof if such Senior Officer had exercised reasonable care
in the performance of his or her duties;

     (c) any representation, warranty or certification made by the Master
Servicer (or any of its officers) in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall prove to have been false or incorrect
in any material respect when made; provided that the materiality qualification
in the preceding clause shall not be applicable with respect to any
representation or warranty which itself contains a materiality qualification;

     (d) An Event of Bankruptcy shall have occurred and remain continuing with
respect to the Master Servicer;

     (e) any Change in Control with respect to the Master Servicer shall occur;

     (f) any change by the Master Servicer in the Credit and Collection Policy
which shall materially adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables
without the prior written consent of the Agent;

     (g) [Reserved];

     (h) Any default under any other agreement or instrument relating to the
purchase of receivables in an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000 of the
Master Servicer, or any other event, shall occur and shall continue after the
applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument, if
the effect of such default (i) is to permit the termination of the commitment of
any party to such agreement or instrument to purchase receivables or the right
of the Master Servicer to reinvest in receivables the principal amount paid by
any party to such agreement or instrument for its interest in receivables or
(ii) is to terminate such commitment or right;

                                       40

<PAGE>

     (i) [Reserved]; or

     (j) An Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have
occurred.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as any such Servicer
Default shall not have been remedied, the Agent, by written notice to the Master
Servicer (a "Termination Notice"), may terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer as Master Servicer under this Agreement and
appoint a successor Master Servicer satisfactory to the Agent (in the Agent's
sole discretion).

     Section 8.5 Rights of the Agent.

     (a) Notice to Obligors. At any time following the occurrence of a
Liquidation Event, the Agent may notify the Obligors of Pool Receivables, or any
of them, of the ownership of the Asset Interest by the Purchaser; provided,
however, that the Agent may not begin to so notify the Obligors of Pool
Receivables after such Liquidation Event has been waived or otherwise cured.

     (b) Notice to Lock-Box Banks. At any time following the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Unmatured Liquidation Event or Liquidation Event,
the Agent is hereby authorized to give notice to the Lock-Box Banks, as provided
in the Lock-Box Agreements, of the transfer to the Agent of dominion and control
over the lock-boxes and related accounts to which the Obligors of Pool
Receivables make payments. The Seller and the Master Servicer hereby transfer to
the Agent, effective when the Agent shall give notice to the Lock-Box Banks as
provided in the Lock-Box Agreements, the exclusive dominion and control over
such lock-boxes and accounts, and shall take any further action that the Agent
may reasonably request to effect such transfer.

     (c) Rights on Servicer Transfer Event. At any time following the
designation of a Master Servicer other than Cadmus pursuant to Section 8.1:

         (i)   The Agent may direct the Obligors of Pool Receivables, or any of
     them, to pay all amounts payable under any Pool Receivable directly to the
     Agent or its designee.

         (ii)  Any Seller Party shall, at the Agent's request and at such Seller
     Party's expense, give notice of the Purchaser's ownership and security
     interests in the Pool Receivables to each Obligor of Pool Receivables and
     direct that payments be made directly to the Agent or its designee.

         (iii) Each Seller Party shall, at the Agent's request, (A) assemble all
     of the documents, instruments and other records (including, without
     limitation, computer programs, tapes and disks) which evidence the Pool
     Receivables, and the related Contracts and Related Security, or which are
     otherwise necessary or desirable to collect such Pool Receivables, and make
     the same available to the successor Master Servicer at a place selected by
     the Agent, and (B) segregate all cash, checks and other instruments
     received by it from time to time constituting Collections of Pool
     Receivables in a manner acceptable to the Agent and promptly upon receipt,
     remit all such cash, checks and

                                       41

<PAGE>

     instruments, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer,
     to the successor Master Servicer.

         (iv) Each Seller Party and Purchaser hereby authorizes the Agent, on
     the Purchaser's behalf, and grants to the Agent an irrevocable power of
     attorney (which shall terminate on the Final Payout Date), to take any and
     all steps in such Seller Party's name and on behalf of the Seller Parties
     and the Purchaser which are necessary or desirable, in the determination of
     the Agent, to collect all amounts due under any and all Pool Receivables,
     including, without limitation, endorsing any Seller Party's name on checks
     and other instruments representing Collections and enforcing such Pool
     Receivables and the related Contracts.

     Section 8.6 Responsibilities of the Seller Parties.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

     (a) Contracts. Each Seller Party shall remain responsible for performing
all of its obligations (if any) under the Contracts related to the Pool
Receivables and under the related agreements to the same extent as if the Asset
Interest had not been sold hereunder, and the exercise by the Agent or its
designee of its rights hereunder shall not relieve any Seller Party from such
obligations.

     (b) Limitation of Liability. The Agent and Purchaser shall not have any
obligation or liability with respect to any Pool Receivables, Contracts related
thereto or any other related agreements, nor shall any of them be obligated to
perform any of the obligations of any Seller Party or any Originator thereunder.

     Section 8.7 Further Action Evidencing Purchases and Reinvestments.

     (a) Further Assurances. Each Seller Party agrees that from time to time, at
its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and
documents, and take all further action that the Agent or its designee may
reasonably request in order to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the
Purchases hereunder and the resulting Asset Interest, or to enable Purchaser or
the Agent or its designee to exercise or enforce any of their respective rights
hereunder or under any Transaction Document in respect thereof. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Seller Party will:

         (i)  upon the request of the Agent, execute and file such financing or
     continuation statements, or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and
     such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate, in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

         (ii) upon the request of the Agent after the occurrence and during the
     continuance of a Liquidation Event, mark conspicuously each Contract
     evidencing each Pool Receivable with a legend, acceptable to the Agent,
     evidencing that the Asset Interest has been sold in accordance with this
     Agreement; and

                                       42

Party irrevocably authorizes the Agent at any time and from time to time in the
sole discretion of the Agent, and appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to
act on behalf of such Seller Party (A) to authorize on behalf of the Seller as
debtor and to file financing statements describing the Collateral necessary or
desirable in the Agent's sole discretion to perfect and to maintain the
perfection and priority of the interest of the Agent, for the benefit of the
Secured Parties, in the Collateral and (B) to file a carbon, photographic or
other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement describing the
Collateral with respect to the Collateral as a financing statement in such
offices as the Agent or in its sole discretion deems necessary or desirable to
perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the Agent's security
interest in the Collateral, for the benefit of the Secured Parties. This
appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) (A) Each of the
Seller Parties hereby authorizes the Agent to file financing statements
describing the Collateral and other filing or recording documents with respect
to the Collateral (including any amendments thereto, or continuation or
termination statements thereof), without the signature or other authorization of
the Seller Party, in such form and in such offices as the Agent reasonably
determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the perfection of the security
interest of the Agent hereunder, (B) each of the Seller Parties acknowledges and
agrees that it is not authorized to, and will not, file financing statements or
other filing or recording documents with respect to the Collateral (including
any amendments thereto, or continuation or termination statements thereof),
without the express prior written approval by the Agent, consenting to the form
and substance of such filing or recording document, and (C) each of the Seller
Parties approves, authorizes and ratifies any filings or recordings describing
the Collateral made by or on behalf of the Agent in connection with the
perfection of the security interests in favor of the Seller or the Agent; and
(iii) The reasonable expenses of the Agent or its designee incurred in
connection with this Section 8.7 shall be payable by the Seller Parties as
provided in Section 14.5.

subsection (a), the Seller will, not earlier than six (6) months and not later
than three (3) months prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of filing of
the financing statements referred to in Section 5.1(a)(v) or any other financing
statement filed pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with any Purchase
hereunder, if the Final Payout Date shall not have occurred:

         (i)   if necessary, execute and deliver and file or cause to be filed
     an appropriate continuation statement with respect to such financing
     statement; and

         (ii)  deliver or cause to be delivered to the Agent an opinion of the
     counsel for the Seller Parties, in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to the Agent, confirming and updating the opinion delivered
     pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(viii) to the effect that the Asset Interest
     hereunder continues to be a valid and perfected ownership or security
     interest, subject to no other Liens of record except as provided herein or
     otherwise permitted hereunder.

     Section 8.8 Application of Collections.

          Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to
any Originator or the Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such
Obligor or required by the underlying Contract or law, be applied, first, as a
Collection of any Pool Receivable or Receivables then outstanding of such
Obligor in the order of the age of such Pool Receivables, starting with the

     Section 9.1 Grant of Security Interest.

exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the

     Section 11.2 Agent's Reliance, Etc.

          The Agent and its directors, officers, agents or employees shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them in good
faith under or in connection with the Transaction Documents (including, without
limitation, the servicing, administering or collecting of Pool Receivables as
Master Servicer pursuant to Section 8.1), except for its or their own breach of
the terms of the applicable terms of the Transaction Documents or its or their
own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel

taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts; (b) makes no warranty or representation to the Purchaser

party or parties.

     Section 11.3 Wachovia and Affiliates.

          Wachovia and any of its Affiliates may generally engage in any kind of
business with any Seller Party or any obligor, any of their respective
Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities of any
Seller Party or any Obligor or any of their respective Affiliates, all as if
Wachovia was not the Agent, and without any duty to account therefor to the
Purchaser or any other holder of an interest in Pool Receivables, but in any
event subject to Section 14.7.

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                     ASSIGNMENT OF THE PURCHASER'S INTEREST

     Section 12.1 Restrictions on Assignments.

     (a) Except as provided in Section 8.1(a), no Seller Party may assign its
rights, or delegate its duties hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Agent. The Purchaser may not assign its rights
hereunder (although it may delegate its duties hereunder as expressly indicated
herein) or the Asset Interest (or any portion thereof) to any Person without

                                       47

<PAGE>

the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that

          (i)   the Purchaser may assign all of its rights and interests in the
     Transaction Documents, together with all its interest in the Asset
     Interest, to any Liquidity Bank, Wachovia, or any Affiliate thereof, or to
     any "bankruptcy remote" special purpose entity, the business of which is
     administered by Wachovia or any Affiliate thereof (which assignee shall
     then be subject to this Article XII);

          (ii)  the Purchaser may assign and grant a security interest in all of
     its rights in the Transaction Documents, together with all of its rights
     and interest in the Asset Interest, to the Collateral Agent, to secure the
     Purchaser's obligations under or in connection with the Commercial Paper
     Notes, the Liquidity Agreement, and certain other obligations of the
     Purchaser incurred in connection with the funding of the Purchases and
     Reinvestments hereunder, which assignment and grant of a security interest
     (and any subsequent assignment by the Collateral Agent) shall not be
     considered an "assignment" for purposes of Section 12.1(b) or, prior to the
     enforcement of such security interest, for purposes of any other provision
     of this Agreement (other than Section 12.3); and

          (iii) the Master Servicer may delegate its duties provided herein to
     any Originator who agrees to act as a Servicer hereunder and assumes in
     writing the obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder with respect to
     that portion of the Pool Receivables originated by such Originator.
     Notwithstanding any delegation pursuant to this clause (iii), the Master
     Servicer shall remain responsible for all of its obligations hereunder.

     (b) The Seller agrees to advise the Agent within five Business Days after
notice to the Seller of any proposed assignment by the Purchaser of the Asset
Interest (or any portion thereof), not otherwise permitted under subsection (a),
of the Seller's consent or non-consent to such assignment, and if it does not
consent, the reasons therefor. If the Seller does not consent to such
assignment, the Purchaser may immediately or at any time thereafter assign such
Asset Interest (or portion thereof) to any Person or Persons permitted under
clause (i) of Section 12.1(a).

     Section 12.2 Rights of Assignee.

          Upon the assignment by the Purchaser in accordance with this Article
XII, the assignee receiving such assignment shall have all of the rights of the
Purchaser with respect to the Transaction Documents and the Asset Interest (or
such portion thereof as has been assigned).

     Section 12.3 Terms and Evidence of Assignment.

          Any assignment of the Asset Interest (or any portion thereof) to any
Person which is otherwise permitted under this Article XII shall be upon such
terms and conditions as the Purchaser and the assignee may mutually agree, and
may be evidenced by such instrument(s) or document(s) as may be satisfactory to
the Purchaser, the Agent and the assignee.

     Section 12.4 Rights of Collateral Agent.

                                       48

<PAGE>

          The Seller hereby agrees that, upon notice to the Seller, the
Collateral Agent or the Liquidity Banks may exercise all the rights of the Agent
and Purchaser hereunder, with respect to the Asset Interest (or any portions
thereof), and Collections with respect thereto, which are owned by the
Purchaser, and all other rights and interests of the Purchaser in, to or under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. Without limiting the
foregoing, upon such notice or at any time thereafter (but subject to any
conditions applicable to the exercise of such rights by the Agent), the
Collateral Agent or the Liquidity Banks may request the Master Servicer to
segregate the Purchaser's allocable share of Collections from the Seller's
allocable share, may give a Successor Notice pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 8.1(b), may give or require the Agent to give notice to the Lock-Box
Banks as referred to in Section 8.3(b) and may direct the Obligors of Pool
Receivables to make payments in respect thereof directly to an account
designated by them, in each case, to the same extent as the Agent might have
done.

                                  ARTICLE XIII.
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 13.1 Indemnities by the Seller.

     (a) General Indemnity. Without limiting any other rights which any such
Person may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify each of Wachovia, both individually and as the Agent, the Purchaser,
the Liquidity Banks, the Liquidity Agent, each of their respective Affiliates,
and all successors, transferees, participants and assigns and all officers,
directors, shareholders, controlling persons, employees and agents of any of the
foregoing (each an "Indemnified Party"), forthwith on demand, from and against
any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities and related costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of the foregoing
being collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or relating to the Transaction Documents
or the ownership or funding of the Asset Interest or in respect of any
Receivable or any Contract, excluding, however, (a) Indemnified Amounts to the
extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party or
(b) recourse (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) for
nonpayment due to a credit problem of the applicable Obligor. Without limiting
the foregoing (but subject to the specified exclusions), the Seller shall
indemnify each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts arising out of or
relating to:

          (i)  the transfer by any Seller Party of any interest in any
     Receivable other than the transfer of Receivables and related property by
     the Originators to the Seller pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the transfer
     of the Asset Interest to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the
     grant of a security interest to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1;

          (ii) any representation or warranty made by any Seller Party (or any
     of its officers) under or in connection with any Transaction Document, any
     Settlement Report or any other information or report delivered by or on
     behalf of any Seller Party pursuant hereto, which shall have been false,
     incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed made or
     delivered, as the case may be;

                                       49

<PAGE>

          (iii)  the failure by any Seller Party to comply with any applicable
     law, rule or regulation with respect to any Pool Receivable or the related
     Contract, or the nonconformity of any Pool Receivable or the related
     Contract with any such applicable law, rule or regulation;

          (iv)   the failure to vest and maintain vested in the Purchaser an
     undivided percentage ownership interest, to the extent of the Asset
     Interest, in the Receivables in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables
     Pool, free and clear of any Lien, other than a Lien arising solely as a
     result of an act of the Purchaser or the Agent, whether existing at the
     time of any Purchase or Reinvestment of such Asset Interest or at any time
     thereafter;

          (v)    the failure of any Seller Party to file, or any delay in
     filing, financing statements or other similar instruments or documents
     under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with
     respect to any Receivables in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables
     Pool, whether at the time of any Purchase or Reinvestment or at any time
     thereafter;

          (vi)   any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than nonpayment
     due to any credit problem of the applicable Obligor) of the Obligor to the
     payment of any Receivable in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables Pool
     (including, without limitation, a defense based on such Receivables or the
     related Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
     Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other
     claim resulting from the sale of the merchandise or services related to
     such Receivable or the furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or
     services;

          (vii)  any matter described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 3.2(a);

          (viii) any failure of any Seller Party, as Master Servicer or
     otherwise, to perform its duties or obligations in accordance with the
     provisions of Article III or Article VIII;

          (ix)   any products liability claim arising out of or in connection
     with merchandise or services that are the subject of any Pool Receivable;

          (x)    any claim of breach by any Seller Party of any related Contract
     with respect to any Pool Receivable; or

          (xi)   any tax or governmental fee or charge (but not including taxes
     upon or measured by net income), all interest and penalties thereon or with
     respect thereto, and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the
     reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same,
     which may arise by reason of the purchase or ownership of the Asset
     Interest, or any other interest in the Pool Receivables or in any goods
     which secure any such Pool Receivables.

     (b) Contest of Tax Claim; After-Tax Basis. If any Indemnified Party shall
have notice of any attempt to impose or collect any tax or governmental fee or
charge for which indemnification will be sought from any Seller Party under
Section 13.1(a)(xi), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt and timely notice
of such attempt to the Seller and the Seller shall have

                                       50

<PAGE>

the right, at its expense, to participate in any proceedings resisting or
objecting to the imposition or collection of any such tax, governmental fee or
charge. Indemnification hereunder shall be in an amount necessary to make the
Indemnified Party whole after taking into account any tax consequences to the
Indemnified Party of the payment of any of the aforesaid taxes (including any
deduction) and the receipt of the indemnity provided hereunder or of any refund
of any such tax previously indemnified hereunder, including the effect of such
tax, deduction or refund on the amount of tax measured by net income or profits
which is or was payable by the Indemnified Party.

     (c) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided above in
this Section 13.1 (and subject to the exceptions set forth therein) is
unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold an Indemnified
Party harmless, then the Seller shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
received by such Indemnified Party on the one hand and the Seller on the other
hand but also the relative fault of such Indemnified Party as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

     Section 13.2 Indemnities by Master Servicer.

          Without limiting any other rights which any Indemnified Party may have
hereunder or under applicable law, the Master Servicer hereby agrees to
indemnify each of the Indemnified Parties forthwith on demand, from and against
any and all Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them
arising out of or relating to the Master Servicer's performance of, or failure
to perform, any of its obligations under or in connection with any Transaction
Document, or any representation or warranty made by Master Servicer (or any of
its officers) under or in connection with any Transaction Document, any
Settlement Report or any other information or report delivered by or on behalf
of Master Servicer, which shall have been false, incorrect or misleading in any
material respect when made or deemed made or delivered, as the case may be, or
the failure of the Master Servicer to comply with any applicable law, rule or
regulation with respect to any Pool Receivable or the related Contract.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be
awarded any Indemnified Amounts (a) to the extent determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party or (b) recourse for nonpayment
due to any credit problem of the applicable Obligor.

          If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this Section
13.2 (and subject to the exceptions set forth therein) is unavailable to an
Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then
the Master Servicer shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received
by such Indemnified Party on the one hand and the Master Servicer on the other
hand but also the relative fault of such Indemnified Party as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

     Section 14.1 Amendments, Etc.

          No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent
to any departure by any Seller Party therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by (a) each Seller Party, the
Agent and the Purchaser (with respect to an amendment), or (b) the Agent and the
Purchaser (with respect to a waiver or consent by them) or any Seller Party
(with respect to a waiver or consent by it), as the case may be, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given. The parties acknowledge that, before entering
into such an amendment or granting such a waiver or consent, the Purchaser may
also be required to obtain the approval of some or all of the Liquidity Banks or
to obtain confirmation from certain rating agencies that such amendment, waiver
or consent will not result in a withdrawal or reduction of the ratings of the
Commercial Paper Notes.

     Section 14.2 Notices, Etc.

          All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall,
unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing (including facsimile
communication) and shall be personally delivered or sent by express mail or
courier or by certified mail, postage prepaid, or by facsimile, to the intended
party at the address or facsimile number of such party set forth on Schedule
14.2 or at such other address or facsimile number as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the other parties hereto. All such notices and
communications shall be effective, (a) if personally delivered or sent by
express mail or courier or if sent by certified mail, when received, and (b) if
transmitted by facsimile, when sent, receipt confirmed by telephone or

     Section 14.3 No Waiver; Remedies.

          No failure on the part of the Agent, any Affected Party, any
Indemnified Party, the Purchaser or any other holder of the Asset Interest (or
any portion thereof) to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Wachovia, individually, and as Agent, the Collateral Agent,
and each Liquidity Bank is hereby authorized by the Seller at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by Wachovia, the
Collateral Agent and such Liquidity Bank to or for the credit or the account of
the Seller, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, to the Agent, any
Affected Party, any Indemnified Party or Purchaser, or their respective
successors and assigns.

Seller Party, the Agent, the Purchaser and their respective successors and
assigns, and the provisions of Section 4.2 and Article XIII shall inure to the
benefit of the Affected Parties and the Indemnified Parties, respectively, and
their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, nothing in the
foregoing shall be deemed to authorize any assignment not permitted by Section
12.1. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of
the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain in full force
and effect until the Final Payout Date. The rights and remedies with respect to
any breach of any representation and warranty made by the Seller pursuant to
Article VI and the indemnification and payment provisions of Article XIII and
Sections 4.2, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.8 and 14.15 shall be continuing and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

          In addition to their obligations under Article XIII, the Seller
Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on demand:

(the information referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, whether furnished by
any Seller Party, any Originator or any attorney for or other representative
thereof (each a "Seller Information Provider"), is collectively referred to as
the "Seller Information"); provided, however, "Seller Information" shall not
include any information which is or becomes generally available to the general
public or to such party on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than any
Seller Information Provider, or which was known to such party on a
nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by any Seller Information
Provider.

     Section 14.7 and has agreed, verbally or otherwise, to be bound by the
     provisions of this Section 14.7;

                                       54

<PAGE>

          (ii)  to any Liquidity Bank, any actual or potential assignees of, or
     participants in, any rights or obligations of the Purchaser, any Liquidity
     Bank or the Agent under or in connection with this Agreement who has agreed
     to be bound by the provisions of this Section 14.7;

          (iii) to any rating agency that maintains a rating for the Purchaser's
     commercial paper or is considering the issuance of such a rating, for the
     purposes of reviewing the credit of the Purchaser in connection with such
     rating;

          (iv)  to any other party to this Agreement (and any independent
     attorneys, consultants and auditors of such party), for the purposes
     contemplated hereby,

          (v)   as may be required by any municipal, state, federal or other
     regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such party, in
     order to comply with any law, order, regulation, regulatory request or
     ruling applicable to such party,

          (vi)  subject to subsection (c), in the event such party is legally
     compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or copies,
     subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose such
     Seller Information, or

          (vii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any
     other Transaction Document.

In addition, the Purchaser and the Agent may disclose on a "no name" basis to
any actual or potential investor in Purchaser's Commercial Paper Notes
information regarding the nature of this Agreement, the basic terms hereof
(including without limitation the amount and nature of the Purchaser's
commitment and Invested Amount with respect to the Asset Interest and any other
credit enhancement provided by any Seller Party hereunder), the nature, amount
and status of the Pool Receivables, and the current and/or historical ratios of
losses to liquidations and/or outstanding with respect to the Receivables Pool.

     (c)  Legal Compulsion. In the event that any party hereto (other than any
Seller Party) or any of its representatives is requested or becomes legally
compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Seller
Information, such party will (or will cause its representative to):

          (i)   provide Cadmus with prompt written notice so that (A) Cadmus may
     seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or (B) Cadmus may, if
     it so chooses, agree that such party (or its representatives) may disclose
     such Seller Information pursuant to such request or legal compulsion; and

          (ii)  unless Cadmus agrees that such Seller Information may be
     disclosed, make a timely objection to the request or compulsion to provide
     such Seller Information on the basis that such Seller Information is
     confidential and subject to the agreements contained in this Section 14.7.

                                       55

<PAGE>

In the event such protective order or remedy is not obtained, or Cadmus agrees
that such Seller Information may be disclosed, such party will furnish only that
portion of the Seller Information which (in such party's good faith judgment) is
legally required to be furnished and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Seller
Information.

     (d)  This Section 14.7 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

     Section 14.8  Confidentiality of Program Information.

     (a)  Confidential Information. Each party hereto acknowledges that
Wachovia, individually and in its capacity as Agent, regards the structure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be proprietary, and each such
party agrees that:

          (i)   it will not disclose without the prior consent of Wachovia
     (other than to the directors, employees, auditors, counsel or affiliates
     (collectively, "representatives") of such party, each of whom shall be
     informed by such party of the confidential nature of the Program
     Information (as defined below) and of the terms of this Section 14.8), (A)
     any information regarding the pricing in, or copies of, the Fee Letter, the
     Mandate Letter, the Due Diligence Report and the other confidential or
     proprietary information with respect to the Agent and the Purchaser and
     their respective businesses obtained in connection with the structuring,
     negotiating and execution of the transactions contemplated hereby or
     thereby, (B) any information regarding the organization, business or
     operations of the Purchaser generally or the services performed by Wachovia
     as the Agent for the Purchaser, or (C) any information which is furnished
     by Wachovia to such party and which is designated by Wachovia to such party
     in writing or otherwise as confidential or not otherwise available to the
     general public (the information referred to in clauses (A), (B) and (C) is
     collectively referred to as the "Program Information"); provided, however,
     that such party may disclose any such Program Information (I) to any other
     party to this Agreement (and any independent attorneys, consultants and
     auditors of any such party) for the purposes contemplated hereby, (II) as
     may be required by any municipal, state, federal or other regulatory body
     having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such party, including, without
     limitation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, (III) in order to
     comply with any law, order, regulation, regulatory request or ruling
     applicable to such party, (IV) subject to subsection (c), in the event such
     party is legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or
     copies, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
     disclose any such Program Information, or (V) in financial statements as
     required by GAAP;

          (ii)  it will use the Program Information solely for the purposes of
     evaluating, administering and enforcing the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement and making any necessary business judgments with respect
     thereto; and

          (iii) it will, upon demand, return (and cause each of its
     representatives to return) to Wachovia, all documents or other written
     material received from Wachovia in

                                       56

<PAGE>

     connection with (a)(i)(B) or (C) above and all copies thereof made by such
     party which contain the Program Information.

     (b)  Availability of Confidential Information. This Section 14.8 shall be
inoperative as to such portions of the Program Information which are or become
generally available to the public or such party on a nonconfidential basis from
a source other than Wachovia or were known to such party on a nonconfidential
basis prior to its disclosure by Wachovia.

     (c)  Legal Compulsion to Disclose. In the event that any party or anyone to
whom such party or its representatives transmits the Program Information is
requested or becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any of the Program Information, such party will:

          (i)   provide Wachovia with prompt written notice so that Wachovia may
     seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or, if it so
     chooses, agree that such party may disclose such Program Information
     pursuant to such request or legal compulsion; and

          (ii)  unless Wachovia agrees that such Program Information may be
     disclosed, make a timely objection to the request or confirmation to
     provide such Program Information on the basis that such Program Information
     is confidential and subject to the agreements contained in this Section
     14.8.

In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or
Wachovia agrees that such Program Information may be disclosed, such party will
furnish only that portion of the Program Information which (in such party's good
faith judgment) is legally required to be furnished and will exercise reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded the Program Information. In the event any Seller Party is required to
file a copy of this Agreement with the SEC or any other governmental authority,
it will (A) provide Wachovia with prompt written notice of such requirement and
(B) exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that such
governmental authority will give confidential treatment to this Agreement;
provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to the ordinary filing
of material agreements with the SEC.

     (d)  Survival. This Section 14.8 shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

     Section 14.9  Captions and Cross References.

                     Description Of Material Adverse Changes

                  Effective July 1, 2002, Cadmus adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
As a result, Cadmus recorded an impairment charge of $56.3 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the
quarter ended September 30, 2002. Additional information and disclosures are
contained in Cadmus' Form 8-K filed on October 24, 2002 and Form 10-Q filed on
November 13, 2002, both of which have been previously provided to the Agent.

On November 4, 2002, Cadmus announced several actions to rationalize capacity
and improve utilization in its special-interest magazine operation, including
the closure of the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania facility. Cadmus plans to
record an after-tax charge to net income in the range of $5 million to $8
million, predominantly in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2003. Additional
information and disclosures are contained in Cadmus' Form 8-K filed on November
5, 2002 and Form 10-Q filed on November 13, 2002, both of which have been
previously provided to the Agent.
