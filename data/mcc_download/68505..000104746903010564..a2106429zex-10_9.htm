SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of the Motorola Compensation/Acquisition Plan of 2000 (the "Plan") are (i)&nbsp;to
make awards to employees of Motorola,&nbsp;Inc. ("Motorola") and it subsidiaries (excluding directors of Motorola and Officers, as defined below) in connection with Motorola's recruiting and
retention efforts and (ii)&nbsp;to furnish maximum incentive to those persons to improve operations and increase profits and to strengthen the mutuality of interest between those persons and
Motorola's stockholders by providing them stock options and other incentives. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan will be administered by a Committee (the "Committee") of the Motorola Board of
Directors consisting of two or more directors as the Board may designate from time to time, each of whom shall qualify as a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning set forth in
Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or any successor legislation. The Committee shall have the authority to determine
the number of shares of Motorola common stock to be reserved for issuance under the Plan; to construe and interpret the Plan and any benefits granted thereunder; to establish and amend rules for Plan
administration; to change the terms and conditions of options and other benefits at or after grant; and to make all other determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of
the Plan. The determinations of the Committee shall be made in accordance with their judgment as to the best interests of Motorola and its stockholders and in accordance with the purposes of the Plan.
A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and all determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members. Any determination of the Committee under the
Plan may be made without notice or meeting of the Committee, in writing signed by all the Committee members. The Committee may delegate the administration of the Plan, in whole or in part, on such
terms and conditions as it may impose, to such other person or persons as it may determine in its discretion pursuant to section&nbsp;157(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. </FONT></P>

of Motorola and officers within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;16a-1 of the Exchange Act ("Officers"). Any corporation or other entity in which a 50% or greater interest is at the time
directly or indirectly owned by Motorola shall be a subsidiary for purposes of the Plan. Designation of a participant in any year shall not require the Committee to designate that person to receive a
benefit in any other year or to receive the same type or amount of benefit as granted to the participant in any other year or as granted to any other participant in any year. The Committee shall
consider all factors that it deems relevant in selecting participants and in determining the type and amount of their respective benefits. </FONT></P>

numbers of shares of Motorola common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan. If there is a lapse, expiration, termination or cancellation of any stock option issued under the Plan prior to the
issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of common stock are issued under the Plan and thereafter are reacquired by Motorola, the shares subject to those options and the reacquired shares shall be
added to the shares available for benefits under </FONT></P>

retained by Motorola pursuant to a participant's tax withholding election, and any shares covered by a benefit which is settled in cash shall be added to the shares available for benefits under the
Plan. All shares issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or issued shares reacquired by Motorola. The shares reserved for issuance and the limitations set forth above shall
be subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;14 hereof. All of the available shares may, but need not, be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Section&nbsp;4 the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan for benefits other than Stock Options, shall not exceed 10% of the shares authorized for
issuance and reserved by the Committee as described in the Section&nbsp;4 (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;14 hereof). </FONT></P>

determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Motorola's common stock on the date the option is granted. Each option shall expire at such time as the
Committee shall determine at the time of grant. Options shall be exercisable at such time and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine; provided, however, that no option
shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of its grant. The option price, upon exercise of any option, shall be payable to Motorola in full by (a)&nbsp;cash payment or its equivalent,
(b)&nbsp;tendering previously acquired shares (held for at least six months) having a fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the option price, (c)&nbsp;certification of ownership of
such previously-acquired shares, (d)&nbsp;delivery of a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to Motorola the amount of sale
proceeds from the option shares or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes due to Motorola, and (e)&nbsp;such other methods of payment as the Committee, at its discretion,
deems appropriate. In no event shall the Committee cancel any outstanding Stock Option for the purpose of reissuing the option to the participant at a lower exercise price or reduce the option price
of an outstanding option. </FONT></P>

SAR shall be equal to the option price of the related option. The grant price of a freestanding SAR shall be equal to the fair market value of Motorola's common stock on the date of its grant. An SAR
may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee in its sole discretion determines; provided, however, that the term shall not exceed the option term in the case of a
tandem SAR or ten years in the case of a free standing SAR. Upon exercise of an SAR, the participant shall be entitled to receive payment from Motorola in cash or stock, at the discretion of the
