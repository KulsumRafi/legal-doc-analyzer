                  WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the
Reservoir Lenders, Scholar and Katzman are parties to a Loan Agreement dated as
of June 25, 2001 (as modified and supplemented and in effect on the date hereof

therein. References in the Loan Agreement (including references to the Loan
Agreement as amended hereby) to "this Agreement" (and indirect references such

evidenced by two promissory notes in or substantially in the form required under
the Loan Agreement. The borrowings contemplated by this Amendment shall not
constitute additional warranties or representations regarding the Obligors or
