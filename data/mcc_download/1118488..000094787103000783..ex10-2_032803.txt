                [TRANCHE A] [TRANCHE B] TERM LOAN PROMISSORY NOTE



$[        ]                                            New York, New York
                                                              [__________], 2002

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned Iroquois Gas Transmission System,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Borrower"), hereby unconditionally
promises to pay to the order of [LENDER] (the "Lender") at the office of
JPMorgan Chase Bank (together with its successors in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent"), located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017,
in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available
funds, in accordance with Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter
defined), of ___________________ Dollars ($[      ]) or, if less, the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all [Tranche A] [Tranche B] Term Loans made by the
Lender to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1(b) of that certain Credit
Agreement dated as of May 30, 2000, among the Borrower, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, Bank of Montreal, as Syndication Agent and Fleet National
Bank, as Documentation Agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). All capitalized terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the
Credit Agreement.

         The Borrower further agrees to pay interest in like money at such
office on the unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time outstanding at
the rates and on the dates specified in Section 2.13 of the Credit Agreement.

         The holder of this promissory note is authorized to endorse on the
schedules annexed hereto and made a part hereof or on a continuation thereof
that shall be attached hereto and made hereof, the date, Type and amount of each
[Tranche A] [Tranche B] Term Loan made pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the
date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereof, each
continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a portion thereof to another
Type and, in the case of Eurodollar [Tranche A] [Tranche B] Term Loans, the
length of each Interest Period with respect thereto. Each such endorsement shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information endorsed,
provided that the failure to make any such endorsement or any error of such
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of any
[Tranche A] [Tranche B] Term Loan.

         This promissory note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is
entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement which, among other things,
contain provisions for the Lender making the Loans, the indebtedness of the
Borrower resulting therefrom being evidenced by this promissory note, the
acceleration of the maturity of principal upon occurrence of Events of


                                     A-1-1

Default and is subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement for prepayments
in whole or in part on accounts of the principal balance hereof prior to the
maturity hereof.

         Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default
specified in the Credit Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this
promissory note shall become, or may be declared to be, immediately due and
payable, all as provided in the Credit Agreement.

         Except as expressly provided in Section 7 of the Credit Agreement,
Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest and any
other notice or formality with respect to this promissory note.

         In no contingency or event whatsoever shall interest be charged
hereunder, however such interest may be characterized or computed if it would
exceed the highest interest permissible under any law which a court of competent
jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. In event
that such a court determine that the Lender has received interest hereunder in
excess of the highest rate applicable hereto, any such excess interest collected
by the Lender shall be deemed to have been a repayment of principal and shall be
so applied.

         None of the Partners or the Partner Parents shall be personally liable
for any obligation of the Borrower under this promissory note or for the
performance of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder. The exclusive recourse
of the Lender for the satisfaction of payment under this promissory note shall
be against the Borrower and its assets (and not against any assets or property
of the Partners or the Partner Parents). In the event that any default occurs in
connection with the obligations of the Borrower under this promissory note, no
action shall be brought against the Partners or the Partner Parents if such
action is predicated solely on such Person's direct or indirect ownership in the
Borrower. In the event of foreclosure or other sale or disposition of
properties, no judgment for any deficiency upon the obligations of the Borrower
under this promissory note shall be obtainable by the Lender against the
Partners or the Partner Parents.

         THIS PROMISSORY NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         Wherever possible, each provision of this promissory note shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this promissory note shall be prohibited or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions
of this promissory note.
