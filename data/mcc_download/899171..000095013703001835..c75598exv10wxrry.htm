Participant is entitled to severance payments and benefits under the Company&#146;s
Transitional Compensation Plan or a Transitional Compensation Agreement with
the Company, such Participant shall receive payments and benefits under the
Transitional Compensation Plan or a Transitional Compensation Agreement, as the
case may be, and no payments shall be made or benefits provided hereunder to
such Participant.

similar benefits, as applicable, and by the amount of any severance pay, notice
pay or other similar benefits received during any Notice Period.

person or other person incapable of giving a receipt therefor shall be deemed
paid when paid to such person&#146;s guardian or to the party providing or
reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment
shall fully discharge the Company, the Plan Administrator and all other parties
with respect thereto. If a Participant shall die while any amounts would be
payable to the Participant under this Plan had the Participant continued to
live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Plan to such person or persons appointed in
writing by the Participant to receive such amounts or, if no person is so
appointed, to the estate of the Participant. The Company may, in its
discretion, pay any such amounts in a single lump-sum payment.
