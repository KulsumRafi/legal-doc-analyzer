     1.3 Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters

     Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:

     (a) Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement, the date that is the
starting reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the
last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end
on the next succeeding Business Day.

     (b) Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement or any Collateral
Agreement to gender shall include all genders, and words imparting the singular
number only shall include the plural and vice versa.

     (c) Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement or any Collateral Agreement into Articles, Sections and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only
and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this
Agreement. All references in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement to any
"Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement or any Collateral
Agreement, as applicable, unless otherwise specified.

     (d) Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

     (e) Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general
statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

     (f) Reasonable Commercial Efforts. Reasonable commercial efforts means that
the obligated party is required to make a diligent, reasonable and good faith
effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such obligation, however, does
not require an expenditure of material funds or the incurrence of a material
liability, in each case inconsistent with past practice, on the part of the
obligated party, nor does it require that the obligated party act in a manner
that would be contrary to normal commercial practices in order to accomplish the
objective. The fact that the objective is or is not actually accomplished is no
indication that the obligated party did or did not in fact utilize its
reasonable commercial efforts in attempting to accomplish the objective.

     (g) Schedules and Exhibits. The Schedules and Exhibits attached to this
Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed
by either party on any one Schedule with respect to any representation, warranty
or covenant of such party shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of all other
representations, warranties or covenants of such party to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent from such disclosure that it also relates to such other
representations, warranties or covenants.

     (h) Knowledge. The phrases "knowledge", "Seller's knowledge", "to the
knowledge of Seller" and similar phrases concerning a particular subject, area
or aspect of Seller, the Subsidiaries or the CATV Business shall mean the
knowledge of each of the officers of Seller or any Subsidiary and of those CATV
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 1.3(h) whose duties
would, in the normal course of affairs, result in such employees having
knowledge concerning such subject, area or aspect.

or appropriate to assure fully to Buyer and its Affiliates and each of their
respective successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles,
interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to
Buyer or a Buyer Designee under this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements and
to assure fully to Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective
successors and assigns, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, and to
otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including (i) transferring to Buyer or a Buyer Designee any asset or liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability,
respectively, which was not transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee at the

contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability,
respectively, which asset or liability was transferred to Buyer or a Buyer
Designee at the Closing).

     (c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign any
Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Lease, License, Governmental Permit,
certificate, approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by
Law is nonassignable without the consent of a Third Party or a Governmental Body
or is cancelable by a Third Party in the event of an assignment ("Nonassignable
Assets") unless and until such consent shall have been obtained. Seller and
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with
Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, in endeavoring to obtain such consents
promptly. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event consents to
the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which (i) Buyer or a Buyer Designee would obtain the benefits
and assume the obligations under such Nonassignable Assets in accordance with
this Agreement including by sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to
Buyer or a Buyer Designee, or (ii) such Nonassignable Assets would be held, as
of and from the Closing Date, by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary in trust
for Buyer or a Buyer Designee and the covenants and obligations thereunder would
be performed by Buyer or a Buyer Designee in Seller's or such Subsidiary's name
and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder would be for Buyer's or the
applicable Buyer Designee's account. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, also take or cause to be taken at Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's
expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may reasonably request so
as to provide Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee with the benefits of the
Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary shall promptly pay over to Buyer the applicable Buyer
Designee all money or other consideration received by it in respect to all
Nonassignable Assets.

request (subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any
applicable attorney-client privilege), reasonable access for inspection and
copying of all Business Records, Governmental Permits, Licenses, Contracts and
any other information existing as of the Closing Date and relating to the CATV
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Transferred
Employees and shall make their respective personnel reasonably available for
interviews, depositions and testimony in any legal matter concerning
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the operations or activities
relating to the CATV Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or
the Transferred Employees and as otherwise may be necessary or desirable to
enable the party requesting such assistance to: (i) comply with any reporting,

(7) years after the Closing Date.

     5.2 [Reserved]

     5.3 Tax Reporting and Allocation of Consideration

     (a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller will be
responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding, payment and reporting
duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Seller or a
Subsidiary to any Business Employee in connection with the operation or conduct

     5.4 Business Employees

     (a) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall make offers of employment to those
Business Employees listed on Schedule 1.1(a) (including those absent due to
vacation, holiday, illness, leave of absence or short-term disability, but
excluding any Business Employees on long-term disability) that it chooses to
offer employment. Seller and any applicable Subsidiary shall cooperate and
assist in facilitating the Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's offers and will not
take any action, or cause any of the Subsidiaries to take any action, which
would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with Buyer's or a Buyer
Designee's effort to hire any Business Employees. Business Employees who accept
Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's offer of employment, as of the effective date of
their employment with Buyer, are referred to as "Transferred Employees."
Employment with Buyer or a Buyer Designee of Transferred Employees shall be
effective as of the day following the close of business on the Closing Date,
except that the employment of individuals receiving short-term disability
benefits or on approved leave of absence on the Closing Date will become
effective as of the date they present themselves for work with the Buyer or a
Buyer Designee. Business Employees who do not accept Buyers offer, together with
any other employees of Seller or any Subsidiary shall be referred to as
"Non-Transferred Employees."

     (b) Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to Transferred Employees, until at least December 31, 2003, the same salary
offered by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing
Date as set forth on Schedule 1.1(a ). Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to Transferred Employees employee benefits that,
in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.4(b) shall restrict Buyer from
subsequently terminating the at-will employment of any individual Transferred
Employee. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4, no assets of any
Benefit Plan shall be transferred to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer. Each
employee benefit plan, program, policy and arrangement of Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer, including any Pension Plans, Welfare Plans, vacation plans and
severance plans, shall recognize to the extent permitted by Buyer's or a Buyer
Designee's plans (i) for purposes of satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and
out-of-pocket maximums during the coverage period that includes the Closing
Date, any payment made by any Transferred Employee towards deductibles, co-pays
and out-of-pocket maximums in any health or other insurance plan of Seller or a
Subsidiary and (ii) for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and for any schedule of benefits based on service (other than for
benefit accruals under Buyer's or Buyer Designees' pension plans), all service
with Seller or a Subsidiary, including service with predecessor employers that
was recognized by Seller or a Subsidiary and any prior unbridged service with
Seller or a Subsidiary, provided that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer or
the applicable Buyer Designee will continue to provide (x) relocation assistance
to those Transferred Employees receiving it as of the Closing Date and (y)
tuition assistance to those Transferred Employees who are receiving such
benefits as of the Closing Date for the current academic session, in each case
as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b). Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee will
honor the terms

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

and conditions of Seller's international assignee program, including
repatriation upon completion of assignment, completion bonuses, Tax equalization
and Tax return preparation, with respect to Transferred Employees who are on
international assignment as of the Closing Date, in each case as set forth on
Schedule 5.4(b), except that these costs shall be allocated between the parties
based on the portion of the international assignment occurring before or on the
Closing Date (which shall be Seller's or the applicable Subsidiary's obligation)
and after the Closing Date (which shall be Buyer's or the applicable Buyer
Designee's obligation).

     (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of a Transferred Employee's
employment with Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not entitle such Transferred Employee to any benefits under
Seller's severance program. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, and provided that the affected Transferred Employee executes a
general and special release in a form acceptable to Buyer, Buyer shall provide
severance benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits listed on Schedule
5.4(c) to Transferred Employees whose employment is terminated involuntarily by
Buyer on or before December 31, 2003 other than terminations in circumstances
that would not require payments of severance benefits under Seller's severance
plan.

     (d) Buyer agrees that its and its Affiliate's health and welfare plans
shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusion (to the extent Buyer's plans
permit and such exclusion was waived under applicable health and welfare plans
offered to the Transferred Employees by Seller or a Subsidiary) with respect to
Transferred Employees and any proof of insurability. Seller or the applicable
Subsidiary shall remain responsible for any benefits payable under a Benefit
Plan with respect to claims incurred by Business Employees prior to or on the
Closing Date. To the extent Buyer's plans permit, the medical and dental plans
maintained by Buyer and Affiliates of Buyer shall recognize as dependents of the
Transferred Employees any Class 2 dependents recognized by Seller's or the
applicable Subsidiary's medical and dental plans.

     (e) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
one or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify under
sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer Savings Plan") to provide for
the receipt of Transferred Employees' lump sum cash distributions, in the form
of an eligible rollover distribution from the Agere Systems Inc. Management
401(k) Plan, provided such rollovers are made at the election of the Transferred
Employees and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Savings Plan. Seller
shall cause the Agere Systems Inc. Management 401(k) Plan to permit the
Transferred Employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued
through the Closing Date in accordance with the Code.

     (f) Seller shall make and be responsible for incentive compensation
payments, if any, to Transferred Employees for the period from October 1, 2002
to and including the Closing Date in accordance with its short-term incentive
plan in effect for any such period. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate Buyer to be liable for or to assume any portion of
Seller's short-term incentive plan.

                                      -36-

     (a) [Reserved]

     (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide
Buyer with the costs and other terms applicable to the Leased Equipment and
Buyer shall decide whether such Leased Equipment will (i) transfer to Buyer as
of the date of assumption by Buyer by Buyer assuming the leases for such
equipment in which case such lease agreement shall from and after such time be
deemed an Assumed Contract hereunder, (ii) be acquired by Buyer as of the date
of purchase by Buyer by Buyer paying for the costs of purchasing such equipment
to the applicable Third Party pursuant to the equipment rentals or leases (the
"Purchased Leased Equipment"), or (iii) remain the property and obligation of
Seller or the applicable Subsidiary, including any such items that are used by
Seller or an Affiliate in providing services pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement which Buyer does not elect to assume or purchase (the "Excluded Leased
Equipment").

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable commercial efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable commercial efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all
acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as

materials, printed or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be restricted in using any packaging materials that are in inventory as of the
Closing Date;

          (iii) Buyer shall not be required at any time to remove the Seller
Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by
Seller or any of its Affiliates from inventory of the CATV Business that is in
existence as of the Closing Date, nor shall Buyer be required at any time to
remove such Seller Name and any such other trademark, design or logo from
schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, machinery, tooling including hand tools,
and the like of the CATV Business in existence as of the Closing Date to the
extent that such instrumentalities are used in the ordinary internal conduct of
the CATV Business and are neither generally observed by the public nor intended
for use as means to effectuate or enhance sales;

          (iv) Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall have the right to sell
existing inventory and to use existing packaging, labeling, containers,
supplies, advertising materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials
bearing the Seller Name or any other trademark, design or logo previously or
currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates until the later of (A) one
year after the Closing Date or (B) the depletion of existing inventory;

          (v) Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) to remove
the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently
used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are transferred
pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) from those assets of the CATV
Business (such as, but not limited to, tools, molds, and machines) used in
association with the manufacture of the products of the CATV Business or
otherwise reasonably used in the conduct of the CATV Business after the Closing.
For the purposes of this Section 5.8(a)(v), "Reasonable Efforts" means Buyer
shall remove the Seller Name from such assets but only at such time when such
asset is not operated or otherwise is taken out of service in the normal course
of business due to regular

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

maintenance or repair (but only for such repairs or maintenance where such
removal could normally be undertaken, for example, repair or maintenance of a
mold cavity) whichever occurs first; provided that, in no event shall Buyer use
the Seller Name after the date which is one (1) year from the Closing Date.
Buyer shall not be required to perform such removal on such assets that are not
or are no longer used to manufacture the products of the CATV Business or other
parts, or if discontinuance of use of such assets is reasonably anticipated
during such time period, or from assets stored during that period provided that
such marks are removed upon such asset's return to service or prior to their
sale or other disposition.

          (vi) Seller hereby grants to Buyer a limited right to use Seller's
Name and associated trademarks, designs and logos as specified in, and during
the periods, if any, specified in clauses (i) - (v) above.

     (b) In no event shall Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer advertise or hold
itself out as Agere or an Affiliate of Agere after the Closing Date.

     5.9 Non-Solicitation of Transferred Employees

     None of Seller, any of its representatives or any of its Affiliates will at
any time prior to two (2) years from the date hereof, directly or indirectly,
solicit the employment of any Transferred Employee without Buyer's prior written
consent. The term "solicit the employment" shall not be deemed to include
generalized searches for employees through media advertisements, employment
firms or otherwise that are not focused on Transferred Employees. This
restriction shall not apply to any employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated by Buyer, or its successors, after the Closing. Solicitation of
employment shall be deemed to occur if the Persons who perform such solicitation
have knowledge of the existence of this Agreement or if such Persons have no
knowledge of the existence of this Agreement but Seller's employees with
knowledge of the existence of this Agreement have advance knowledge of any such
solicitation.

     5.10 [Reserved]

     5.11 Non-Competition

     (a) Seller agrees that, as part of the consideration for the payment of the
Purchase Price, for a period of two (2) years immediately following the Closing
Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, as
a principal, stockholder or otherwise, operate, perform or have any ownership
interest in any business that develops, manufactures, sells, installs or
distributes products in competition with the CATV Business, except that Seller
may (i) purchase or otherwise acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock,
controlling interest or otherwise any Person or business or engage in any
similar merger and acquisition activity with any Person the primary business of
which is not in competition with the CATV Business, or (ii) invest as a minority
shareholder in any Person. For the purposes of this Section 5.11(a), ownership
of securities of a company whose securities are publicly traded under a
recognized securities exchange not in excess of 10% of any class of such
securities

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

shall not be considered to be competition with the CATV Business, and a Person
shall not be considered to be in the "primary business" of competing with the
CATV Business if such Person derives less than 15% of its revenues from products
that compete with the CATV Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that the agreements and limitations set forth in this Section 5.11 shall
not apply to any entity that acquires all or part of Seller in any transaction,
but shall continue to apply to Seller and its Affiliates (as constituted
immediately prior to any such transaction).

     (b) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.11(a)
constitute a material inducement to Buyer's entering into and performing this
Agreement. Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach of
such obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to Buyer
for which there may be no adequate remedy at law and further agrees that in the
event of any breach of said obligation, Buyer may be entitled to injunctive
relief and to such other relief as is proper under the circumstances.

     (c) If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section 5.11, but
this Section 5.11 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of
the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is
held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section 5.11 to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than
those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable
Law.

6. Confidential Nature of Information

     6.1 Confidentiality Agreement

     Buyer agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to (a) all
documents, materials and other information that it shall have obtained regarding
Seller or its Affiliates during the course of the negotiations leading to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or
after the date of this Agreement), any investigations made in connection
therewith and the preparation of this Agreement and related documents and (b)
all analyses, reports, compilations, evaluations and other materials prepared by
Buyer or its counsel, accountants or financial advisors that contain or
otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any of the provided
information; provided, however, that subject to Section 6.2(a), the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing and shall be of no
further force and effect thereafter with respect to information of Seller or its
Affiliates the ownership of which is transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee.

     6.2 Seller's Proprietary Information

     (a) Except as provided in Section 6.2(b), after the Closing and for a
period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it will
keep confidential all of Seller's and its Affiliates' Proprietary Information
that is received from, or made available by, Seller in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, for purposes of this Section 6.2,
information about the CATV Business's business plans and strategies, marketing
ideas and concepts, especially with respect to unannounced products and
services, present and future product plans, pricing, volume estimates, financial
data, product enhancement information, business plans, marketing plans, sales
strategies, customer information (including customers' applications and
environments), market testing information, development plans, specifications,
customer requirements, configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus,
sketches, software, hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or other
technical and business information, except for such Proprietary Information the
ownership of which is transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee as part of the
Purchased Assets.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Proprietary Information shall not
be deemed confidential and Buyer shall have no obligation with respect to any
such Proprietary Information that:

          (i) at the time of disclosure was already known to Buyer other than as
a result of this transaction, free of restriction as evidenced by documentation
in Buyer's possession;

          (ii) is or becomes publicly known through publication, inspection of a
product, or otherwise, and through no negligence or other wrongful act of Buyer;

          (iii) is received by Buyer from a Third Party without similar
restriction and without breach of any agreement;

          (iv) to the extent it is independently developed by Buyer; or

          (v) is, subject to Section 6.2(c), required to be disclosed under
applicable Law or judicial process.

     (c) If Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is requested or required (by oral
question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Proprietary
Information, Buyer will promptly notify Seller of such request or requirement
and will cooperate with Seller such that Seller may seek an appropriate
protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is
in the opinion of Buyer's counsel compelled to disclose the Proprietary
Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, Buyer (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the Proprietary
Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required by

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

Law. Buyer will exercise its (and will cause its Affiliates to exercise their)
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Proprietary
Information.

     6.3 Buyer's Proprietary Information

     (a) Except as provided in Section 6.3(b), after the Closing Date and for a
period of two (2) years thereafter, Seller agrees that it will keep confidential
all of Seller's and its Affiliates' Proprietary Information the ownership of
which or exclusive use of which is transferred to Buyer as part of the Purchased
Assets, including, for purposes of this Section 6.3, information about the CATV
Business's business plans and strategies, marketing ideas and concepts,
especially with respect to unannounced products and services, present and future
product plans, pricing, volume estimates, financial data, product enhancement
information, business plans, marketing plans, sales strategies, customer
information (including customers' applications and environments), market testing
information, development plans, specifications, customer requirements,
configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus, sketches, software,
hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or other technical and
business information.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Proprietary Information regarding
the CATV Business shall not be deemed confidential and Seller shall have no
obligation with respect to any such Proprietary Information that:

          (i) is or becomes publicly known through publication, inspection of a
product, or otherwise, and through no negligence or other wrongful act of
Seller;

          (ii) is received by Seller from a Third Party without similar
restriction and without breach of any agreement; or

          (iii) is, subject to Section 6.3(c), required to be disclosed under
applicable Law or judicial process.

     (c) If Seller (or any of its Affiliates) is requested or required (by oral
question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Proprietary Information
regarding the CATV Business, Seller will promptly notify Buyer of such request
or requirement and will cooperate with Buyer such that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of
a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) is in the opinion of Seller's counsel compelled to disclose the
Proprietary Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other
censure or penalty, Seller (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the
Proprietary Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required by
Law. Seller will exercise its (and will cause its Affiliates to exercise their)
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Proprietary
Information.

     6.4 Confidential Nature of Agreements

     Except to the extent that disclosure thereof is required to enforce a
party's rights under this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements or under
accounting, stock exchange or federal securities or labor relations Laws
disclosure obligations, both parties agree that the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and all Schedules, attachments and
amendments hereto and thereto shall be considered Proprietary Information
protected under this Article 6. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 6 to
the contrary, in the event that any such Proprietary Information is also subject
to a limitation on disclosure or use contained in another written agreement
between Buyer and Seller or either of their respective Affiliates that is more
restrictive than the limitation contained in this Article 6, then the limitation
in such agreement shall supersede this Article 6.

<PAGE>

     (c) all such other documents and instruments as Seller or a Subsidiary may
reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary or desirable to evidence and
effect the assumption by Buyer or a Buyer Designee of the Assumed Liabilities.

     7.3 Closing Date

     The Closing shall take place at the offices of Agere, 1110 American Parkway

the representations and warranties in Section 3.7(c) relating to environmental

this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements that are required to be performed,

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

     9.3 General Agreement to Indemnify

     (a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other
party hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer, employee or
agent of such other party or Affiliates thereof (each an "Indemnified Party")
from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities,
obligations, Taxes, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement, interest,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the
foregoing) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Party to the extent that the Losses arise by reason of, or result from (i)
subject to Section 9.2, any breach or any failure of any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to have been true when made
and at and as of the Closing Date, or (ii) the breach by such party of any
covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the extent
not waived in writing by the other party.

     (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and any
Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Buyer or any
Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) the
Excluded Liabilities; (ii) Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's waiver of any
applicable Bulk Sales Laws; and (iii) any claim, demand or liability relating
to, pertaining to, or arising out of the CATV Business or the Purchased Assets
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

     (c) Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any
Seller Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Seller or any
Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any
failure of Buyer to discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) any
medical, health or disability claims of any Transferred Employee or such
Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer accruing after the Closing Date;
and (iii) any claim, demand or liability for Taxes relating to, pertaining to,
or arising out of the CATV Business or the Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing
Tax Period.

     (d) Amounts payable in respect of the parties' indemnification obligations
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree
to cooperate in the preparation of a supplemental Asset Acquisition Statement as
required by Section 5.3(b) and Treasury Reg. ss. 1.1060-1(e) as a result of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the preceding sentence. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third-Party Claim (as defined below), both parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or as
provided in Section 5.1.

     (e) The amount of the Indemnifying Party's liability under this Agreement
shall be net of any applicable insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of the Loss for which indemnity is sought, which
amount shall be offset by any

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

increases in insurance premium amounts resulting from the insurer having covered
all or portion of such Loss, and Tax savings, if and when realized that actually
reduce the overall impact of the Losses upon, the Indemnified Party. In
computing the amount of any such Tax savings, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence of any payment of any indemnified Loss. The
indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article 9 shall
inure to the benefit of the directors, officers and Affiliates of the other
party hereto on the same terms as are applicable to such other party.

     (f) Except to the extent arising from fraud, bad faith or intentional
misrepresentation, the Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under
Section 9.3(a) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate
amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed $500,000, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the portion of the Losses exceeding
$500,000, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability for all such
claims shall not exceed $12,500,000.

     (g) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties to
this Agreement for breach of any of the terms, conditions, representations or
warranties contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, this exclusive
remedy for damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for (i)
specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or (ii) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

     (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
except to the extent arising from fraud, bad faith or intentional
misrepresentation, no party shall be liable to the other party for any indirect,
special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss
of revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party
in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims. Both parties
shall mitigate their damages.

     (i) The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.3 shall not be
subject to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to
such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.

     9.4 General Procedures for Indemnification

     (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement
shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
action, suit or proceeding by any

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

Third Party, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall
give the Indemnifying Party such information available to the Indemnified Party
with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability hereunder (unless and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
has suffered actual and material prejudice by such failure). If the Indemnifying
Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receipt
of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Third Party in respect of which indemnity
may be sought hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), to assume at the Indemnifying
Party's expense the defense and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim
that (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages, or (ii)
involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages and equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where the claims
for money damages are the primary claims asserted by the Third Party and the
claims for equitable relief are incidental to the claims for money damages. If
the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to assume and control the defense or the settlement against such Third Party
Claim. In the event that any party exercises its right to undertake any such
defense against any Third Party Claim as provided above, then the other parties
shall cooperate in such defense and make available at such cooperating party
expense all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such
party's possession and control relating thereto as is reasonably required to by
the party conducting the defense.

     (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense,
the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in
this Agreement.

     (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any
Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party
Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or
judgment relates solely to monetary damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, enter into any compromise
or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to
take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such Third
Party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and
exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as
it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall
have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which
the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 9.4
with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

     (d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment
pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of
such claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and only to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual and prejudice by such
failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount
thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable
particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement
in respect of which such a claim shall have been incurred. Such notice shall be
given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each
such a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within 20 days after receipt of such
notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.3, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of
such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not
contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to contest the
existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss by stating with particularity
the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount thereof.

     (e) Any claim for indemnification must be made in good faith and in writing
(and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such determination and to
the extent known, an estimated calculation of the Losses incurred in connection
therewith) by no later than the expiration of the applicable periods set forth
in Section 9.2 above, if any. If an Indemnified Party has made such a valid
claim prior to the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 9.2
above, if any, then, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3 above,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the full amount of any Losses
even if that amount is not finally determined until after such expiration. Upon
final determination of the amount of the Losses that is the subject of an
indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the
amount of such Losses to the Indemnified Party within five (5) business days of
such final determination of the amount of the Losses due by the Indemnifying
Party.
