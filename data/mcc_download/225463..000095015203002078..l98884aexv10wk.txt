       E.   For those individuals who have a portion of their incentive measured
            on achievement of individual personal objectives, the following
            implementation procedure will be used:

            1.   Each individual will develop calendar year objectives
                 supporting the business and supervisor's objectives.

            2.   These objectives should have the following characteristics:

                 a)   Not be equivalent to financial goals. (Objectives related
                      to cost reduction or similar projects are appropriate.)

                 b)   Objectives should be specific, measurable, meaningful,
                      agreed to, realistic and time planned. (A project need not
                      be completed in the calendar year if the objective defines
                      a specific status in the project by calendar year end.)

                 c)       Process

                          1) The Chairman shall develop no more than 7 to 10
                             objectives.

                          2) Other Corporate Officers, Huffy Company Presidents,
                             Vice President Group Controller and Vice President
                             Human Resources, shall each develop no more than 8
                             objectives.

                          3) Huffy Company Corporate Staff Level and Corporate
                             Exempt colleagues shall each develop no more than
                             4 to 6 objectives.

                 d)   A "degree of difficulty" is to be assigned to each
                      objective, in total equaling 100.

           3.     The personal objectives and degrees of difficulty shall be
                  jointly reviewed by the individual and his/her supervisor and

                  Note: An employee promoted from a position not eligible for
                  incentive opportunity to a position eligible for incentive
                  opportunity will be eligible only for those quarters in which
                  they held incentive eligible positions.

              3.  Terminations:  To be eligible to receive the Performance
                  Incentive Plan payment for a calendar year, an employee must
                  be on the active payroll at the time payment for that
                  calendar year is made (i.e., the date the checks are issued).

              4.  Death or Retirement: Employees who retired or died during or
                  after the calendar year for which incentive is being
                  calculated and who met the requirement of being on the active
                  payroll during the year will be given consideration for an
                  incentive payment on basis of the following percentage of
                  full incentive opportunity: retired or died during the
                  calendar year in 1st Qtr - 25%; 2nd Qtr - 50%; 3rd Qtr - 75%;
                  during or after 4th Qtr - 100%.

                  Payment for deceased employees shall be made to the
                  beneficiary designated under the Salaried Employees Group Term
                  Life Insurance Plan.

                  the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.

                  In the event of a major restructuring, Profit Plan goals will
                  be modified to reflect the impact of the restructure
                  adjustments; Performance Incentive Plan goals will not be
                  modified, but will be measured on the pre-restructure Profit
                  Plan.

   B.      PAYMENT           Except as otherwise specifically provided
                             by this Policy 128 or its Supplement, payment for

                             awards.

   C.      CALCULATIONS      All incentive calculations will be rounded up to
                             the nearest $1.00 increment, provided employee is
                             eligible for incentive and such incentive is
