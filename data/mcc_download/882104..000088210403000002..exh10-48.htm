<LI>&#9;<B><I>Limitations on Forms of Consideration.</LI>
</B></I>
<OL TYPE="i">

<B><LI>&#9;Tender of Stock.</B>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may
not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of
shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a
violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the
redemption of the shares of Stock.  The Option may not be exercised by tender to
the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such
shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months or
were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.  </LI>

<B><LI>&#9;Cashless Exercise.</B>  A &quot;<B><I>Cashless Exercise</B></I>&quot;
means the assignment in a form acceptable to the Company of the proceeds of a
sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock acquired upon
the exercise of the Option pursuant to a program or procedure approved by the
Company (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the
provisions of Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System).  The Company reserves, at any and all
times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to decline to
approve or terminate any such program or procedure.</LI></OL>
</OL>


<B><LI>&#9;Tax Withholding<I>.</B></I>  At the time the Option is exercised, in
whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the
Optionee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts
payable to the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for
(including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the
Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax
withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise
in connection with the Option, including, without limitation, obligations
arising upon (i)&nbsp;the exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option,
(ii)&nbsp;the transfer, in whole or in part, of any shares of Stock acquired
upon exercise of the Option, (iii)&nbsp;the operation of any law or regulation
providing for the imputation of interest, or (iv)&nbsp;the lapsing of any
restriction with respect to any shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of the
Option.  THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION IS NOT EXERCISABLE UNLESS THE
TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTICIPATING COMPANY GROUP ARE SATISFIED.
ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED
EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED, AND THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO
ISSUE A CERTIFICATE FOR SUCH SHARES OF STOCK.</LI>

<B><LI>&#9;Certificate Registration<I>.</B></I>  Except in the event the
Exercise Price is paid by means of a Cashless Exercise, the certificate for the
shares of Stock as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the
name of the Optionee, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the
Optionee.</LI>

<B><LI>&#9;Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of
Shares<I>.</B></I>  The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock
upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable
requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.
The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise
would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign
securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock
exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition,
the Option may not be exercised unless (i)&nbsp;a registration statement under
the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with
respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii)&nbsp;in the
opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares of Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE
FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED.  ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED.  Questions
concerning this restriction should be directed to the Legal Department of the
Company.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having
jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be
necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock subject to the
Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to
issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have
been obtained.  As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may
require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or
appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to
make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by
the Company.</LI>

the extent provided in Section 7, may be exercised by the Optionee's legal
representative or by any Person empowered to do so under the deceased Optionee's
will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.</P>

exercisable on the date on which the Optionee's Service terminated, may be
exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee's guardian or legal representative)
at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on
which the Optionee's Service terminated, but in any event no later than the
Option Expiration Date, and (ii)&nbsp;the number of Vested Shares shall be

Optionee's Service is terminated by the Participating Company Group for Cause,
the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Optionee on the
date on which the Optionee's Service was terminated, may be exercised by the
Optionee within three (3) months (or such longer period of time as determined by
the Board, in its discretion) after the date on which the Optionee's Service
terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.</P>

<B><I><P>&#9;&#9;&#9;</B></I>(e)&#9;<B><I>Other Termination of Service</I>.</B>
If the Optionee's Service with the Participating Company Group terminates for
any reason, other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a), (b), (c) or (d), the Option,
to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Optionee on the date on which
the Optionee's Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee within
twelve (12) months (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board, in
its discretion) after the date on which the Optionee's Service terminated, but
in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.</P>

<B><LI>&#9;Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law<I>.</B></I>  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods
set forth in Section 7.1 is prevented by the provisions of Section 4.6, the
Option shall remain exercisable until ninety (90) days after the date the
Optionee is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any
event no later than the Option Expiration Date.</LI>

<B><LI>&#9;Extension if Optionee Subject to Section 16(b)<I>.</B></I>

In addition, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or
parent corporation thereof, as the case may be (the <B>&quot;<I>Acquiring
Corporation</I>&quot;</B>), shall either assume the Company's rights and
obligations under the Option or substitute for the Option a substantially
equivalent option for the Acquiring Corporation's stock.  The Option shall
terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in
Control to the extent that the Option is neither assumed or substituted for by
the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised
as of the date of the Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
corporation the stock of which is subject to the Option immediately prior to a
Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately
after such Change in Control less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined
voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other
corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of
Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b)

</B>
<P>&#9;&#9;In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split,
recapitalization, combination, reclassification, or similar change in the
capital structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
number, Exercise Price and class of shares of stock subject to the Option.  If a
majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are
subject to the Option are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become
(whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another
corporation (the &quot;<B><I>New Shares</B></I>&quot;), the Board may
unilaterally amend the Option to provide that the Option is exercisable for New
Shares.  In the event of any such amendment, the Number of Option Shares and the
Exercise Price shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner, as determined
by the Board, in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 9 shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole number, as determined by the Board, and in
no event may the Exercise Price be decreased to an amount less than the par
value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option.  The adjustments determined
by the Board pursuant to this Section 9 shall be final and binding.</P>

any shares of Stock covered by the Option until the date of the issuance of a
certificate for the shares of Stock for which the Option has been exercised (as
evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment shall be made for
dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to
the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 9.  If the
Optionee is an Employee, the Optionee understands and acknowledges that, except
as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a
Participating Company and the Optionee, the Optionee's employment is &quot;at
will&quot; and is for no specified term.  Nothing in this Option Agreement shall
confer upon the Optionee, whether an Employee, Director or Consultant, any right
to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way
with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Optionee's
Service as an Employee, Director or Consultant, as the case may be, at any
time.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable

The Optionee shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the
Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired pursuant
