                             SECOND LEASE AMENDMENT

                                     BETWEEN

                          BENAROYA CAPITAL COMPANY, LLC

                                       AND

                                ICOS CORPORATION

This Second Lease Amendment dated August 13, 2001 is attached to and made part
of that certain Lease dated May 20th, 1997, as amended by that First Lease
Amendment dated February 18, 1998 (the "Lease") between Benaroya Capital
Company, LLC., a Washington limited liability company, as Lessor ("Lessor") and
ICOS Corporation., a Delaware corporation, as Lessee ("Lessee") in the Building
known as Canyon Park - 4, at 2222 220th Street SE in Bothell, Washington (the
"Premises"). The Premises are more particularly described in the Lease.

The terms used herein shall have the same definitions as set forth in the Lease.

In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained in this Second
Lease Amendment, the First Lease Amendment, and the Lease, Lessor and Lessee
agree as follows:

1.    SECTION 1 PREMISES. The Premises' area is hereby amended to be 17,390
      square feet, consisting of 13,022 square feet of office/laboratory area
      and 4,368 square feet of mezzanine storage area, as outlined on the floor
      plan of the Premises attached hereto as Exhibit A-1, which hereby replaces
      Exhibit A of the Lease.

2.    SECTION 2 TERM. The Term of the Lease is hereby extended for an additional
      term of three (3) years, ten (10) months, and ten (10) days, commencing
      May 22, 2002 and expiring March 31, 2006 ("the First Extended Term"). This
      extension constitutes Lessee's exercise of the first (1st) of two (2)
      successive options to renew as provided in Section 34, Option to Extend,
      of the Lease, as amended by the First Lease Amendment, thereby leaving one
      (1) five (5) year option to renew remaining (the term of that renewal, if
      exercised will be for the period of April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2011). The
      actual term of this extension is (3) years, ten (10) months, and ten (10)
      days, rather than 5 years. Lessee has requested of Lessor, and Lessor has
      agreed, to revise the Term of the First Extended Term to be co-terminus
      with the other lease between Lessor and Lessee for the adjacent space in
      the CP-4 Building.
