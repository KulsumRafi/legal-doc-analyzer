                        FIRST AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of
January 11, 2001, is entered into by and among:

              (1) CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
         company ("Borrower");

              (2) LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle National
         Bank, as trustee for the registered Holders of Prudential Mortgage
         Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
         Series 1998-1 ("Lender");

              (3) Each of the certificateholders listed in Schedule I attached
         hereto (collectively, the "Certificateholders") comprising all of the
         holders of Certificates as defined in that certain Trust and Servicing
         Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, by and among Prudential
         Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, as Depositor, The Prudential Insurance
         Company of America, as Servicer, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Fiscal Agent,
         and LaSalle National Bank, as Trustee (the "Trust and Servicing
         Agreement"); and

              (4) THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, as servicer under
         the Trust and Servicing Agreement (in such capacity, "Servicer").

                                    RECITALS

         A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Borrower and Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Lender (as the
same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00).

         B.   Prudential assigned all of its right, title and interest under the
Loan to Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, which in turn assigned all
of its right, title and interest under the Loan to Lender in accordance with the
terms and provisions of the Trust and Servicing Agreement.

         C.   In connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower pledged to
Prudential as collateral for the Loan, among other things, certain "Expansion
Land" comprising a portion of the Property identified as CA0712430, 1051 N.
Wineville Avenue, Ontario, California in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (the
"Ontario Property"); such Expansion Land, consisting of approximately 5 acres of
land, as more specifically described on Exhibit A attached hereto, is

<PAGE>

hereinafter referred to as the "Ontario Expansion Parcel" and the remaining
portion of the Ontario Property hereinafter referred to as the "Remaining
Property."

         D. Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 2.15(b) of the Loan
Agreement for the release of Expansion Land, Borrower has requested Lender, the
Certificateholders and the Servicer to amend the Loan Agreement and the
applicable mortgage to release Lender's lien to the Ontario Expansion Parcel
under the Loan Documents.

         E. Lender, the Certificateholders, and the Servicer are willing so to
amend the Loan Agreement and the applicable mortgage upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Borrower, Lender, the Certificateholders and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

         1. Definitions, Interpretation. All capitalized terms defined above and
elsewhere in this Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise
defined herein, all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the
respective meanings given to those terms in the Loan Agreement, as amended by
this Amendment.

         2. Amendments to Loan Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 5 below, (a) Section 2.15 of the Loan Agreement
is hereby amended by releasing and deleting therefrom the Ontario Expansion
Parcel, (b) Exhibit A of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
therefrom the Ontario Expansion Parcel, and (c) Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement
is hereby amended by deleting therefrom the Ontario Expansion Parcel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release of the Ontario Expansion Parcel shall
not constitute a release of Borrower's indemnification obligations under the
Loan Agreement or under the other Loan Documents as to any matters or claims
which occurred or relate to any matters or claims which occurred on or before
the Effective Date (as defined below) with respect to the Ontario Expansion
Parcel and such obligations shall survive the release of the Ontario Expansion
Parcel from the Property Pool.

         3. Representations and Warranties of Borrower. Borrower hereby
represents and warrants to Lender, the Certificateholders and Servicer that the
following are true and correct on the date of this Amendment and that, after
giving effect to the amendment set forth in Paragraph 2 above, the following
will be true and correct on the Effective Date (as defined below):

            (a) The representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in
         Article V of the Loan Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are
         true and correct in all material respects as if made on such date
         (except for representations and warranties expressly made as of a
         specified date, which shall be true as of such date);

                                        2

<PAGE>

              (b) No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

              (c) All of the Loan Documents are in full force and effect;

              (d) There are no existing rights, conditions or options to expand
         onto, to lease, or to purchase, all or any portion of the Ontario
         Expansion Parcel held by any tenant or any other party with an interest
         to the Remaining Property. All options, rights of first refusal or any
         other right to lease or purchase all or any portion of the Ontario
         Expansion Parcel, if any, held by any past or present tenant or any
         other person with an interest in the Ontario Property have either been
         terminated, waived or expired, such that the Ontario Expansion Parcel
         can be separated from the Remaining Property without any resulting
         adverse consequences to Lender.

              (e) The fair market value of all the Properties securing the Loan
         as of the Closing Date as listed on Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement
         was $522,829,999, and, to Borrower's knowledge, the current fair market
         value of all the Properties currently securing the Loan as of the date
         hereof has not materially and adversely changed from the fair market
         values as of the Closing Date; and

              (f) The fair market value of the Ontario Expansion Parcel on the
         Closing Date of the Loan and the current fair market value of the
         Ontario Expansion Parcel as of the date hereof is not more than
         $1,125,000.

(Without limiting the scope of the term "Loan Documents," Borrower expressly
acknowledges in making the representations and warranties set forth in this
Paragraph 3 that, on and after the date hereof, such term includes this
Amendment.)

         4.   Representations of Servicer to Lender and Certificateholders.
Servicer hereby represents and warrants to Lender and the Certificateholders
that the following are true and correct on the date of this Amendment:

              (a) To Servicer's knowledge, the outstanding principle balance of
the Loan as of the date of this Amendment is Three Hundred Sixty-Two Million
Seven Hundred Thirty-Five Thousand Nine Hundred Eight and 75/100 dollars
($362,735,908.75);

              (b) Servicer is not receiving any loan payments or fees from
Borrower in connection with the release of the Ontario Expansion Parcel other
than for amounts intended to reimburse Servicer for costs and expenses in
handling the transaction; and

              (c) The release of the Ontario Expansion Parcel will not change
the Servicer's payment expectations with respect to the Loan.

         5.   Effective Date. The amendments effected by Paragraph 2 above shall
become effective (the "Effective Date") upon satisfaction and receipt by Lender,
the Certificateholders and Servicer of the following matters, each in form and
substance satisfactory to Lender, the Certificateholders and Servicer:

         determination assuming the separate ownership and operation of the
         Remaining Property from the Ontario Expansion Parcel;

              (g) Copies of all existing tenant leases and amendments thereto
         for the Ontario Property and a tenant estoppel certificate from each
         tenant thereunder certifying that the tenant has no options, rights of
         first refusal, or any other right to lease, expand, develop or purchase
         all or any portion of the Ontario Expansion Parcel, and that there are
         no conditions under the lease in which the tenant could in the future
         exercise an option, or any other right to lease, expand, develop or
         purchase all or any portion of the Ontario Expansion Parcel.

              (h) Evidence that, following the release of the Ontario Expansion

         County, California, shall be unaffected as a result of the release of
         the Ontario Expansion Parcel;

              (k) An opinion of counsel (obtained at the expense of Borrower) to
         the effect that this Amendment and the release of the Ontario Expansion
         Parcel will not cause either the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper Tier
         REMIC (as such terms are defined in the Trust and Servicing Agreement)
         to fail to qualify as REMIC for federal income tax purposes;

              (l) Payment of all fees and expenses payable to Lender, the

              (m) Confirmation that the Amendment to Deed of Trust and the
         Amendment to Assignment of Leases have been recorded in the Official
         Records of San Bernardino County, California;

              (n) Confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the release of the
         Ontario Expansion Parcel will not result in a downgrade, qualification
         or withdrawal of the ratings of the securities held by the
         Certificateholders; and

              (o) Such other evidence as Lender, the Certificateholders and
         Servicer may reasonably request to establish the accuracy and
         completeness in all material respects of the representations and
         warranties and the compliance with the terms and conditions contained
         in this Amendment and the other Loan Documents.

         6.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the Effective Date, each
reference in the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the Loan
Agreement shall mean the Loan Agreement as amended hereby. Except as
specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and
(b) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not,
except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power, or
remedy of Lender, the Certificateholders or Servicer, nor constitute a waiver of
any provision of the Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document.

         7.   Miscellaneous.

              (a) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
         identical counterparts, any set of which signed by all the parties
         hereto shall be deemed to constitute a complete, executed original for

California 94105, and by LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle
National Bank, as trustee for the registered Holders of Prudential Mortgage
Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
1998-1 ("Beneficiary"), having an address at 135 South LaSalle Street, Suite
1625, Chicago, Illinois 60647-4107.

                                    RECITALS

         A.    Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Trustor and PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE CAPITAL COMPANY, INC.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Beneficiary
(as the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by, among other things, that certain Deed
of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing
dated as of October 26, 1998, and recorded on October 28, 1998 as Document
19980458192 in the Official Records of San Bernardino County, California (the
"Ontario Deed of Trust").

          B.   As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, the
Ontario Deed of Trust encumbers, among other properties, expansion land
comprising a portion of the Property identified as CA0712430, 1051 N. Wineville
Avenue, Ontario, California (Pepsi/Ontario) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement
(such expansion land referred to herein as the "Ontario Expansion Land").

          C.   Beneficiary and Trustor now desire to amend the Ontario Deed of
Trust to release the Ontario Expansion Land from the lien of the Ontario Deed of
Trust.

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Beneficiary and Trustor hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings given
to those terms in the Loan Agreement.

<PAGE>

     2.   Substitution of Trustee and Partial Release of Property under Ontario
Deed of Trust. Beneficiary hereby substitutes itself as trustee under the
Ontario Deed of Trust in place of First American Title Insurance Company and
hereby releases and discharges from the lien of the Ontario Deed of Trust that
portion, and only that portion, of the real property and improvements encumbered
by the Ontario Deed of Trust which is more particularly described on Exhibit A
attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Release Parcel"). All other
"Property" described in and currently encumbered by the Ontario Deed of Trust
shall remain encumbered by the Ontario Deed of Trust in accordance with the
terms thereof.

     3.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of San Bernardino County, California, each
reference in the Loan Agreement to the Deed of Trust encumbering the property
identified as CA0712430 (Pepsi/Ontario, CA) shall mean such Deed of Trust as
amended hereby. Except as specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement,
the Ontario Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full
force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and (b) the execution,
delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly
provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power, or remedy of
Beneficiary, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the
Ontario Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document.

     4.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
     taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The signature
     page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed therefrom and
     attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution thereof by all of
     the parties hereto without affecting the validity thereof.
