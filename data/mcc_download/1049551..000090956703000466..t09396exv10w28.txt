         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         this Assignment, Assignor and all other parties so obligated shall be
         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and

         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies

         protest in respect thereof;

         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from

         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's

         covered by insurance and/or condemnation of all or any portion of any
         Mortgaged Property and to exercise its discretion in the proper

         the Assignee any greater rights with respect to the Mortgage Loan
         Documents than granted to Assignor or expand or extend such rights, the

custodial agreement dated as of January 25, 2002 by and between the Bank and
Assignee and (ii) the Amended and Restated Servicing Agreement dated as of June
28, 2001 by and between the Bank and Assignee.

         other encumbrance, (ii) has not granted any participation or other
         interest or assignment, other option or rights to the Mortgage Loans,

         so, other than to Assignee.

                  (b) The registered office and principal place of business of
         the Assignor is located in Hamilton, Bermuda.

         (other than liens created in favor of Assignee hereunder). No
         authorization which has not been obtained is required for the
         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies
         under this Assignment. This Assignment, when executed and delivered,
         will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Assignor

Assignor under the Loan Agreement shall have occurred:

                  (a) Assignee or its agents, shall have the sole power and

         with the Mortgage Loan Documents and the property described therein

         and authority in its sole discretion, to (i) advance funds thereunder,
         (ii) determine that all conditions to the advance of funds thereunder
         have been satisfied (or to waive some or all of the conditions to
         advance thereunder), and (iii) determine that a default or event of
         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         under the Mortgage Loan Documents shall deal solely with the Bank,
         acting on behalf of Assignee, under the Mortgage Loan Documents and
         this Assignment, Assignor and all other parties so obligated shall be
         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and

                  (c) Assignor hereby appoints Assignee the true and lawful
         attorney-in-fact of Assignor, with full power of substitution, in its
         own name, both before and/or after any Event of Default (as defined in
         the Loan Agreement), to take any action under or in connection with the

         interest and shall be irrevocable.

                  (d) Assignor agrees that the assignment herein provided is
         absolute and from and after the date hereof, subject to SECTION 16,

         Documents. On each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Loan

         or unscheduled principal payments due and payable under the Loan
         Documents, (iii) third, to the payment of any Excess Loan Amount (as

         authorization which has not been obtained is required for the
         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies

Assignor under the Loan Agreement shall have occurred:

                  (a) Assignee or its agents, shall have the sole power and

         have been satisfied (or to waive some or all of the conditions to
         advance thereunder), and (iii) determine that a default or event of
         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         acting on behalf of Assignee, under the Mortgage Loan Documents and
         this Assignment, Assignor and all other parties so obligated shall be
         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and
         enforcement of the Loan Documents, in order to effectuate the purposes

understood and agreed that the rights, remedies and options of Assignee or the
Bank, acting as servicer on behalf of Assignee, hereunder are and shall be

provided however, that in the event an Event of Default under any Mortgage Loan

         authorization which has not been obtained is required for the
         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies
         under this Assignment. This Assignment, when executed and delivered,

         have been satisfied (or to waive some or all of the conditions to
         advance thereunder), and (iii) determine that a default or event of
         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         this Assignment, Assignor and all other parties so obligated shall be
         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and

         Services or "Baa" by Moody's Investor Service, Inc.

         so, other than to Assignee.

         authorization which has not been obtained is required for the
         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies
         under this Assignment. This Assignment, when executed and delivered,

Assignor under the Loan Agreement shall have occurred:

         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and

         other encumbrance, (ii) has not granted any participation or other
         interest or assignment, other option or rights to the Mortgage Loans,

         so, other than to Assignee.

         authorization which has not been obtained is required for the
         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies
         under this Assignment. This Assignment, when executed and delivered,

Assignor under the Loan Agreement shall have occurred:

                  (a) Assignee or its agents, shall have the sole power and

         have been satisfied (or to waive some or all of the conditions to
         advance thereunder), and (iii) determine that a default or event of
         default has occurred thereunder and to give any notice, demand or
         protest in respect thereof;

                  (b) Assignor acknowledges that (i) the Bank, as agent of

         acting on behalf of Assignee, under the Mortgage Loan Documents and
         this Assignment, Assignor and all other parties so obligated shall be
         entitled to rely on their actions so taken with respect to the Bank and
         upon the action taken by the Bank, acting on behalf of Assignee, with
         respect to them until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
         Assignor under the Loan Agreement or until Assignee shall appoint
         another person to act on its behalf (or otherwise revoke the Bank's
         authority to act on behalf of Assignee);

                  (c) Assignor agrees that Assignee or it agents shall have the
         full power and authority, in its discretion, to take, or defer from
         taking, any and all actions with respect to the administration and

         contemplated herein and therein, including the right, power and
         authority to exercise any and all of the rights, remedies and options

         assignment hereunder or the enforcement by Assignee of its remedies
         under this Assignment. This Assignment, when executed and delivered,
