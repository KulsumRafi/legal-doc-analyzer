15 business days of the receipt of notice from Employee that there
has been a Payment, the Tax Firm shall make all determinations
required under this Section&nbsp;8, shall provide to Parent and Employee
a written report setting forth such determinations, together with
detailed supporting calculations, and, if the Tax Firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable, shall deliver the Accounting Opinion
to Employee. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;8, shall be paid by Parent to Employee within fifteen days
of the receipt of the Tax Firm&#146;s determination. Subject to the
remainder of this Section, any determination by the Tax Firm shall
be binding upon Parent and Employee; provided, however, that
Employee shall only be bound to the extent that the determinations
of the Tax Firm hereunder, including the determinations made in the
Accounting Opinion, are reasonable and reasonably supported by
applicable law. As a result of the uncertainty in the application
of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Tax Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by Parent should
have been made (&#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with the calculations
required to be made hereunder. In the event that it is ultimately
determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
8(g)(iii) that Employee is required to make a payment of any Excise
Tax, the Tax Firm shall reasonably determine the amount of the
Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be
promptly paid by Parent to or for the benefit of Employee. In
determining the reasonableness of Tax Firm&#146;s determinations
hereunder, and the effect thereof, Parent and Employee shall be
provided a reasonable opportunity to review such determinations
with Tax Firm and their respective tax counsel, if separate from
the Tax Firm. Tax Firm&#146;s determinations hereunder, and the
Accounting Opinion, shall not be deemed reasonable until Employee&#146;s
reasonable objections and comments thereto have been satisfactorily
accommodated by Tax Firm.</FONT></TD>

modified to the extent necessary to be enforceable and, specifically, without

enforceable, it shall be modified to encompass the longest term which is
enforceable and, if the scope of the geographic area of non-competition is too
great to be enforceable, it shall be modified to encompass the greatest area
that is enforceable. The parties further agree to submit any issues regarding
such modification to a court of competent jurisdiction if they are unable to
agree and further agree that if said court declines to so amend or modify this
Agreement, the parties will submit the issue of amendment or modification of
the non-competition covenants in this Agreement to binding arbitration in
