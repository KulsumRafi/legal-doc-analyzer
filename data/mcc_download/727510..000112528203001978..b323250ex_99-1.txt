                                VOTING AGREEMENT


         THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
February __, 2003, by and between NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("NPS"), and the undersigned Stockholder of Enzon ("Stockholder").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Momentum Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Holdco"), NPS,
Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Enzon"), Newton
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Newton Merger Sub"), and
Einstein Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Einstein Merger
Sub"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as such
agreement may hereafter be amended from time to time in conformity with the
provisions thereof, the "Reorganization Agreement") which provides for the
merger of Newton Merger Sub with and into NPS and the merger of Enzon with and
into Einstein Merger Sub, pursuant to which mergers NPS will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdco and Einstein Merger Sub will continue as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdco (together, the "Mergers"). Pursuant to the Mergers,
all outstanding common stock of NPS and all outstanding common stock of Enzon
will be converted into the right to receive shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Holdco ("Holdco Common Stock").

         B. Stockholder is the beneficial owner (as such term is defined under
Rule 13(d)(3) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
of such number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Enzon
("Enzon Common Stock") as set forth on the signature page hereof, and options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such number of shares of Enzon Common Stock
as set forth on the signature page hereof.

         C. As an inducement and a condition to entering into the Reorganization
Agreement, NPS has requested that Stockholder agree, and Stockholder has agreed
(in Stockholder's capacity as such), to enter into this Agreement in order to
facilitate the consummation of the Mergers.

         NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

         1. Definitions.

                  (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms that
are used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in the Reorganization Agreement.

                  (b) "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i)
such date and time as the Reorganization Agreement shall have been validly
terminated pursuant to its terms, or (ii) such date and time as the Mergers
shall become effective in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
the Reorganization Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  (c) "Person" shall mean any individual, any corporation,
limited liability company, general or limited partnership, business trust,
unincorporated association or other business organization or entity, or any
governmental authority.

                  (d) "Shares" shall mean: (i) all securities of Enzon
(including all shares of Enzon Common Stock and all options, warrants and other
rights to acquire shares of Enzon Common Stock) owned by Stockholder as of the
date of this Agreement, and (ii) all additional securities of Enzon (including
all additional shares of Enzon Common Stock and all additional options, warrants
and other rights to acquire shares of Enzon Common Stock) of which Stockholder
acquires beneficial ownership during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement until the Expiration Date.

                  (e) A Person shall be deemed to have effected a "Transfer" of
a security if such Person directly or indirectly (i) offers for sale, sells,
assigns, pledges, encumbers, grants an option with respect to, transfers or
otherwise disposes of such security or any interest therein, or (ii) enters into
an agreement, commitment or other arrangement providing for the sale of,
assignment of, pledge of, encumbrance of, granting of an option with respect to,
transfer of or disposition of such security or any interest therein; provided,
however, that the granting by Stockholder of a security interest in Shares to a
brokerage firm to secure a cash loan from such brokerage firm for the purpose of
purchasing shares of Enzon Common Stock upon exercise of Enzon Options
outstanding on the date of this Agreement shall not be deemed a "Transfer" for
purposes of this Agreement.

         2. Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference; Stop
Transfer. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, at all times
during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and continuing until the Expiration Date, Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) cause or permit the Transfer of any of the Shares to be
effected, or discuss, negotiate or make any offer regarding any Transfer of any
of the Shares, (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to any
of the Shares, deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement or other similar commitment or arrangement with respect to any
of the Shares in contravention of the obligations of Stockholder under this
Agreement, (iii) request that Enzon register the Transfer of any certificate or
uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares, or (iv) take any action
that would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder contained herein
untrue or incorrect, or have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder
from performing any of Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement.
Stockholder hereby agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the
restrictions referred to herein, Enzon may issue appropriate "stop transfer"
instructions to its transfer agent in respect of the Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (A)
Stockholder may Transfer any or all of the Shares pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of Stockholder's 10b-5 plan or arrangement with Enzon, if any,
as in effect as of the date hereof, and (B) Stockholder may sell Shares for cash
to the extent necessary to pay taxes incurred as a direct result of the exercise
of Enzon Options after the date hereof.

         5. Representations and Warranties. Stockholder hereby represents and
warrants to NPS and Holdco as follows:

                  (a) Ownership of Shares. Stockholder is the beneficial owner
(as such term is defined under Rule 13(d)(3) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except that such terms shall include Shares
that may be acquired more than sixty (60) days from the date hereof) of all of
the Shares. Stockholder has sole voting power and the sole power of disposition

restrictions on such rights, subject to applicable federal securities laws and
the terms of this Agreement. Stockholder is the sole record holder (as reflected

capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform all of Stockholder's

voting agreement or voting trust. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its
terms.

                  (d) No Consents. To his, her or its knowledge, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and the performance by
Stockholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder will not, require
Stockholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to
make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority.

                                       3

         6. No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in NPS any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership
of or with respect to any Shares. Except as provided in this Agreement, all
rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares shall remain
vested in and belong to Stockholder.

         7. Stockholder Notification of Acquisition of Additional Shares. At all
times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, Stockholder shall promptly
notify NPS and Holdco of the number of any additional shares of Enzon Common
Stock and the number and type of any other voting securities of Enzon acquired
by Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof.

         8. Enzon Stop Transfer Instructions. At all times commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration
Date, Enzon shall not register the Transfer (by book-entry or otherwise) of any
certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares unless
such Transfer is made pursuant to and in compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Enzon shall instruct its transfer agent for Enzon
Common Stock (the "Transfer Agent") not to Transfer, at any time commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration
Date, any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares
unless and until the Transfer Agent has received NPS's consent to effect any
such Transfer.

         9. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and
automatically, without any action on the part of any party hereto, as of the
Expiration Date.

         10. Directors and Officers. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if Stockholder is a director or officer of Enzon, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit such director or officer from acting
in his/her capacity as such or from taking such action as a director or officer
of Enzon that may be required on the part of such person as a director or
officer of Enzon, including acting in compliance with the Reorganization
Agreement.

         11. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Reorganization Agreement and any other

                  (b) Certain Events. This Agreement and the obligations
hereunder shall attach to all of the Shares and shall be binding upon any person

foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall not attach to any Shares that are

America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents
referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action,
suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding
may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may
not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware state or federal court. The parties hereby consent
to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and
over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner

                           (i) Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached.

that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having

entitled at law or in equity.

                  (j) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF MOMENTUM MERGER CORPORATION, NPS AND ENZON IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

                  (k) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

                  (l) Further Assurances. At the request of any party to another
party or parties to this Agreement, such other party or parties shall execute
and deliver such instruments or documents to evidence or further effectuate (but
not to enlarge) the respective rights and obligations of the parties and to
evidence and effectuate any termination of this Agreement.

                  (m) Public Disclosure. Stockholder shall not issue any

Sub"). The Reorganization Agreement provides for the merger of Newton Merger Sub
with and into NPS (the "NPS Merger") and the merger of Enzon with and into
Einstein Merger Sub (the "Enzon Merger" and together with the NPS Merger, the
"Mergers"), and Stockholder is receiving a portion of the consideration payable
in connection with the Enzon Merger. As used in this Proxy, the term "Expiration
Date" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the
Reorganization Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to its
terms, or (ii) such date and time as the Mergers shall become effective in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Reorganization
Agreement.

         The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby
authorized and empowered by Stockholder, at any time prior to the Expiration
Date, to act as Stockholder's attorney and proxy to vote all of the Shares, and
to exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with
respect to all of the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to
execute and deliver written consents) at every annual or special meeting of
stockholders of Enzon (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and in
every written consent in lieu of such meeting:

                  (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the
         Reorganization Agreement and approval of the Enzon Merger;

                  (b) against the approval of any proposal that would result in
         a breach by Enzon of the Reorganization Agreement; and

                  (c) against any proposal made in opposition to, or in
         competition with, consummation of the Mergers (or either of them) and
         the other transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement,
         including any Acquisition Proposal.

         The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Proxy on
any other matter except as provided in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above.
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters. Notwithstanding anything
in this Proxy to the contrary, if Stockholder is a director or officer of Enzon,
nothing contained in this Proxy shall prohibit such director or officer from
acting in his/her capacity as such or from taking such action as a director or
officer of Enzon that may be required on the part of such person as a director
or officer of Enzon, including acting in compliance with the Reorganization
Agreement.

         Any obligation of Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Stockholder.

         This Proxy shall terminate and be of no further force and effect,
automatically upon the Expiration Date.
