consideration of the Employment Agreement, the provisions hereof, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and Optionee hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P><P

from 60 days before a Change in Control until 548 days after a Change in Control, subject to <U>Section 2</U>, all of the shares of the Company&#146;s capital stock that are at the time of the Involuntary Termination subject to outstanding Covered
Options or issued upon exercise of Covered Options prior to vesting shall automatically vest in full on an accelerated basis so that the Covered Options shall immediately become exercisable for all underlying shares as fully-vested and all shares
issued upon exercise of Covered Options prior to vesting will become free of repurchase rights. The Covered Options shall remain governed by the plan pursuant to which they were granted, including for purposes of the period for which they will
remain exercisable, except to the extent the plan is modified by a written agreement between Optionee and the Company. In order to facilitate the vesting that would be provided by this Addendum in case of a Change in Control occurring 60 days or
less after an Involuntary Termination preceding that Change in Control, any cancellation or termination of unvested Covered Options that would occur as a result of the Involuntary Termination will be deferred until it is determined that no vesting
of those Covered Options will occur pursuant to this Addendum. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Addendum will not extend the term or cause vesting of any Covered Options that have lapsed upon expiration of their initial term before
occurrence of the Involuntary Termination and Change in Control required to trigger vesting under this Addendum. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

Gross-Up Payment had been paid. The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined in good faith by independent accountants or tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to Optionee, who shall apply the following assumptions: (i)
Executive shall be treated as paying federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is made, and (ii) Optionee shall be treated as paying state and local income taxes at the highest marginal
rate(s) in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is made in the locality of Optionee&#146;s residence as of the effective date of Optionee&#146;s termination or resignation, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that could
be obtained from deducting those state and local taxes. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"

(the &#147;Triggering Event&#148;), provided that if the Gross-Up Payment cannot be determined within that time, the Company shall pay Optionee within that time an estimate, determined in good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of the
Gross-Up Payment and shall pay the remainder (plus interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount can be determined but in no event later than the 30th day after the Triggering Event. If the estimated
payment is more than the amount later determined to have been due, the excess (plus interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) shall be repaid by Optionee within five business days after written demand. </FONT></P><P

less than the amount that was taken into account in determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, Optionee shall repay at the time that the amount of the reduced Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to
that reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, FICA tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by Optionee, to the extent the repayment results in
a reduction in or refund of the Excise Tax, FICA tax or federal, state or local income tax), plus interest on the amount of the repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. If the actual Excise Tax imposed is more than the
amount that was taken into account in determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Company shall make an additional gross-up payment in respect of such excess (plus interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) at the
