Member's share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain attributable to such
Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and (5). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence

Capital Account Deficit for the Member, such Member shall be allocated items of
income and book gain in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate such
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as quickly as possible; PROVIDED, that an
allocation pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be made if and only to the
extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all
other allocations provided in this Article III have been tentatively made as if

constitute a "qualified income offset" as provided by Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently herewith.

Debt. The provision is to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and (i)(1).

          (e)     LIMITATION ON ALLOCATION OF NET LOSS. To the extent any

shall be reallocated among the other Members in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests, subject to the limitations of this paragraph (e).

          (f)     SHARING OF EXCESS NONRECOURSE LIABILITIES. For purposes of

Section 3.5 (the "REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS") are intended to comply with certain
requirements of the applicable Regulations promulgated under Code
Section 704(b).  Notwithstanding  any other  provisions of this Article III, the
Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other operating
Net Profits, Net Loss and other items of income, gain, loss and deduction to the
Members for Capital Account  purposes so that, to the extent  possible,  the net
amount of such  allocations  of Net  Profits,  Net Loss and other items shall be
equal to the  amount  that  would  have  been  allocated  to each  Member if the
Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for federal, state and
local tax purposes shall be allocated to the Members in the same manner and
amounts as the book items corresponding to such tax items are allocated for
Capital Account purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, credits arising from
expenditures of the Company shall be allocated to the Members in the same manner
in which Net Losses are allocated to them hereunder.

                                       15

          (b)     RECAPTURE INCOME. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if there is a
gain on any sale, exchange or other disposition of Company assets and all or a
portion of such gain is characterized as ordinary income by virtue of the
recapture rules of Code Section 1245 or 1250, or under the corresponding
recapture rules of state or local income tax law, as the case may be, then, to
the extent possible, such recapture income for United States and state and local
tax purposes shall be allocated to the Members in the ratio that they were
allocated Tax Depreciation previously taken and allowed with respect to the
Company assets being sold or otherwise disposed of.

          (c)     SECTION 754 ADJUSTMENTS. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), any
increase or decrease in the amount of any items of income, gain, loss, deduction
or credit for tax purposes attributable to an adjustment to the basis of Company
assets made pursuant to a valid election or deemed election under
SECTIONS 732(d), 734, 743, and 754 of the Code, and any increase or decrease in
the amount of any item of credit or tax preference attributable to any such
adjustment, shall be allocated to those Members entitled thereto under such law.
Such items shall be excluded in determining the Capital Accounts of the Members,
except as otherwise provided in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Regulations.

          (d)     SECTION 704(c). Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the Company
owns or acquires Section 704(c) Property, or if the Tax Matters Member makes an
election referred to in the definition of "Gross Asset Value" herein, then,
solely for tax purposes and not for Capital Account purposes, Tax Depreciation,
and any gain or loss, attributable to such Section 704(c) Property shall be
allocated between or among the Members in a manner that takes into account the
variation between such Gross Asset Value and such adjusted tax basis, in
accordance with the principles of Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations
promulgated thereunder; provided that, in connection with such allocations, the
Tax Matters Member shall have the right to elect either the "traditional method"
as permitted by Section 1.704-3(b) of the Regulations or the "traditional method
with curative allocations" as permitted by Section 1.704-3(c) of the
Regulations.

          3.7     SECTION 754 ELECTION. The Management Committee may, in its
sole discretion, cause the Company to make an election under Section 754 of the
Code.

          3.8     DISTRIBUTIONS.

          (a)     Distributions of cash (other than distributions in liquidation
of the Company with respect to which Section 8.2(d) shall apply) shall be made
as follows:

                  (1)  Up to an amount equal to the Net Profits for the year and
     any Net Profits for prior years to the extent not previously distributed,
     to the Members in an amount equal to the allocation of such Net Profits;
     and

                  (2)  any distributions in excess of distributions made
     pursuant to Section 3.8(a)(1) hereof shall be made in proportion to the
     Members' Percentage Interests after giving effect to all other adjustments
     for the year.

          (b)     Distributions shall be made at such times and in such amounts
as the Management Committee may determine in its sole discretion. In any tax
year in which there are Net Profits, the Management Committee shall distribute
to the Members an amount of cash equal

                                       16
<Page>

to forty-five percent (45%) of the Members' respective share of Net Profits (as
determined under Section 3.4) for such tax year by means of quarterly
distributions.

          3.9     NO RETURN. Except as provided herein or by law, no Member

demand or receive the return of any of such Member's Capital Contributions from

Company shall not distribute any assets in kind unless approved by the
Management Committee. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2(d) and (e),
such property distributions in kind shall be distributed based on the Fair
Market Value of such property in the same proportions as if cash were
distributed.

          (b)     If any Company asset is distributed in kind (including
pursuant to Article VIII), the Members' Capital Accounts shall be adjusted for
the items of income and loss that would have been realized by the Company if the
distributed asset had been sold for its Fair Market Value on the date of
distribution (as determined by the Management Committee in its discretion). The
method of allocating such items of income or loss shall be determined by the
other provisions of this Agreement.

          (c)     No distribution in kind of the GTC Contributed Assets shall be
made to a Member other than GTC, and such a distribution shall not be made
without the prior approval of GTC.

          4.3     INSPECTION RIGHTS OF MEMBERS. Any Managing Member, and any
accountants, attorneys, financial advisers and other representatives of such
Managing Member and its subsidiaries, may, from time to time at such Member's
sole expense, for any reasonable purpose visit and inspect the properties of the
Company, examine (and make copies and extracts of) the Company's books, records

                                    ARTICLE V

                                   TAX MATTERS

          5.1     PARTNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES. The Members agree that it is
their intention that the Company shall be treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes, and further agree not to take any
position or make any election, in a tax return or otherwise, inconsistent
herewith or inconsistent with any position taken by the Company in any tax
return of the Company. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will file as
a

                                       18
<Page>

partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. If a change in
applicable law (including a revenue ruling, revenue procedure or other
administrative pronouncement) would cause the Company not to be treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, the Members shall
endeavor in good faith to reach an agreement on restructuring the Company so
that it will be so treated (which may, subject to the following proviso, entail
a merger of the Company into an entity treated as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes); PROVIDED that no Member shall be required to agree to any
restructuring that it reasonably determines would have an adverse effect on the
assets, business, results of operations or condition (financial or other) of, or
otherwise would be adverse to the interests of or cause the incurrence of any
material additional expenditure by, such Member or any Affiliate of such Member.

          5.2     TAX MATTERS MEMBER. The Tax Matters Member of the Company
shall be GTC or any other Member selected by the Management Committee to succeed
it or any of its successors, who shall be subject to the control of the
Management Committee. Each Member, by its execution of this Agreement, consents
to such designation of the Tax Matters Member, and agrees to execute, certify,
acknowledge, deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate public
offices such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such
consent. The Tax Matters Member shall exercise any authority permitted the Tax
Matters Member under the Code and Regulations, provided that nothing herein
shall limit the rights granted Members under the Code and Regulations
(including, without limitation, the right, subject to section 6222 of the Code
and Section 5.1 hereof, to take inconsistent positions).

          5.3     TAX ELECTIONS, TAX REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING DECISIONS.

          (a)     All determinations as to tax elections and tax reporting shall
be made by the Tax Matters Member with the consent of the Management Committee.
All determinations as to accounting policies and significant accounting
principles shall be made by the Management Committee.

          (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members agree that the
Company shall elect, for its first taxable year, to have the TEFRA audit rules
apply as permitted by Code Section 6231(a)(1)(B)(ii) and Treasury Regulation
Section 301.6231(a)(1) - 1T(b). The Tax Matters Member is authorized to prepare
the requisite election statement, which should be signed by all persons who are
Members during such year, and file the completed statement with the Company's
federal income tax return for such taxable year.

          5.4     TAX RETURNS. The Tax Matters Member shall, at the cost of the
Company, cause to be prepared and delivered to each Member as soon as
practicable after the end of each Fiscal Year a copy of the Company's federal,
state and local income and other tax returns for said Fiscal Year, with Schedule
K-1 attached to the federal return.

          5.5     WITHHOLDING. The Company shall comply with withholding
requirements under federal, state and local law and shall remit amounts withheld
to and file required forms with the applicable jurisdictions. To the extent the
Company is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with
respect to distributions or allocations to any Member, the amount withheld shall
be treated as a distribution in the amount of the withholding to that

                                       19
<Page>

Member on the last day of the Company's Fiscal Year for which the amount was
paid, or if earlier, the last day on which such Member held Percentage Interests
in the Company during such Fiscal Year. In the event of any claimed
overwithholding, Members shall have no rights against the Company or any other
Member. If the amount of withholding tax paid by the Company was not withheld
from actual distributions, the Company may, at its option, (i) require the
Member promptly to reimburse the Company such withholding or (ii) reduce any
subsequent distributions to such Member by the amount of such withholding. Each
Member agrees to furnish the Company with any representations and forms as shall
reasonably be requested by the Company to assist it in determining the extent
of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. Each Member agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and all other Members from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses
(including reasonable legal and accounting fees) resulting from any tax
liability incurred by the Company attributable to the Company's failure to
withhold taxes on distributions or allocations to such Member.

          6.1     POWERS OF MEMBERS. Pursuant to Section 6.2, the management of
the Company is vested in the Management Committee. The Members shall have power
to exercise only those rights and powers granted to the Members pursuant to the

pursuant to, and with the powers and authority set forth in, this Article VI
(the "MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE"). The Management Committee shall have the sole and
exclusive responsibility and authority for the management, conduct and operation
of the Company's business in all respects and in all matters, except to the
extent that the Management Committee delegates in accordance with this Agreement
any such responsibility or authority to any other committee of Members,
Managers, officers, employees or agents of the Company. The Management Committee
may delegate such general or specific authority to committees of Managing
Members, Managers, officers, employees or agents of the Company as the
Management Committee considers desirable from time to time, and such committees
of Managing Members, Manager, officers, employees or agents of the Company may,
subject to any restraints or limitations imposed by the Management Committee,
exercise the authority granted to them. The Committee Members shall have the
same standard of care and duty of loyalty to the Company and the Members as the
directors of a Delaware corporation have to such corporation and its
stockholders.

the Decreased Percentage Member shall be suspended ("SUSPENDED COMMITTEE
MEMBERS") until the Percentage Interest of the Decreased Percentage Member is

                                       24
<Page>

increased to at least half of the Percentage Interest of the other Managing
Member (i.e. a ratio of 1:2), provided further that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Suspended Committee Members shall continue to have the right to vote
with respect to matters set forth in clauses (1)(ii), (4), (5), (8), (12),
(13)(i), (14), (21), (22), (24), (25) and (26)(i) of Section 6.5(b) and
Section 6.5(c). Suspended Committee Members shall continue to have the right to
attend Management Committee meetings.

          (b)     Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Management
Committee may be taken without a meeting, if all of the Committee Members
entitled to vote (taking into account Section 6.6(a)) consent in writing to such
action. Such consent shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of the
Management Committee.

          (c)     The Management Committee shall cause to be kept a book of
minutes of all of its actions by written consent and its meetings in which there
shall be recorded the time and place of such meeting, whether regular or special
(and if special, how called), the notice thereof given, the names of those
present and the proceedings thereof.

          (d)     The chairperson shall appoint a secretary of the meeting who
shall produce the written minutes of the meeting. The order of business of the
meeting of the Management Committee shall be determined by the chairperson. The
secretary of the meeting may be a person who is not a Committee Member.

          (e)     Committee Members may participate in a meeting of the
Management Committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
one another, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

          6.7     DEADLOCK. In the event that a matter brought before the
Management Committee cannot be resolved due to the deadlock of the Committee
Members, the matter shall be referred to the Chief Executive Officer of GTC and
the President of Fresenius Kabi (together, the "MEMBER OFFICERS") for
resolution. In the event that the Member Officers are unable to resolve the
matter within forty-five (45) days, at the option of any Managing Member, the
matter shall be submitted to arbitration for resolution in accordance with
Section 12.7.

          6.8     MANAGERS. GTC shall nominate, and the Management Committee
shall approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), the General
Manager, and Fresenius Kabi shall nominate, and the Management Committee shall
approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), the Project Manager
(collectively, the "MANAGERS"). The Managers shall be responsible for overall
implementation of the Management Committee's approved objectives, plans and
budgets for the development of the Company Business. The Managers shall be
responsible for making decisions related to the day-to-day operations of the
Company, including the implementation of the Company Business Plan and Budget
and Quarterly Company Business Plan and Budget for the development and
commercialization of rhSA, provided, however that all decisions listed in
Section 6.5 shall require Management Committee approval. The Managers will
report to the Management Committee as often and at such times as the Management
Committee requests. The Members agree that the initial General Manager shall be
Paul Horan and that the initial Project Manager shall be Wolfram Eichner. The
Managers

                                       25
<Page>

shall serve for a term of two years, renewable by written consent of the Chief
Executive Officer of GTC and the President of Fresenius Kabi. Upon nonrenewal of
such term, resignation or dismissal of a Manager in accordance with this
Agreement, the Managing Member who approved such Manager shall designate a
replacement Manager. In the event the Managers shall be unable to agree on any
decision, such decision shall be presented to the Management Committee for
determination. In addition to any other duties specified in this Agreement, the
specific duties and responsibilities of the Managers shall include the
following:

          (a)     Prepare Proposed Company Business Plan and Budget and Proposed
Quarterly Business Plan and Budget;

          (b)     Manage financial resources and cash burn to approved budget;

          (c)     Raise capital as authorized by the Board of Managers;

          (d)     Write strategic and business plans to be updated on a yearly
basis;

          (e)     Prepare and manage technical, operational and commercial
milestones on a quarterly basis and coordinate activities of development process
to meet such milestones;

          (f)     Manage sales and marketing activities;

          (g)     Manage negotiation and consummation of contracts for purchase
of products or services and strategic alliances;

          (h)     Manage QA/QC activities; and

          (i)     Manage clinical trial activities.

     The General Manager shall have primary responsibility for managing the
activities of the Company relating to Excipient Uses.

     The General Manager and the Project Manager shall communicate regularly
regarding the day-to-day operations of the Company, including the implementation
of the Company Business Plan and Budget and Quarterly Company Business Plan and
Budget for the development and commercialization of rhSA. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Manager shall keep the other Manager fully informed on a periodic
basis and in response to requests for information.

          6.9     ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL/SERVICES.

          (a)     Additional services required for completion of tasks
identified and outlined by the Managers that are in furtherance of the Field of
Interest shall be performed through service agreements with either GTC or
Fresenius Kabi (the "SERVICE AGREEMENTS"), provided that such Service Agreements
are on financial, technical and operational terms not less favorable than could
be obtained from an unaffiliated party on an arm's length basis as reasonably
determined by the Management Committee. The Managers and the Management
Committee shall use their best efforts, that are nonetheless commercially
reasonable, to limit the

                                       26
<Page>

scope of services to be performed under the Service Agreements to activities
that are in furtherance of the Field of Interest.

          (b)     The principal terms of the initial Service Agreement with GTC
are set forth on Schedule D hereto. The initial Service Agreement with GTC shall
be executed and effective no later than February 28, 2003. The initial Service
Agreement with GTC will include GTC's obligation to provide the Company, to the
extent it is able, the benefits of services that relate to the Field of Interest
that are provided to GTC under the Existing Service Arrangements. The Company
and the Managing Members hereby acknowledge and agree that the provision of
services to the Company through GTC under the Existing Service Arrangements may
not otherwise comply with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
provisions of this Section 6.9(a) or Section 11.3 below.

          (c)     GTC shall be the preferred seller and distributor of the
Company for the Non-Therapeutic Uses of rhSA and Fresenius Kabi shall be the
preferred seller and distributor of the Company for the Therapeutic Uses of
rhSA.

          (d)     The Company shall have the right to negotiate for services
with third party vendors ("VENDORS") even if the same functions could be
provided by GTC or Fresenius Kabi so long as the services agreements or other
arrangements ("VENDOR AGREEMENTS") are approved by the Management Committee.
Unless otherwise negotiated by the Managers in good faith, such Vendor
Agreements shall contain the following intellectual property provisions: (i) any
Inventions made by a Vendor in the course of the service relationship with the
Company shall become the property of the Company and (ii) any Improvements made
by a Vendor in the course of the service relationship with the Company shall
become the property of the Company. The Company will notify Fresenius Kabi and
GTC immediately upon its intention to file a patent application with respect to
such Invention or Improvement. In the event any such Invention or Improvement is
also of interest to GTC or Fresenius Kabi for use outside the Field of Interest,
the Company shall grant to GTC and/or Fresenius Kabi, upon written request, a
fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide, nonexclusive license, with the right to
grant sublicenses, under such Invention or Improvement for use outside the Field
of Interest only, and shall provide access to any data or materials related to
such Invention or Improvement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such Invention or
Improvement: (iii) relates to the development or use of transgenic animals for
the production of proteins, peptides and polypeptides for use as
biopharmaceutical products (the "GTC CORE BUSINESS"), the Company shall only
grant such a license exclusively to GTC; or (iv) relates to dialysis, clinical
nutrition, transfusion, infusion, adsorber technology and immune therapy (the
"FRESENIUS CORE BUSINESS"), the Company shall only grant such a license
exclusively to Fresenius.

          6.10    INITIAL FOCUS OF COMPANY. The initial focus of the Company
shall be to pursue Excipient Uses.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                     LIABILITY; EXCULPATION; INDEMNIFICATION

          7.1     LIABILITY FOR DEBTS OF THE COMPANY; LIMITED LIABILITY.

          (a)     The debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether
arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations
and liabilities of the Company, and no Member, in its capacity as such, shall be
obligated personally for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company.

          (b)     No Member, in its capacity as such, shall have any liability
to the Company, any other Member or to the creditors of the Company. No Manager
or Committee Member shall be liable to the Company or to any Member for any act
performed by such individual within the scope of authority conferred on him or
her by this Agreement, except with respect to any matter as to which he or she
shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith in
the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interest of the
Company.

          7.2     INAPPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN DOCTRINES. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law (including section 18-1101(c) of the Act), no
Managing Member shall have any fiduciary or similar duty, at law or in equity,
or any liability relating thereto to the Company, or any other Member (or
Affiliate of such Member), with respect to or in connection with the Company or
the Company's business or affairs.

          7.3     INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person
against any and all Indemnified Losses. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall indemnify the Managers and Committee Members for
any act performed by them within the scope of authority conferred on them by
this Agreement, except with respect to any matter as to which they shall have
been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the
reasonable belief that their action was in the best interest of the Company.

          7.4     PROCEDURES.

          (a)     If any Third Party Proceeding shall be instituted or asserted
or any Indemnified Losses in connection with a Third Party Proceeding shall
arise in respect of which indemnity may be sought by an Indemnified Person
pursuant to Section 7.3, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the
Company thereof in writing. Failure to provide notice shall not affect the
Company obligations hereunder except to the extent the Company is actually
prejudiced thereby.

          (b)     The Company shall have the right to participate in and control
the defense of any such Third Party Proceeding and, in connection therewith, to
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnified Person, at the
Company's expense, to represent each Indemnified Person in such Third Party
Proceeding. The Company shall keep the Indemnified Person advised of the status
of such Third Party Proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in
good faith recommendations made by the Indemnified Person with respect thereto.

                                       28
<Page>

          (c)     In any such Third Party Proceeding, any Indemnified Person
shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense; PROVIDED that
the fees and expenses of such Indemnified Person's counsel shall be at the
expense of the Company if (i) the Company and such Indemnified Person shall have
mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the Company has failed,
within a reasonable time after having been notified of the existence of an
indemnified claim, to assume the defense of such indemnified claim or (iii)
representation of both parties by the same counsel would, in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Person, be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. It is understood that all fees and expenses
shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

          (d)     The Company shall not settle any Third Party Proceeding
without the Indemnified Person's written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed if such settlement does not include injunctive
or other relief that affects or relates to the rights or obligations of the
Indemnified Person).

          7.5     NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The indemnification provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of, and
shall not limit, any other rights or remedies to which any Indemnified Person
may be entitled or which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at
law or in equity.

          7.6     CONTINUING PROVISIONS. The indemnification provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall continue as to a Person
notwithstanding that such Person has ceased to meet the definition of
Indemnified Person as a result of a Transfer.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

               DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP; RESIGNATION OF A MEMBER

          8.1     DISSOLUTION EVENTS.

          (a)     The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of
additional or substitute Members pursuant to Article IX.

          (b)     The Company shall dissolve and commence winding up upon the
first to occur of any of the following events (each a "DISSOLUTION EVENT"):

                  (1)  the bankruptcy of either Managing Member, if the
     remaining Member or Members owning at least a majority of Percentage
     Interest owned by all the remaining Members decide in writing to dissolve
     the Company within 90 days after the occurrence of such event;

                  (2)  the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's
     assets;

                  (3)  the vote of the Management Committee pursuant to
     Section 6.5(b) (18);

                  (4)  the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to
     the Act;

                                       29
<Page>

          (c)     The death, retirement, resignation, expulsion or dissolution
of a Member or the occurrence of any other event that terminates the continued
membership of a Member of the Company shall not in and of itself cause a
dissolution of the Company.

          8.2     TERMINATION. Except in the case of the bankruptcy of the Tax
Matters Member, upon the dissolution of the Company, the Tax Matters Member
shall be the liquidating Member (the "LIQUIDATING MEMBER"). The Liquidating
Member shall wind up the business of the Company and terminate the Company as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and each of the following shall be
accomplished:

          (a)     The Liquidating Member shall cause to be prepared a statement
setting forth the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the date of
dissolution, a copy of which statement shall be furnished to all of the Members.

          (b)     The property and assets of the Company shall be liquidated by
the Liquidating Member as promptly as possible, but in an orderly and
businesslike and commercially reasonable manner. Except in the case of a sale of
all or substantially all of the Company's assets, the Liquidating Member (i)
shall not sell the GTC Contributed Assets, and (ii) may, in the exercise of its
business judgment and if commercially reasonable, determine not to sell all or
any portion of the property and assets of the Company, in which event such
property and assets shall be distributed in kind pursuant to subparagraphs
(d)(4) and (e) below.

          (c)     Any Net Profit or Net Loss realized by the Company upon the
sale or other disposition of its assets pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or deemed
realized pursuant to Section 8.2(e) shall be allocated as follows:

                  (1)  Net Loss shall be allocated first to Fresenius Kabi, up
     to the balance in its Capital Account and, thereafter, the balance to GTC;
     and

                  (2)  Net Profits shall be allocated to the Members in
     proportion to their Percentage Interests as of the time of liquidation.

          (d)     Upon the liquidation, sale or other disposition of the Company
or all or substantially all of its assets, the assets of the Company and any
proceeds thereof shall be applied and distributed as follows and in the
following order of priority:

                  (1)  To the payment of (x) the debts and liabilities of the
     Company and (y) the expenses of liquidation;

                  (2)  To the setting up of any reserves which the Liquidating
     Member shall determine to be reasonably necessary for contingent,
     unliquidated or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Company or the
     Members arising out of or in connection with the Company. Such reserves
     may, in the discretion of the Liquidating Member, be paid over to a
     national bank or national title company selected by it and authorized to
     conduct business as an escrowee to be held by such bank or title company as
     escrowee for the purposes of disbursing such reserves to satisfy the
     liabilities and obligations described above, and at the expiration of such
     period as the Liquidating Member may

                                       30
<Page>

     reasonably deem advisable, distribute any remaining balance in the manner
     set forth below;

                  (3)  If there is an in-kind distribution to be made of the GTC
     Contributed Assets (which distribution could, in part, be in the form of a
     termination of the licenses thereunder from GTC to the Company and
     consequent reversion of rights under such licenses to GTC), which the
     Company shall make upon GTC's request and not otherwise, such distribution
     to be made solely to GTC, subject to GTC's obligations under Section 8.3;

                  (4)  In the event a distribution is made to GTC pursuant to
     clause (3) above, the next assets available for distribution to be
     distributed to Fresenius Kabi until Fresenius Kabi shall have received a
     distribution in cash in an amount equal to the product of: (i) the Fair
     Market Value of any distribution made to GTC pursuant to clause (3),
     divided by GTC's Percentage Interest, multiplied by (ii) Fresenius Kabi's
     Percentage Interest; and then

                  (5)  To each Member in accordance with its Percentage
     Interest.

     No payment or distribution in any of the foregoing categories shall be made
until all payments in each prior category shall have been made in full. If the
payments due to be made in any of the foregoing categories exceed the remaining
assets available for such purpose, such payment shall be made to the Persons
entitled to receive the same pro rata in accordance with the respective amount
due them. Payments described in clause (5) above may be made in cash or in
assets of the Company in kind. Any asset distributed in kind pursuant to clause
(3) or (5) shall be valued at its Fair Market Value as determined by the
Management Committee, and for all purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as
if such asset had been sold at such value and the net cash proceeds therefrom
distributed to the Member to which the asset was distributed.

          (e)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, upon liquidation of the
Company, either Managing Member gives notice to the Management Committee that it
chooses to receive a distribution in kind of a Company asset (other than a GTC
Contributed Asset), the Management Committee shall determine the Fair Market
Value of such asset. The Company shall then distribute such asset to such
Managing Member in accordance with the principles of this Section 8.2 in lieu of
a cash distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of such distributed property;
PROVIDED, however, that if, upon calculation of the amount such Managing Member
is entitled to receive in a liquidating distribution, pursuant to this
Section 8.2, such amount is less than the Fair Market Value of the distributed
asset, such Member shall contribute to the Company an amount of cash equal to
the difference between the Fair Market Value of the distributed asset and the
amount to which such Member is entitled under this Section 8.2. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall a contribution or other payment under this
Section 8.2(e) be required of GTC with respect to a distribution to GTC pursuant
to Section 8.2(d)(3); the obligations of GTC with respect to such a
distribution, if any, shall be governed exclusively by Section 8.3.

                                       31

          8.3     CERTAIN CATCH-UP PAYMENTS.

          (a)     Upon liquidation of the Company, GTC shall have the following
obligations, which shall survive termination of this Agreement. If the Fair
Market Value of the assets distributed to Fresenius Kabi pursuant to
Section 8.2(d)(4) (the "ACTUAL FRESENIUS DISTRIBUTION") is less than the product
of: (i) the Fair Market Value of any distribution made to GTC pursuant to
8.2(d)(3), divided by GTC's Percentage Interest, and (ii) Fresenius Kabi's
Percentage Interest (the "OWED FRESENIUS DISTRIBUTION"), then GTC shall pay
Fresenius Kabi, in the manner set forth below, an amount (the "CATCH UP AMOUNT")
equal to the lesser of (x) the Owed Fresenius Distribution minus the Actual
Fresenius Distribution and (y) [****(*)]:

                  (1)  GTC shall pay to Fresenius Kabi royalties (the "ROYALTY
     PAYMENTS") equal to [****(*)]; and/or

                  (2)  GTC shall pay to Fresenius Kabi a portion of any
     royalties or proceeds (the "SHARED SALE PROCEEDS") received by GTC or an
     Affiliate in connection with the sale, license, sublicense or other
     disposition to a Third Party of its rights in and to the GTC Contributed
     Assets distributed pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(3) in whole or in part (a
     "DISPOSITION"), including any up-front, milestone, or other lump-sum
     payments received by GTC or an Affiliate in the Disposition, other than (1)
     any milestone or other payments received by GTC or an Affiliate that are in
     consideration for the provision of research and development services and
     (2) any payments for securities of GTC at their Fair Market Value as
     follows:

          (i) [****(*)] of any royalties received; and

          (ii) a percentage of the Shared Sale Proceeds equal to Fresenius
     Kabi's Percentage Interest in the Company as of the date of distribution
     except that in the case of any lump sum payment equal to the total
     consideration received in a Disposition, Fresneius Kabi shall be paid the
     entire outstanding Catch-Up Amount out of such payment.

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Royalty Payments and the Shared
Sale Proceeds, in the aggregate, exceed the Catch-Up Amount.

          (b)     For purposes of this Section 8.3, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

                  (1)  "NET SALES" shall mean the gross amounts received on the
     sale of a Royalty Bearing Product by GTC or any of its Affiliates to a
     non-Affiliate Distributor or End-User, less the following reasonable
     amounts: (a) customary trade, quantity or cash discounts or rebates allowed
     and actually taken; (b) amounts rebated, refunded or credited for rejected
     or returned Royalty Bearing Products or because of retroactive price
     reductions, rebates or chargebacks; (c) government mandated rebates and
     discount programs; (d) sales, use, turnover, excise taxes, or other
     governmental charges levied on

     or measured by sales, but not franchise or income taxes; and (e) customs
     duties, transportation, freight, shipping and handling charges, and
     insurance costs on shipments to customers. Transfer of a Royalty Bearing
     Product by GTC to an Affiliate, for resale shall not be considered a sale.
     "DISTRIBUTOR" shall mean a Person who buys a Royalty Bearing Product from
     GTC or any of its Affiliates and who sells such Royalty Bearing Product to
     an End User. "END USER" shall mean a purchaser of a Royalty Bearing Product
     whose use or sale of the Royalty Bearing Product results in its
     destruction, loss of activity, loss of resalability, and/or other loss of
     value.

     In the case of a Combination Product, Royalty Bearing Product Net Sales
shall mean the gross amount received by GTC or its Affiliates, on sales of the
Combination Product to a third party less the deductions set forth above,
multiplied by a proration factor that is determined as follows: (i) if all
components of the Combination Product were sold separately during the same or
immediately preceding calendar quarter, the proration factor shall be determined
by the formula [A / (A+B)], where A is the aggregate gross sales price of all
Royalty Bearing Product components during such period when sold separately from
the other active components, and B is the aggregate gross sales price of the
other active components during such period when sold separately from the Royalty
Bearing Product components; or (ii) if all components of the Combination Product
were not sold separately during the same or immediately preceding calendar
quarter, the proration factor shall be determined by the formula [C / (C+D)],
where C is the aggregate fully burdened cost of the Royalty Bearing Product
components during the prior calendar quarter and D is the aggregate fully
burdened cost of the other active components during the prior calendar quarter,
with such costs being determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. As used herein, "COMBINATION PRODUCT" means a product
that contains a Royalty Bearing Product as one component and at least one other
active component.

                  (2)  "ROYALTY BEARING PRODUCT" shall mean any product or
     service in the Field of Interest.

          (c)     For purposes of Sections 8.2 and 8.3, in any calculation
involving Percentage Interests such percentages shall be expressed as decimals.

          8.4     SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS, DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS. Termination,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company for any reason shall not
release any party from liability which at the time of such termination,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up already had accrued to any other party or
which thereafter may accrue in respect to any act or omission prior to such
termination, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

          8.5     NO RESIGNATIONS BY MEMBERS. Except as provided in Article IX,
no Member shall resign from the Company prior to the dissolution and winding up
of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

          9.2     RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. In the event that a Member (the "SELLING
MEMBER") desires to Transfer any or all of its Interest, such Selling Member
shall first deliver to GTC and Fresenius Kabi a written notice (the "TRANSFER
NOTICE") and a valuation analysis ("INDEPENDENT VALUATION") conducted by an
independent investment bank selected by Selling Member and reasonably acceptable
to the other Members (the "NON-SELLING MEMBERS"). Such Transfer Notice shall
specify the terms, including the portion of the Selling Member's Percentage
Interest to be sold ("OFFERED INTEREST") and the purchase price for the Offered
Interest which shall equal a pro rata portion of (based on Percentage Interest)
of the Independent Valuation. Each of the Non-Selling Members shall have the
right and option, at its sole discretion, for thirty (30) days after the later
of (i) delivery of the Transfer Notice or (ii) delivery of the Independent
Valuation, to accept all, but not less than all of its pro rata portion (based
on Percentage Interest) of the Offered Interest at a price equal to the pro rata
portion of the purchase price and other terms stated in the Transfer Notice (the
"RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER"), provided that all of the Offered Interest is accepted
by one or more Non-Selling Members. Such acceptance may be made by delivery of a
written notice to the Selling Member (the "EXERCISE NOTICE") within said thirty
(30) day period, which Exercise Notice shall set forth the maximum portion of
the Percentage Interest that such Non-Selling Member is willing to acquire. If
any Non-Selling Member does not exercise its Right of First Offer
("NON-EXERCISING MEMBER") the portion of the Offered Interest that such
Non-Exercising Member had a right to acquire may be acquired by the other
Non-Selling Members to the extent set forth in its Exercise Notice. If the
Non-Selling Members fail to exercise their Right of First Offer with respect to
the entire Offered Interest, the Selling Member shall be free to seek a third
party buyer to acquire the Offered Interest for a price no less than the
purchase price set forth in the Transfer Notice and on substantially similar
terms as those stated in the Transfer Notice at any time within 180 days after
the expiration of the aforementioned thirty (30) day period. In the event that
the Offered Interest is not sold to a third party at such price and on such
terms during such 180 day period, the right of the Selling Member to Transfer
such Offered Interest shall expire and the obligations of this Section 9.2 shall
be reinstated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Right of First Offer shall not
apply to and shall terminate immediately prior to a Qualified IPO.

          9.3     TRANSFERS TO THIRD PARTIES. Subject to Section 9.6, each
Member will have the right to Transfer all (but not less than all) its Interests
to any of its Affiliates upon the prior written consent of the other Members,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and such Transfer shall not be
subject to Section 9.2. No Member shall have the right to transfer its Interests
or its rights and obligations under any agreement to any unaffiliated third
party, subject to Section 9.4 and 9.2.

          9.4     EXIT STRATEGY. In the event that the Management Committee
determines that the forecasted business plan cannot support the continuation of
the Company or in any other situation if the Management Committee so decides,
the Management Committee shall begin consideration of an Exit Strategy. If the
Management Committee approves the pursuit of an Exit Strategy (other than
liquidation), and only upon such approval, then the consummation of such Exit
Strategy shall be subject to the following conditions:

                                       34
<Page>

          (a)     Any Managing Member initiating a Sale of the Company as an
Exit Strategy ("INITIATING MEMBER") to an unaffiliated third party ("PROSPECTIVE
BUYER") shall submit the terms and conditions of the proposed Sale of the
Company to the Management Committee for its approval. Such Sale of the Company
shall not be subject to Section 9.2. Upon receiving such approval, the
Initiating Member shall give written notice to the remaining Members
("NON-INITIATING MEMBERS") of such terms and conditions of the Sale of the
Company, including the purchase price ("PROSPECTIVE PURCHASE PRICE") and the
identity of the Prospective Buyer. Each of the Non-Initiating Members shall have
the right ("RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL") to purchase its pro rata portion (based on
Percentage Interest) of all (but not less than all) of the Initiating Member's
Interests for the Initiating Member's pro rata portion (based on Percentage
Interest) of the Prospective Purchase Price. Non-Initiating Members shall
exercise such right by delivering an Exercise Notice to the Initiating Member
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from Initiating Member. The
Exercise Notice shall set forth the maximum portion of the Initiating Member's
Interest that such Non-Initiating Member is willing to acquire from the
Initiating Member. If any Non-Initiating Member does not exercise its Right of
First Refusal, the portion of the Interest to which such Member had a right to
acquire, may be acquired by the other Non-Initiating Members on a pro rata basis
(based on Percentage Interests) to the extent set forth in its Exercise Notice.
If Non-Initiating Members fail to exercise their Right of First Refusal with
respect to Initiating Member's entire Interest, the Non-Initiating Members shall
be required to Transfer all of their Interests pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Sale of the Company to the Prospective Buyer.

          (b)     Any Member seeking to Transfer its entire Interest to a
Prospective Buyer (other than in connection with a Sale of the Company pursuant
to Section 9.4(a) above) shall be a Selling Member and shall be subject to the
Right of First Offer pursuant to Section 9.2 to the extent the Non-Selling
Members consist of one or both of GTC and Fresenius Kabi and solely with respect
to GTC and Fresenius Kabi. In the event that Fresenius Kabi and GTC (to the
extent they are Non-Selling Members) do not exercise their Right of First Offer,
the Selling Member may consummate such Transfer subject to the following:

                  (1)  The Selling Member shall give all Non-Selling Members the
     right to require that the sale by the Member be conditioned upon any
     Prospective Buyer acquiring the entire Interest of the Non-Selling Member
     ("TAG-ALONG SALE"). The Selling Member shall provide each Non-Selling
     Member with written notice ("TAG-ALONG SALE NOTICE") not less than thirty
     (30) days prior to the proposed date of the Tag-Along Sale (the "TAG-ALONG
     SALE DATE"). Each such Tag-Along Sale Notice shall be accompanied by an
     agreement relating to the Tag-Along Sale and shall set forth (i) the name
     and address of the Prospective Buyer, (ii) the proposed amount and form of
     consideration for the Interests and terms and conditions of payment offered
     by the Prospective Buyer, (iii) confirmation that the Prospective Buyer has
     been informed of the "TAG-ALONG RIGHTS" provided for herein and has agreed
     to purchase the Interests of Non-Selling Members in accordance with the
     terms hereof and (iv) the Tag-Along Sale Date. Any Non-Selling Member
     wishing to participate in the Tag-Along Sale shall provide written notice
     (the "TAG-ALONG NOTICE") to the Selling Member no less than fifteen (15)
     days prior to the Tag-Along Sale Date.

                                       35
<Page>

                  (2)  In the event that there is any material change in the
     material terms and conditions of such Tag-Along Sale after such Non-Selling
     Member gives its Tag-Along Notice, then notwithstanding anything herein to
     the contrary, such Non-Selling Member shall have the right to withdraw from
     participation in the Tag-Along Sale. If the Prospective Buyer does not
     consummate the purchase of all of the Interests requested to be included in
     the Tag-Along Sale by any Non-Selling Member on terms and conditions which
     are no more favorable in any material respect to the Selling Member, then
     the Selling Member shall not consummate the Tag-Along Sale of any of its
     Interest to the Prospective Buyer.

                  (3)  If a Tag-Along Notice from any Non-Selling Member is not
     received by the Selling Member prior to the fifteen (15) day period
     specified above, the Selling Member shall have the right to consummate the
     Tag-Along Sale without the participation of the Non-Selling Members, but
     only on terms and conditions which are no more favorable in any material
     respect to the Selling Member than as stated in the Tag-Along Sale Notice
     and only if such Tag-Along Sale occurs on a date within 180 days of the
     Tag-Along Sale Date. If such Tag-Along Sale does not occur within such 180
     day period, the Selling Member's Interest that was subject to such
     Tag-Along Sale shall thereafter continue to be subject to all of the
     restrictions contained in this Agreement.

          9.5     APPROVALS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article IX, no Transfer of Offered Interest will occur unless and until any and
all necessary Regulatory Approvals and third-party approvals have been obtained.
The Members agree to cooperate in the preparation and filing of any and all
reports or other submissions required in connection with obtaining such
Regulatory Approvals and in obtaining any necessary third-party approvals.

          9.6     RECOGNITION OF TRANSFER OF MEMBER INTERESTS; ADDITIONAL
MEMBERS. The Company may, from time to time, upon the approval of the Management
Committee admit additional Members in accordance with Section 6.5(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Transfer or
attempted Transfer of all or any portion of a Member's Interests will be valid
and no purchaser, assignee, transferee or other recipient (a "TRANSFEREE") of
such Interests and no additional Member will be admitted as a Member of the
Company unless (i) in the case of Transferee, such Transfer is in accordance
with this Article IX, (ii) such Transferee or such additional Member shall have
executed and delivered to the Company a counterpart of this Agreement and such
other documents or agreements as shall be reasonably requested by the Company to
confirm such Transferee's or such additional Member's admission as a Member and
its agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as such Agreement may
be amended, modified or supplemented as the Management Committee may deem
reasonably appropriate to reflect a change or modification of the Company or of
the respective Members hereunder, including such adjustment to Percentage
Interest and in Capital Accounts as may be required), (iii) to the extent
applicable, any Person that ultimately controls such Transferee will have
executed such documents or agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to
each such Member, as will be necessary to confirm such Person's agreement to be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the transferor and to
effectuate the assumption by such Person of the rights and obligations of such
transferor under this Agreement, (iv) in the case of additional Members, their
making contributions to the capital of the Company, to the extent provided
herein or otherwise required by the Management Committee and (v) in the case of

                                       36
<Page>

Transferee, such Transfer would not, in the opinion of counsel to the Company,
jeopardize the status of the Company as a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes. Upon the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, such
Transferee and additional Member will be admitted to the Company as a Member and
will be listed in the books and records of the Company as a Member, and the
Transferee will succeed to the rights and obligations of the transferor Member
under this Agreement. Immediately following such admission, the transferor will
cease to be a Member of the Company. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company and the Management Committee shall be entitled to
treat the transferor of Interests as the absolute owner thereof in all respects,
and shall incur no liability for distributions made in good faith to the
transferor, until such time as a Transfer meeting all of the requirements of
this Article IX has been made.

          9.7     BUYBACK RIGHT.

          (a)     [****(*)]

          (b)     [****(*)]

          (c)     The Buyback Right shall not be subject to the Right of First
Offer pursuant to Section 9.2. The Buyback Right may be exercised multiple times
so long as the condition set forth in Section 9.7(a) is satisfied at the time of
such exercise.

          (d)     The Buyback Right is transferable to Affiliates of the
Managing Members. Except for such transfers, the Buyback Right of a Managing
Member is only transferable with the written consent of the other Managing
Member and expires on a Transfer by a Managing Member of its entire Percentage
Interest without such consent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

             MEMBER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; MEMBER COVENANTS

          11.1    MEMBER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. As of the date hereof
(or the date of execution of this Agreement if a Member admitted after the date
hereof), each Member, solely with respect to itself, represents and warrants to
all other Members as follows:

          (a)     The Member (i) has been duly organized and is a validly
existing corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or general
partnership, and if applicable, is in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and (ii) has full power and authority to enter
into and perform this Agreement.

          (b)     This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by it and constitutes its valid and binding obligations, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Laws and equitable principles relating to or limiting creditors' rights
generally.

          11.2    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. For as long as a Member has any
Interest in the Company, such Member and its Affiliates shall not directly or
indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, finance or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, any Person other than the
Company which is engaged in the development, manufacture, use, marketing, sale
and commercialization of rhSA and products derived from or utilizing rhSA
(excluding fusion proteins) for both Therapeutic Uses and Non-Therapeutic Uses
(such business, "FIELD OF INTEREST") other than for the benefit of the Company
in accordance with the terms of a Service Arrangement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 11.2, Members may own no more than five percent (5%)
of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded company that acquires,
owns, develops, manages, operates, controls, participates in the management or
control of, maintains, or continues an interest in a Competing Business. If the
provisions of this Section 11.2 should ever be determined by a court of law to
exceed the time or geographic limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be deemed reformed to the maximum time or geographic
limitations permitted by applicable law. In the event of a breach by any Member
of the terms of this Section 11.2, any other Member and any of its Affiliates
shall be entitled to institute legal proceedings to obtain damages for any such
breach or to obtain the specific performance of this Agreement by such Member
and to enjoin such Member from any further violation of this Section 11.2 and to
exercise such remedies cumulatively or in conjunction with all other rights and
remedies provided by law.

          11.3    FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.

          (a)     Any Invention or Improvement that is made, conceived or
reduced to practice by or on behalf of the Company, or by or on behalf of a
Managing Member in the course of a Managing Member providing services to the
Company pursuant to a written agreement or arrangement (including, without
limitation, pursuant to their respective Service Agreements) (a "SERVICE
ARRANGEMENT"), shall be the exclusive property of the Company, and the Managing
Members hereby assign and agree to assign all of their rights, title and
interest in and to any such

                                       39
<Page>

Inventions or Improvements to the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
Invention or Improvement that has application outside of the Field of Interest
shall: (i) be owned by GTC if GTC was the Managing Member providing such
services and such Invention or Improvement relates to the GTC Core Business; or
(ii) be owned by Fresnius Kabi if Fresenius Kabi was the Managing Member
providing such services and such Invention or Improvement relates to the
Fresnius Core Business. If any such Invention or Improvement not covered by
clauses (i) or (ii), above, has applicability outside of the Field of Interest,
then the Company shall, upon the written request of the Managing Member that
made such Invention/Improvement, grant such Managing Member a fully-paid,
royalty-free, worldwide, nonexclusive right and license, with the right to grant
sublicenses, in and to such Invention/Improvement, for use outside the Field of
Interest only, and shall provide access to any data or materials related to such
Invention/Improvement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such Invention/Improvement:
(iii) is made by Fresenius but relates to the GTC Core Business, the Company
shall instead grant such a license exclusively to GTC; or (iv) is made by GTC
but relates to the Fresenius Core Business, the Company shall instead grant such
a license exclusively to Fresenius. The Company and the Managing Members hereby
covenant and agree that any such Service Arrangements shall contain terms and
conditions consistent with all of the foregoing.

          (b)     If a Member of the Company makes, conceives or reduces to
practice, any Invention or Improvement that may have applicability within the
Field of Interest, other than pursuant to a Services Arrangement, then such
Member (the "INVENTING MEMBER"), shall own all right, title and interest in such
Invention and/or Improvement, but shall immediately notify the Company and the
Managing Members (other than the Inventing Member, the "NON-INVENTING MANAGING
MEMBERS"). If requested by any Non-Inventing Managing Member, or by the Company,
then the Inventing Member shall grant to the Company a fully-paid, royalty-free,
worldwide, exclusive right and license, with the right to grant sublicenses, in
and to such Invention and Improvement, for use within the Field of Interest
only, and shall provide the Company access to any data or materials related to
such Invention or Improvement. The Inventing Member shall further notify the
Company and the Non-Inventing Managing Members immediately of a decision to file
a patent application with respect to such Invention or Improvement.

          (c)     For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
foregoing, it is the intention of the Company and the Members to make available
to the Company, by ownership, license or sublicense, all Inventions and
Improvements within the Field of Interest including, without limitation, any
such Inventions or Improvements made by a Member or by a third party service
provider.

          11.4    NO FURTHER OBLIGATIONS. NEITHER MANAGING MEMBER SHALL BE
LIABLE OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FURTHER CAPITAL OR OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS,
FUNDING, FINANCING, GUARANTEES OR TAX OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DEBTS OR
LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY. TO THAT END, NONE OF THE COMPANY, FRESENIUS KABI, OR
GTC SHALL HAVE THE POWER OR AUTHORITY TO FORCE, COMPEL OR REQUIRE FRESENIUS KABI
OR GTC TO MAKE ANY FURTHER CAPITAL OR OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS, PROVIDE FUNDING,
FINANCING OR GUARANTEES, OR TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TAX OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS, DEBTS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY.

          12.2    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

          (a)     Each party shall keep in strict confidence and secrecy all of
the Confidential Information of the other parties and shall not disclose the
same to any person or firm whatsoever during the term of this Agreement and for
a period of five (5) years thereafter, unless such Confidential Information
becomes public knowledge through no act or fault on the part of such party,
except that either party may disclose Confidential Information or any part
thereof,

                  (1)  Subject to the limitations set forth below, to its
     subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and agents for the purpose of
     performing its obligations hereunder; or

                  (2)  Pursuant to compulsory legal process or as may otherwise
     be required by applicable Law, but only after having made reasonable
     efforts to secure the court's or other Governmental Entity's order to limit
     production, use and disclosure of said information for the purposes of the
     proceeding and to the narrowest class of disclosure practicable under the
     circumstances.

          (b)     Each party agrees to limit the above-contemplated disclosure
of Confidential Information to only those of its directors, officers, employees
and authorized agents who need to know and whose access to such information is
necessary for the proper discharge of such party's functions and
responsibilities under this Agreement, and further agrees to take all reasonable
safeguards so as to protect the secret and proprietary nature of such
information and to prevent the unauthorized use, reproduction, disclosure or
other dissemination thereof. Prior to disclosing any Confidential Information of
a party hereto, or any part thereof to any of its authorized agents, or to
permitted researchers, the party intending to make such disclosure shall obtain
from each such person an agreement in which such person agrees to keep in strict
confidence and secrecy all of the information disclosed to him or her under the
provisions of this clause. Each party shall be responsible for the disclosure of
any Confidential Information contrary to the provisions of this Section 12.2 by
its directors, officers, employees, authorized agents, and permitted
researchers.

<Page>

          (c)     The provisions of this Section 12.2 shall not apply to the
extent of and under the following conditions: (i) the information is
subsequently otherwise legally acquired by a party hereto from a third party
whose disclosure thereof is not in any breach of any applicable confidentiality
obligation; (ii) the information is in or comes into the public domain or is or
becomes generally known in the industry otherwise than by a breach of this
Agreement or any other applicable confidentiality obligation, (iii) prior to
disclosure under this Agreement, the information was already in the possession
of the receiving Member or its Affiliates, provided that such information was
not obtained directly or indirectly from the other party under this Agreement in
confidence; or (iv) the information can be shown by written documents to have
been independently developed by the receiving Member or its Affiliates without
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any
material disclosure under (i) or (ii) occurs, such party shall after receiving
knowledge thereof promptly notify the other parties of the occurrence of such
event.

          (d)     The parties shall not disclose any material information about
this Agreement without the consent of the other parties. Consent shall not be
required, however, for disclosures to tax authorities, provided, that in
connection with such disclosure, each party agrees to use its reasonable efforts
to secure confidential treatment of such information. Each party shall have the
further right to disclose the terms of this Agreement (i) as required by
applicable Law, including the rules and regulations promulgated by the Frankfurt
Securities and Exchange Commission or the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, provided the
disclosing party provides to the other parties a copy of the information to be
disclosed and subject to the remainder of this clause (d), an opportunity to
comment thereon not less than 5 Business Days (or such shorter period as may be
available under applicable Law) prior to such disclosure, and (ii) to
underwriters, investment, merchant or commercial bankers and financial advisors
in connection with due diligence investigations of the party by any such person.
Any copy of this Agreement required to be disclosed pursuant to item (i) of the
previous sentence shall be redacted to delete Confidential Information to the
maximum extent permitted by Law or the rules of the organizations referred to
therein. If any party determines that a release of such regulatory authority is
required by law it shall, to the extent practicable in light of legal
requirements relating to such release, notify the other parties in writing as
soon as practicable prior to the time of the proposed release. At the other
party's request and before the release (if time permits under applicable Law),
the party seeking disclosure shall consult with the other parties on the
necessity of such disclosure and the text of the proposed release. Nothing in
this Section 12.2 shall preclude the disclosure of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to the respective boards of directors or
management committees of the parties for the purpose of obtaining corporate
authorization of this Agreement and such transactions.

          (e)     Each party acknowledges that any violation by it of its
obligations under this Section 12.2 may cause irreparable injury to the other
party for which damages may not be adequate compensation. Therefore, in addition
to all other remedies available at law or in equity, the non-violating party
will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event of a violation or
threatened violation of this Section 12.2 by the other party.

          12.3    USE OF NAMES. Neither of Fresenius Kabi nor GTC shall use the
name of the other party in any advertising or any form of publicity, including
press releases, without the prior written consent of the other party.

          12.4    ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NON-WAIVER. This Agreement and any other
agreement entered into contemporaneously herewith constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof, and supersede all other prior agreements or undertakings
with respect thereto, both written and oral. No delay on the part of any party
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any waiver, express or implied, by any party of any right hereunder or of any
failure to perform or breach hereof by any other party constitute or be deemed a
waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other failure to perform or breach
hereof by the same or any other Member, whether of a similar or dissimilar
nature thereof.

          12.5    AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Any provision of the Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by all of the Managing Members and any
other Member which would be materially adversely affected by such amendment, or,
in the case of a waiver, by the party or parties against whom the waiver is to
be effective; PROVIDED that this Agreement shall be deemed amended from time to
time to reflect the admission of any new Member and the adjustment of the
Percentage Interests of the Members resulting from any Transfer, capital
contribution or otherwise, in each case that is made in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

          12.6    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, their
respective successors and permitted assigns and, to the extent provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Persons and, except as otherwise expressly
contemplated herein, nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be
construed to give any other Person any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

          12.7    RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. Any dispute arising in connection with
this Agreement that is not resolved pursuant to Section 6.7, including any
question regarding its existence, validity or termination, is to be referred to
and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of the Arbitration Court of
the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris (France), which rules are deemed to
be incorporated by reference into this clause, and except for (a) proceedings
commenced to enforce an arbitration award and (b) proceedings commenced for
specific performance of Sections 11.2 and 12.2, each party hereby irrevocably
waives its right to commence any proceedings in any court with respect to any
matter arising under this Agreement. The tribunal shall consist of a sole
arbitrator appointed jointly by the parties. In the case of the parties failing
to choose a sole arbitrator, the tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators,
two of whom shall be appointed by the respective parties and the third
arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the first two, all three of whom shall
be lawyers. The place of arbitration shall be the location of the defendant in
any proceeding or such other location as the parties shall jointly agree. The
language of the arbitration shall be English. No arbitrator shall be an
Affiliate, employee, officer or director of either party or of their respective
Affiliates, nor shall any Arbitrator have any interest that would be affected in
any material respect by the outcome of the dispute. The decision of the sole
arbitrator or of a majority of the arbitrators, where applicable, shall be final
and binding on the parties and their respective successors and assigns. The
decision shall not be subject to appeal or judicial review except in
circumstances of fraud. The tribunal shall determine the proportions in which
the parties shall pay the costs of the tribunal.

          12.8    FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the Members hereby agrees to
execute and deliver all such other and additional instruments and documents and
to do such other acts and things, at the request of the Management Committee, as
may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes
of this Agreement.

          12.9    APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to conflicts of law principles.

          12.10   SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall survive
to the extent it is not so declared, and the validity, legality and
enforceability of the other provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby, unless such action would substantially impair the benefits
to the parties of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

          12.11   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
