                                                           For immediate release
                                                               February 14, 2003

        Toyota to Introduce Lexus Brand and Revise Sales Network in Japan

Tokyo--TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION (TMC) announced today a new product and
distribution strategy that outlines the introduction of the Lexus brand to Japan
and the reorganization of TMC's Japanese-market Toyota-brand sales channels into
four channels from the current five.

This new product and distribution strategy is aimed at allowing TMC to
adequately respond to future changes in consumer values and in the structure of
Japan's highly competitive automobile market.

Specifically, the new strategy entails:
     1.   the establishment in Japan of the Lexus brand--apart from the Toyota
          brand--as a "global premium brand for the 21st century"
     2.   the merging of the Netz and Vista sales channels to form a new Netz
          channel capable of addressing the desires of the growing segment of
          "new value" consumers, while keeping in mind the needs of current
          customers
     3.   the reinforcement of the identities of the Toyota, Toyopet and Corolla
          sales channels and a review of their product lineups

In recent years, new consumer values that increasingly emphasize a "sense of the
best", as well as individuality, have led to vast changes in the automobile
market. These changes represent a trend that is advancing on a global scale,
intensifying competition among the world's automakers in how well they can
respond to evolving consumer demand.

Japan, in particular, is thought to be at the forefront of such evolution due to
its low birthrate, rapidly aging society and other factors, which are said to be
bringing on market-structure changes at a pace greater than that in any other
industrially developed nation. This means that response to such changes in Japan
is becoming viewed as an important factor in terms of being globally
competitive.

                                                                        More...

Under its new product and distribution strategy, TMC plans to put full effort
into creating a global premium brand by introducing to the Japanese market the
Lexus brand, which is already well established in the United States.
Additionally, it intends to proactively respond to market changes by
restructuring its domestic sales network--such as through establishing a new
Netz channel and other measures--into one with a more future-looking stance.

Together with its "the customer always comes first" policy, TMC intends to use
the new strategy to steadily maintain a non-minivehicle market share of more
than 40% and to secure an even greater market share in the mid to long term.

Details of the new product and distribution strategy are as follows:
