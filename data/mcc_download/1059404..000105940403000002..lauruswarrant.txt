have been  issued in exchange  for or in  replacement  of Common  Stock or Other
Securities pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise.

          (d) The term "EXERCISE PRICE" shall be $___ per share [100% of closing

          1. EXERCISE OF WARRANT.  1.1 Number of Shares  Issuable upon Exercise.
From and after the date hereof  through and including the  Expiration  Date, the
Holder shall be entitled to receive,  upon  exercise of this Warrant in whole or
in part, by delivery of an original or fax copy of the exercise  notice attached
hereto  as  Exhibit A (the  "EXERCISE  NOTICE"),  shares of Common  Stock of the
Company,  subject to  adjustment  pursuant to Section 4. 1.2 Fair Market  Value.

"DETERMINATION DATE") shall mean:

(a) If the  Company's  Common Stock is traded on an exchange or is quoted on the
National Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc. Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ")

price,  respectively,  reported for the last business day immediately  preceding
the Determination Date.

(b) If the Company's  Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or on the NASDAQ
National  Market or the  NASDAQ  SmallCap  Market  but is traded on the NASD OTC
Bulletin Board or BBX Exchange,  then the mean of the average of the closing bid
and asked prices  reported for the last business day  immediately  preceding the
Determination Date.

(c) Except as provided in clause (d) below, if the Company's Common Stock is not
publicly  traded,  then as the Holder and the Company agree or in the absence of
agreement  by  arbitration  in  accordance  with the rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association, before a single arbitrator to be chosen from a
panel of persons qualified by education and training to pass on the matter to be
decided.

(d) If the  Determination  Date is the  date of a  liquidation,  dissolution  or
winding up, or any event deemed to be a  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up
pursuant to the Company's  charter,  then all amounts to be payable per share to
holders  of the  Common  Stock  pursuant  to the  charter  in the  event of such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus all other amounts to be payable per
share in respect of the Common Stock in liquidation under the charter,  assuming
for the  purposes of this clause (d) that all of the shares of Common Stock then
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are outstanding at the Determination Date.

2. PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE.

2.1 Delivery of Stock  Certificates,  etc. on Exercise.  The Company agrees that
the shares of Common Stock  purchased  upon  exercise of this  Warrant  shall be
deemed to be issued to the Holder as the record  owner of such  shares as of the
close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been  surrendered
and payment made for such shares as aforesaid.  As soon as practicable after the
exercise of this Warrant in full or in part,  and in any event within 3 business
days thereafter,  the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any
applicable  issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to
the Holder,  or as such Holder  (upon  payment by such holder of any  applicable
transfer  taxes) may direct in compliance  with  applicable  securities  laws, a
certificate or  certificates  for the number of duly and validly  issued,  fully
paid and  nonassessable  shares of Common Stock (or Other  Securities)  to which
such Holder shall be entitled on such exercise,  plus, in lieu of any fractional
share to which such  holder  would  otherwise  be  entitled,  cash equal to such
fraction  multiplied  by the then Fair Market Value of one full share,  together
with any other stock or other  securities and property  (including  cash,  where
applicable)  to which such Holder is  entitled  upon such  exercise  pursuant to
Section 1 or otherwise.

2.2      Exercise.
         --------
(a)  Payment  may be made either in (i) cash or by  certified  or official  bank
check  payable to the order of the  Company  equal to the  applicable  aggregate
Exercise  Price,  (ii) by delivery of the Warrant,  Common  Stock and/or  Common
Stock  receivable  upon exercise of the Warrant in  accordance  with Section (b)
below, or (iii) by a combination of any of the foregoing methods, for the number
of Common  Shares  specified  in such  form (as such  exercise  number  shall be
adjusted to reflect any adjustment in the total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable  to the holder  per the terms of this  Warrant)  and the  Holder  shall
thereupon be entitled to receive the number of duly authorized,  validly issued,
fully-paid  and  non-assessable  shares  of Common  Stock (or Other  Securities)
determined as provided herein.

(b)  Notwithstanding  any provisions herein to the contrary,  if the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock is greater  than the  Exercise  Price (at the
date of calculation as set forth below),  in lieu of exercising this Warrant for
cash,  the Holder may elect to receive  shares equal to the value (as determined
below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being  exercised) by surrender of
this Warrant at the principal  office of the Company  together with the properly
endorsed  Exercise Notice in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a
number of shares of Common Stock computed using the following formula:

                  X=Y (A-B)

          A

          Where X= the  number of  shares  of  Common  Stock to be issued to the
Holder

          Y= the number of shares of Common Stock  purchasable under the Warrant
          or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being  exercised,  the portion
          of the Warrant being exercised (at the date of such calculation)

          A= the Fair Market  Value of one share of the  Company's  Common Stock
          (at the date of such calculation)

          B= Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)

3.       EFFECT OF REORGANIZATION, ETC.; ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE.

3.1 Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case at any time or from time
to time, the Company shall (a) effect a reorganization,  (b) consolidate with or
merge into any other  person,  or (c) transfer all or  substantially  all of its
properties  or  assets  to any  other  person  under  any  plan  or  arrangement
contemplating  the  dissolution  of the Company,  then,  in each such case, as a
condition  to the  consummation  of  such a  transaction,  proper  and  adequate
provision  shall be made by the Company  whereby the Holder of this Warrant,  on
the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1 at any time after the  consummation
of such  reorganization,  consolidation  or merger or the effective date of such
dissolution,  as the case may be, shall receive, in lieu of the Common Stock (or
Other  Securities)  issuable on such exercise prior to such consummation or such
effective date, the stock and other securities and property  (including cash) to
which  such  Holder  would  have  been  entitled  upon such  consummation  or in
connection  with such  dissolution,  as the case may be, if such  Holder  had so
exercised  this  Warrant,  immediately  prior  thereto,  all  subject to further
adjustment thereafter as provided in Section 4. 3.2 Dissolution. In the event of
any  dissolution of the Company  following the transfer of all or  substantially
all of its properties or assets, the Company,  prior to such dissolution,  shall
at its expense  deliver or cause to be delivered the stock and other  securities
and property (including cash, where applicable)  receivable by the Holder of the
Warrant after the effective date of such dissolution  pursuant to Section 3.1 to
a bank or trust company having its principal  office in New York, NY, as trustee
for  the  Holder  of  the  Warrant.   3.3   Continuation  of  Terms.   Upon  any
reorganization, consolidation, merger or transfer (and any dissolution following
any transfer) referred to in this Section 3, this Warrant shall continue in full
force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the shares of stock
and other  securities  and property  receivable  on the exercise of this Warrant
after the  consummation of such  reorganization,  consolidation or merger or the
effective date of dissolution  following any such transfer,  as the case may be,
and shall be  binding  upon the  issuer of any such  stock or other  securities,
including,  in the  case of any  such  transfer,  the  person  acquiring  all or
substantially  all of the  properties  or assets of the Company,  whether or not
such person shall have  expressly  assumed the terms of this Warrant as provided
in Section  4. In the event this  Warrant  does not  continue  in full force and
effect after the consummation of the  transactions  described in this Section 3,
then only in such event will the Company's  securities  and property  (including
cash, where applicable) receivable by the holders of the Warrant be delivered to
the Trustee as contemplated by Section 3.2.

3.4  Adjustment of Warrant  Exercise Price and Number of Shares upon Issuance of
Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the date hereof, the Company issues or
sells,  or is  deemed  to have  issued  or sold,  any  shares  of  Common  Stock
(including  the  issuance or sale of shares of Common  Stock owned or held by or
for the account of the Company) for a consideration  per share less than a price
(the "APPLICABLE PRICE") equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to such issuance or sale, then immediately after such issue or sale the Exercise
Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount  equal to such  consideration
per  share.  If the  Company  in any  manner  issues  or sells  any  convertible
securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is
issuable  upon such  conversion,  exchange or exercise  thereof is less than the
Applicable  Price,  then  such  share of  Common  Stock  shall be  deemed  to be
outstanding  and to have been  issued and sold by the Company at the time of the
issuance or sale of such  convertible  securities for such price per share.  For
the purposes of this section, the "lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is issuable upon such  conversion,  exchange or exercise"  shall be
equal to the sum of the lowest  amounts of  consideration  (if any)  received or
receivable  by the Company  with  respect to one share of Common  Stock upon the
issuance or sale of the convertible  security and upon  conversion,  exchange or
exercise of such  convertible  security.  No further  adjustment of the Exercise
Price  shall  be made  upon  the  actual  issuance  of such  Common  Stock  upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of such convertible securities, and if any such
issue  or sale of such  convertible  securities  is made  upon  exercise  of any
options for which  adjustment  of the Exercise  Price had been or are to be made
pursuant to other  provisions  of this  section,  no further  adjustment  of the
Exercise Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

4.  EXTRAORDINARY  EVENTS  REGARDING COMMON STOCK. In the event that the Company
shall (a) issue  additional  shares of the Common  Stock as a dividend  or other
distribution on outstanding  Common Stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding  shares
of Common Stock, or (c) combine its outstanding  shares of the Common Stock into
a smaller  number of shares of the Common Stock,  then, in each such event,  the
Exercise  Price  shall,  simultaneously  with the  happening  of such event,  be
adjusted by multiplying the then Exercise Price by a fraction,  the numerator of
which  shall be the  number of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  immediately
prior to such event and the  denominator  of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock  outstanding  immediately  after such event,  and the product so
obtained  shall  thereafter be the Exercise  Price then in effect.  The Exercise
Price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening
of any successive event or events described herein in this Section 4. The number
of shares of Common Stock that the holder of this Warrant shall  thereafter,  on
the  exercise  hereof as provided in Section 1, be entitled to receive  shall be
increased or  decreased  to a number  determined  by  multiplying  the number of
shares of Common  Stock that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator
is the  Exercise  Price that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Exercise Price in effect
on the date of such exercise.

5. CERTIFICATE AS TO ADJUSTMENTS. In each case of any adjustment or readjustment
in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities)  issuable on the exercise of
the Warrant,  the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial
Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment
in accordance  with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a  certificate  setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is based,  including a statement  of (a) the
consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of
Common Stock (or Other Securities)  issued or sold or deemed to have been issued
or sold,  (b) the  number  of shares  of  Common  Stock  (or  Other  Securities)
outstanding  or deemed to be  outstanding,  and (c) the  Exercise  Price and the
number of shares of Common Stock to be received  upon  exercise of this Warrant,
in effect  immediately  prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted
or  readjusted as provided in this Warrant.  The Company will  forthwith  mail a
copy of each such certificate to the holder of the Warrant and any Warrant agent
of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

6. RESERVATION OF STOCK, ETC. ISSUABLE ON EXERCISE OF WARRANT.  The Company will
at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery on the
exercise of the Warrant,  shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time
to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant.

7.  ASSIGNMENT;  EXCHANGE  OF WARRANT.  Subject to  compliance  with  applicable
securities  laws,  this  Warrant,  and  the  rights  evidenced  hereby,  may  be
transferred by any registered holder hereof (a "TRANSFEROR") with respect to any
or all of the Shares.  On the surrender  for exchange of this Warrant,  with the
Transferor's  endorsement  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  B  attached  hereto  (the
"TRANSFEROR   ENDORSEMENT   FORM")  and  together   with   evidence   reasonably
satisfactory to the Company demonstrating  compliance with applicable securities
laws,  which  shall  include,  without  limitation,  a legal  opinion  from  the
Transferor's  counsel  that  such  transfer  is  exempt  from  the  registration
requirements of applicable  securities laws, the Company at its expense but with
payment by the  Transferor  of any  applicable  transfer  taxes)  will issue and
deliver  to or on the  order of the  Transferor  thereof a new  Warrant  of like
tenor, in the name of the Transferor and/or the transferee(s)  specified in such
Transferor  Endorsement Form (each a "Transferee"),  calling in the aggregate on
the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock called for on
the  face  or  faces  of  the  Warrant  so  surrendered  by the  Transferor.  8.
REPLACEMENT OF WARRANT.  On receipt of evidence  reasonably  satisfactory to the
Company of the loss,  theft,  destruction  or mutilation of this Warrant and, in
the case of any such loss, theft or destruction of this Warrant,  on delivery of
an indemnity agreement or security reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to
the  Company  or,  in  the  case  of  any  such  mutilation,  on  surrender  and
cancellation  of this  Warrant,  the  Company at its  expense  will  execute and
deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

9.  REGISTRATION  RIGHTS.  The Holder of this Warrant has been  granted  certain
registration rights by the Company. These registration rights are set forth in a
Registration  Rights Agreement  entered into by the Company and Purchaser of the
Company's  Convertible  Note (the  "NOTE") at or prior to the issue date of this
Warrant. 10. MAXIMUM EXERCISE. The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this
Warrant on an exercise date, in connection  with that number of shares of Common
Stock  which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock  beneficially  owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise date,
and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made on
an exercise date,  which would result in beneficial  ownership by the Holder and
its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the  outstanding  shares of Common Stock of
the Company on such date.  For the  purposes  of the proviso to the  immediately
preceding sentence,  beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Regulation
13d-3 thereunder.  Subject to the foregoing,  the Holder shall not be limited to
aggregate  exercises which would result in the issuance of more than 4.99%.  The
restriction described in this paragraph may be revoked upon 75 days prior notice
from the Holder to the Company and is automatically  null and void upon an Event
of Default under the Note.

11. WARRANT AGENT.  The Company may, by written notice to the each holder of the
Warrant,  appoint an agent for the  purpose of  issuing  Common  Stock (or Other
Securities)  on the exercise of this Warrant  pursuant to Section 1,  exchanging
this  Warrant  pursuant to Section 7, and  replacing  this  Warrant  pursuant to
Section 8, or any of the foregoing,  and thereafter any such issuance,  exchange
or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such agent.

12.  TRANSFER ON THE COMPANY'S  BOOKS.  Until this Warrant is transferred on the
books of the Company,  the Company may treat the registered holder hereof as the
absolute  owner  hereof  for all  purposes,  notwithstanding  any  notice to the
contrary.

13. NOTICES,  ETC. All notices and other  communications from the Company to the
Holder of this Warrant  shall be mailed by first class  registered  or certified
mail, postage prepaid, at such address as may have been furnished to the Company
in writing by such holder or, until any such Holder  furnishes to the Company an
address, then to, and at the address of, the last Holder of this Warrant who has
so furnished an address to the Company. 14. VOLUNTARY ADJUSTMENT BY THE COMPANY.
The  Company  may at any time  during the term of this  Warrant  reduce the then
current  Exercise  Price  to any  amount  and for  any  period  of  time  deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company.

15.  MISCELLANEOUS.  This  Warrant and any term  hereof may be changed,  waived,
discharged  or terminated  only by an instrument in writing  signed by the party
against which  enforcement of such change,  waiver,  discharge or termination is
sought.  This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance  with the
laws of State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any
action brought concerning the transactions contemplated by this Warrant shall be
brought only in the state courts of New York or in the federal courts located in
the state of New York;  provided,  however,  that the Holder may choose to waive
this  provision  and  bring  an  action  outside  the  state  of New  York.  The
individuals  executing  this Warrant on behalf of the Company agree to submit to
the  jurisdiction  of such courts and waive trial by jury. The prevailing  party
shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney's fees
and  costs.  In the event  that any  provision  of this  Warrant  is  invalid or
unenforceable  under any applicable  statute or rule of law, then such provision
shall be deemed  inoperative  to the extent that it may conflict  therewith  and
shall be deemed  modified to conform  with such statute or rule of law. Any such
provision  which  may prove  invalid  or  unenforceable  under any law shall not
affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other  provision of this Warrant.
The headings in this Warrant are for purposes of reference  only,  and shall not
limit  or  otherwise  affect  any  of  the  terms  hereof.   The  invalidity  or
unenforceability  of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability  of any other  provision.  The  Company  acknowledges  that legal
counsel  participated  in  the  preparation  of  this  Warrant  and,  therefore,
stipulates  that the rule of  construction  that  ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting  party shall not be applied in the  interpretation  of this
Warrant to favor any party against the other party.
