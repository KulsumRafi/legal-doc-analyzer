stated in Section&nbsp;6, the parties hereto have chosen New York law to apply

expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower and Lender at all

times to comply strictly with the applicable laws including, without

limitation, the laws of the State of New York (and any other State law, if for

any reason a court should follow such law (including without limitation Texas)

notwithstanding the parties express intention to follow New York law),

governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on the Notes or the

Related Indebtedness (or applicable United States federal law to the extent

that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a

greater amount of interest than under any applicable state law).&#160; If the applicable law is ever judicially

interpreted so as to render usurious any amount (i) contracted for, charged,

taken, reserved or received pursuant to any of the Notes, any of the other

documents executed in connection therewith or as security therefore including

the Guaranty and this Agreement (the &#147;Loan Documents&#148;), or any other

communication or writing by or between Borrower and Lender related to the

transaction or transactions that are the subject matter of the Loan Documents,

(ii) contracted for, charged or received by reason of Lender&#146;s exercise of the

option to accelerate the maturity of any of the Notes and/or the Related

Indebtedness, or (iii) Borrower will have paid or Lender will have received by

reason of any voluntary prepayment by Borrower of any of the Notes and/or the

Related Indebtedness, then it is Borrower&#146;s and Lender&#146;s express intent that

all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate shall be automatically

cancelled, ab initio, and all amounts in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate

theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of

any of the Notes and/or the Related Indebtedness (or, if the Notes and all

Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower),

and the provisions of the Notes and the other Loan Documents immediately be

deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder

reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to

comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest

amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder; provided, however, if any

of the Notes have been paid in full before the end of the stated term of any of

the applicable Notes, then Borrower and Lender agree that Lender shall, with

reasonable promptness after Lender discovers or is advised by Borrower that

interest was received in an amount in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, either

refund such excess interest to Borrower and/or credit such excess interest

against the Notes and/or any Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower to

Lender.&#160; Borrower hereby agrees that as

a condition precedent to any claim seeking usury penalties against Lender, Borrower

will provide written notice to Lender, advising Lender in reasonable detail of

the nature and amount of the violation, and Lender shall have sixty (60) days

after receipt of such notice in </font></h1>

and nonpayment and/or nonperformance any Borrower under any Loan Agreement

hereunder, of presentment, protest, and demand, and of all other matters to

which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled. Guarantor further agrees that this

Guaranty shall remain and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any

renewal, modification, or extension of any Loan Agreement (but not increases

thereof). Guarantor hereby expressly waives all notice of and consents to any

such renewal, modification, or extension, and to the execution by any Borrower

of any document pertaining to any such renewal, modification, or

extension.&#160; Guarantor further agrees

that its liability under this Guaranty shall be absolute, primary, and direct,

joint and several, and that Holder shall not be required to pursue any right or

remedy it may have against any Borrower under any Loan Agreement or otherwise

(and shall not be required to first commence any action or obtain any judgment

against Borrower) before enforcing this Guaranty against Guarantor, and the

Guarantor will, upon demand, pay Holder all amounts and all other sums, due and

owing under any Loan Agreements in default hereunder, and will, upon demand,

perform all other obligations of the Borrower, the performance of which is in

default under any Loan Agreement hereunder.</font></p>

and relinquishes Guarantor&#146;s rights of indemnification, subrogation,

contribution and reimbursement from the Borrower in respect of demands under

this guaranty, except those arising out of the gross negligence or willful

misconduct of the Holder, until such time as the Borrower&#146;s obligations under

the Loan Agreement have been fully satisfied.&#160;

Any obligation of Borrower, now or hereafter held by or owing, to

Guarantor is hereby subordinated to obligations of Borrower to Holder, and,

upon an Event of Default, as defined in the Loan Agreement, any indebtedness

shall be collected, enforced and received by Guarantor as trustee for Holder

and paid over to Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and provided that

Borrower has not failed to make any payment when due hereunder, Guarantor shall

be entitled to collect and keep any indebtedness or other obligations

(including, without limitation, management fees), of Borrower to Guarantor.

Guarantor hereby agrees that the failure of Holder to insist in any one or more

instances upon a strict performance or observance of any of the terms,

provisions, or covenants of any Loan Agreement or any other agreements, or to

exercise any of its rights thereunder, shall not be construed or deemed to be a

waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such terms, provisions,

covenants, or rights, but such terms, provisions, covenants, and rights shall

continue and remain in full force and effect.&#160;

Receipt by Holder of any payment or other sums payable under any Loan

Agreement with knowledge that Borrower has breached any of the terms,

provisions or covenants or the Loan Agreement shall not be deemed to be a

waiver by Holder of such breach.</font></p>
