TO STANDBY PURCHASE<BR>
AND NOTE SUPPORT AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS WAIVER AND FOURTH AMENDMENT (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Fourth Amendment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), dated as of July&nbsp;23, 2002, is entered into by
and among LOUISIANA-PACIFIC CORPORATION, a Delaware Corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>L-P</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., a national banking association
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>BofA</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, a Canadian chartered bank ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CIBC</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). RECITALS: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L-P,
BofA and CIBC are parties to a Standby Purchase and Note Support Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;16, 1999, as amended by the Waiver and First
Amendment to Standby Purchase and Note Support Agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;18, 2001, the Second Amendment (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Second Amendment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to Standby
Purchase and Note Support Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2001 and the Consent and Third Amendment to the Standby Purchase and Note Support Agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;30, 2001
(collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), pursuant to which L-P has agreed to purchase certain Installment Notes (as such term is defined therein)
from BofA and CIBC (collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Standby Lenders</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") under certain circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L-P
and BofA also executed that certain Collateral Agency and Security Agreement dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2001 pursuant to which L-P
granted to BofA, as collateral agent (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Collateral Agent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") for the benefit of the Standby Lenders a security interest in certain assets of
L-P to secure L-P's Obligations under the Agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Standby Security Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L-P
previously entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2001 (as amended, modified and supplemented from time to time, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Credit Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by and among L-P, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto (collectively, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Banks</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and BofA, as agent for the Banks, certain covenants of which were incorporated by reference in the Agreement upon the effectiveness of the
Second Amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the execution of this Fourth Amendment, L-P, Banks constituting "Required Lenders" under the Credit Agreement, and BofA, as agent for the
Banks, are entering into a Waiver and Second Amendment, dated as of July&nbsp;23, 2002 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>US Amendment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), attached hereto as </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, pursuant to
which (i)&nbsp;such Banks are waiving defaults and events of defaults arising from (x)&nbsp;unintentional omissions
and inaccuracies on Schedules 5.13 and 7.02 of the Credit Agreement and (y)&nbsp;unintentional defaults and events of defaults under the Permitted Securitization (as defined in the Credit
Agreement), and (ii)&nbsp;L-P and such Banks are (X)&nbsp;amending and restating Schedules 5.13 and 7.02 of the Credit Agreement, and (Y)&nbsp;amending the Security Agreement by
L-P in favor of BofA as Agent, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2001 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Security Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the Agreement incorporates by reference certain of the provisions of the Credit Agreement, without giving effect to any amendment thereof unless consented to by
the Standby Lenders, L-P has asked the Standby Lenders to consent to the amendment and restatement of the Schedules as referred to above. L-P and the Standby Lenders would also
like to amend the Standby Security Agreement to conform to the amendment of the Security Agreement described in Section&nbsp;4 of the US Amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L-P
has reported to the Standby Lenders that the defaults and events of defaults being waived in the US Amendment result in breaches and defaults under the
Agreement. L-P has asked the Standby Lenders to waive such breaches and defaults. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;4, 2002, the Company announced a program of facility sales and closures that to the extent implemented may result in a reduction under ERISA
Section&nbsp;4043(c)(3) of more than 20&nbsp;percent of the active participants in 2002 or 2003, or more than 25&nbsp;percent of the active participants in 2002 and 2003, in either or both of
the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation Retirement Account Plan or the ABTco.&nbsp;Inc. Retirement Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
such, it would be a Reportable Event, unless the 30&nbsp;day notice period has been waived under 29 CFR Section&nbsp;4043.23(c)(2) or (3). It is not presently known whether either
such waiver will apply and thus it is not presently certain that either such event would be a Reportable Event under the Credit Agreement. Such participant reductions may constitute a partial
termination of either or both such Plans, in which event the affected participants must under tax qualified plan law be vested to the extent their benefits are funded. The Company has decided to fully
vest the affected participants who are not already vested, by Plan amendment, instead of incurring the substantial administrative expenses and uncertainties of a vesting to the extent funded
determination. </FONT></P>
