   NEWELL RUBBERMAID INC. MANAGEMENT CASH BONUS PLAN
   -------------------------------------------------

        The following is a description of the Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
   Management Cash Bonus Plan ("Bonus Plan"), effective January 1, 2002.
   The Bonus Plan (the principal provisions of which are attached hereto)
   provides for the payment of annual cash bonuses to employees who are
   considered to be management level and are selected by the Committee.

        The Bonus Plan is administered by the Organizational Development
   & Compensation Committee or if the Committee is not comprised of
   "outside directors" as defined in Section 162(m), then by a subset of
   the Committee comprised of at least two "outside directors" (the
   "Committee").  The Committee has full authority to select the
   employees eligible for bonus awards under the Bonus Plan, determine
   when the employee's participation in the Bonus Plan will begin, and
   determine the performance goals pursuant to which bonus amounts will
   be determined.

        The Bonus Plan provides that for a calendar year the Committee
   will establish corporate performance goals and a bonus payment
   schedule detailing the amount that may be paid to each participant
   based upon the level of attainment of the performance goals.  Bonus
   payments will be made only upon the Committee's determination that the
   performance goals for the calendar year were achieved.  The
   performance goals may be based on one or more of the following
   business criteria: earnings per share; cash flow; operating income;
   sales growth; common stock price; return on equity; return on assets;
   return on investment; net income; and expense management.  Performance
   goals may be absolute in their terms or measured against or in
   relationship to the performance of other companies or indices selected
   by the Committee.  The performance goals may be particular to one or
   more subsidiaries or divisions or may be based on the performance of
   the Company and its subsidiaries as a whole.

        In 2002, payments to participants were based on a combination of
   cash flow, operating income and earnings per share.  In 2003,
   payments to participants are based on a combination of sales growth,
   operating income, cash flow and earnings per share.

        The bonus amount payable is a percentage of salary based upon an
   employee's participation category and the level of attainment of the
   applicable performance goals, as reflected in the table below.
   Performance below the target levels will result in lower or no bonus
   payments.  No award will be paid for any calendar year or portion
   thereof to a participant whose employment with the Company terminates
   during the year for a reason other than retirement, disability, death
   or other reason approved by the Committee.  In all cases, the
   Committee must approve final bonus awards and can reduce a bonus






   payment in its discretion.  The Company retains the right to terminate
   an employee's participation in the Bonus Plan at any time, in which
   case no bonus may be paid.
