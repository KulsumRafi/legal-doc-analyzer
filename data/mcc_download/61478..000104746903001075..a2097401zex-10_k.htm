<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>ADC Special Incentive Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Name and Effective Date  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this plan is the ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. Special Incentive Plan. The Plan is effective November&nbsp;1, 2002 and is of indefinite
duration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Purpose  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Plan is to coordinate with the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) to provide a financial incentive and reward to identified participants for
achieving pre-defined business milestones that are crucial for the success of ADC or one of its business segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility for Participation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility is very restrictive. It is limited to a relatively small number of employees who are deemed most key to the achievement of crucial business
milestones. Temporary employees and independent contractors are not eligible. Participation requires the prior written approval of the CEO. Participation of a Section&nbsp;16 officer also requires
the approval of the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Milestones  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, one to five milestones will be defined. Each will have an associated date after which achievement is not recognized. For each milestone, one to three
levels of achievement may be defined such that the more difficult level results in a higher payment. Each milestone should be defined in such a fashion that subjectivity is not required to determine
its achievement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Timing of Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments that become due under this Plan are made on a normal payroll date as soon as administratively feasible following the verification of the achievement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Payment Levels  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A payment amount earned through the achievement of a milestone may be prospectively defined as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the participant's
Management Incentive Plan (MIP) annual target incentive. The total of all potential payments earned during the fiscal year will not exceed the fiscal year total target incentive for the individual
under the MIP program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility for Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive a payment under this Plan, the participant must be an employee of ADC as of the date that the relevant milestone is deemed to have been
achieved. Participants who leave employment with ADC prior to that date will not be deemed to have earned a payment for that milestone achievement. Participants who transfer to another business or
function within ADC and who have no continuing responsibility in this new role for the milestone achievement will not be eligible for a milestone achievement payment unless that milestone was achieved
prior to the transfer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Promotions or Demotions  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions or demotions that maintain a responsibility for achievement of the milestone will require a restatement of the individual's payment for milestone
achievement unless the payment amount is expressed in light of MIP target percentages. If expressed as a proportion of the target MIP, an adjustment will be made to maintain the same proportion of the
new target MIP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Payment Maximum  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no case will payments credited under this Plan during the fiscal year plus any amount paid under the MIP with respect to that same fiscal year combine to equal
more than three times the participant's target MIP award for that fiscal year. By participating in this Plan, the participant expressly agrees to have payments (either under this Plan or the MIP, as
determined by ADC) reduced to conform with this aggregate limit. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Administration  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO, VP of HR, and CFO (the "Management Committee") are jointly appointed and authorized to administer this plan, provided however that all matters effecting
Section&nbsp;16 officers who are participants shall be determined by the Committee. Except as noted in the preceding sentence, the Management Committee is authorized to make all decisions to
administer, apply, interpret, determine whether designated milestones have been achieved and withdraw this Plan, and all decisions of the Management Committee shall be final and binding on all
participants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Severability  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, this Plan shall be deemed
severable and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Plan which shall be enforced in accordance with the intent of this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Assignment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall have the right to assign this Plan to its successors and assigns and this Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said
successors and assigns. Participant may not assign this Plan or any rights hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Entire Understanding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan, together with each participant's individual </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>statement of milestones and milestone achievement award
amounts</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the payment of incentive compensation under this Plan, and it supercedes any and all prior agreements
or understandings, whether oral or written, express or implied, on such subject matter. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Amendment or Termination of Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall not entitle Participants to any future compensation. The Plan is not an element of the employees' salary or base compensation and shall not be
considered as part of such in the event of severance, redundancy, or resignation. ADC has no obligation to offer incentive plans to Participants in the future. The Participant understands and accepts
that the incentive payments made under the Plan are entirely at the sole discretion of ADC. Specifically, ADC assumes no obligation to the Participant under this Plan with respect to any doctrine or
principle of acquired rights or similar concept. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, ADC may amend or terminate the Plan or discontinue the payment of incentives under the Plan at any time, at its
sole discretion and without advance notice. </FONT></P>
