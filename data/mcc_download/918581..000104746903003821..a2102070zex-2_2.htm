OF THIS FORM OF ACCEPTANCE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be effective, this Form of Acceptance must, except as mentioned below, be signed by the registered holder or, in the case of a joint holding, by ALL
the joint holders or under a power of attorney. A body corporate incorporated in England and Wales may execute this Form of Acceptance under its common seal, the seal being affixed and witnessed in
accordance with its articles of association or other regulations. Alternatively, a company to which section&nbsp;36A of the Companies Act applies may execute this Form of Acceptance by a director
and the company secretary or by two directors signing this Form of Acceptance and inserting the name of the company above their signatures. Each such person signing this Form of Acceptance should
state the office which he/she holds in the relevant company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
order to avoid inconvenience and delay, the following points may assist you: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a holder is away from home (e.g. abroad or on holiday):  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send this Form of Acceptance by the quickest means (e.g. airmail) to the holder (but not in or into Canada, Australia or Japan) for execution or, if he has
executed a power of attorney, have this Form of Acceptance signed by the attorney in the presence of a witness who must also sign this Form of Acceptance. In the latter case, the original power of
attorney (or a copy thereof duly certified in accordance with the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 by, for example, a solicitor) must be lodged with this Form of Acceptance. No other signatures are
acceptable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have sold or transferred all, or wish to sell or transfer part, of your holding of ECsoft Shares:  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have sold or transferred all of your ECsoft Shares, you should send this Form of Acceptance at once to the purchaser or transferee, or to the stockbroker,
bank or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected for delivery to the purchaser or transferee (but not in or into Canada, Australia or Japan). If your ECsoft Shares are in
certificated form, and you wish to sell or transfer part of your holding of ECsoft Shares and to accept the Offer in respect of the balance but are unable to obtain the balance share certificate by 20
January&nbsp;2003, you should ensure that the stockbroker, bank or other agent through whom you make the sale or transfer obtains the appropriate endorsement or indication, signed on behalf of
ECsoft's registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars at 54 Perthshire Road, Birmingham B72 1AD, in respect of the balance of your holding of ECsoft Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sole holder has died:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grant of probate or letters of administration must be obtained in respect of the relevant ECsoft Shares. If the grant of probate or letters of administration
has/have been registered with ECsoft's registrars, this Form of Acceptance must be signed by the personal representative(s) of the deceased holder each in the presence of an independent witness who
must also sign this Form of Acceptance. This Form of Acceptance should then be lodged with Capita IRG Plc at the address given on the cover page of this Form of Acceptance, together with the relevant
share certificate(s) and/or other document(s) of title. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the grant of probate or letters of administration has/have not been registered with ECsoft's registrars, the personal representative(s) or the prospective personal representative(s)
should sign this Form of Acceptance and forward it to Capita IRG Plc at the address given on the cover page of this Form of Acceptance, together with the relevant share certificate(s) and/or other
document(s) of title. However, once obtained, the grant of probate or letters of administration must be lodged before the consideration due under the Offer can be forwarded to the personal
representative(s). </FONT></P>
