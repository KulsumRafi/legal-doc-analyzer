          "Each Borrower agrees to indemnify any Lender and to hold such Lender
          harmless from any cost, loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
          or incur as a consequence of (i) such Borrower making a payment or
          prepayment of principal or interest on any LIBOR Loan (including
          through a conversion to the same or a different type of Loan or
          pursuant to Sections 2.3(B) and 2.9 above) on a day which is not the
          last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto (other than
          interest paid on the last day of a three month interval in respect of
          a LIBOR Loan having an Interest Period longer than three months), (ii)
          any failure by such Borrower to borrow or convert any Loan hereunder

          the case of LIBOR Loans) by it, (iii) default by such Borrower in
          making any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan after such Borrower has given a
          notice of prepayment and (iv) any acceleration of the maturity of the
          Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but
          not limited to, any such reasonable cost, loss or expense arising in
          liquidating the Loans and from interest or fees payable by such Lender
          to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the Loans
          hereunder. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall survive the
          repayment of the Loans and the termination of this Agreement."

     2.8 The first sentence of Section 3.3(A) is amended by replacing the phrase
"Borrowers agree" with "Each Borrower for whose account a Letter of Credit is
issued agrees".

     2.9 The second sentence of Section 3.3(A) is amended by: (a) replacing the

          Credit is issued agrees to reimburse the Issuing Lender for amounts
          which the Issuing Lender pays under such Letter of Credit no later
          than the time specified in this Agreement. If such Borrower does not
          pay any such Reimbursement Obligations when due, such Borrower shall
          be deemed to have immediately requested that the Lenders make a Base
          Rate Loan under this Agreement in a principal amount equal to such
          unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligations. Administrative Agent shall
          promptly notify Lenders of such deemed request and, without the
          necessity of compliance with the requirements of Sections 2.1 and 6.1,
          each Lender shall make available to Administrative Agent its Loan in
          the manner prescribed for Base Rate Loans. The proceeds of such Loans
          shall be paid over by Administrative Agent to the Issuing Lender for
          the account of such Borrower in satisfaction of such

                                       3
<PAGE>
          unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligations, which shall thereupon be
          deemed satisfied by the proceeds of, and replaced by, such Base Rate
          Loan."

Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued".

follows:

          "IRI shall pay to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Issuing
          Lender and the other Lenders) on the last Business Day of each
          calendar quarter, in arrears, a letter of credit fee at a rate per
          annum (the "LETTER OF CREDIT FEES") equal to the Applicable Margin for
          outstanding Letters of Credit. In addition, the Borrower for whose
          account a Letter of Credit is issued shall pay to Administrative Agent
          (for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders) any
          other processing, issuance, amendment or other similar fees
          customarily charged in connection with Letters of Credit, together
          with the Issuing Lender's out-of-pocket costs of issuing and servicing

          basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days."

     2.14 The first sentence of Section 4.1(A) is amended by replacing the

follows:

          "Each Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative Agent such other Fees
          as such Borrower has agreed to pay in this Agreement or under any

          connection herewith."

          Administrative Agent of the occurrence thereof."

          constitute a violation of any material

                                       4
<PAGE>
          and any applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree
          applicable to such Borrower or its assets (with respect to any
          Borrower organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the
          Unites States or a state or territory thereof (a "FOREIGN
          JURISDICTION"), this representation as to applicable laws, rules,
          regulations, judgments, orders or decrees is qualified to the extent
          enforcement of the Credit Documents is sought in such Foreign
          Jurisdiction, as such Foreign Jurisdiction may have mandatory
          provisions of laws of public order that may be different than the
          provisions set forth in the Credit Documents or applicable Illinois
          law) or constitute a material breach of any provision contained in
          such Borrower's charter or by-laws or contained in any material
          agreement, instrument, indenture or other document to which such
          Borrower is now a party or by which it or any of its property is

          other than employee grievances or other claims arising in the ordinary
          course of business which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material
          Adverse Effect on each Borrower and (ii) to the best of such
          Borrower's knowledge, such Borrower has no obligation under any
          collective bargaining agreement or any employment agreement. Except
          for the Collective Labor Agreement to which IRI Infoscan S.r.l. is a
          party, to such Borrower's knowledge, there is no organizing activity
          pending or threatened in writing by any labor union or group of
          employees."

follows:

          "Pay to Administrative Agent on demand, any and all reasonable fees,

          arising out of or in connection with (i) the forwarding to such
          Borrower or any other Person on behalf of such Borrower, by
          Administrative Agent of proceeds of Loans made to such Borrower
          pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the depositing for collection by

          favor of Administrative Agent and the other Lenders in the event a
          Borrower (other than IRI Infoscan S.r.l.) acquires any real property
          that is valued, in the aggregate of more than $1,000,000; and".

     2.22 A new Section 7.8 shall be added to the end of Section 7 to state as
follows:

          "7.8 OWNERSHIP OF SUBSIDIARIES. The Borrowers shall ensure that at all
          times the shares of IRI Infoscan S.r.l., Information Resources S.A.,
          and IRI Software Ltd. (each a "FOREIGN PLEDGED SUBSIDIARY") pledged
          under the Collateral Documents, entered into on or about January 31,
          2003, constitute, in the aggregate, 65% of the total capital stock of
          each such Foreign Pledged Subsidiary, on a fully-diluted basis. IRI
          shall ensure that at all times it owns 100% of the total capital stock
          of IRI Software B.V. (the "DUTCH SUBSIDIARY"), on a fully-diluted
          basis; provided that once Articles 8 and 9 of the Articles of
          Association of the Dutch Subsidiary are amended to provide that a
          transfer of shares of the Dutch Subsidiary shall require the approval
          of a general shareholders' meeting (as opposed to granting other
          shareholders a right of first refusal over such shares), IRI shall
          only be required to own 65% of the total capital stock of the Dutch
          Subsidiary, on a fully-diluted basis."

          organized under the laws of Italy, including IRI Infoscan S.r.l. (each
          an "ITALIAN BORROWER"), the liability of any Italian Borrower under
          this Section 11 (which liability is in any event in addition to
          amounts for which such Italian Borrower may be primarily liable under
          Section 2) shall be limited to an amount not to exceed as of any date
          of determination the lesser of: (i) the net amount of all Loans
          advanced to any other Borrower under this Agreement and then re-loaned
          or otherwise transferred to, or for the benefit of, such Italian
          Borrower and for which such Italian Borrower is still owing to such
          other Borrower at the time of determination; and (ii) $40,000,000."

     2.25 The Schedules to the Credit Agreement are hereby amended and restated
