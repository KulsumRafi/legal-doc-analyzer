<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is engaged in the business of owning, managing, operating and leasing real estate, primarily warehouse and industrial property, in the metropolitan Chicago
area, the area defined by the United States Department of Commerce as the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area, comprised of Lake, Cook, DuPage, Kane, McHenry, Grundy, Kendall and Will Counties in
Illinois, Kenosha County in Wisconsin and Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana, and in other markets outside metropolitan Chicago ("CenterPoint Market Area"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive and the Company have entered into an Employment Agreement dated September, 1993 (the "Employment Agreement") pursuant to which the Original Agreement was
executed and delivered. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive and the Company are entering into an Employment Separation Agreement dated of even date herewith (the "Employment Separation Agreement") which, among other
things, amends the Employment Agreement to provide for a termination date of October&nbsp;31, 1997 and provides for the nomination of the Executive to the Board of Directors of the Company or, in
the event Executive is not elected by the stockholders of the Company to the Board of Directors, the appointment of the
Executive as a consultant until December&nbsp;31, 2000, on the terms and conditions set forth therein. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in the employment Separation Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a condition to the continued employment with the Company under the Employment Agreement, as amended, and the Company's entry into the Employment Separation Agreement,
in order to protect the Company's business relationships and good will, and to guard against conflicts of interest the Executive is willing to enter into this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual promises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of

competitive and that by reason of his employment by the Company, his duties as a director of the Company or his duties as a consultant to the Company under the terms of the Employment Agreement and
the Employment Separation Agreement he will have access to confidential and proprietary information regarding the Company and its business. The Executive agrees, in consideration of his employment by
the Company and in consideration of the compensation set forth in Section&nbsp;2 below, that during the Term (as defined in the Employment Separation Agreement), unless the Executive is terminated
without cause by the Company as provided in the Employment Agreement and in the Employment Separation Agreement, he will not anywhere in the CenterPoint Market Area or in any other market in which the
Company may in the future conduct, or intend to conduct, its business own, directly or indirectly, manage, operate, join, control, be employed by or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control of, or consultation for, or be connected in any manner </FONT></P>

extraordinary character, that it would be extremely difficult to quantify the money damages which would accrue to the Company by reason of the Executive's failure to perform any of his obligations
under this Agreement, that it would be extremely difficult to replace such services, and that any violation of the provisions of this paragraph would be likely to be highly injurious to the Company.
By reason of the foregoing, the Executive consents and agrees that if he violates any of the provisions of this Agreement the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies
that it may have, including money damages, to apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for </FONT></P>
