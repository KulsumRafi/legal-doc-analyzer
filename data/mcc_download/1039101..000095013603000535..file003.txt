                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                               - - - - - - - - - -

                  WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders, the Syndication Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Administrative Agent and certain other parties have
entered into the Second Amended and Restated 364 Day Credit Agreement dated as
of May 16, 2001 (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT");

                  WHEREAS, the Borrower desires that the Lenders consent to an
extension of the Revolving 364 Day Termination Date and provide a limited waiver
of compliance with certain provisions in Sections 2.5(a) and 2.17 of the Credit
Agreement; and

                  WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that certain waivers and

Credit Documents.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
agreements, provisions and covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree

                  SECTION 1. CONSENTS AND WAIVERS.

          1.1     Extension of Revolving 364 Day Termination Date. Borrower has
requested that each Lender consent to the extension of the Revolving 364 Day
Termination Date for an additional 364 day period commencing on the "Extension
Effective Date" (as defined below) (the


<PAGE>



"REQUESTED EXTENSION"). The Borrower has also requested that each Lender waive
the requirements in subsection 2.5(a) of the Credit Agreement that (i) the
Borrower's request for the proposed Requested Extension be made no earlier than
60 days and no later than 55 days prior to the scheduled Revolving 364 Day
Termination Date (the "NOTICE LIMITATION"), (ii) each Lender shall advise the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower whether such Lender consents to the
Requested Extension not later than 30 days after receipt of notice of the
proposed Requested Extension (the "RESPONSE PERIOD") and (iii) the Borrower
provide the Administrative Agent with no less than 5 days' prior written notice
(the "FIVE DAY PERIOD") of the Borrower's election to exercise the Extension
Option with only those Lenders constituting Extending Lenders in accordance with
subsection 2.5(a) of the Credit Agreement (the "EXERCISE NOTICE"). In addition,
the Borrower has been advised by certain Lender(s) (each a "NONCONSENTING
LENDER") that such Nonconsenting Lender(s) do not desire to consent to the
Requested Extension. Solely in connection with the Requested Extension, Borrower
requests that the 5 Business Day prior notice requirement for replacing such a
Nonconsenting Lender in subsection 2.17 of the Credit Agreement be waived (the
"NONCONSENTING LENDER NOTICE PERIOD"). Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to this Amendment set forth in Section 5 hereof, each
Lender executing this Amendment hereby (i) consents to the Requested Extension
and agrees to waive the Notice Limitation, the Response Period and the
Nonconsenting Lender Notice Period solely with respect to the Requested
Extension and (ii) waives the delivery of the Exercise Notice in the Five Day
Period, provided that such Exercise Notice shall be delivered to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the Extension Effective Date.

          1.2     Consent to Extension of Time for Compliance with Section 6.10
Obligations. Borrower hereby advises the Lenders that Borrower has acquired each
of the entities described on Annex 1.2 hereof (the "ADDITIONAL ENTITIES") and
may not be successful in completing compliance with the terms of Section 6.10 of
the Credit Agreement for each of the Additional Entities prior to the Extension
Effective Date. Borrower hereby requests that the Required Lenders consent to
extend until March 25, 2003 the date for Borrower's compliance with Section 6.10
regarding the Additional Entities (the "SECTION 6.10 CONSENT"). Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to this Amendment set forth in Section
5 hereof, each Lender executing this Amendment hereby consents to the Section
6.10 Consent and waives the effect of any noncompliance with Section 6.10
arising prior to Extension Effective Date with respect to the Additional
Entities.

          1.3     Rollover Fee. Subject to the occurrence of the Extension
Effective Date, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay to each Lender consenting to
the Requested Extension and the waiver of the Notice Limitation (each such
Lender, a "CONSENTING LENDER") a non-refundable fee (the "ROLLOVER FEE") in the
amount set forth in that certain fee letter pertaining to this Amendment on that
portion of such Consenting Lender's Commitment which is subject to the Requested
Extension (but shall not include any portion of any Commitment purchased and
assumed by such Lender under Section 2 of this Amendment on which such Lender is
receiving a New Money Fee pursuant to subsection 1.4 below). The Rollover Fee
owing to each Consenting Lender shall be paid in immediately available funds by
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Consenting
Lenders not later than noon (New York time) on the first Business Day following
the occurrence of the Extension Effective Date.

          1.4     New Money Fee. Subject to the occurrence of the Extension
Effective Date, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay to each Supplemental Lender
(as defined in Section 2 below) and Consenting Lender purchasing and assuming
any Commitments of any Nonconsenting Lender(s) and/or Consenting Lenders
pursuant to Section 2 of this Amendment a new money fee (the "NEW MONEY FEE") in
the amount set forth in that certain fee letter pertaining to this Amendment,
which New Money Fee will be based and payable on the Commitments purchased and
assumed by such Supplemental Lender and/or Consenting Lender pursuant to Section
2 of this Amendment.

                  SECTION 2. EXTENSION EFFECTIVE DATE ASSIGNMENTS.

          2.1     On and as of the Extension Effective Date, each Nonconsenting
Lender, Consenting Lender and party signing this Amendment as a Lender which,
prior to the Extension Effective Date, was not a Lender under the Credit
Agreement (each such new Lender, a "SUPPLEMENTAL LENDER") shall sell, assign and
transfer, or purchase and assume, as the case may be, such interests in the
Commitments and the Loan Exposure of the Nonconsenting Lenders and Consenting
Lenders immediately prior to the Extension Effective Date, as shall be necessary
in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, the
Commitments and the Loan Exposure will be held by the Consenting Lenders and the
Supplemental Lender(s) as set forth in Schedule I to this Amendment. Each
Consenting Lender and Supplemental Lender purchasing interests of any type under
this Section shall be deemed to have purchased such interests from each
Nonconsenting Lender and Consenting Lender selling interests of such type
ratably in accordance with the amounts of such interests sold by such
Nonconsenting Lenders and Consenting Lenders. The assignments and purchases
provided for in this Section shall be without recourse, warranty or
representation, except that each Nonconsenting Lender and Consenting Lender
assigning any interests shall be deemed to have represented that it is the legal
and beneficial owner of the interests assigned by it and that such interests are
free and clear of any adverse claim, and the purchase price for each such
assignment and purchase shall equal the principal amount of the Loans purchased.
All accrued but unpaid interest and fees due and owing thereon through but not
including the Extension Effective Date shall be paid to such Nonconsenting
Lender by Borrower on or as of the Extension Effective Date. On the Extension
Effective Date, the Nonconsenting Lenders shall cease to be parties to the
Credit Agreement and shall be released from all further obligations thereunder
and shall have no further rights to or interest in any of the Collateral (as
defined in the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that the Nonconsenting
Lenders shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15,
2.16, 9.7, 10.5 and 10.16 of the Credit Agreement as in effect immediately prior
to the Extension Effective Date.

          2.2     On the Extension Effective Date, (i) each Consenting Lender
and Supplemental Lender that is purchasing interests in the Loan Exposure and
Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.1 above shall pay the purchase price for
the interests purchased by it pursuant to such subsection 2.1 by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00
p.m. (New York time), and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall pay to each
Nonconsenting Lender and Consenting Lender that is assigning interests in Loan
Exposure and Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.1 above, out of the amounts
received by the Administrative Agent from each Consenting Lender and
Supplemental Lender pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection 2.2, the purchase
price for the interests assigned by it pursuant to such



                                       3
<PAGE>


subsection 2.1 by wire transfer of immediately available funds not later than
3:00 p.m. (New York time).

          2.3     Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the assignments
and purchases provided for in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 above and effective upon
the Extension Effective Date agrees that (i) each Consenting Lender and
Supplemental Lender that is purchasing or accepting interests in the Commitments
and the Loan Exposure pursuant to subsection 2.1 above are assignees of the
Nonconsenting Lenders and certain Consenting Lenders permitted under Section
10.6 of the Credit Agreement, (ii) each Supplemental Lender shall be a party to
the Credit Agreement, (iii) each Consenting Lender and Supplemental Lender shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Credit Agreement and
the other Credit Documents with respect to the interests purchased by it
pursuant to such subsections. If requested by any Consenting Lender or
Supplemental Lender, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and
deliver a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent) one or more promissory notes
evidencing the Loans and Commitments of such Lender in accordance with
subsection 2.5(i) of the Credit Agreement.

          2.4     Each Supplemental Lender (a) represents and warrants that it
is legally authorized to enter into this Amendment; (b) confirms that it has
received a copy of the Credit Agreement together with copies of the financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Credit Agreement and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Amendment; (c) agrees that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (d) appoints and authorizes
the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers and discretion under the Credit Agreement, the other Credit
Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or
thereto as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof,
together with such powers as are incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will
be bound by the provisions of the Credit Agreement and will perform in
accordance with its terms all the obligations which by the terms of the Credit
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender including, if it is
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, its
obligation pursuant to clause (b) of subsection 2.15 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 3. AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENT. Subject to the
satisfaction of each of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 6

Credit Agreement as follows:

          3.1     The fifth sentence in Section 4.12 of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

                  "As of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on
          which this representation is made or deemed made, the actuarial
          present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under the Single
          Employer Plans taken as a whole did not exceed the fair market value
          of the assets available for benefits under such Plans by an amount



                                       4
<PAGE>



          which would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
          Effect (with all valuations determined in accordance with Statement of
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 87)."

          3.2     Section 6.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:


          "6.10   Additional Collateral.

                  (a)  With respect to any Capital Stock of any newly created or
          acquired Subsidiary or any newly issued Capital Stock of any existing
          Subsidiary acquired after the Original Closing Date by the Borrower or
          any of its Subsidiaries that is intended to be subject to the Lien
          created by any of the Pledge Agreements but which is not so subject,
          promptly (and in any event within 30 days after the acquisition
          thereof): (i) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such
          amendments to the relevant Pledge Agreements or such other documents
          as the Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or advisable to grant
          to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a Lien on
          such Capital Stock, (ii) take all actions necessary or advisable to
          cause such Lien to be duly perfected in accordance with all applicable
          Requirements of Law, including delivering all such original
          certificates evidencing such Capital Stock to the Administrative Agent
          together with undated stock powers executed in blank therefor, and
          (iii) if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required
          Lenders, deliver to the Administrative Agent legal opinions relating
          to the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) immediately
          preceding, which opinions shall be in form and substance, and from
          counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Borrower nor any of its
          Subsidiaries shall be required to grant to the Administrative Agent a
          Lien upon the Capital Stock of any Immaterial Subsidiary; provided
          that if an Immaterial Subsidiary ceases to be an Immaterial
          Subsidiary, Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be,
          shall within thirty (30) days of such event comply with the foregoing
          requirements."

                  (b)  With respect to any Person that, subsequent to the
          Original Closing Date, becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
          Borrower, promptly (and in any event within 30 days after such Person
          becomes a Subsidiary): (i) cause such new Subsidiary to become a party
          to the Subsidiary Guarantee and, to the extent such Subsidiary holds
          any Capital Stock of any Subsidiary that is not an Immaterial
          Subsidiary, to the Subsidiary Pledge Agreement and (ii) if requested
          by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, deliver to the
          Administrative Agent legal opinions relating to the matters described
          in clause (i) immediately preceding, which opinions shall be in form
          and substance, and from counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the
          Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Immaterial
          Subsidiary, Foreign Subsidiary or TCAS Subsidiary (except as provided
          below) of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries shall be required to
          execute a Subsidiary Guarantee or Subsidiary Pledge Agreement, and no
          more than 65% of the total combined voting power of the Capital Stock
          of or equity interests in (A) any direct or indirect Foreign
          Subsidiary of the Borrower or (B) any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
          the Borrower if more than 65% of the assets of such Subsidiary are
          securities of foreign companies (such determination to be made on the



                                       5
<PAGE>



          basis of fair market value), and no Subsidiary of any Person described
          in clause (A) or (B), shall be required to be pledged hereunder;
          provided, that if, after the consummation of any sale of a portion of
          Capital Stock of the TCAS Subsidiary, the TCAS Subsidiary thereafter
          becomes a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, then the TCAS Subsidiary shall
          become a party to the Subsidiary Guarantee and Subsidiary Pledge
          Agreement and Borrower shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days
          after such event occurs) comply with the requirements of this
          subsection 6.10(b) with respect to the TCAS Subsidiary."

          3.3     Schedule 4.14 to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its
entirety to read as provided on Schedule 4.14 attached hereto.

          3.4     The last sentence in Section 10.6(c) of the Credit Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as provided below:

          "Notwithstanding any provision under this paragraph (c) and paragraph
          (f) of this subsection, the consent of the Borrower shall not be
          required for any assignment which occurs at any time when any events
          described in clause (a) or (f) of Section 8 shall have occurred and be
          continuing."

Except as specifically provided in this Amendment, the Credit Agreement and the

other Credit Documents.

          8.2     Fees and Expenses. The Borrower acknowledges that all costs,
