      2. Registration.

Closing Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) (the "INITIAL
FILING DEADLINE"), file with the SEC the Initial Registration Statement on Form
S-3 covering the resale of all of the Initial Registrable Securities. In the
event that Form S-3 is unavailable for such a registration, the Company shall
use such other form as is available for such a registration, subject to the
provisions of Section 2(e). The Initial Registration Statement prepared pursuant
hereto shall register for resale at least that number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the product of (x) 1.3 and (y) the number of Initial Registrable
Securities as of the trading day immediately preceding the date the Initial


                                       3
<PAGE>
Registration Statement is initially filed with the SEC, subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 2(e). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Initial Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than the date which is 90 days after the
Initial Closing Date (the "INITIAL EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE").

            b. Additional Mandatory Registration. The Company shall prepare,
and, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after each of (i)
the Subsequent Closing Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement)
and (ii) the earlier of (x) each Additional Closing Date at which an aggregate
of at least $750,000 in principal amount of Additional Notes are purchased by
one or more Buyers or their successors or assigns or after which there is an
aggregate of at least $750,000 in principal amount of Additional Notes that have
purchased by one or more Buyers or their successors or assigns that have not had
their related Additional Registrable Securities previously registered hereunder
or (y) such time after any Additional Notes are purchased that no additional
Additional Notes are available or are permitted to be purchased pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement (each, an "ADDITIONAL FILING DEADLINE"), file with
the SEC an Additional Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of
all of the Subsequent Registrable Securities or Additional Registrable
Securities not previously registered on an Additional Registration Statement
hereunder, as the case may be. In the event that Form S-3 is unavailable for
such a registration, the Company shall use such other form as is available for
such a registration, subject to the provisions of Section 2(e). Each Additional
Registration Statement prepared pursuant hereto shall register for resale at
least that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (x) 1.3 and
(y) the number of Additional Registrable Securities as of the trading day
immediately preceding the date the Additional Registration Statement is
initially filed with the SEC, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2(e).
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have each Additional
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than the date which is 90 days after the applicable Additional
Closing Date or Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be (each, an
"ADDITIONAL EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE").

            c. Allocation of Registrable Securities. The initial number of
Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement and each increase
in the number of Registrable Securities included therein pursuant to Section
2(e) shall be allocated pro rata among the Investors based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by each Investor at the time the Registration
Statement covering such initial number of Registrable Securities or increase
thereof is declared effective by the SEC. In the event that an Investor sells or
otherwise transfers any of such Investor's Registrable Securities, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement for such
transferor. Any shares of Common Stock included in a Registration Statement and
which remain allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall be allocated to the
remaining Investors, pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities then
held by such Investors which are covered by such Registration Statement. In no
event shall the Company include any securities other than Registrable Securities
on any Registration Statement without the prior written consent of Buyers
holding at least two-thirds of the Registrable Securities.


                                       4
<PAGE>
            d. Ineligibility for Form S-3. In the event that Form S-3 is not
available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities
hereunder, the Company shall (i) register the resale of the Registrable
Securities on another appropriate form reasonably acceptable to the holders of
at least two-thirds of the Registrable Securities and (ii) undertake to register
the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available,
provided that the Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement then in effect until such time as a Registration Statement on Form S-3
covering the Registrable Securities has been declared effective by the SEC.

            e. Sufficient Number of Shares Registered. In the event the number
of shares available under a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section
2(a) or 2(b) is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities required
to be covered by such Registration Statement or an Investor's allocated portion
of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2(c), the Company shall amend
the applicable Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on
the short form available therefor, if applicable), or both, so as to cover at
least 130% of the number of such Registrable Securities as of the trading day
immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new
Registration Statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event
not later than fifteen (15) days after the necessity therefor arises. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment and/or new
Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the
filing thereof. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the number of shares
available under a Registration Statement shall be deemed "insufficient to cover
all of the Registrable Securities" if at any time the number of shares of Common
Stock available for resale under the Registration Statement is less than the
product determined by multiplying (i) the number of Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement, by (ii) 1.1. The calculation set forth
in the foregoing sentence shall be made without regard to any limitations on the
conversion of the Notes or the exercise of the Warrants and such calculation
shall assume that the Notes and the Warrants are then convertible into shares of
Common Stock and the maximum number of Interest Shares under the Notes, assuming
the initial outstanding principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding
through the scheduled maturity date and assuming no conversions or redemptions
of the Notes prior to the scheduled maturity date, are issuable at the then
prevailing Interest Conversion Price (as defined in the Notes), Conversion Rate
(as defined in the Notes) or Warrant Exercise Price (as defined in the
Warrants), as applicable.

            f. Effect of Failure to File and Obtain and Maintain Effectiveness
of Registration Statement. If (i) a Registration Statement covering all the
Registrable Securities required to be covered thereby and required to be filed
by the Company pursuant to this Agreement is (A) not filed with the SEC on or
before the respective Filing Deadline or (B) not declared effective by the SEC
on or before 30 days after the respective Effectiveness Deadline or (ii) on any
day after such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC
sales of all the Registrable Securities required to be included on such
Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace
Period (as defined in Section 3(r)) pursuant to such Registration Statement
(including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration
Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to
be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or to register sufficient shares
of Common Stock), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by
reason of any such delay in or reduction of


                                       5
<PAGE>
its ability to sell the underlying shares of Common Stock (which remedy shall
not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity), the
Company shall pay to each holder of Notes relating to such Registration
Statement an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate Principal
(as such term is defined in the Notes) convertible into Conversion Shares
included in such Registration Statement of such Investor's Notes multiplied by
(ii) the sum of (A) 0.015, if such Registration Statement is not filed by the
applicable Filing Deadline, plus (B) 0.015, if such Registration Statement is
not declared effective by 30 days after the applicable Effectiveness Deadline,
plus (C) the product of (I) 0.0005 multiplied by (II) the sum of (x) the number
of days after the applicable Filing Deadline that the Registration Statement is
not filed with the SEC, plus (y) the number of days after the 30th day after
applicable Effectiveness Deadline that the Registration Statement is not
declared effective by the SEC, plus (z) the number of days, in each instance,
after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC that
such Registration Statement is not available (other than during an Allowable
Grace Period) for the sale of all the Registrable Securities required to be
included on such Registration Statement. The payments to which a holder shall be
entitled pursuant to this Section 2(f) are referred to herein as "REGISTRATION
DELAY PAYMENTS." Registration Delay Payments shall be paid on the earlier of (I)
the last day of the calendar month during which such Registration Delay Payments
are incurred and (II) the third Business Day after the event or failure giving
rise to the Registration Delay Payments is cured. In the event the Company fails
to make Registration Delay Payments in a timely manner, such Registration Delay
Payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (prorated for partial
months) until paid in full.

      3. Related Obligations.

      At such time as the Company is obligated to file a Registration Statement
with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a), 2(b), 2(d) or 2(e), the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof
(provided that such intended method of distribution shall not include an
underwritten offering) and, pursuant thereto, the Company shall have the
following obligations:

            a. The Company shall submit to the SEC, within two (2) Business Days
after the Company learns that no review of a particular Registration Statement
will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments
on a particular Registration Statement, as the case may be, a request for
acceleration of effectiveness of such Registration Statement to a time and date
not later than 48 hours after the submission of such request. The Company shall
keep each Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times
until the earlier of (i) the date as of which the Investors may sell all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement without
restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or successor thereto) promulgated under the
1933 Act or (ii) the date on which the Investors shall have sold all the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement (the "REGISTRATION
PERIOD"). The Company shall ensure that each Registration Statement (including
any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of prospectuses, in the light of the circumstances in which they
were made) not misleading.


                                       6
<PAGE>
            b. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments
(including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a Registration
Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration
Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated
under the 1933 Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period,
comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of
all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration Statement
until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed
of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or
sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement. In the case of
amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement which are required to be
filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 3(b)) by
reason of the Company filing a report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any
analogous report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"1934 ACT"), the Company shall have incorporated such report by reference into
such Registration Statement, if applicable, or shall file such amendments or
supplements with the SEC on the same day on which the 1934 Act report is filed
which created the requirement for the Company to amend or supplement such
Registration Statement.

            c. The Company shall (A) permit one legal counsel ("LEGAL COUNSEL"),
which shall be Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP or such other counsel as thereafter
designated by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Registrable Securities
to review and comment upon (i) a Registration Statement at least five (5)
Business Days prior to its filing with the SEC and (ii) all amendments and
supplements to all Registration Statements (except for Annual Reports on Form
10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and any
similar or successor reports) within a reasonable number of days prior to their
filing with the SEC, and (B) not file any Registration Statement or amendment or
supplement thereto in a form to which Legal Counsel reasonably objects. The
Company shall not submit a request for acceleration of the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto without the prior
approval of Legal Counsel, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Company shall furnish to Legal Counsel, without charge, (i) copies
of any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its
representatives relating to any Registration Statement, (ii) promptly after the
same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of any Registration Statement
and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all
documents incorporated therein by reference, if requested by an Investor, and
all exhibits and (iii) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, one
copy of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all
amendments and supplements thereto. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Legal Counsel in performing the Company's obligations pursuant to this Section
3.

            d. The Company shall furnish to each Investor whose Registrable
Securities are included in any Registration Statement, without charge, (i)
promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, at least one copy of
such Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial
statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference, if
requested by an Investor, all exhibits and each preliminary prospectus, (ii)
upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, ten (10) copies of the
prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and
supplements thereto


                                       7
<PAGE>
(or such other number of copies as such Investor may reasonably request) and
(iii) such other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final
prospectus, as such Investor may reasonably request from time to time in order
to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Investor.

            e. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) register
and qualify, unless an exemption from registration and qualification applies,
the resale by Investors of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of all applicable
jurisdictions in the United States, (ii) prepare and file in those
jurisdictions, such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and
supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to
maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take
such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and
qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv)
take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the
Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to (x) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(e), (y) subject itself
to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (z) file a general consent to
service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company shall promptly notify
Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities of the receipt
by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale
under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in the United States
or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose.

            f. The Company shall notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in
writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming
aware of such event, as a result of which the prospectus included in a
Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such
notice contain any material, nonpublic information), and, subject to Section
3(r), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement
to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver ten (10) copies of
such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and each Investor (or such other
number of copies as Legal Counsel or such Investor may reasonably request). The
Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing
(i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be
delivered to Legal Counsel and each Investor by facsimile on the same day of
such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (ii) of any request by the SEC for
amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related prospectus or
related information, and (iii) of the Company's reasonable determination that a
post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.

            g. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a
Registration Statement, or the


                                       8
<PAGE>
suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the
withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to
notify Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities being
sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of
actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

            h. At the reasonable request of any Investor, the Company shall
furnish to such Investor, within five (5) Business Days following the date of
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (i) a letter, dated such date,
from the Company's independent certified public accountants in form and
substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to
underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors, and
(ii) opinions, dated as of such date, of counsel representing the Company for
purposes of such Registration Statement and the Company's General Counsel as to
internal matters, in form, scope and substance as is customarily given in an
underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors.

            i. The Company shall make available for inspection by (i) one
Investor (as may be designated by the holders of at least two-thirds of the
Registrable Securities), (ii) Legal Counsel and (iii) one firm of accountants or
other agents retained by the Investors (collectively, the "INSPECTORS"), all
pertinent financial and other records, and pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the Company (collectively, the "RECORDS"), as shall be reasonably
deemed necessary by each Inspector, and cause the Company's officers, directors
and employees to supply all information which any Inspector may reasonably
request; provided, however, that each Inspector shall agree to hold in strict
confidence and shall not make any disclosure (except to an Investor) or use of
any Record or other information which the Company determines in good faith to be
confidential, and of which determination the Inspectors are so notified, unless
(a) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement or is otherwise required
under the 1933 Act, (b) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a
final, non-appealable subpoena or order from a court or government body of
competent jurisdiction, or (c) the information in such Records has been made
generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this
or any other agreement of which the Inspector has knowledge. Each Investor
agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in
or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other
means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense,
to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a
protective order for, the Records deemed confidential. Nothing herein (or in any
other confidentiality agreement between the Company and any Investor) shall be
deemed to limit the Investors' ability to sell Registrable Securities in a
manner which is otherwise consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

            j. The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure
of information concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless (i)
disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with federal or state
securities laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (iii) the
release of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other final,
non-appealable order from a court or governmental body of competent
jurisdiction,


                                       9
<PAGE>
or (iv) such information has been made generally available to the public other
than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement or any other agreement. The
Company agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such information
concerning an Investor is sought in or by a court or governmental body of
competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt written notice to
such Investor and allow such Investor, at the Investor's expense, to undertake
appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order
for, such information.

            k. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts either to (i)
cause all the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be
listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or
series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such
Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or
(ii) secure designation and quotation of all the Registrable Securities covered
by a Registration Statement on the Nasdaq National Market, or (iii) if, despite
the Company's reasonable best efforts to satisfy the preceding clause (i) or
(ii), the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying the preceding clause (i) or
(ii), to secure the inclusion for quotation on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market for
such Registrable Securities and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for at least two market
makers to register with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD") as such with respect to such Registrable Securities. The Company shall
pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under
this Section 3(k).

            l. The Company shall cooperate with the Investors who hold
Registrable Securities being offered and, to the extent applicable, facilitate
the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive
legend) representing the Registrable Securities to be offered pursuant to a
Registration Statement and enable such certificates to be in such denominations
or amounts, as the case may be, as the Investors may reasonably request and
registered in such names as the Investors may request.

            m. If requested by an Investor, the Company shall (i) as soon as
practicable incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
such information as an Investor reasonably requests to be included therein
relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including,
without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable
Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any
other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such
offering; (ii) as soon as practicable make all required filings of such
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the
matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment; and (iii) as soon as practicable, supplement or make amendments to
any Registration Statement if reasonably requested by an Investor holding any
Registrable Securities.

            n. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be registered with
or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be
necessary to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

            o. The Company shall make generally available to its security
holders as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days after the
close of the period covered


                                       10
<PAGE>
thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with, and in the manner
provided by, the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) covering a
twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's
fiscal quarter next following the effective date of a Registration Statement.

            p. The Company shall otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with
any registration hereunder.

            q. Within two (2) Business Days after a Registration Statement which
covers Registrable Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall
deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the Company to deliver, to the
transfer agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investors
whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement)
confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the
SEC in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

            r. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time
after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the
Company may delay the disclosure of material non-public information concerning
the Company the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith
opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company and its counsel, in the best
interest of the Company and, based upon the advice of counsel to the Company,
otherwise required (a "GRACE PERIOD"); provided, that the Company shall promptly
(i) notify the Investors in writing of the existence of material non-public
information giving rise to a Grace Period (provided that in each notice the
Company will not disclose the content of such material non-public information to
the Investors) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii)
notify the Investors in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and,
provided further, that no Grace Period shall exceed fifteen (15) consecutive
days and during any three hundred sixty five (365) day period such Grace Periods
shall not exceed an aggregate of forty-five (45) days and the first day of any
Grace Period must be at least two (2) trading days after the last day of any
prior Grace Period (each, an "ALLOWABLE GRACE PERIOD"). For purposes of
determining the length of a Grace Period above, the Grace Period shall begin on
and include the date the Investors receive the notice referred to in clause (i)
and shall end on and include the later of the date the Investors receive the
notice referred to in clause (ii) and the date referred to in such notice. The
provisions of Section 3(f) hereof shall not be applicable during the period of
any Allowable Grace Period. Upon expiration of the Grace Period, the Company
shall again be bound by the first sentence of Section 3(f) with respect to the
information giving rise thereto unless such material non-public information is
no longer applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a
transferee of an Investor in accordance with the terms of the Securities
Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with
respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered
a copy of the prospectus included as part of the applicable Registration
Statement, prior to the Investor's receipt of the notice of a Grace Period and
for which the Investor has not yet settled.

      4. Obligations Of The Investors.

            a. At least seven (7) Business Days prior to the first anticipated
filing date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor
in writing of the information the Company requires from each such Investor if
such Investor elects to have any of such Investor's Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement. It shall be a condition precedent to
the obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of a particular Investor
that such Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding
itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of
disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it as shall be reasonably
required to effect the effectiveness of the registration of such Registrable
Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration
as the Company may reasonably request.

            b. Each Investor, by such Investor's acceptance of the Registrable
Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration
Statement hereunder, unless such Investor has notified the Company in writing of
such Investor's election to exclude all of such Investor's Registrable
Securities from such Registration Statement.

            c. Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or
the first sentence of 3(f), such Investor will immediately discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement(s)
covering such Registrable Securities until such Investor's receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(g) or the
first sentence of 3(f) or receipt of notice that no supplement or amendment is
required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of
an Investor in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement in
connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an
Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor's receipt of
a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f) and for which the Investor has not
yet settled.

      5. Expenses Of Registration.

      The Company shall pay all reasonable expenses, other than underwriting
discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with the performance of its
obligations hereunder and under the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, and
including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications
fees, printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for
the Company. The Company shall also reimburse the Investors for the fees and
disbursements of Legal Counsel in connection with registration, filing or
qualification pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement which amount shall
be limited to $5,000 for each Registration Statement.


                                       12

      6. Indemnification.

      In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration
Statement under this Agreement:

            a. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and
hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Investor, the directors,
officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives of, and each Person, if
any, who controls any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934
Act (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON"), against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, reasonable attorneys'
fees, amounts paid in settlement or reasonable expenses, joint or several,
(collectively, "CLAIMS") incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any
action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the
foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other
regulatory agency, body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened, whether or
not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto ("INDEMNIFIED DAMAGES"),
to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact in a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the
offering under the securities or other "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in
which Registrable Securities are offered ("BLUE SKY FILING"), or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such Registration
Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if
the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the
statements therein were made, not misleading, (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other law,
including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or
regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or (iv) any material violation
of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being,
collectively, "VIOLATIONS"). Subject to Section 6(c), the Company shall
reimburse the Indemnified Persons, promptly as such expenses are incurred and
are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification
agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim by an
Indemnified Person arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by such Indemnified Person for such Indemnified Person expressly for use
in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made
available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d); (ii) with respect to any
preliminary prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any such person from
whom the person asserting any such Claim purchased the Registrable Securities
that are the subject thereof (or to the benefit of any person controlling such
person) if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the
preliminary prospectus was corrected in the prospectus, as then amended or


                                       13
<PAGE>
supplemented, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company
pursuant to Section 3(d), and the Indemnified Person was promptly advised in
writing not to use the incorrect prospectus prior to the use giving rise to a
violation and such Indemnified Person, notwithstanding such advice, used it or
failed to deliver the correct prospectus as required by the 1933 Act and such
correct prospectus was timely made available pursuant to Section 3(d); (iii)
shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the
Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by
the Company, including a corrected prospectus, if such prospectus or corrected
prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d);
and (iv) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such
settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the
Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9.

            b. In connection with any Registration Statement in which an
Investor is participating, each such Investor agrees to severally and not
jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same
manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each
of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each Person, if any,
who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act
(each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to
which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or
otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are
based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent,
that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such Investor expressly for use in
connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 6(c), such
Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b)
and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected
without the prior written consent of such Investor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, further, however, that the Investor
shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for only that amount of a Claim or
Indemnified Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Investor as a
result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to
Section 9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(b) with respect to any
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party
if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the
preliminary prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in the prospectus, as
then amended or supplemented.

            c. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim,
such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect
thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6,
deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the


                                       14
<PAGE>
commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person
or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party to be paid by the indemnifying party,
if, in the reasonable conclusion of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party,
the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. In the
case of an Indemnified Person, legal counsel referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be selected by the Investors holding at least
two-thirds in interest of the Registrable Securities included in the
Registration Statement to which the Claim relates. The Indemnified Party or
Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in
connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the
indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which
relates to such action or Claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person reasonably apprised at all times as to
the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.
No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or
proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that
the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its
consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in
respect to such Claim or litigation. Following indemnification as provided for
hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms
or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.
The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a
reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such
indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

            d. The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by
periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation
or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred.

            e. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to
(i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the
indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.


                                       15
<PAGE>
      7. Contribution.

      To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited
or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum
contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable
under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that:
(i) no person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which person is
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the 1933 Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution
from any person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of
Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds
received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement.

      8. Reports Under The 1934 Act.

      With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule 144
promulgated under the 1933 Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the
SEC that may at any time permit the Investors to sell securities of the Company
to the public without registration ("RULE 144"), the Company agrees to:

            a. make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144;

            b. file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as
the Company remains subject to such requirements (it being understood that
nothing herein shall limit the Company's obligations under Section 4(c) of the
Securities Purchase Agreement) and the filing of such reports and other
documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

            c. furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns
Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the
Company, if true, that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule
144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by
the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to
permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without
registration.

      9. Assignment of Registration Rights.

      The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the
Investors to any transferee of all or any portion of such Investor's Registrable
Securities if: (i) the Investor agrees in writing with the transferee or
assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the
Company within a reasonable time after such assignment; (ii) the Company is,
within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with
written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and
(b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being
transferred or assigned; (iii) immediately following such transfer or assignment
the further disposition of such securities by the transferee


                                       16
<PAGE>
or assignee is restricted under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities
laws; (iv) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice
contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the transferee or assignee agrees
in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained
herein; and (v) such transfer shall have been made in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Purchase Agreement.

      10. Amendment of Registration Rights.

      Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and Investors
who then hold at least two-thirds of the Registrable Securities. Any amendment
or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 10 shall be binding upon each
Investor and the Company. No such amendment shall be effective to the extent
that it applies to less than all of the holders of the Registrable Securities.
No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or consent to a
waiver or modification of any provision of any of this Agreement unless the same
consideration also is offered to all of the parties to this Agreement.

      11. Miscellaneous.

            a. A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities
whenever such Person owns or is deemed to own of record such Registrable
Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or
elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable
Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or
election received from the such record owner of such Registrable Securities.

            b. Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required
or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing
and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered
personally; (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of
transmission is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the
sending party); or (iii) one Business Day after deposit with a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed to the
party to receive the same. The addresses and facsimile numbers for such

unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or the validity or
enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

                         FORM OF NOTICE OF EFFECTIVENESS

[Transfer Agent]
Attn:

      Re:   Viewpoint Corporation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

            [We are counsel to][I am the General Counsel of] Viewpoint
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and have represented the
Company in connection with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as
of December 31, 2002 (the "Purchase Agreement"), entered into by and among the
Company and the buyers named therein (collectively, the "Holders") pursuant to
which the Company issued to the Holders its convertible notes (the "Notes"),
convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share (the "Common Stock") and warrants exercisable for shares of its Common
Stock (the "Warrants"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company also has
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Holders (the "Registration
Rights Agreement") pursuant to which the Company agreed, among other things, to
register the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement), including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes and exercise of the Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "1933 Act"). In connection with the Company's obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement, on ____________ ___, 200_, the Company filed a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-_____________) (the
"Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") relating to the Registrable Securities which names each of the Holders as
a selling stockholder thereunder.

            In connection with the foregoing, [we][I] advise you that a member
of the SEC's staff has advised [us][me] by telephone that the SEC has entered an
order declaring the Registration Statement effective under the 1933 Act at
[ENTER TIME OF EFFECTIVENESS] on [ENTER DATE OF EFFECTIVENESS] and [we][I] have
no knowledge, after telephonic inquiry of a member of the SEC's staff, that any
stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued or that any proceedings
for that purpose are pending before, or threatened by, the SEC and the
Registrable Securities are available for resale under the 1933 Act pursuant to
the Registration Statement.

                                             Very truly yours,

                                             [ISSUER'S COUNSEL][GENERAL COUNSEL]

                                             By:_______________________
