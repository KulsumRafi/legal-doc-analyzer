&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Interest</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest  shall accrue on any  principal
balance  outstanding  hereunder from and including the date hereof at a rate per
annum equal to the Fixed Rate. All  computations of interest and fees under this
Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days
and calculated  for the actual days elapsed.  Any change in the rate of interest
occasioned  by a change in the Prime Rate shall be  effective on the same day as
the change in the Prime Rate. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Repayment</U>. Maker will repay this Loan in consecutive monthly installments
of principal and interest,  based on the applicable interest rate and the months
remaining in an  amortization  period that begins on the date hereof and extends
for a period of two hundred  forty (240) months  thereafter.  Maker&#146;s  said
installment payments shall commence on December&#160;1, 2002, and shall continue
on the first day of each calendar month until the Maturity Date. On the Maturity
Date, the balance,  plus accrued interest,  then unpaid shall be due and payable
immediately.  To the extent  that the  amortization  period  extends  beyond the
Maturity Date, the final payment on the Maturity Date will be a balloon  payment
in  an  amount  sufficient  to  repay  all  remaining  indebtedness  under  this
Promissory  Note.  Principal  and  interest  payments  after  any  change in the
applicable  interest rate or any partial  prepayment will be calculated based on
the number of months remaining in the two hundred forty (240) month amortization
period of this Promissory Note at such time. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In any and all events,  the entire remaining  balance of this Promissory Note is
due and payable on the Maturity  Date.  Acceptance by Payee of any payment which
is less than payment in full of all amounts due and owing at such time shall not
constitute a waiver of Payee&#146;s  right to receive payment in full at such or
any other time. </FONT></P>

<PAGE>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each payment of principal and interest due under this  Promissory  Note shall be
made by Maker to Payee at any of its offices.  All sums paid on this  Promissory
Note shall be applied  first to fees and costs of Payee in  connection  with the
enforcement  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of the  Loan  Agreement  and  this
Promissory Note, second to interest accrued to the date of payment,  and finally
to principal.  Each payment due under this Promissory Note shall be made without
set-off or  counterclaim  in immediately  available  funds on a Business Day not
later than 3:30&#160;p.m.  Lafayette, Indiana time. All sums received after such
time shall be deemed  received on the next Business Day. If any  installment  of
principal or interest under this  Promissory Note is payable on a day other than
a Business Day, the maturity of such  installment  shall be extended to the next
succeeding  Business Day, and interest shall be payable during such extension of
maturity. </FONT></P>

connection with the delivery, acceptance,  performance,  default, endorsement or
guaranty  of this  Promissory  Note,  notice  of loans  made,  credit  extended,
collateral  received or delivered,  or other action taken in reliance hereon and
all  other  demands  and  notices  of any  description.  Further,  Maker and all
endorsers hereof hereby severally  consent to extensions of time with respect to
sums payable hereunder and any collateral for this indebtedness.  Maker consents
to any extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other  indulgence
to any  substitution,  exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security
interest  in such  collateral,  to the  adding or release of any party or person
primarily or secondarily  liable,  to the acceptance of partial payment thereon,
and the settlement,  compromise or adjustment of any thereof, all in such manner
and at such time as Payee may deem advisable. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Prepayment</U>.  Maker may prepay all or any part of the principal balance of

<U>Default  Rate  and  Late  Charge</U>.  After  maturity  (by  acceleration  or
otherwise) the unpaid balance (both principal and unpaid pre-maturity  interest)
shall bear  interest at a Default  Rate equal to four percent (4%) over the rate
of interest in effect  immediately prior to maturity.  If any payment under this
Promissory  Note is not  received  by the  holder  hereof  within  fifteen  (15)
calendar  days after the payment is due,  Maker will pay to the holder  hereof a
late charge of the lesser of five percent  (5.0%) of the overdue  payment amount
or One Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($1,000.00). </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Notices</U>. All notices to be given pursuant to this Promissory Note will be
sufficient if given by personal  service,  or by guaranteed  overnight  delivery
service,  or by postage  prepaid  mailing by certified or  registered  mail with
return receipt  requested,  to the parties as set forth below,  or to such other
address as a party may request by notice  given  pursuant to this  Section.  Any
time period  provided in the giving of any notice  hereunder shall commence upon
the date of personal service, the day after delivery to the guaranteed overnight
delivery  service,  or two (2) days after mailing  certified or registered mail.
However, any failure to give notice in accordance with the terms of this Section
will not  invalidate  such  notice if such  notice  was in fact in  writing  and
actually received by the party to whom it was directed. </FONT></P>

<U>Related  Documents</U>.  This  Promissory  Note is made  pursuant to the Loan
Agreement  and is  secured  by the real  estate  mortgages  and  other  security
instruments  therein  referred to. The terms,  conditions and definitions of the
Loan Agreement are  incorporated in this  Promissory Note by this reference.  If
any  installment  due on this  Promissory Note is not paid when due, or if there
should be an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement which is not cured within
the grace period (if any)  allowed for the cure  thereof,  the unpaid  principal
balance  hereof  together with interest  accrued  thereon,  at the option of the
holder  hereof,  immediately  become due and payable  without  notice or demand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The real estate  mortgages  and other  security  instruments  referred to in the
preceding paragraph may also secure the payment of other obligations of Maker. A
default in the payment of any of such other  obligations,  after any  applicable
notice  and  periods of grace or cure,  shall  constitute  a default  hereunder.
Nothing  herein  shall in any way lessen or impair the rights of the holder with
respect to this Promissory Note. This Promissory Note and the other  obligations
referred  to above  shall  remain  separate  obligations  of Maker  and shall be
separately  enforceable  according  to their  respective  terms.  The holder may
institute  separate  proceedings with respect to each  simultaneously or in such
order and such times as the holder may elect.  The  pendency of any  proceedings
with respect to this  Promissory Note or other  obligation  shall not be grounds
for the abatement or for hindering,  delaying or preventing any proceedings with
respect to any other obligation.  Default under each shall constitute a separate
cause of action and the institution of proceedings  upon one, but not all, shall
not be construed as splitting a cause of action by the holder. </FONT></P>

other  future  exercise of it or the  exercise of any other right or remedy.  No
waiver  or  indulgence  by Payee of any  default  shall be  effective  unless in
