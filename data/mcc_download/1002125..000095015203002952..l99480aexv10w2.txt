         SECOND AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT



         THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT
(this "Amendment") is made and entered into as of this 10th day of January,
2003, among Advanced Lighting Technologies, Inc., Venture Lighting Power Systems
North America Inc., Parry Power Systems Limited, and Venture Lighting Europe
Ltd. (collectively, "Borrowers"), PNC Bank, National Association, as Agent
("Agent") and PNC Bank, National Association, National City Commercial Finance,
Inc. and Sovereign Bank (collectively, "Lenders"). Capitalized terms used herein
without definition have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Amended and
Restated Forbearance Agreement among the parties hereto dated October 18, 2002
(the "Forbearance Agreement").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Borrowers, Agent and Lenders entered into the Forbearance Agreement
on October 18, 2002, which Forbearance Agreement was amended by the Amendment to
Forbearance Agreement among Borrowers, Agent and Lenders dated November 19, 2002
(together with the Forbearance Agreement, the "Amended Forbearance Agreement").

         B. The Amended Forbearance Agreement provided for a Forbearance Period
expiring March 31, 2003, provided that the conditions to forbearance set forth
in Section 2 thereof were satisfied. Borrower has advised Agent and Lenders that
it has failed to satisfy the conditions to Agent's and Lenders' continued
forbearance, including, without limitation, the conditions set forth in Sections
2(g)(ii),(v) and (vi). Borrowers acknowledge that the Forbearance Period has
expired in accordance with the terms of the Amended Forbearance Agreement and
that Agent and Lenders have the right at any time to exercise their rights and
remedies under the Credit Agreement, the Security Documents and other Related
Writings.

         C. Notwithstanding the failure of Borrowers to satisfy the conditions
to the Agent's and Lenders' forbearance as set forth in the Amended Forbearance
Agreement, Borrowers now request that Agent and Lenders again agree to continue
to make Revolving Loans and to forbear for an additional period of time from
exercising their rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement, the Security
Documents and other Related Writings.

         D. Agent and Lenders are willing to enter into this Amendment and to
agree to provide an additional Forbearance Period to Borrowers, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Amendment.

following proviso: "provided, however, that the failure of Borrowers to actively
pursue a Sale Transaction from November 19, 2002, to January 23, 2003, shall not
constitute a violation of the condition contained in this Section 2(g)(i)."

         (b) Section 2(g)(v) is hereby amended to delete the reference to
"December 31, 2002" and insert in lieu thereof "January 23, 2003".

and good faith estimate of financing needs, shall be provided by Borrowers to

         (r) all Loans and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement to Agent
