                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------

         EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT dated as of December 18, 2002, among NATIONAL PENN
BANCSHARES,  INC., a  Pennsylvania  business  corporation  and  registered  bank
holding  company  ("NPB");  NATIONAL PENN BANK, a national  banking  association
("Bank");  and GLENN E. MOYER ("Executive") (NPB and Bank are sometimes referred
to herein collectively as "Employer").

                                   BACKGROUND
                                   ----------

         1. Executive is presently employed by NPB as Executive Vice President
and by Bank as President and Chief Operating Officer.

         2. It is the  desire of the  Boards of  Directors  of NPB and Bank that
Executive continue his employment, on the terms and conditions set forth herein,
in order  that the  experience  he has  gained  throughout  his  career  and the
management  ability he has  demonstrated  for NPB and Bank will  continue  to be
available to NPB and Bank. Executive is willing to continue such employment,  on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

                                    AGREEMENT
                                    ---------

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the mutual  promises  contained
herein, and each intending to be legally bound, NPB, Bank and Executive agree as
follows:

         1.  Background.  The matters set forth in the  "Background"  section of
this Agreement are incorporated by reference herein.

         2. Term. This Agreement  shall be for a term of three years,  beginning
on December 18, 2002 and ending on December 17, 2005, subject to the following:

                  (a) This  Agreement  may be terminated at any time as provided
in Sections 10 through 14.

                  (b) If this Agreement is not terminated on or before  December
17, 2003 or any  subsequent  December 17, then,  on such date,  the term of this
Agreement  shall be  automatically  extended by adding one year to the term then
remaining.  For  example,  if this  Agreement is still in effect on December 17,
2003, then, on such date, its term shall be automatically  extended so as to end
on December 17, 2006.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  there shall be no further
extensions of the term of this  Agreement  beginning  with the first December 18
that occurs after Executive shall have reached age 62.


                                       1

         3. Position, Duties.

                  (a) During  the time this  Agreement  is in  effect,  NPB will
employ Executive as Executive Vice President,  and Bank will employ Executive as
President and Chief Operating Officer,  or, in either case, in such other higher
ranking  executive  officer  positions  as may from time to time be  assigned to
Executive  by the  respective  Boards of  Directors  of NPB and Bank.  Executive
accepts  such  employment,   with  such  powers  and  duties  commensurate  with
Executive's then existing titles as an executive  officer of NPB and Bank as may
from time to time be determined by the respective  Boards of Directors of NPB or
Bank.  Executive's  duties shall  include  compliance  with  Employer's  Code of
Conduct as in effect from time to time.

                  (b) Executive's  office will be located at the location of the
executive offices of NPB and Bank, wherever maintained from time to time.

                  (c) During the period of Executive's employment hereunder, the
Board of Directors of NPB will cause NPB, as sole  shareholder of Bank, to elect
and  annually  re-elect  Executive  to the Board of Directors of Bank (unless it
believes such action would violate its fiduciary  duties).  Upon any termination
of Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, including without limitation
a termination without cause,  Executive will concurrently resign from the Boards
of Directors of NPB, Bank, and all direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates
of NPB or Bank on which he is then serving.

                  (d)  Executive  will  devote  substantially  all his  time and
attention to, and will use his best  energies and  abilities in the  performance
of, his duties and  responsibilities  as  prescribed in this Section 3, and will
not engage in  consulting  work or any trade or business  for his own account or
for or on  behalf of any  other  person,  firm or  corporation  which  competes,
conflicts,  or interferes  with the  performance of his duties  hereunder in any
way.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Executive may perform  community  service
consistent  with  Employer  policy and engage in  activities on behalf of NPB or
Bank or for his own account, including personal investment activities (excluding
any personal  investments  in  publicly-traded  companies  (other than NPB) with
voting power equal to five percent or more);  provided,  however,  that all such
service or activities  do not  interfere  with  Executive's  performance  of his
responsibilities under this Agreement.

         4. Base Compensation. Except as provided in Section 23, for all
services to be rendered by Executive pursuant to Section 3, Employer will pay
Executive a base salary of at least Two Hundred Eighty-Four Thousand Dollars
($284,000) per year (effective January 1, 2003). Employer shall pay such salary
to Executive in approximately equal installments during each year on the
customary

                                       2
<PAGE>

salary payment dates of Employer, and such salary shall be subject to applicable
income  tax  withholding,  deductions  required  by law,  and  other  deductions
authorized  by  Executive.  Executive  shall not be entitled  to any  additional
compensation  for service as a director or committee  member of NPB, Bank or any
other  affiliated  company.   Employer  will  evaluate  Executive's  performance
annually,  and  Executive  shall be eligible for annual merit  increases in base
salary in the discretion of the respective  Boards of Directors of NPB and Bank.
Except as provided in Section 23, a base salary  increase  shall,  when it takes
effect,  become the new minimum base salary required  thereafter by this Section
4.

         5. Health Insurance, Benefit Plans, Stock Compensation Plans, etc.

                  (a) In  addition  to the  compensation  payable  to  Executive
pursuant to Section 4 hereof,  Executive  shall be entitled during the time this
Agreement is in effect to participate in all health insurance and benefit plans,
group  insurance,  pension  or  profit-sharing  plans,  or  other  plan or plans
providing  benefits  applicable  generally to employees of NPB or Bank which are
presently in force or which may hereafter be adopted by NPB or Bank.

                  (b)  Executive  shall  also be  eligible  during the time this
Agreement  is in  effect  for  receipt  of stock  options  or  restricted  stock
commensurate  with his positions with NPB and Bank,  pursuant to NPB's Officers'
and Key Employees' Stock  Compensation Plan or any successor or additional stock
option plan or stock compensation plan which may hereafter be adopted by NPB for
officers and other key employees of NPB and its subsidiaries.  Any discretionary
terms of grants or awards to Executive (other than with respect to amount) shall
be consistent with grants or awards to other senior officers generally.

         6. Bonuses. As additional compensation for services rendered hereunder,
Executive shall be entitled during the time this Agreement is in effect:

                  (a)  To  participate  as  a  "Type  A  Participant"  in  NPB's
Executive  Incentive  Plan,  assuming  such plan  remains  in  effect,  or at an
equivalent level in any successor  executive bonus plan covering the officers of
NPB or Bank which may be adopted by NPB or Bank; and

                  (b) To receive any discretionary  bonus that may be awarded to
him under the Executive Incentive Plan or such successor executive bonus plan.

Executive acknowledges that this Section 6 does not preclude NPB's or Bank's
Board of Directors, as the case may be, from amending or terminating the
Executive Incentive Plan or any other executive bonus plan in accordance with
its terms.

                                       3

         7. Other Benefits. Except as provided in Sections 14 and 23, as
additional compensation for services rendered hereunder, Executive shall be
entitled during the time this Agreement is in effect:

                  (a) To payment by NPB or Bank of, or  reimbursement  by NPB or
Bank  for,  100% of  Executive's  regular  membership  dues and  assessments  at
Stonewall  Links,  L.P. and Bellewood Golf Club, or similar quality  replacement
club or clubs, and all eligible business expenses related thereto;

                  (b)  To  life  insurance  coverage  and  long-term  disability
insurance  coverage at no expense to Executive,  in at least such amounts and on
such terms and conditions as are such insurance coverages for Executive that are
in effect on the date of this Agreement;

                  (c) To the receipt of an automobile allowance,  in such amount
as shall be  determined  by  Employer  from  time to time,  in  Employer's  sole
discretion, but in no event less than $850 per month; and

                  (d) To reasonable  vacation and sick leave in accordance  with
Employer policy, as the same may be revised from time to time.

         8. Supplemental Retirement Benefits.

                  (a)  Except  as  provided  in  Sections  9, 12,  13, 14 and 15
hereof,  Employer  shall make monthly  payments to Executive (or to  Executive's
"Designated Beneficiary" (defined in Section 8(b)) as follows:

                      (1)  Each  such  payment  shall be in an  amount  equal to
sixty-five  percent (65%) of Executive's  "Average Monthly Salary Base" (defined
in Section 8(a)(2)), multiplied by a fraction:

                         (i) the numerator of which is the number (not in excess
of 21) of full  years  of  Executive's  employment  by NPB and  Bank  (including
Executive's  employment  by Elverson  National  Bank prior to Elverson  National
Bank's  merger  into  Bank)  from  March  1,  1995  [the  date  of   Executive's
commencement  of  employment  with Elverson  National  Bank] through the date of
termination of his employment; and

                         (ii) the  denominator  of which is the  number  21 [the
number  of  years  until  Executive  would  reach  age 65 from  the  date of his
commencement of employment with Elverson National Bank].

                      (2)  "Average  Monthly  Salary  Base"  means  the total of
Executive's  monthly  Salary  (defined in Section  8(a)(3))  from  Employer  (or
Elverson National Bank, as appropriate) for the 60

                                       4
<PAGE>

months  immediately   preceding  the  month  in  which  Executive's   employment
terminates divided by the number 60.

                      (3) "Salary"  means  Executive's  base salary  established
pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Agreement,  excluding  payments  for  bonuses,
commissions and other  payments,  prior to any reduction of such salary pursuant
to any contribution to a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code").

                      (4)  Such  payments  shall  commence  on the date on which
payments commence to the Executive under NPB's defined benefit pension plan (the
"NPB Pension Plan") or under any annuity acquired,  or other plan or arrangement
adopted,  by NPB in substitution for benefits vested under the NPB Pension Plan.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Executive may (subject to the prior approval of
NPB's Board of Directors,  which  approval shall not be  unreasonably  withheld)
designate  a later date as the  commencement  date for such  payments.  Any such
Board-approved  designation  shall be set  forth on a  "Beneficiary  Designation
Form" duly  completed,  signed and filed as provided in Section 8(b) hereof.  In
such event, payments shall commence on such later-designated date. Such payments
shall be made for one hundred twenty (120) consecutive months.

                      (5) If  Executive  chooses,  in  accordance  with  Section
8(a)(4),  to designate a commencement date later than the date on which payments
commence under the NPB Pension Plan,  then for each full year of deferral,  such
payments shall be increased by an amount  calculated using the interest rate for
one-year U.S. treasury bills in effect at the beginning of each year, compounded
annually.  For example,  if a payment would have been $1,000 if made without any
deferral,  and instead  Executive elects to defer payments for two years,  then,
assuming  a  one-year  treasury  bill  interest  rate of 3.5% in  effect  at the
beginning of the first year and a one-year  treasury bill interest rate of 4% in
effect at the  beginning of the second year,  the payment  would be increased to
$1,076.40   [$1,000  times  1.035  equals  $1,035;   $1,035  times  1.04  equals
$1,076.40].

                  (b) If  payments  shall  have  commenced  to  Executive  under
Section 8(a) and Executive  shall die before  receiving all the payments that he
is entitled to  receive,  then  Employer  shall make the  remaining  payments to
Executive's   Designated    Beneficiary.    "Designated    Beneficiary"   means,
collectively,  the persons or entities  (e.g.,  the United  Way)  designated  by
Executive as his beneficiary or beneficiaries  on the  "Beneficiary  Designation
Form"  (the form of which is  attached  hereto as Exhibit  "A") duly  completed,
signed and filed by Executive with NPB's Corporate  Secretary.  Executive may at
any  time,  and from  time to time,  revoke or amend  such  designation  by duly
completing,  signing and filing a new  "Beneficiary  Designation  Form" with the
Corporate
                                       5

<PAGE>

Secretary.  Should  Executive  die  without  a  completed,  signed  "Beneficiary
Designation Form" on file with the Corporate Secretary, payments will be made to
Executive's heirs at law.

                  (c) (1) If  Executive  shall  die  while  still  employed  by
Employer,  then, for purposes of Section 8(a), the date of death shall be deemed
to be the date of Executive's termination of employment.

                      (2) If Executive  shall die prior to the  commencement  of
payments  to  Executive  under  Section  8(a),  then  payments  to  be  made  to
Executive's  Designated Beneficiary pursuant to this Section 8 shall commence on
the date on which payments commence to Executive's  Designated Beneficiary under
the NPB Pension Plan or under any annuity acquired, or other plan or arrangement
adopted,  by NPB in substitution for benefits vested under the NPB Pension Plan,
as soon as practicable  after  Executive's  death,  whether or not Executive had
waived the survivor's  benefit under the NPB Pension Plan.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if Executive shall have designated a later date as the  commencement
date for such  payments  on a  "Beneficiary  Designation  Form" duly  completed,
signed and filed as  provided  in  Section  8(b)  hereof,  then  payments  shall
commence on such later date.  Such payments shall be made for one hundred twenty
(120) consecutive months.

                  (d) Each  payment to be made to  Executive  or to  Executive's
Designated Beneficiary under this Section 8 shall be reduced, dollar-for-dollar,
by the maximum benefit  payable to Executive,  regardless of the form of benefit
elected by Executive,  pursuant to the NPB Pension Plan or any annuity acquired,
or other plan or arrangement  adopted, by NPB in substitution for vested pension
benefits. For purposes of this Section 8, this maximum benefit shall be computed
as an amount equal to the amount that would have been  payable to Executive  had
he retired at age 65 and  elected to receive a single  life  annuity  with equal
monthly installments payable to Executive for his lifetime.

                  (e) No  payments  to be made to  Executive  or to  Executive's
Designated  Beneficiary  under  this  Section 8 shall be deemed  salary or other
compensation to Executive for the purpose of computing  benefits to which he may
be  entitled  under  the NPB  Pension  Plan or any other  pension  plan or other
arrangement  of  NPB or  Bank  adopted  for  the  benefit  of  their  respective
employees.

         9. Change in Control.

                  (a) If a Change in Control  (defined  in Section  9(b))  shall
occur  during  the time this  Agreement  is in  effect,  then,  at the option of
Executive,  exercisable  by  Executive  at any time  within  three years after a
Change  in  Control  occurs,  Executive  may  resign  from  employment  (or,  if
involuntarily  terminated from
                                       6

<PAGE>

employment,   give  notice  of  intention  to  collect  benefits  hereunder)  by
delivering a notice in writing to  Employer,  in which case  Executive  shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash severance  payment equal to 299% of Executive's Base
Amount (defined in Section 9(c)),  which Employer shall pay to Executive  within
fifteen (15) days of Executive's termination of employment.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall the lump sum payment to Executive pursuant to
this Section 9(a) be greater than an amount equal to an amount ("X") determined
pursuant to the following formula:

                           X = (2.99A - B) x (1 + C)D.

                  For purposes of the foregoing formula:

                  A=        Executive's  Base Amount on the date of the Change
                            in Control;

                  B=        The  present  value  of all  other  amounts  which
                            qualify as  parachute  payments  under Code  Section
                            280G(b)(2)(A)   or  (B)   (without   regard  to  the
                            provisions of Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii)),  such
                            present  value  to be  determined  pursuant  to  the
                            provisions of Code Section 280G;

                  C=        120% times 0.5 times the lowest of the  semiannual
                            applicable  federal  rates  (determined  pursuant to
                            Code  Section  1274(d)) in effect on the date of the
                            Change in Control; and

                  D=        The number of whole  semiannual  periods  plus any
                            fraction of a semiannual period from the date of the
                            Change in Control to the date of  termination of the
                            Executive's employment.

                  (b)       "Change in Control" means:

                      (1) An  acquisition  by any  "person" or "group" (as those
terms are defined or used in Section  13(d) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act")) of "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of securities of NPB  representing  24.99% or more
of the combined voting power of NPB's securities then outstanding;

                      (2) A merger,  consolidation  or other  reorganization  of
Bank,  except where the resulting entity is controlled,  directly or indirectly,
by NPB;

                      (3) A merger,  consolidation  or other  reorganization  of
NPB, except where shareholders of NPB,  immediately prior to


                                       7
<PAGE>

consummation  of any  such  transaction,  continue  to hold at  least  sixty-one
percent (61%) of combined voting power of the outstanding  voting  securities of
the legal entity  resulting from or existing after any such  transaction  and at
least  sixty-one  percent  (61%) of the members of the Board of Directors of the
legal entity  resulting from or existing after any such  transaction  are former
members of NPB's Board of Directors;

                      (4) A sale,  exchange,  transfer or other  disposition  of
substantially  all of the assets of Bank to another entity,  except to an entity
controlled, directly or indirectly, by NPB;

                      (5) A sale,  exchange,  transfer or other  disposition  of
substantially  all  of the  assets  of NPB to  another  entity,  or a  corporate
division involving NPB; or

                      (6) A contested proxy  solicitation of the shareholders of
NPB which results in the contesting  party  obtaining the ability to cast 25% or
more of the votes entitled to be cast in an election of directors of NPB.

                  (c) "Base Amount" means Executive's average annualized taxable
compensation  from Employer (or Elverson  National Bank, as appropriate) for the
five years prior to the year in which a Change in Control occurs,  determined in
accordance with the provisions of Code Section 280G.

                  (d) Executive  shall not be required to mitigate the amount of
any  payment  provided  for in  Section  9(a) by  seeking  other  employment  or
otherwise,  nor shall the  amount of any  payment  or  benefit  provided  for in
Section 9(a) be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of
employment by another  employer or by reason of Executive's  receipt of or right
to receive any  retirement or other  benefits  after the date of  termination of
employment or otherwise.

                  (e) If, after a Change in Control:

                      (1) Executive terminates his employment in accordance with
Section 9(a) above, or

                      (2) Executive's  employment is terminated without cause in
accordance  with Section 14,

in calculating the payments to which  Executive is entitled  pursuant to Section
8(a),  the fraction  referred to in Section  8(a)(1) shall be the greater of the
fraction  calculated  by the  terms of  subsections  8(a)(1)(i)  and (ii) or the
fraction 15/21. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any increase
in Executive's otherwise vested supplemental retirement benefit by reason of the
application  of such  sentence  shall  be  limited  to no more  that  the  value
determined  as  reasonable  compensation  for  his


                                       8
<PAGE>

agreement to refrain from performing  competitive  services under Section 15 if,
at the time of termination of Executive's  employment,  such an agreement  would
not, in the opinion of counsel  mutually  acceptable to NPB and Executive (which
can be NPB's outside corporate counsel),  constitute a "parachute payment" under
Code Section 280G. In the event that  Executive  elects to invoke the provisions
of Section 17  following a Change in Control,  appropriate  adjustment  shall be
made, if necessary,  to his supplemental retirement benefit so that the value of
any increase in his vested  benefit  occurring by reason of the  application  of
this Section 9(e) does not exceed an amount equal to the  redetermined  value of
his agreement to refrain from performing  competitive  services.  All valuations
required  under  this  Section  9(e)  shall be made by a  mutually  agreed  upon
nationally or regionally recognized  independent public accounting firm or other
professional  organization  with  expertise  in such  matters.  The cost of such
valuations shall be borne by NPB.

         10. Termination--Disability. Employer may terminate Executive's
employment at any time if Executive shall be "disabled" for a period of 180
consecutive days. "Disability" means that, because of Executive's injury or
sickness, Executive cannot perform each of the material duties of his regular
occupation, as determined by Employer in good faith. In such event:

                  (a) This Agreement shall remain in effect for the remainder of
its term, as then extended, and terminate at the end of such term;

                  (b) Employer shall continue to pay Executive the  compensation
set forth in Section 4 for the remainder of the term of this  Agreement,  at the
times set forth in Section 4; and

                  (c)  Employer  shall pay to  Executive  the  payments to which
Executive  is entitled  pursuant to Section  8(a) at the times and in the manner
set forth in Section 8(a), notwithstanding termination of this Agreement.

         11. Termination--Death. If Executive's employment is terminated because
of Executive's death:

                  (a) This Agreement shall terminate at that time;

                  (b) Within 30 days of the date of death, Employer shall pay to
Executive's  Designated  Beneficiary,  in one lump sum,  an amount  equal to the
total  amount of  compensation  remaining  to be paid to  Executive  pursuant to
Section 4 through what would have been the  remaining  term of the Agreement but
for its  termination  under  subparagraph  11(a) above or the amount  payable to
Executive pursuant to Section 9(a); and

                                       9
<PAGE>

                  (c) Employer shall pay to Executive's  Designated  Beneficiary
the payments to which Executive was entitled to receive pursuant to Section 8(a)
at the times set forth in  Section  8(a),  notwithstanding  termination  of this
Agreement.

         12. Voluntary Termination. Executive may terminate his employment with
Employer at any time. In such event:

                  (a) This Agreement shall terminate at that time; and

                  (b)  Employer  shall not be  obligated  to pay  Executive  any
further  compensation  pursuant  to  Section  4 or  otherwise,  except  that the
following shall remain due and payable by Employer to Executive  notwithstanding
termination of this Agreement:

                      (1)  Section 4  compensation,  if any,  accrued and unpaid
through the date of voluntary termination;

                      (2) Section 8  supplemental  retirement  benefits,  at the
times and in the manner set forth in Section 8, but only if Executive shall have
reached age 58 at or before the date of his termination of employment; and

                      (3) The amount  payable to Executive  pursuant to Sections
9(a) and 9(e), if any.

         13. Termination--Cause. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to prevent Employer from terminating the employment of Executive
hereunder at any time for "cause".

                  (a) "Cause" means the occurrence of either of the following:

                      (1)  Executive's  conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo
contendere to, a felony or a crime of falsehood or involving moral turpitude; or

                      (2) The  willful  failure by  Executive  to  substantially
perform his duties to Employer,  other than a failure resulting from Executive's
incapacity as a result of the  Executive's  disability,  which  willful  failure
results  in  demonstrable  material  injury and  damage to  Employer,  and which
willful  failure  continues  uncured  after  thirty (30) days notice  containing
specific written instructions relating to the matter.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive's Employment shall
not be deemed to have been terminated for cause if such termination took place
as a result of:

                      (1) Questionable judgment on the part of Executive;

                                       10
<PAGE>

                      (2) Any act or  omission  believed  by  Executive  in good
faith, to have been in or not opposed to the best interests of Employer; or

                      (3)  Any  act  or   omission   in   respect   of  which  a
determination  could properly be made that Executive met the applicable standard
of  conduct  prescribed  for  indemnification  or  reimbursement  or  payment of
expenses  under  the  Bylaws of NPB or Bank or the laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Pennsylvania, or the directors and officers' liability insurance of NPB or Bank,
in each case as in effect at the time of such act or omission.

                  (b) If Employer proposes to terminate  Executive's  employment
for cause,  Employer  shall give Executive  written notice  specifying the exact
circumstances  relating  to cause and an  opportunity  for  Executive  to appear
before a joint meeting of the Boards of Directors of NPB and the Bank,  with his
counsel, if he so desires.

                  (c) If Employer terminates Executive's employment for cause:

                      (1)  Employer  shall give  Executive  a written  notice of
termination  effective on the date  specified by Employer in said notice,  which
notice  shall  contain  a full  statement  of the  facts  and  reasons  for such
termination;

                      (2) This Agreement shall terminate at such time; and

                      (3) Employer  shall not be obligated to pay  Executive any
further  compensation  pursuant  to Sections  4, 8(a) or  otherwise,  except for
Section  4  compensation,  if  any,  accrued  and  unpaid  through  the  date of
termination.

         14. Termination--Without Cause. Employer may terminate Executive's
employment at any time without cause (defined in Section 13(a)). In such event:

                  (a) This Agreement shall remain in effect for the remainder of
its term, as then extended, and terminate at the end of such term;

                  (b) Employer shall continue to pay Executive the  compensation
set forth in Section 4 for the remainder of the term of this Agreement,  as then
extended, at the times set forth in Section 4;

                  (c) Employer shall reimburse Executive for the cost of "COBRA"
health  care  continuation  coverage  for  the  remainder  of the  term  of this
Agreement, as then extended;

                                       11
<PAGE>

                  (d)  Employer  shall  continue to provide  Executive  with the
following benefits for one year from the date of termination of employment:

                      (1) Payment by NPB or Bank of, or  reimbursement by NPB or
Bank  for,  100% of  Executive's  regular  membership  dues and  assessments  at
Stonewall Links, L.P. or similar quality replacement club;

                      (2)  Life  insurance  coverage  and  long-term  disability
insurance  coverage at no expense to Executive,  in at least such amounts and on
such terms and conditions as are such insurance coverages for Executive that are
in effect on the date of this Agreement; and

                      (3) The receipt of an automobile allowance, in such amount
as shall be  determined  by  Employer  from  time to time,  in  Employer's  sole
discretion, but in no event less than $850 per month.

                  (e)  Employer  shall pay to  Executive  the  payments to which
Executive  is entitled  pursuant to Section  8(a) at the times and in the manner
set forth in Section 8(a),  notwithstanding  termination of this  Agreement;  in
calculating such payments,  the fraction referred to in Section 8(a)(1) shall be
the greater of the fraction  calculated by the terms of  subsections  8(a)(1)(i)
and (ii) or the fraction 15/21;

                  (f) If a Change in Control  (defined  in Section  9(a))  shall
occur prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, as then extended, Employer
shall pay to Executive  the payment to which  Executive is entitled  pursuant to
Sections 9(a) and 9(e); and

                  (g) Except as described in Section 14(d),  Executive shall not
receive any other employee benefits, including the benefits described in Section
7 of this  Agreement,  or be entitled to  participate in any other plan or plans
providing  benefits  generally to employees of Employer  which are  presently in
effect or which may  hereafter be adopted by Employer,  for the remainder of the
term of this Agreement, as then extended.

         15. Non-Competition. Executive acknowledges that NPB is a registered
bank holding company engaged principally in the commercial and retail banking
business through its ownership, support, operation and management of its banking
subsidiaries which, as of the date hereof, are Bank and Panasia Bank, N.A.
("Panasia"). During the time this Agreement is in effect, and if Executive shall
voluntarily terminate his employment pursuant to Section 12 hereof, for the
remainder of the term of this Agreement in effect immediately prior to such
termination, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, acting alone or in
conjunction with others:

                                       12
<PAGE>

                  (a)  Engage  as  a  director,   officer,  employee,   partner,
shareholder,  consultant,  agent or in any other capacity,  in the commercial or
retail banking  business in competition  with NPB, Bank,  Panasia,  or any other
future NPB  banking  subsidiary,  in any  location  within the  Commonwealth  of
Pennsylvania that is:

                      (1) During such time as the  executive  offices of NPB and
Bank are located in Boyertown, Berks County,  Pennsylvania----Within  fifty (50)
miles of Boyertown, Berks County, Pennsylvania;

                      (2) If the  executive  offices  of NPB and Bank are  moved
from Boyertown,  Berks County,  Pennsylvania to a new location, and if Executive
is employed  by Employer on the date of such move,  then during such time as the
executive  offices  of NPB and Bank are  located at such new  location  (but not
beyond  the  time  period  provided  in the  first  paragraph  of  this  Section
15)----Within  fifty (50) miles of the new location of the executive  offices of
NPB and Bank, wherever that may be;

                      (3) If the  executive  offices  of NPB and Bank are  moved
from a  successor-to-Boyertown  location to a new location,  and if Executive is
employed  by  Employer  on the date of such move,  then  during such time as the
executive  offices  of NPB and Bank are  located at such new  location  (but not
beyond  the  time  period  provided  in the  first  paragraph  of  this  Section
15)----Within  fifty (50) miles of the new location of the executive  offices of
NPB and Bank,  wherever that may be; it being  understood that Section  15(a)(3)
shall apply to any further  relocation or relocations  that may occur within the
time period  provided in the first  paragraph  of this  Section 15; and it being
further understood that the geographic  limitation  relating to the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania set forth in this Section 15(a) shall not apply if the executive
offices  of NPB and Bank are  ever  relocated  outside  of the  Commonwealth  of
Pennsylvania;

                  (b) Request any customers of NPB, Bank,  Panasia, or any other
future NPB banking  subsidiary,  to curtail or cancel their  business  with NPB,
Bank, Panasia, or any other future NPB banking subsidiary, excluding himself and
any customer who is a relative of Executive; or

                  (c)  Induce,  or attempt to  influence,  any  employee of NPB,
Bank,  Panasia,  or  any  other  future  NPB  banking  subsidiary  to  terminate
employment with NPB, Bank,  Panasia, or any other future NPB banking subsidiary,
or to enter into any  employment or other business  relationship  with any other
person (including Executive), firm or corporation.

         Executive recognizes that immediate and irreparable damage will result
to Employer if Executive breaches any of the terms and conditions of this
Section 15 and, accordingly, Executive hereby

                                       13
<PAGE>

consents to the entry by any court
of competent jurisdiction of an injunction against him to restrain any such
breach, in addition to any other remedies or claims for money damages which
Employer may seek. Executive represents and warrants to Employer that his
experience and capabilities are such that he can obtain employment in business
without breaching the terms and conditions of this Section 15, and the
enforcement hereof by injunction or otherwise will not prevent him from earning
a livelihood.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Executive files a lawsuit challenging any provision of this Section 15,
Executive shall forfeit any and all rights to receive any further compensation
pursuant to Section 8(a) of this Agreement.

         16. Non-Disclosure. During the time this Agreement is in effect and
thereafter for a period of three (3) years, Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly, acting alone or in conjunction with others, disclose to any person,
firm or corporation any of the following information: any trade secret, any
details of organization or business affairs, any names of past or present
customers, consumers or employees, or any other proprietary data or confidential
information, of NPB, Bank, Panasia or of any of NPB's other direct or indirect,
present or future, subsidiaries or affiliates; provided, however, that
disclosure of such information within the scope of Executive's employment,
disclosure of such information as is required by law, and disclosure of such
information already in the public domain through no fault of Executive, shall
not be prohibited by this Section 16.

         Employer may enforce the provisions of this Section 16 by suit for
damages, injunction, or both. Executive agrees that Employer would be
irreparably injured by the breach of any provision of this Section 16, and money
damages alone would not be an appropriate measure of the harm to Employer from
such continuing breach. Therefore, equitable relief, including specific
performance of the provisions of this Section 16 by injunction, would be an
appropriate remedy for the breach of these provisions.

         17. Release of Non-Competition Covenant. Notwithstanding Section 15 of
this Agreement, if Employer terminates Executive's employment without cause
pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement, Executive may, at his option, at any
time prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 14(a), elect to
accept a position with another firm otherwise prohibited by Section 15(a) of
this Agreement, in which case:

                  (a) Executive shall  concurrently give Employer written notice
of such election;

                  (b) This  Agreement  shall  terminate  immediately,  including
without limitation Section 15 hereof;


                                       14
<PAGE>

                  (c)  Employer  shall  immediately  cease  making any  payments
pursuant to Sections 14(b) and 14(c) of this Agreement; and

                  (d)  All  other   provisions   of  Section  14  shall   remain
unaffected.

         18. No Disparagement. During the time this Agreement is in effect and
thereafter indefinitely, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, acting
alone or in conjunction with others, disparage or criticize NPB, Bank, Panasia,
or any other future NPB banking subsidiary, or any of their respective present
or future directors, officers, employees, agents or attorneys (collectively, the
"NPB Parties"), and the NPB Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, acting
alone or in conjunction with others, disparage or criticize Executive.

         19. Binding Effect, Assignment.

                  (a) This  Agreement  shall be  binding  upon and  inure to the
benefit of NPB and Bank, and it shall be assignable to any corporation,  bank or
other entity which may acquire NPB's or Bank's business or all or  substantially
all of the  assets  of NPB or  Bank,  or with or into  which  NPB or Bank may be
merged or consolidated, as provided in Section 19(b).

                  (b) Each of NPB and Bank shall require any successor  (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase,  merger,  consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially  all of the  business  and/or  assets of NPB or Bank to  expressly
assume and agree to perform  this  Agreement  in the same manner and to the same
extent that NPB or Bank would be  required  to perform it if no such  succession
had taken place.  Failure to obtain such  assumption and agreement  prior to the
effectiveness  of  any  such  succession  shall  constitute  a  breach  of  this
Agreement,  in which case a "Change in  Control"  (as  defined in Section  9(b))
shall be deemed to have occurred and Executive shall have the immediate right to
take the actions and receive the  payments  provided in Sections 8 and 9 hereof.
As  used in  this  Agreement,  "NPB"  and  "Bank"  shall  mean  NPB and  Bank as
previously  defined and any  successor to the business  and/or  assets of NPB or
Bank as  aforesaid  which  assumes  and  agrees to  perform  this  Agreement  by
operation of law or otherwise.

                  (c) This  Agreement  shall be  binding  upon and  inure to the
benefit  of   Executive,   his  personal  and  legal   representatives,   heirs,
distributees,   devisees  and  assigns.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,   the
obligations  and  duties  of  Executive  hereunder  shall  be  personal  and not
assignable or delegable by him in any manner whatsoever.

         20. Exclusive Benefit. Neither Executive, his spouse nor any other
Designated Beneficiary shall have the right to commute, sell, assign, transfer
or otherwise convey the right to receive any


                                       15
<PAGE>


payments  hereunder,  which payment and the right thereto are expressly declared
to be non-assignable and non-transferable.  If there is any attempted assignment
or transfer,  neither NPB nor Bank shall have any further  liability  hereunder.
The interest of any  beneficiary in any benefits  hereunder shall not be subject
to attachment,  execution or sequestration for any debts, contracts, obligations
or  liabilities  of  any  beneficiary  and  shall  not  be  subject  to  pledge,
assignment, conveyance or attachment.

         21. Unsecured General Creditor. If NPB or Bank shall acquire an
insurance policy or any other asset in connection with its liabilities
hereunder, neither Executive, his spouse nor any other Designated Beneficiary
shall have any right with respect to, or claimed against, such policy or other
asset. Executive shall remain at all times an unsecured general creditor with
respect to any amount payable hereunder.

         22. Legal Fees and Expenses. Employer shall pay all reasonable legal
fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts, evidence and counsel
and expenses included in connection with an arbitration or in other litigation
or appeal) incurred by the Executive as a result of his seeking to obtain or
enforce any right or benefit provided by any provision of this Agreement, but
only if Executive's efforts in seeking to obtain or enforce any such right or
benefit are successful, and in the case of any provision of this Agreement other
than Section 9, not to exceed $10,000 in the aggregate in any calendar year.

         23. Exception for Across-the-Board Actions. If, during the term of this
Agreement, the Boards of Directors of NPB and NPBank shall determine, acting in
good faith and with a reasonable basis, that it is in the best interests of NPB,
NPBank and NPB's shareholders to implement one or more broad, across-the-board
cost-cutting measures for all members of senior management, then,
notwithstanding Sections 4 and 7, Executive's base compensation and other
benefits may be reduced in accordance with such cost-cutting measures in a
manner consistent with any such reductions in base compensation and/or other
benefits for other senior officers generally.

         24. Notices. All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given upon delivery if delivered personally or two
business days after mailing if mailed by prepaid, registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, addressed as follows:

         25.  Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  is intended by the parties to

Agreement supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings,  negotiations

discharged or terminated  only by an instrument in writing  signed by Executive,

be, against whom or which  enforcement of the amendment,  modification,  waiver,
discharge or termination is sought.

         27. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic internal law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

         28. Interpretation of Provisions.  Wherever possible, each provision of
this Agreement  shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited
by or invalid under  applicable  law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity,  without invalidating the remainder of
such provision or the remaining  provisions of this Agreement.  Without limiting
the  generality of the  foregoing,  if a court of competent  jurisdiction  shall
determine  that  the  time  or  geography  provisions  of  Section  15  are  not
reasonable,  then such


                                       17
<PAGE>

provision(s)  shall be reformed to reflect  such period of time or  geographical
areas as the court shall determine to be reasonable and enforceable.

         29.  Captions.  The  captions  contained  in  this  Agreement  are  for
reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement.

         30.  Joint and Several  Obligations.  All  obligations  of NPB and Bank
herein shall be joint and several obligations.

         31. Survival.  Notwithstanding  any termination of this Agreement,  the
provisions of Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 22 shall,  except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, survive such termination and remain in full
force and effect.

         32. Termination of Executive Agreement. Effective concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement,  the Executive Agreement dated January
4, 1999 among NPB, Bank and Executive is terminated  and of no further force and
effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on
the date first above written.
