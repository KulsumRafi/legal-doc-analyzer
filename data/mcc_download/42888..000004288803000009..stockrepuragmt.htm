Except for the record ownership in Merrill Lynch and Piper Jaffray set forth in

Purchase Shares           were split or re-split were originally acquired by such Seller.
Such Seller owns           no shares of capital stock of the Company other than the
Shares indicated in the           first paragraph of the Recitals above; provided, that

connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Stock Purchase Agreement
dated as of March 12, 2003 (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;), by and among each of you
(collectively, the &#147;Sellers&#148;, and each sometimes referred to herein as a &#147;Seller&#148;)
and the Company, pursuant to which each Seller has agreed to sell, and the Company has
agreed to repurchase from such Seller, the Purchase Shares owned by such Seller, on the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof. This opinion is rendered to you pursuant to

instruments relevant hereto (including the Purchase Agreement), that such parties had the
requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform
such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly
authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise) on the part of such parties,
that such agreements or instruments have been duly executed and delivered by such parties
and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of such parties. As to questions of fact material to my opinions, I have
relied upon the representations made in the Purchase Agreement and upon certificates of
officers of the Company.  </FONT></P>
