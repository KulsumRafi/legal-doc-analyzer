Crosstex Energy Entity may pursue an opportunity to purchase or invest in, and may
ultimately purchase, own and/or operate, a Restricted Business under the following circumstances: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Restricted Business was engaged in by a Crosstex Energy Entity on the date of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the business relating to the Excluded
Assets (as defined in the First Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;27, 2002, among Crosstex Energy Holdings, the Partnership, the Operating Partnership, the
General Partner and the other parties named therein); provided, however, that any future acquisitions or opportunities related to such Restricted Business shall be subject to the procedures set forth

purchase or investment, in the reasonable belief of majority of the board of directors of Crosstex Energy Holdings; provided that the Crosstex Energy Entity subsequently offers the Partnership the
opportunity to purchase the assets that comprise the Restricted Business in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.3 and the board of directors of Crosstex GP, with the approval
of the Conflicts Committee, has elected not to cause a Group Member to pursue such opportunity or acquisition. </FONT></P>

to purchase a Restricted Business, then as soon as practicable, such Crosstex
Energy Entity shall notify the Partnership of such opportunity and deliver to Crosstex GP all information prepared by or on behalf of such Crosstex Energy Entity relating to such potential purchase.
As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of such notification and information, Crosstex GP, on behalf of the Partnership, shall notify the Crosstex Energy Entity
that either (i)&nbsp;Crosstex GP, on behalf of the Partnership, has elected, with the approval of the Conflicts Committee, not to cause a Group Member to pursue the opportunity to acquire such
Restricted Business, or (ii)&nbsp;Crosstex GP, on behalf of the Partnership, has elected to cause a Group Member to pursue the opportunity to acquire such Restricted Business. If, at any time,
Crosstex GP abandons such opportunity (as evidenced in writing by Crosstex GP following the request of the Crosstex Energy Entity), the Crosstex Energy Entity may pursue such opportunity. Any
Restricted Business which is permitted to be purchased by a Crosstex Energy Entity must be so purchased (i)&nbsp;within 12&nbsp;months of the time the Crosstex Energy Entity becomes able to pursue
such acquisition in accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.3 and (ii)&nbsp;on terms not materially more favorable to the Crosstex Energy Entity than were offered to the Partnership.
If either of these conditions are not satisfied, the opportunity must be reoffered to the Partnership in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.3(a). </FONT></P>

the event that a Crosstex Energy Entity acquires a Restricted Business as part of a larger transaction in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2(c), then not later than
30&nbsp;days after the consummation of the acquisition, such Crosstex Energy Entity shall notify Crosstex GP of such purchase and offer the Partnership the opportunity to purchase the Restricted
Business constituting a portion of such purchase and deliver to Crosstex GP all information prepared by or on behalf of or in the possession of such Crosstex Energy Entity relating to the Restricted
Business. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 60&nbsp;days after receipt of such notification, Crosstex GP shall notify the Crosstex Energy Entity that either (i)&nbsp;Crosstex GP has
elected, with the approval of the Conflicts Committee, not to cause a Group Member to purchase such Restricted Business, in which event the Crosstex Energy Entity shall be forever free to continue to
