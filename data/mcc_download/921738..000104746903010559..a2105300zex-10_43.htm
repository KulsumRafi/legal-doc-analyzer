is understood by both Charles Town Races and the HBPA that overnight purses will have first priority in purse increases, followed by stake races. Any initial increase in stake monies
must be preceded by at least three (3)&nbsp;consecutive months during which the average daily purses earned are above the benchmark levels. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average
monthly purses will be calculated by dividing all purse monies received from all purse revenue sources (including but not limited to, pari-mutuel wagering on live
thoroughbred horse racing, video lottery terminal wagering, off-track wagering, merged pool simulcast wagering, telephone account or other electronic media wagering, or any other form or
forms of legalized wagering) by the total number of live Charles Town Races racing days. Purse amounts, conditions, distances and dates for all stake
races shall be subject to HBPA approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Charles Town Races shall send to the HBPA, not later than ten (10)&nbsp;days prior to the first day of
each Race Meeting its proposed Stakes Race Schedule for that Race Meeting. </FONT></P>
