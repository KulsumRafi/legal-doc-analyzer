                  1990 STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

                  Pursuant  to the power  reserved  to it in  Section  11 of the
Crown Cork & Seal Company,  Inc. 1990 Stock-Based  Incentive  Compensation  Plan
("Plan"),  the Board of  Directors  of Crown Cork & Seal  Company,  Inc.  hereby
amends the Plan, effective January 1, 2003, as follows:

                  Section  8.06 is hereby  amended  in its  entirety  to read as
follows:

                  "Payment of Option Price:  The Committee  shall  establish the
                  time and the manner in which an Option may be  exercised.  The
                  option  price  with  respect  to the  shares of  Common  Stock
                  received  upon the  exercise of an Option shall be paid within
                  three  days of the  date of  exercise:  (i) in cash  from  the
                  Holder,  (ii) in cash received from a  broker-dealer  whom the
                  Holder has  authorized  to sell all or a portion of the Common
                  Stock covered by the Option,  or (iii) with the consent of the
                  Committee,  in whole or in part in Common Stock valued at Fair
                  Market Value on the date of exercise.  With the consent of the
                  Committee, payment upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Option
                  may be made in whole or in part by Restricted  Stock (based on
                  the fair market value of the Restricted  Stock on the date the
                  Option is exercised, as determined by the Committee).  In such
                  case the  Common  Stock to which the Option  relates  shall be
                  subject to the same forfeiture restrictions originally imposed
                  on the Restricted Stock exchanged therefor."

                                   * * * * * *
