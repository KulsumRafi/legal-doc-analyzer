</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>SECTION 1. Purpose of Plan</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The purpose of this &#147;Fluor Corporation 2003 Executive Performance Incentive
Plan&#148; (the &#147;Plan&#148;) of Fluor Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is to enable
the Company, as defined in Section&nbsp;2.2(a)(ii) hereof, to attract, retain and
motivate its officers, management and other key personnel, and to further align
the interests of such persons with those of the shareholders of the Company, by
providing for or increasing their proprietary interest in the Company.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>SECTION 2. Administration of the Plan</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2.1 Composition of Committee.</B> The Plan shall be administered by the
Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and/or by
the Board of Directors or another committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors (any such
administrative body, the &#147;Committee&#148;). The Board of Directors shall fill
vacancies on, and from time to time may remove or add members to, the
Committee. The Committee shall act pursuant to a majority vote or unanimous
written consent. If an award granted under the Plan (an &#147;Award&#148;) is intended
to satisfy the conditions of Section&nbsp;162(m)(4)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), then each of the Committee members approving
such grant shall be an &#147;outside director&#148; as described in the Treasury
regulations under Section&nbsp;162(m). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to any Award that is not intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) or Code
Section&nbsp;162(m)(4)(C), the Committee may appoint one or more separate committees
(any such committee, a &#147;Subcommittee&#148;) composed of one or more directors of the
Company (who may but need not be members of the Committee) and may delegate to
any such Subcommittee(s) the authority to grant Awards, as defined in Section
5.1 hereof, under the Plan to Employees, to determine all terms of such Awards,
and/or to administer the Plan or any aspect of it. Any action by any such
Subcommittee within the scope of such delegation shall be deemed for all
purposes to have been taken by the Committee. The Committee may designate the
Secretary of the Company or other Company employees to assist the Committee in
the administration of the Plan, and may grant authority to such persons to
execute agreements evidencing Awards made under this Plan or other documents
entered into under this Plan on behalf of the Committee or the Company.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2.2 Powers of the Committee.</B> Subject to the express provisions of this Plan,
the Committee shall be authorized and empowered to do all things necessary or
desirable in connection with the administration of this Plan with respect to
the Awards over which such Committee has authority, including, without
limitation, the following:

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Each Incentive Award will confer upon the Eligible Employee the opportunity to
earn a future payment tied to the level of achievement with respect to one or
more performance criteria established for a performance period of not less than
one year.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>8.1 Incentive Award.</B> Each Incentive Award shall contain provisions regarding
(a)&nbsp;the target and maximum amount payable to the Participant as an Incentive
Award, (b)&nbsp;the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these
criteria which shall determine the amount of such payment, (c)&nbsp;the period as to
which performance shall be measured for establishing the amount of any payment,
(d)&nbsp;the timing of any payment earned by virtue of performance, (e)&nbsp;restrictions
on the alienation or transfer of the Incentive Award prior to actual payment,
(f)&nbsp;forfeiture provisions, and (g)&nbsp;such further terms and conditions, in each
case not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined from time to time by
the Committee. In establishing the provisions of Incentive Awards, the
Committee may refer to categories of such Awards as parts of &#147;Programs&#148; or
&#147;Plans&#148;, which names will not affect the applicability of this Plan. The
maximum amount payable as an Incentive Award that is settled for cash may be a
multiple of the target amount payable, but the maximum amount payable pursuant
to that portion of an Incentive Award granted under this Plan for any fiscal
year to any Participant that is intended to satisfy the requirements for
&#147;performance based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) shall not exceed
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>8.2 Performance Criteria.</B> The Committee shall establish the performance
criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria which shall determine
the target and the minimum and maximum amount payable under an Incentive Award,
which criteria may be based on financial performance and/or personal
performance evaluations. The Committee may specify the percentage of the
target Incentive Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for
&#147;performance-based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any portion of an
Incentive Award that is intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements
for &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) shall be a
measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria (as defined in
Section&nbsp;10.2 hereof) selected by the Committee and specified at the time
required under Code Section&nbsp;162(m).

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>8.3 Timing and Form of Payment.</B> The Committee shall determine the timing of
payment of any Incentive Award. The Committee may provide for or, subject to
such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, may permit a
Participant to elect for the payment of any Incentive Award to be deferred to a
specified date or event. The Committee may specify the form of payment of
Incentive Awards, which may be cash, shares or other property, or may provide
for a Participant to have the option for his or her Incentive Award, or such

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>9.1 Stock Units.</B> A &#147;Stock Unit&#148; is a bookkeeping entry representing an amount
equivalent to the fair market value of one Share, also sometimes referred to as
a &#147;restricted unit&#148; or &#147;shadow stock&#148;. Stock Units represent an unfunded and
unsecured obligation of the Company, except as otherwise provided for by the
Committee.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>9.2 Stock Unit Awards.</B> Each Stock Unit Award shall reflect, to the extent
applicable (a)&nbsp;the number of Stock Units subject to such Award or a formula for
determining such, (b)&nbsp;the time or times at which Stock Units shall be granted
or issued and/or become retainable or vested, and the conditions or
restrictions on such Stock Units, (c)&nbsp;the performance criteria and level of
achievement versus these criteria which shall determine the number of Stock
Units granted, issued, retainable and/or vested, (d)&nbsp;the period as to which
performance shall be measured for determining achievement of performance, (e)
forfeiture provisions, and (f)&nbsp;such further terms and conditions, in each case
not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined from time to time by the
Committee. Stock Units may also be issued upon exercise of Options, may be
granted in payment and satisfaction of Incentive Awards and may be issued in
lieu of Restricted Stock or any other Award that the Committee elects to be
paid in the form of Stock Units.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>9.3 Performance Criteria.</B> The grant, issuance, retention and or vesting of
each Stock Unit may be subject to such performance criteria and level of
achievement versus these criteria as the Committee shall determine, which
criteria may be based on financial performance, personal performance
evaluations and/or completion of service by the Participant; provided, however,
that no Stock Unit shall first vest within one (1)&nbsp;year from its date of grant,
other than upon death, disability, retirement, a Change of Control (as defined
in Section&nbsp;12.2 hereof) or upon satisfaction of such performance requirements
as deemed appropriate by the Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the performance criteria for any Stock Unit that is intended
by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for &#147;performance-based
compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) shall be a measure based on one or more
Qualifying Performance Criteria (as defined in Section&nbsp;10.2 hereof) selected by
the Committee and specified at the time the Stock Unit is granted.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>9.4 Timing and Form of Award.</B> The Committee shall determine the timing of
award of any Stock Unit. The Committee may provide for or, subject to such
terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, may permit a Participant to
elect for the award or vesting of any Stock Unit to be deferred to a specified
date or event. The Committee may provide for a Participant to have the option
for his or her Stock Unit, or such portion thereof as the Committee may
specify, to be granted in whole or in part in Shares.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>9.5 Settlement of Stock Units.</B> The Committee may provide for Stock Units to
be settled in cash or Shares (at the election of the Company or the
Participant, as specified by the Committee) and to be made at such other times
as it determines appropriate or as it permits a Participant to choose. The
amount of cash or Shares, or other settlement medium, to be so distributed may
be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents, as the case may
be, which may be

of Shares represented by a Stock Unit shall be subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section&nbsp;11.

of service or performance goals, the number of Stock Units granted, issued,
retainable and/or vested under a Stock Unit Award on account of either
financial performance or personal performance evaluations may be reduced by the
Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its
sole discretion shall determine.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>SECTION 10. Other Provisions Applicable to Awards</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>10.1 Transferability.</B> During an Eligible Employee&#146;s lifetime, Options may be
exercised only by the Participant. Unless the agreement evidencing an Award
(or an amendment thereto authorized by the Committee) expressly states that it
is transferable as provided hereunder, no Award granted under the Plan, nor any
interest in such Award, may be sold, assigned, conveyed, gifted, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise transferred in any manner, other than by will or the
laws of descent and distribution, prior to the vesting or lapse of any and all
restrictions applicable to any Shares issued under an Award. The Committee may
in its sole discretion grant an Award or amend an outstanding Award to provide
that the Award is transferable or assignable to a member or members of the
Eligible Employee&#146;s &#147;immediate family&#148;, as such term is defined under Exchange
Act Rule&nbsp;16a-1(e), or to a trust for the benefit solely of a member or members
of the Eligible Employee&#146;s immediate family, or to a partnership or other
entity whose only owners are members of the Eligible Employee&#146;s family,
provided that following any such transfer or assignment the Award will remain
subject to substantially the same terms applicable to the Award while held by
the Eligible Employee, as modified as the Committee in its sole discretion
shall determine appropriate, and the Participant shall execute an agreement
agreeing to be bound by such terms.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>10.2 Qualifying Performance Criteria.</B> For purposes of this Plan, the term
&#147;Qualifying Performance Criteria&#148; shall mean any one or more of the following
performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination,

business segment, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and
measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute

mean, for any fiscal period, the daily average percent per annum yield for U.S.
Government Securities &#151; 10&nbsp;year Treasury constant maturities, as published in
the Federal Reserve statistical release or any successor publication. Prior to
the payment of any compensation under an Award intended to qualify as
&#147;performance-based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) the Committee shall
certify the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria and any other
material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases where
such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Company&#146;s Common Stock).

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>10.3 Dividends.</B> Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment
shall be made in Shares issuable under Awards on account of cash dividends
which may be paid or other rights which may be issued to the holders of Shares
prior to their issuance under any Award. The Committee shall specify whether
dividends or dividend equivalent amounts shall be paid to any Participant with
respect to the Shares subject to any Award that have not vested or been issued
or that are subject to any restrictions or conditions on the record date for
dividends.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>10.4 Agreements Evidencing Awards.</B> The Committee shall, subject to applicable
law, determine the date an Award is deemed to be granted, which for purposes of
this Plan shall not be affected by the fact that an Award is contingent on
subsequent stockholder approval of the Plan. The Committee or, except to the
extent prohibited under applicable law, its delegate(s) may establish the terms
of agreements evidencing Awards under this Plan and may, but need not, require
as a condition to any such agreement&#146;s effectiveness that such agreement be
executed by the Participant and that such Participant agree to such further
terms and conditions as specified in such agreement. The grant of an Award
under this Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such
Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified
in this Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as
are expressly set forth in the Agreement evidencing such Award.

Participant in a principal amount sufficient to pay the purchase price of any
Award and/or to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld with
respect to any Award. Any such loan shall be subject to all applicable legal
requirements and restrictions pertinent thereto, including Regulation&nbsp;G
promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board. The grant of an Award shall in no
way obligate the Company or the Committee to provide any financing whatsoever
in connection therewith.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">If the outstanding securities of the class then subject to this Plan are
increased, decreased or exchanged for or converted into cash, property or a
different number or kind of shares or securities, or if cash, property or

shall provide otherwise, the Committee may make appropriate and proportionate
adjustments in (i)&nbsp;the number and type of shares or other securities or cash or
other property that may be acquired pursuant to Awards theretofore granted
under this Plan and the exercise or settlement price of such Awards, provided,
however, that any such adjustment shall be made in such a manner that will not
affect the status of any Award intended to qualify as an ISO under Code Section

in the case of an Option, the Participant&#146;s ability to exercise any portion of
the Option not previously exercisable; (b)&nbsp;in the case of an Incentive Award,
the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable or, if
