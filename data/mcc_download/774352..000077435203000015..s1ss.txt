                                   DEFINITIONS


        Section 1.01  Definitions.

        Whenever used in this Agreement, the following words and phrases, unless
the  context  otherwise  requires,  shall have the  meanings  specified  in this
Article.

        Bankruptcy  Amount:  As of any date of determination  prior to the first
anniversary  of the Cut-off Date, an amount equal to the excess,  if any, of (A)
$100,000 over (B) the aggregate amount of Bankruptcy  Losses allocated solely to
one or more specific  Classes of Certificates in accordance with Section 4.05 of
this Series  Supplement.  As of any date of  determination on or after the first
anniversary of the Cut-off Date, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of

               (1) the lesser of (a) the Bankruptcy  Amount calculated as of the
        close of business on the Business  Day  immediately  preceding  the most
        recent anniversary of the Cut-off Date coinciding with or preceding such
        date  of  determination  (or,  if  such  date  of  determination  is  an
        anniversary of the Cut-off Date, the Business Day immediately  preceding
        such  date of  determination)  (for  purposes  of this  definition,  the
        "Relevant Anniversary") and (b) the greater of

                      (A)  the  greater  of  (i)  0.0006  times  the   aggregate
               principal  balance of all the Mortgage Loans in the Mortgage Pool
               as of the Relevant Anniversary (other than Additional  Collateral
               Loans, if any) having a Loan-to-Value  Ratio at origination which
               exceeds 75% and (ii) $100,000; and

                      (B) the greater of (i) the product of (x) an amount  equal
               to the largest  difference in the related Monthly Payment for any
               Non-Primary  Residence Loan remaining in the Mortgage Pool (other
               than Additional  Collateral  Loans, if any) which had an original
               Loan-to-Value  Ratio of 80% or greater  that would  result if the
               Net  Mortgage  Rate  thereof  was equal to the  weighted  average
               (based on the principal  balance of the Mortgage  Loans as of the
               Relevant  Anniversary)  of the Net Mortgage Rates of all Mortgage
               Loans as of the Relevant  Anniversary less 1.25% per annum, (y) a
               number equal to the weighted average  remaining term to maturity,
               in months,  of all  Non-Primary  Residence Loans remaining in the
               Mortgage  Pool as of the Relevant  Anniversary,  and (z) one plus
               the  quotient of the number of all Non- Primary  Residence  Loans
               remaining  in the  Mortgage  Pool  divided by the total number of
               Outstanding  Mortgage  Loans  in  the  Mortgage  Pool  as of  the
               Relevant  Anniversary,  and (ii) $50,000,  over (2) the aggregate
               amount  of  Bankruptcy  Losses  allocated  solely  to one or more
               specific  Classes of Certificates in accordance with Section 4.05
               since the Relevant Anniversary.

Uncertificated  Class A-V REMIC Regular  Interests  represented by such Class or
Subclass as of the day immediately  preceding such  Distribution  Date (or, with
respect  to the  initial  Distribution  Date,  at the close of  business  on the
Cut-off Date).

       Pass-Through  Rate: With respect to the Class A Certificates  (other than
the  Class  A-V   Certificates  and  Principal  Only   Certificates),   Class  M
Certificates, Class B Certificates and Class R Certificates and any Distribution
Date, the per annum rates set forth in the Preliminary  Statement  hereto.  With
respect to the Class A-V Certificates  (other than any Subclass thereof) and any
Distribution  Date,  a  rate  equal  to the  weighted  average,  expressed  as a
percentage,  of the Pool Strip Rates of all Mortgage Loans as of the Due Date in
the related Due Period, weighted on the basis of the respective Stated Principal
Balances  of such  Mortgage  Loans  as of the  day  immediately  preceding  such
Distribution  Date (or,  with respect to the initial  Distribution  Date, at the
close  of  business  on  the  Cut-off  Date).  With  respect  to the  Class  A-V

purposes.  The prepayment speed assumption assumes a constant rate of prepayment
of mortgage loans of 0.2% per annum of the then outstanding principal balance of
such  mortgage  loans in the  first  month of the  life of the  mortgage  loans,
increasing by an additional  0.2% per annum in each  succeeding  month until the
thirtieth month,  and a constant 6% per annum rate of prepayment  thereafter for
the life of the mortgage loans.

       zero), 0%.

              (ii) For any Distribution Date for which clause (i) above does not
       apply, and on which any Class of Subordinate  Certificates is outstanding
       with a Certificate Principal Balance greater than zero:

                     (a) in the case of the  Class of  Subordinate  Certificates
              then outstanding with the Highest Priority and each other Class of
              Subordinate   Certificates   for  which  the  related   Prepayment
              Distribution Trigger has been satisfied, a fraction,  expressed as
              a percentage,  the numerator of which is the Certificate Principal
              Balance  of such  Class  immediately  prior  to such  date and the
              denominator  of  which  is the  sum of the  Certificate  Principal
              Balances  immediately  prior  to such  date of (1)  the  Class  of
              Subordinate   Certificates   then  outstanding  with  the  Highest
              Priority and (2) all other Classes of Subordinate Certificates for
              which the respective  Prepayment  Distribution  Triggers have been
              satisfied; and

                     (b)  in  the  case  of  each  other  Class  of  Subordinate
              Certificates for which the Prepayment  Distribution  Triggers have
              not been satisfied, 0%; and

              (iii)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if the  application of the
       foregoing  percentages  on any  Distribution  Date as provided in Section
       4.02 of this Series Supplement  (determined without regard to the proviso
       to the definition of "Subordinate  Principal  Distribution Amount") would
       result in a distribution  in respect of principal of any Class or Classes
       of  Subordinate  Certificates  in an amount  greater  than the  remaining
       Certificate  Principal  Balance  thereof  (any such  class,  a  "Maturing
       Class"),  then:  (a)  the  Prepayment  Distribution  Percentage  of  each
       Maturing  Class  shall  be  reduced  to a level  that,  when  applied  as
       described above,  would exactly reduce the Certificate  Principal Balance
       of such Class to zero; (b) the Prepayment Distribution Percentage of each
       other Class of Subordinate  Certificates (any such Class, a "Non-Maturing
       Class")  shall be  recalculated  in  accordance  with the  provisions  in
       paragraph (ii) above,  as if the  Certificate  Principal  Balance of each
       Maturing Class had been reduced to zero (such percentage as recalculated,
       the "Recalculated Percentage"); (c) the total amount of the reductions in
       the Prepayment Distribution  Percentages of the Maturing Class or Classes
       pursuant  to  clause  (a) of this  sentence,  expressed  as an  aggregate
       percentage,   shall  be  allocated  among  the  Non-Maturing  Classes  in
       proportion to their respective  Recalculated  Percentages (the portion of
       such  aggregate  reduction so allocated to any  Non-Maturing  Class,  the
       "Adjustment Percentage"); and (d) for purposes of such Distribution Date,
       the Prepayment  Distribution  Percentage of each Non-Maturing Class shall
       be  equal  to the  sum  of (1)  the  Prepayment  Distribution  Percentage
       thereof,  calculated in accordance  with the provisions in paragraph (ii)
       above as if the Certificate  Principal Balance of each Maturing Class had
       not been reduced to zero, plus (2) the related Adjustment Percentage.

       Principal Only Certificates:  Any one of the Class A-P Certificates.

          Standard Terms)

     Section 2.02  Acceptance  by Trustee.  (See  Section  2.02 of the  Standard
          Terms)

     Section  2.03  Representations,  Warranties  and  Covenants  of the  Master
          Servicer and the Company.

              (a) For  representations,  warranties  and covenants of the Master
       Servicer, see Section 2.03(a) of the Standard Terms.

              (b) The Company hereby  represents and warrants to the Trustee for
       the benefit of  Certificateholders  that as of the  Closing  Date (or, if
       otherwise specified below, as of the date so specified):

                     (i) No  Mortgage  Loan is 30 or  more  days  Delinquent  in
              payment of  principal  and  interest as of the Cut-off Date and no
              Mortgage  Loan  has  been  so  Delinquent  more  than  once in the
              12-month period prior to the Cut-off Date;

                     (ii) The  information  set forth in Exhibit One hereto with
              respect to each Mortgage Loan or the Mortgage  Loans,  as the case
              may be, is true and correct in all  material  respects at the date
              or dates respecting which such information is furnished;

                     (iii) The Mortgage Loans are  fully-amortizing,  fixed-rate
              mortgage loans with level Monthly  Payments due, with respect to a
              majority of the Mortgage Loans, on the first day of each month and
              terms to maturity at origination or  modification of not more than
              15 years;

                     (iv) To the best of the Company's knowledge,  if a Mortgage
              Loan is secured by a Mortgaged Property with a Loan-to-Value Ratio
              at origination in excess of 80%, such Mortgage Loan is the subject
              of a Primary  Insurance  Policy that insures that (a) at least 25%
              of  the  Stated   Principal   Balance  of  the  Mortgage  Loan  at
              origination  if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio is  between  95.00%  and
              90.01%,  (b) at least  12% of such  balance  if the  Loan-to-Value
              Ratio is between  90.00% and  85.01%,  and (c) at least 6% of such
              balance if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio is between 85.00% and 80.01%.
              To  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  each  such  Primary
              Insurance  Policy is in full force and  effect and the  Trustee is
              entitled to the benefits thereunder;

                     (v) The  issuers  of the  Primary  Insurance  Policies  are
              insurance  companies whose  claims-paying  abilities are currently
              acceptable to each Rating Agency;



                                            -13-

                     (vi) No more than 1.4% of the  Mortgage  Loans by aggregate
              Stated  Principal  Balance as of the  Cut-off  Date are secured by
              Mortgaged   Properties  located  in  any  one  zip  code  area  in
              California  and no  more  than  0.9%  of  the  Mortgage  Loans  by
              aggregate  Stated  Principal  Balance as of the  Cut-off  Date are
              secured by Mortgaged  Properties  located in any one zip code area
              outside California;

                     (vii) The  improvements  upon the Mortgaged  Properties are
              insured  against loss by fire and other hazards as required by the
              Program  Guide,  including  flood  insurance if required under the
              National  Flood  Insurance Act of 1968,  as amended.  The Mortgage
              requires the Mortgagor to maintain such casualty  insurance at the
              Mortgagor's  expense,  and on the  Mortgagor's  failure  to do so,
              authorizes  the holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such
              insurance  at the  Mortgagor's  expense and to seek  reimbursement
              therefor from the Mortgagor;

                     (viii)  Immediately prior to the assignment of the Mortgage
              Loans to the  Trustee,  the Company had good title to, and was the
              sole owner of,  each  Mortgage  Loan free and clear of any pledge,
              lien,  encumbrance  or  security  interest  (other  than rights to
              servicing and related  compensation)  and such assignment  validly
              transfers  ownership of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee free and
              clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or security interest;

                     (ix) 19.96% of the Mortgage Loans were underwritten under a
              reduced loan documentation program;

                     (x) Each Mortgagor represented in its loan application with
              respect to the related  Mortgage Loan that the Mortgaged  Property
              would be  owner-occupied  and  therefore  would not be an investor
              property as of the date of  origination  of such Mortgage Loan. No
              Mortgagor is a corporation or a partnership;

                     (xi) None of the Mortgage Loans is a Buydown Mortgage Loan;

                     (xii) Each Mortgage Loan  constitutes a qualified  mortgage
              under Section  860G(a)(3)(A) of the Code and Treasury  Regulations
              Section 1.860G-2(a)(1);

                     (xiii) A policy of title  insurance was effective as of the
              closing of each Mortgage Loan and is valid and binding and remains
              in full force and  effect,  unless the  Mortgaged  Properties  are
              located  in the State of Iowa and an  attorney's  certificate  has
              been provided as described in the Program Guide;

                     (xiv) None of the Mortgage Loans are Cooperative Loans;

                     (xv) With respect to each Mortgage Loan originated  under a
              "streamlined"  Mortgage  Loan  program  (through  which  no new or
              updated  appraisals  of  Mortgaged   Properties  are  obtained  in
              connection with the refinancing  thereof),  the related Seller has
              represented  that  either (a) the value of the  related  Mortgaged
              Property as of the date the Mortgage Loan was  originated  was not
              less than the appraised value of such


                                            -14-

<PAGE>



              property at the time of  origination  of the  refinanced  Mortgage
              Loan or (b) the Loan-  to-Value  Ratio of the Mortgage  Loan as of
              the date of origination  of the Mortgage Loan generally  meets the
              Company's underwriting guidelines;

                     (xvi)  Interest on each  Mortgage Loan is calculated on the
              basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months; and

                     (xvii) None of the Mortgage  Loans are Pledged  Asset Loans
              or Additional Collateral Loans.

It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.03(b) shall survive delivery of the respective  Mortgage Files to
the Trustee or any Custodian.

       Upon discovery by any of the Company, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
any Custodian of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 2.03(b) that  materially and adversely  affects the interests of
the  Certificateholders  in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach
shall give prompt written  notice to the other parties (any  Custodian  being so
obligated under a Custodial Agreement);  provided, however, that in the event of
a breach of the representation  and warranty set forth in Section  2.03(b)(xii),
the party  discovering  such breach  shall give such notice  within five days of
discovery.  Within 90 days of its  discovery or its receipt of notice of breach,
the Company  shall either (i) cure such breach in all material  respects or (ii)
purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the
manner set forth in  Section  2.02;  provided  that the  Company  shall have the
option to  substitute  a Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans for such
Mortgage Loan if such substitution occurs within two years following the Closing
Date;  provided  that if the omission or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to
be other than a  "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the
Code,  any such cure or repurchase  must occur within 90 days from the date such
breach was discovered.  Any such  substitution  shall be effected by the Company
under  the  same  terms  and   conditions   as  provided  in  Section  2.04  for
substitutions  by  Residential  Funding.  It is  understood  and agreed that the
obligation  of the Company to cure such  breach or to so purchase or  substitute
for any Mortgage  Loan as to which such a breach has occurred and is  continuing
shall  constitute  the sole  remedy  respecting  such  breach  available  to the
Certificateholders   or  the  Trustee  on  behalf  of  the   Certificateholders.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  shall  not be  required  to cure
breaches  or  purchase  or  substitute  for  Mortgage  Loans as provided in this
Section  2.03(b) if the  substance of the breach of a  representation  set forth
above also constitutes fraud in the origination of the Mortgage Loan.

     Section 2.04  Representations and Warranties of Sellers.  (See Section 2.04
          of the Standard Terms)

       Section 2.05  Execution and Authentication of Certificates.

       The Trustee  acknowledges  the assignment to it of the Mortgage Loans and
the  delivery  of the  Mortgage  Files to it, or any  Custodian  on its  behalf,
subject to any exceptions noted, together with the assignment to it of all other
assets  included  in the Trust  Fund,  receipt of which is hereby  acknowledged.
Concurrently with such delivery and in exchange therefor, the Trustee, pursuant


                                            -15-

the  Company  the  Certificates  in  authorized   denominations  which  evidence

       Distribution  Amount,  in reduction of the Certificate  Principal Balance
       thereof,  until such  Certificate  Principal  Balance has been reduced to
       zero; third, to the Senior Support Certificates, up to an amount equal to
       the Accrued  Certificate  Interest  thereon;  and  fourth,  to the Senior
       Support  Certificates,  the remainder,  until the  Certificate  Principal
       Balance thereof has been reduced to zero.

              (d) On or after the  occurrence  of the Credit  Support  Depletion
       Date and after the reduction of the Certificate  Principal Balance of the
       Senior  Support   Certificates  to  zero,  all  priorities   relating  to
       distributions as described in clauses 4.02(b) and (c) above in respect of
       principal  among the various classes of Senior  Certificates  (other than
       the Class A-P Certificates)  will be disregarded,  an amount equal to the
       Discount  Fraction of the  principal  portion of  scheduled  payments and
       unscheduled  collections  received  or  advanced  in respect of  Discount
       Mortgage Loans will be distributed to the Class A-P Certificates, and the
       Senior  Principal  Distribution  Amount will be  distributed to the Super
       Senior  Certificates and the amount set forth in Section  4.02(a)(i) will
       be distributed as set forth therein.

              (e) After the reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balances of
       the Senior  Certificates  (other than the Class A-P Certificates) to zero
       but prior to the Credit Support  Depletion Date, the Senior  Certificates
       (other  than the Class A-P  Certificates)  will be entitled to no further
       distributions of principal thereon and the Available  Distribution Amount
       will be paid solely to the holders of the Class A-P  Certificates,  Class
       A-V Certificates,  Class M Certificates and Class B Certificates, in each
       case as described herein.

              (f) In addition to the  foregoing  distributions,  with respect to
       any Subsequent  Recoveries,  the Master Servicer shall deposit such funds
       into the Custodial  Account pursuant to Section  3.07(b)(iii).  If, after
       taking into account such Subsequent Recoveries,  the amount of a Realized
       Loss is reduced, the amount of such Subsequent Recoveries will be applied
       to increase the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class of Subordinate
       Certificates  with the Highest Priority to which Realized  Losses,  other
       than Excess Bankruptcy Losses, Excess Fraud Losses, Excess Special Hazard
       Losses and  Extraordinary  Losses,  have been allocated,  but not by more
       than the amount of Realized Losses previously  allocated to that Class of
       Certificates  pursuant  to  Section  4.05.  The  amount of any  remaining
       Subsequent  Recoveries  will  be  applied  to  increase  the  Certificate
       Principal  Balance  of the  Class of  Certificates  with  the next  Lower
       Priority,  up to the amount of such Realized Losses previously  allocated
       to that Class of  Certificates  pursuant to Section  4.05.  Any remaining
       Subsequent Recoveries will in turn be applied to increase the Certificate
       Principal  Balance  of the  Class of  Certificates  with  the next  Lower
       Priority up to the amount of such Realized Losses previously allocated to
       that Class of Certificates pursuant to Section 4.05, and so on. Holders

       of such  Certificates  will not be  entitled to any payment in respect of
       Accrued  Certificate  Interest  on the amount of such  increases  for any
       Interest  Accrual Period  preceding the  Distribution  Date on which such
       increase  occurs.  Any such increases shall be applied to the Certificate
       Principal  Balance of each  Certificate of such Class in accordance  with
       its respective Percentage Interest.

              (g) Each  distribution  with respect to a  Book-Entry  Certificate
       shall be paid to the Depository,  as Holder  thereof,  and the Depository
       shall be solely responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution
       to the accounts of its  Depository  Participants  in accordance  with its
       normal procedures.  Each Depository  Participant shall be responsible for
       disbursing such distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents
       and to each indirect  participating  brokerage firm (a "brokerage  firm")
       for which it acts as agent.  Each brokerage firm shall be responsible for
       disbursing  funds to the Certificate  Owners that it represents.  None of
       the  Trustee,  the  Certificate  Registrar,  the  Company  or the  Master
       Servicer shall have any responsibility therefor.

              (h) Except as otherwise  provided in Section  9.01,  if the Master
       Servicer  anticipates that a final distribution with respect to any Class
       of Certificates  will be made on the next  Distribution  Date, the Master
       Servicer shall, no later than the Determination Date in the month of such
       final  distribution,  notify the Trustee and the Trustee shall,  no later
       than two (2) Business Days after such  Determination  Date,  mail on such
       date to each Holder of such Class of  Certificates a notice to the effect
       that:  (i) the  Trustee  anticipates  that the  final  distribution  with
       respect to such Class of Certificates  will be made on such  Distribution
       Date but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the
       office of the  Trustee or as  otherwise  specified  therein,  and (ii) no
       interest shall accrue on such  Certificates from and after the end of the
       related  Interest  Accrual Period.  In the event that  Certificateholders
       required to surrender their  Certificates  pursuant to Section 9.01(c) do
       not surrender  their  Certificates  for final  cancellation,  the Trustee
       shall cause funds  distributable  with respect to such Certificates to be
       withdrawn from the Certificate  Account and credited to a separate escrow
       account for the benefit of such Certificateholders as provided in Section
       9.01(d).

     Section 4.03 Statements to Certificateholders; Exchange Act Reporting. (See
          Section  4.03(a)  through (d) of the Standard  Terms and Exhibit Three
          attached hereto)

              (e) The  Trustee  will make the  reports  referred  to in  Section
       4.03(a) (and, at its option,  any  additional  files  containing the same
       information   in  an   alternative   format)   available  each  month  to
       Certificateholders  and other  parties to the Agreement via the Trustee's
       website, which is presently located at www.abs.bankone.com.  Persons that
       are unable to use the above  website  are  entitled  to have a paper copy
       mailed to them via first  class  mail by  calling  the  Trustee  at (800)
       524-9472.  The Trustee shall have the right to change the way the reports
       referred  to in Section  4.03(a)  are  distributed  in order to make such
       distribution  more convenient and/or more accessible to the above parties
       and to the  Certificateholders.  The  Trustee  shall  provide  timely and
       adequate  notification  to all the  parties  mentioned  above  and to the
       Certificateholders regarding any such change.

              (f) The Master  Servicer  shall, on behalf of the Depositor and in
       respect of the Trust Fund, sign and cause to be filed with the Commission
       any periodic  reports  required to be filed under the  provisions  of the
       Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
       In connection with the  preparation and filing of such periodic  reports,
       the Trustee  shall  timely  provide to the Master  Servicer (I) a list of
       Certificateholders  as shown on the Certificate Register as of the end of
       each calendar year, (II) copies of all pleadings, other legal process and
       any  other  documents  relating  to any  claims,  charges  or  complaints
       involving the Trustee,  as trustee hereunder,  or the Trust Fund that are
       received by the Trustee,  (III) notice of all matters that, to the actual
       knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, have been submitted to
       a vote of the Certificateholders, other than those matters that have been
       submitted  to a vote  of the  Certificateholders  at the  request  of the
       Depositor or the Master  Servicer,  and (IV) notice of any failure of the
       Trustee to make any  distribution to the  Certificateholders  as required
       pursuant to this  Agreement.  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee
       shall have any liability with respect to the Master Servicer's failure to
       properly prepare or file such periodic reports resulting from or relating
       to the Master  Servicer's  inability or failure to obtain any information
       not  resulting  from the  Master  Servicer's  own  negligence  or willful
       misconduct.  Any Form 10-K filed with the  Commission in connection  with
       this  clause  (f) shall  include a  certification,  signed by the  senior
       officer in charge of the servicing  functions of the Master Servicer,  in
       the form  attached  as Exhibit  Five  hereto or such other form as may be
       required or permitted by the Commission (the "Form 10-K  Certification"),
       in compliance  with Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and any
       additional directives of the Commission. In connection with the Form 10-K
       Certification,  the  Trustee  shall  provide the Master  Servicer  with a
       back-up  certification  substantially  in the  form  attached  hereto  as
       Exhibit Six.

     Section 4.04  Distribution  of  Reports  to the  Trustee  and the  Company;
          Advances by the Master  Servicer.  (See  Section  4.04 of the Standard
          Terms)

       Section 4.05  Allocation of Realized Losses.

       Prior to each Distribution  Date, the Master Servicer shall determine the
total  amount  of  Realized  Losses,   if  any,  that  resulted  from  any  Cash
Liquidation, Servicing Modification, Debt Service Reduction, Deficient Valuation
or REO Disposition that occurred during the related Prepayment Period or, in the
case of a Servicing  Modification  that  constitutes a reduction of the interest
rate on a Mortgage Loan, the amount of the reduction in the interest  portion of
the  Monthly  Payment  due during the  related  Due  Period.  The amount of each
Realized  Loss shall be  evidenced  by an  Officers'  Certificate.  All Realized
Losses, other than Excess Special Hazard Losses,  Extraordinary  Losses,  Excess
Bankruptcy Losses or Excess Fraud Losses, shall be allocated as follows:  first,
to the Class B-3 Certificates  until the Certificate  Principal  Balance thereof
has been  reduced  to zero;  second,  to the  Class B-2  Certificates  until the
Certificate  Principal  Balance thereof has been reduced to zero;  third, to the
Class B-1 Certificates until the Certificate  Principal Balance thereof has been
reduced to zero;  fourth,  to the Class M-3  Certificates  until the Certificate
Principal  Balance  thereof has been  reduced to zero;  fifth,  to the Class M-2
Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to
zero;  sixth,  to the Class M-1  Certificates  until the  Certificate  Principal
Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; and, thereafter,  if any such Realized
Losses are on a Discount  Mortgage  Loan,  to the Class A-P  Certificates  in an
amount equal to the


                                            -27-

<PAGE>



Discount  Fraction of the principal  portion thereof,  and the remainder of such
Realized  Losses on the Discount  Mortgage  Loans and the entire  amount of such
Realized Losses on  Non-Discount  Mortgage Loans will be allocated among all the
Senior Certificates (other than the Class A-P Certificates) on a pro rata basis,
as described below. Any Excess Special Hazard Losses,  Excess Bankruptcy Losses,
Excess Fraud Losses, Extraordinary Losses on Non-Discount Mortgage Loans will be
allocated among the Senior  Certificates (other than the Class A-P Certificates)
and  Subordinate  Certificates,  on a pro rata basis,  as described  below.  The
principal portion of such Realized Losses on the Discount Mortgage Loans will be
allocated  to the Class A-P  Certificates  in an  amount  equal to the  Discount
Fraction  thereof and the  remainder  of such  Realized  Losses on the  Discount
Mortgage  Loans and the entire  amount of such Realized  Losses on  Non-Discount
Mortgage Loans will be allocated among the Senior  Certificates  (other than the
Class A-P  Certificates) and Subordinate  Certificates,  on a pro rata basis, as
described  below,  provided,  however,  that Realized  Losses (other than Excess
Special  Hazard  Losses,  Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess  Fraud  Losses and
Extraordinary  Losses) otherwise allocable to the Super Senior Certificates will
be allocated to the Senior Support Certificates until the Certificate  Principal
Balance thereof is reduced to zero.

       As used herein,  an  allocation  of a Realized Loss on a "pro rata basis"
among two or more specified Classes of Certificates means an allocation on a pro
rata  basis,  among the  various  Classes  so  specified,  to each such Class of
Certificates  on the  basis  of their  then  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
Balances prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such Distribution
Date in the case of the  principal  portion of a  Realized  Loss or based on the
Accrued Certificate  Interest thereon payable on such Distribution Date (without
regard to any Compensating  Interest for such Distribution  Date) in the case of
an interest  portion of a Realized  Loss.  Except as  provided in the  following
sentence, any allocation of the principal portion of Realized Losses (other than
Debt Service  Reductions) to a Class of  Certificates  shall be made by reducing
the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  thereof by the amount so allocated,  which
allocation  shall be deemed to have  occurred  on such  Distribution  Date.  Any
allocation of the principal  portion of Realized Losses (other than Debt Service
Reductions) to the Subordinate  Certificates  then  outstanding  with the Lowest
Priority shall be made by operation of the definition of "Certificate  Principal
Balance" and by operation of the provisions of Section  4.02(a).  Allocations of
the  interest  portions of Realized  Losses shall be made in  proportion  to the
amount of Accrued  Certificate  Interest and by operation of the  definition  of
"Accrued  Certificate  Interest"  and by operation of the  provisions of Section
4.02(a).  Allocations of the principal portion of Debt Service  Reductions shall
be made by operation of the provisions of Section  4.02(a).  All Realized Losses
and all other losses  allocated  to a Class of  Certificates  hereunder  will be
allocated  among the  Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage
Interests  evidenced  thereby;  provided that if any Subclasses of the Class A-V
Certificates have been issued pursuant to Section 5.01(c),  such Realized Losses
and other  losses  allocated  to the Class A-V  Certificates  shall be allocated
among  such  Subclasses  in  proportion  to the  respective  amounts  of Accrued
Certificate  Interest payable on such Distribution Date that would have resulted
absent such reductions.

Opinion of Counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer to the effect that the purchase or
holding of such Class B or Class R Certificate is permissible  under  applicable
law, will not  constitute  or result in any  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction
under  Section 406 of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"),  or Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable provisions of any
subsequent  enactments),  and will not subject the  Trustee,  the Company or the
Master  Servicer  to any  obligation  or  liability  (including  obligations  or
liabilities  under  ERISA or  Section  4975 of the  Code) in  addition  to those
undertaken in this  Agreement,  which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense
of the  Trustee,  the  Company or the  Master  Servicer  or (B) the  prospective
Transferee shall be required to provide the Trustee,  the Company and the Master
Servicer  with a  certification  to the  effect  set forth in  paragraph  six of
Exhibit H (with  respect to any Class B  Certificate)  or paragraph  fourteen of
Exhibit G-1 to the  Standard  Terms (with  respect to any Class R  Certificate),
which the Trustee may rely upon without  further  inquiry or  investigation,  or
such other  certifications  as the Trustee may deem  desirable  or  necessary in
order to  establish  that  such  Transferee  or the  Person  in whose  name such
registration  is requested  either (a) is not an employee  benefit plan or other
plan subject to the prohibited  transaction  provisions of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code, or any Person (including an investment  manager,  a named fiduciary
or a trustee  of any such plan) who is using  "plan  assets" of any such plan to

95-60 have been  satisfied  (each  entity  that  satisfies  this  clause  (b), a
"Complying Insurance Company").

     (ii)  Any  Transferee  of a Class M  Certificate  will  be  deemed  to have
represented  by  virtue of its  purchase  or  holding  of such  Certificate  (or
interest therein) that either (a) such Transferee is not a Plan Investor, (b) it
has  acquired  and  is  holding  such  Certificate  in  reliance  on  Prohibited

conditions  to the  availability  of  the  RFC  Exemption  including  that  such
Certificate must be rated, at the time of purchase, not lower than

Transferee is a Complying Insurance Company.

                     (iii)  (A) If any  Class M  Certificate  (or  any  interest
therein) is acquired
or held by any  Person  that  does  not  satisfy  the  conditions  described  in
paragraph (ii) above, then the last preceding  Transferee that either (i) is not
a Plan  Investor,  (ii) acquired  such  Certificate  in compliance  with the RFC
Exemption,  or (iii) is a Complying Insurance Company shall be restored,  to the
extent  permitted by law, to all rights and  obligations  as  Certificate  Owner
thereof  retroactive  to the date of such Transfer of such Class M  Certificate.
The Trustee  shall be under no  liability  to any Person for making any payments
due on such Certificate to such preceding Transferee.

to  itself,  as  the  holder  of the  Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular  Interests,
Uncertificated  Accrued Interest on the  Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interests
for such  Distribution  Date, plus any  Uncertificated  Accrued Interest thereon
remaining unpaid from any previous Distribution Date.

       (b) In  determining  from time to time the  Uncertificated  REMIC Regular
Interest  Distribution  Amounts,  Realized  Losses  allocated  to the  Class A-V
Certificates  under  Section 4.05 shall be deemed  allocated  to  Uncertificated
REMIC Regular Interests on a pro rata basis based on the Uncertificated  Accrued
Interest for the related Distribution Date.

       (c) On each Distribution  Date, the Trustee shall be deemed to distribute
from the Trust Fund, in the priority set forth in Section 4.02(a),  to the Class
A-V  Certificates,  the amounts  distributable  thereon from the  Uncertificated
REMIC Regular Interest  Distribution Amounts deemed to have been received by the
Trustee  from the Trust  Fund  under  this  Section  10.04.  The  amount  deemed
distributable  hereunder with respect to the Class A-V Certificates  shall equal
100% of the amounts  payable with respect to the  Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular
Interests.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Trustee or any
Paying  Agent,  as  applicable,   shall  comply  with  all  federal  withholding
requirements  respecting payments to  Certificateholders,  including interest or
original  interest discount payments or advances thereof that the Trustee or any
Paying Agent, as applicable,  reasonably believes are applicable under the Code.
The consent of Certificateholders shall not be required for such withholding. In
the event the Trustee or any Paying  Agent,  as  applicable,  does  withhold any
amount from interest or original issue discount  payments or advances thereof to
any Certificateholder pursuant to federal withholding requirements,  the Trustee
or any Paying Agent,  as applicable,  shall indicate the amount withheld to such
Certificateholder pursuant to the terms of such requirements.

        (d)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section  2.01(c),  in connection
with any  Mortgage  Loan,  if the Company  cannot  deliver  the  original of the
Mortgage, any assignment,  modification,  assumption agreement or preferred loan
agreement  (or copy thereof as permitted by Section  2.01(b))  with  evidence of
recording thereon concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
because  of (i) a  delay  caused  by the  public  recording  office  where  such
Mortgage,  assignment,  modification,  assumption  agreement or  preferred  loan
agreement  as the case may be, has been  delivered  for  recordation,  or (ii) a
delay in the  receipt of certain  information  necessary  to prepare the related
assignments,  the Company  shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee
or the respective Custodian a copy of such Mortgage,  assignment,  modification,
assumption agreement or preferred loan agreement.

        The Company  shall  promptly  cause to be  recorded  in the  appropriate
public office for real  property  records the  Assignment  referred to in clause
(I)(iii)  of Section  2.01(b),  except (a) in states  where,  in the  opinion of
counsel acceptable to the Trustee and the Master Servicer, such recording is not
required to protect the  Trustee's  interests in the  Mortgage  Loan against the
claim of any  subsequent  transferee  or any  successor  to or  creditor  of the
Company or the  originator of such Mortgage Loan or (b) if MERS is identified on
the  Mortgage  or on a  properly  recorded  assignment  of the  Mortgage  as the
mortgagee  of record  solely as nominee  for the Seller and its  successors  and
assigns,  and shall  promptly  cause to be filed the Form UCC-3  assignment  and
UCC-1 financing statement referred to in clause (II)(vii) and (x), respectively,
of Section 2.01(b). If any Assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1, as applicable,
is lost or returned unrecorded to the Company because of any defect therein, the
Company  shall  prepare a substitute  Assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1,  as
applicable,  or cure such defect,  as the case may be, and cause such Assignment
to be recorded in accordance  with this  paragraph.  The Company shall  promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the respective Custodian such
Mortgage or  Assignment  or Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1,  as  applicable,  (or copy
thereof as permitted by Section  2.01(b)) with  evidence of recording  indicated
thereon  at the time  specified  in  Section  2.01(c).  In  connection  with its
servicing of Cooperative Loans, the Master Servicer will use its best efforts to
file timely continuation  statements with regard to each financing statement and
assignment  relating to  Cooperative  Loans as to which the related  Cooperative
Apartment is located outside of the State of New York.

        If the Company delivers to the Trustee or Custodian any Mortgage Note or
Assignment of Mortgage in blank, the Company shall, or shall cause the Custodian
to, complete the endorsement of the Mortgage Note and the Assignment of Mortgage
in the name of the Trustee in conjunction with the Interim  Certification issued
by the Custodian, as contemplated by Section 2.02.

        Any of the items set forth in Sections  2.01(b)(I)(ii),  (iii), (iv) and
(v) and  (II)(vi)  and (vii) and that may be delivered as a copy rather than the
original may be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian.

        In connection with the assignment of any Mortgage Loan registered on the
MERS(R) System,  the Company further agrees that it will cause, at the Company's
own expense,  within 30 Business Days after the Closing Date, the MERS(R) System
to indicate  that such  Mortgage  Loans have been assigned by the Company to the
Trustee   in   accordance   with  this   Agreement   for  the   benefit  of  the
Certificateholders  by including  (or  deleting,  in the case of Mortgage  Loans
which are  repurchased in accordance with this Agreement) in such computer files
(a) the code in the field which identifies


                                              33

<PAGE>



the specific Trustee and (b) the code in the field "Pool Field" which identifies
the series of the  Certificates  issued in connection  with such Mortgage Loans.
The  Company  further  agrees  that it will not,  and will not permit the Master
Servicer to, and the Master  Servicer  agrees that it will not,  alter the codes
referenced in this  paragraph  with respect to any Mortgage Loan during the term
of this  Agreement  unless  and  until  such  Mortgage  Loan is  repurchased  in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

        (e)  Residential  Funding  hereby  assigns to the Trustee  its  security
interest in and to any  Additional  Collateral or Pledged  Assets,  its right to
receive amounts due or to become due in respect of any Additional  Collateral or
Pledged Assets pursuant to the related Subservicing  Agreement and its rights as
beneficiary under the Surety Bond in respect of any Additional Collateral Loans.
With  respect  to  any  Additional   Collateral  Loan  or  Pledged  Asset  Loan,
Residential Funding shall cause to be filed in the appropriate  recording office
a UCC-3  statement  giving  notice of the  assignment  of the  related  security
interest to the Trust Fund and shall  thereafter  cause the timely filing of all
necessary continuation statements with regard to such financing statements.

        (f) It is intended that the  conveyance by the Company to the Trustee of
the   Mortgage   Loans  as  provided  for  in  this  Section  2.01  be  and  the
Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular  Interests,  if any (as  provided  for in Section
2.06),  be  construed  as a sale by the Company to the  Trustee of the  Mortgage
Loans and any  Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular  Interests  for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.  Further,  it is not intended that such conveyance be deemed
to be a pledge  of the  Mortgage  Loans  and any  Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular
Interests by the Company to the Trustee to secure a debt or other  obligation of
the Company. However, if the Mortgage Loans and any Uncertificated REMIC Regular
Interests are held to be property of the Company or of Residential  Funding,  or
if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest
in the Mortgage Loans and any Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests, then it is
intended  that (a) this  Agreement  shall be a  security  agreement  within  the
meaning of  Articles  8 and 9 of the New York  Uniform  Commercial  Code and the
Uniform Commercial Code of any other applicable jurisdiction; (b) the conveyance
provided  for in Section  2.01 shall be deemed to be, and hereby is, (1) a grant
by the  Company to the Trustee of a security  interest  in all of the  Company's
right (including the power to convey title thereto), title and interest, whether
now owned or  hereafter  acquired,  in and to any and all  general  intangibles,
payment intangibles,  accounts,  chattel paper, instruments,  documents,  money,
deposit accounts,  certificates of deposit, goods, letters of credit, advices of
credit  and  investment   property  and  other  property  of  whatever  kind  or
description  now existing or hereafter  acquired  consisting of, arising from or
relating to any of the  following:  (A) the Mortgage  Loans,  including (i) with
respect to each Cooperative Loan, the related Mortgage Note, Security Agreement,
Assignment of Proprietary  Lease,  Cooperative Stock Certificate and Cooperative
Lease,  (ii) with respect to each Mortgage  Loan other than a Cooperative  Loan,
the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage, and (iii) any insurance policies and all
other documents in the related  Mortgage File, (B) all amounts payable  pursuant
to  the  Mortgage  Loans  in  accordance   with  the  terms  thereof,   (C)  any
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular  Interests and (D) all proceeds of the conversion,
voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or
other property,  including without limitation all amounts from time to time held
or invested in the Certificate Account or the Custodial Account,  whether in the
form of cash, instruments, securities or other property and (2) an assignment by
the  Company  to the  Trustee  of  any  security  interest  in  any  and  all of
Residential Funding's right (including the power to convey title thereto), title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter


                                              34

<PAGE>



acquired, in and to the property described in the foregoing clauses (1)(A), (B),
(C) and (D)  granted by  Residential  Funding  to the  Company  pursuant  to the
Assignment  Agreement;  (c) the possession by the Trustee,  the Custodian or any
other agent of the Trustee of Mortgage  Notes or such other items of property as
constitute instruments, money, payment intangibles, negotiable documents, goods,
deposit accounts,  letters of credit,  advices of credit,  investment  property,
certificated  securities or chattel paper shall be deemed to be  "possession  by
the secured party," or possession by a purchaser or a person  designated by such
secured party, for purposes of perfecting the security  interest pursuant to the
Minnesota Uniform  Commercial Code and the Uniform  Commercial Code of any other
applicable  jurisdiction as in effect (including,  without limitation,  Sections
8-106,  9-313 and 9-106 thereof);  and (d) notifications to persons holding such
property,  and  acknowledgments,  receipts or confirmations from persons holding
such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, securities intermediaries,  bailees or agents of, or persons
holding for (as  applicable)  the Trustee  for the  purpose of  perfecting  such
security interest under applicable law.

        The Company and, at the Company's direction, Residential Funding and the
Trustee  shall,  to  the  extent  consistent  with  this  Agreement,  take  such
reasonable  actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this  Agreement  were
determined  to  create  a  security   interest  in  the  Mortgage   Loans,   any
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interests and the other property  described above,
such security  interest would be determined to be a perfected  security interest
of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout
the term of this  Agreement.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior
to any filing date and, the Trustee shall forward for filing,  or shall cause to
be forwarded for filing, at the expense of the Company, all filings necessary to
maintain the  effectiveness of any original filings  necessary under the Uniform
Commercial  Code as in effect  in any  jurisdiction  to  perfect  the  Trustee's
security interest in or lien on the Mortgage Loans and any Uncertificated  REMIC
Regular  Interests,  as evidenced by an  Officers'  Certificate  of the Company,
including  without  limitation (x) continuation  statements,  and (y) such other
statements  as may be  occasioned  by (1) any  change  of  name  of  Residential
Funding, the Company or the Trustee (such preparation and filing shall be at the
expense of the Trustee,  if occasioned by a change in the Trustee's  name),  (2)
any change of location of the place of business or the chief executive office of
Residential  Funding  or the  Company,  (3)  any  transfer  of any  interest  of
Residential  Funding or the Company in any Mortgage  Loan or (4) any transfer of
any interest of Residential  Funding or the Company in any Uncertificated  REMIC
Regular Interest.

        (g) The Master  Servicer  hereby  acknowledges  the receipt by it of the
Initial  Monthly  Payment  Fund.  The Master  Servicer  shall hold such  Initial
Monthly  Payment Fund in the  Custodial  Account and shall  include such Initial
Monthly  Payment  Fund in the  Available  Distribution  Amount  for the  initial
Distribution Date.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Initial
Monthly  Payment Fund shall not be an asset of any REMIC. To the extent that the
Initial Monthly  Payment Fund  constitutes a reserve fund for federal income tax
purposes, (1) it shall be an outside reserve fund and not an asset of any REMIC,
(2) it shall be owned by the Seller and (3) amounts  transferred by any REMIC to
the Initial  Monthly  Payment Fund shall be treated as transferred to the Seller
or any successor,  all within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(h) of the Treasury
Regulations.

        (h) The Company agrees that the sale of each Pledged Asset Loan pursuant
to this  Agreement  will also  constitute the  assignment,  sale,  setting-over,
transfer and  conveyance  to the Trustee,  without  recourse (but subject to the
Company's  covenants,   representations  and  warranties  specifically  provided
herein),  of all of the Company's  obligations  and all of the Company's  right,
title and interest in, to and under,  whether now existing or hereafter acquired
as owner of the Mortgage  Loan with respect to all money,  securities,  security
entitlements,    accounts,   general   intangibles,    instruments,   documents,
certificates of deposit,  commodities  contracts,  and other investment property
and other property of whatever kind or  description  consisting of, arising from
or related to (i) the Assigned Contracts,  (ii) all rights,  powers and remedies
of the Company as owner of such Mortgage  Loan under or in  connection  with the
Assigned Contracts,  whether arising under the terms of such Assigned Contracts,
by statute,  at law or in equity, or otherwise arising out of any default by the
Mortgagor  under or in  connection  with the Assigned  Contracts,  including all
rights  to  exercise  any  election  or  option  or  to  make  any  decision  or
determination  or to give or receive  any  notice,  consent,  approval or waiver
thereunder,  (iii) all security interests in and lien of the Company as owner of
such Mortgage Loan in the Pledged  Amounts and all money,  securities,  security
entitlements,    accounts,   general   intangibles,    instruments,   documents,
certificates of deposit,  commodities  contracts,  and other investment property
and other  property of whatever  kind or  description  and all cash and non-cash
proceeds of the sale,  exchange,  or redemption  of, and all stock or conversion
rights,  rights  to  subscribe,  liquidation  dividends  or  preferences,  stock
dividends,  rights to interest,  dividends,  earnings,  income,  rents,  issues,
profits, interest payments or other distributions of cash or other property that
is credited to the  Custodial  Account,  (iv) all  documents,  books and records
concerning the foregoing  (including  all computer  programs,  tapes,  disks and
related items containing any such  information)  and (v) all insurance  proceeds
(including  proceeds  from the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  or the
Securities  Investor  Protection  Corporation or any other insurance company) of
any of the foregoing or replacements thereof or substitutions therefor, proceeds
of proceeds and the conversion,  voluntary or involuntary,  of any thereof.  The
foregoing transfer,  sale,  assignment and conveyance does not constitute and is
not intended to result in the creation,  or an assumption by the Trustee, of any
obligation of the Company,  or any other person in  connection  with the Pledged
Assets or under any  agreement or  instrument  relating  thereto,  including any
obligation to the Mortgagor, other than as owner of the Mortgage Loan.

        Section 2.02  Acceptance by Trustee.
                      ---------------------

        The Trustee  acknowledges  receipt (or,  with respect to Mortgage  Loans
subject  to  a  Custodial  Agreement,   and  based  solely  upon  a  receipt  or
certification executed by the Custodian,  receipt by the respective Custodian as
the duly appointed agent of the Trustee) of the documents referred to in Section
2.01(b)(I)(i)  and Section  2.01(b)(II)(i),  (iii),  (v),  (vi) and (viii) above
(except that for purposes of such  acknowledgment  only, a Mortgage  Note may be
endorsed in blank) and declares that it, or a Custodian as its agent,  holds and
will hold such  documents  and the other  documents  constituting  a part of the
Mortgage Files  delivered to it, or a Custodian as its agent,  and the rights of
Residential  Funding with respect to any Pledged Assets,  Additional  Collateral
and the Surety Bond  assigned to the Trustee  pursuant to Section 2.01, in trust
for the use and  benefit  of all  present  and  future  Certificateholders.  The
Trustee or  Custodian  (such  Custodian  being so  obligated  under a  Custodial
Agreement)  agrees,  for the  benefit  of  Certificateholders,  to  review  each
Mortgage File  delivered to it pursuant to Section  2.01(b) within 45 days after
the Closing Date to ascertain that all required  documents  (specifically as set
forth in Section 2.01(b)), have been executed and received,


                                              36

<PAGE>



and that such documents  relate to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage
Loan Schedule, as supplemented, that have been conveyed to it, and to deliver to
the Trustee a certificate (the "Interim  Certification")  to the effect that all
documents  required to be delivered  pursuant to Section 2.01(b) above have been
executed  and  received and that such  documents  relate to the  Mortgage  Loans
identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule,  except for any  exceptions  listed on
Schedule A attached to such Interim Certification. Upon delivery of the Mortgage
Files by the  Company or the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  shall  acknowledge
receipt (or, with respect to Mortgage  Loans  subject to a Custodial  Agreement,
and based  solely upon a receipt or  certification  executed  by the  Custodian,
receipt by the respective  Custodian as the duly appointed agent of the Trustee)
of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(c) above.

        If  the  Custodian,  as the  Trustee's  agent,  finds  any  document  or
documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be missing or defective, the
Trustee shall promptly so notify the Master  Servicer and the Company.  Pursuant
to Section 2.3 of the Custodial Agreement,  the Custodian will notify the Master
Servicer, the Company and the Trustee of any such omission or defect found by it
in respect of any Mortgage  File held by it in respect of the items  reviewed by
it pursuant to the Custodial  Agreement.  If such omission or defect  materially
and  adversely  affects  the  interests  of the  Certificateholders,  the Master
Servicer  shall  promptly  notify  the  related  Subservicer  or  Seller of such
omission or defect and request that such  Subservicer  or Seller correct or cure
such  omission or defect  within 60 days from the date the Master  Servicer  was
notified of such omission or defect and, if such  Subservicer or Seller does not
correct  or  cure  such  omission  or  defect  within  such  period,  that  such
Subservicer  or Seller  purchase  such  Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at its
Purchase  Price, in either case within 90 days from the date the Master Servicer
was notified of such omission or defect; provided that if the omission or defect
would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" as defined
in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, any such cure or repurchase must occur within
90 days from the date such breach was  discovered.  The  Purchase  Price for any
such Mortgage Loan, whether purchased by the Seller or the Subservicer, shall be
deposited  or caused to be  deposited  by the Master  Servicer in the  Custodial
Account  maintained  by it pursuant  to Section  3.07 and,  upon  receipt by the
Trustee of written  notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,
the Trustee or any  Custodian,  as the case may be, shall  release to the Master
Servicer the related  Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver
such instruments of transfer or assignment  prepared by the Master Servicer,  in
each case without  recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller or its
designee or the  Subservicer  or its designee,  as the case may be, any Mortgage
Loan released  pursuant  hereto and  thereafter  such Mortgage Loan shall not be
part of the Trust Fund. In furtherance of the foregoing,  if the  Subservicer or
Seller  that  repurchases  the  Mortgage  Loan is not a  member  of MERS and the
Mortgage is registered on the MERS(R) System,  the Master  Servicer,  at its own
expense and without any right of reimbursement,  shall cause MERS to execute and
deliver an  assignment  of the  Mortgage  in  recordable  form to  transfer  the
Mortgage from MERS to such  Subservicer  or Seller and shall cause such Mortgage
to be removed from  registration  on the MERS(R) System in accordance with MERS'
rules and  regulations.  It is understood  and agreed that the obligation of the
Seller  or the  Subservicer,  as the case  may be,  to so cure or  purchase  any
Mortgage  Loan as to which a material  and  adverse  defect in or  omission of a
constituent  document  exists shall  constitute the sole remedy  respecting such
defect or omission available to  Certificateholders  or the Trustee on behalf of
the Certificateholders.

               Servicer and the Company.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  hereby  represents and warrants to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders that:

                      (i) The Master  Servicer is a corporation  duly organized,
               validly  existing and in good standing  under the laws  governing
               its creation and existence  and is or will be in compliance  with
               the laws of each state in which any Mortgaged Property is located
               to the  extent  necessary  to ensure the  enforceability  of each
               Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

                      (ii) The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by the
               Master Servicer and its performance and compliance with the terms
               of  this  Agreement  will  not  violate  the  Master   Servicer's
               Certificate of  Incorporation  or Bylaws or constitute a material
               default  (or an event  which,  with  notice or lapse of time,  or
               both,  would  constitute a material  default) under, or result in
               the material breach of, any material contract, agreement or other
               instrument  to which the Master  Servicer is a party or which may
               be applicable to the Master Servicer or any of its assets;

                      (iii)  This   Agreement,   assuming   due   authorization,
               execution   and   delivery  by  the  Trustee  and  the   Company,
               constitutes a valid,  legal and binding  obligation of the Master
               Servicer,  enforceable  against it in  accordance  with the terms
               hereof    subject   to   applicable    bankruptcy,    insolvency,
               reorganization,   moratorium   and  other  laws   affecting   the
               enforcement  of  creditors'   rights  generally  and  to  general
               principles of equity,  regardless of whether such  enforcement is
               considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

                      (iv) The Master Servicer is not in default with respect to
               any  order or decree of any  court or any  order,  regulation  or
               demand of any federal,  state,  municipal or governmental agency,
               which default might have  consequences  that would materially and
               adversely affect the condition (financial or other) or operations
               of  the  Master   Servicer  or  its   properties  or  might  have
               consequences   that  would   materially   adversely   affect  its
               performance hereunder;

                      (v) No litigation is pending or, to the best of the Master
               Servicer's  knowledge,  threatened  against  the Master  Servicer
               which  would   prohibit  its  entering  into  this  Agreement  or
               performing its obligations under this Agreement;

                      (vi) The  Master  Servicer  will  comply  in all  material
               respects in the performance of this Agreement with all reasonable
               rules  and  requirements  of each  insurer  under  each  Required
               Insurance Policy;

                      (vii) No information, certificate of an officer, statement
               furnished  in writing or report  delivered  to the  Company,  any
               Affiliate  of the Company or the  Trustee by the Master  Servicer
               will, to the knowledge of the Master Servicer, contain

               any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit a material fact
               necessary  to make the  information,  certificate,  statement  or
               report not misleading;

                      (viii) The Master Servicer has examined each existing, and
               will examine each new,  Subservicing  Agreement and is or will be
               familiar  with the  terms  thereof.  The  terms of each  existing
               Subservicing   Agreement  and  each  designated  Subservicer  are
               acceptable  to the  Master  Servicer  and  any  new  Subservicing
               Agreements will comply with the provisions of Section 3.02; and

                      (ix)  The  Master  Servicer  is a  member  of MERS in good
               standing, and will comply in all material respects with the rules
               and  procedures of MERS in  connection  with the servicing of the
               Mortgage Loans that are registered with MERS.

               It  is  understood  and  agreed  that  the   representations  and
               warranties  set  forth  in this  Section  2.03(a)  shall  survive
               delivery of the  respective  Mortgage Files to the Trustee or any
               Custodian.

        Upon discovery by either the Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee
or any Custodian of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Section  2.03(a) which  materially  and  adversely  affects the interests of the
Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall
give  prompt  written  notice  to the  other  parties  (any  Custodian  being so
obligated under a Custodial  Agreement).  Within 90 days of its discovery or its
receipt of notice of such breach, the Master Servicer shall either (i) cure such
breach in all  material  respects or (ii) to the extent that such breach is with
respect to a Mortgage  Loan or a related  document,  purchase such Mortgage Loan
from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the manner set forth in Section
2.02;  provided  that if the omission or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to
be other than a  "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the
Code,  any such cure or repurchase  must occur within 90 days from the date such
breach was discovered. The obligation of the Master Servicer to cure such breach
or to so purchase such Mortgage Loan shall constitute the sole remedy in respect
of a breach of a  representation  and warranty set forth in this Section 2.03(a)
available   to  the   Certificateholders   or  the  Trustee  on  behalf  of  the
Certificateholders.

        (b)  Representations  and warranties  relating to the Mortgage Loans are
set forth in Section 2.03(b) of the Series Supplement.

        Section 2.04  Representations and Warranties of Sellers.
                      -----------------------------------------

        The Company,  as assignee of  Residential  Funding under the  Assignment
Agreement,  hereby assigns to the Trustee for the benefit of  Certificateholders
all of its right, title and interest in respect of the Assignment  Agreement and
each Seller's  Agreement (to the extent assigned to the Company  pursuant to the
Assignment  Agreement)  applicable to a Mortgage Loan. Insofar as the Assignment
Agreement or the Company's  rights under such Seller's  Agreement  relate to the
representations and warranties made by Residential Funding or the related Seller
in respect of such Mortgage Loan and any remedies  provided  thereunder  for any
breach of such  representations  and warranties,  such right, title and interest
may be  enforced  by the  Master  Servicer  on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and the
Certificateholders.  Upon the discovery by the Company, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or any

Custodian of a breach of any of the  representations  and  warranties  made in a
Seller's  Agreement  that have been  assigned  to the  Trustee  pursuant to this
Section 2.04 or of a breach of any of the representations and warranties made in
the Assignment  Agreement (which, for purposes hereof, will be deemed to include
any other cause  giving rise to a  repurchase  obligation  under the  Assignment
Agreement)  in  respect of any  Mortgage  Loan which  materially  and  adversely
affects the interests of the Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, the party
discovering  such breach shall give prompt  written  notice to the other parties
(any  Custodian  being so  obligated  under a Custodial  Agreement).  The Master
Servicer shall promptly notify the related Seller or Residential Funding, as the
case may be, of such breach and request that such Seller or Residential Funding,
as the case may be, either (i) cure such breach in all material  respects within
90 days from the date the Master  Servicer  was  notified of such breach or (ii)
purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the
manner set forth in Section  2.02;  provided  that in the case of a breach under
the Assignment Agreement Residential Funding shall have the option to substitute
a Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans for such  Mortgage Loan if such
substitution  occurs within two years following the Closing Date;  provided that
if the  breach  would  cause the  Mortgage  Loan to be other  than a  "qualified
mortgage"  as  defined  in  Section  860G(a)(3)  of the  Code,  any  such  cure,
repurchase  or  substitution  must occur within 90 days from the date the breach
was  discovered.  In the event that  Residential  Funding elects to substitute a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans for a Deleted Mortgage Loan pursuant
to this Section 2.04,  Residential  Funding shall deliver to the Trustee for the
benefit of the  Certificateholders  with  respect to such  Qualified  Substitute
Mortgage Loan or Loans, the original Mortgage Note, the Mortgage,  an Assignment
of the Mortgage in recordable  form if required  pursuant to Section  2.01,  and
such other  documents and  agreements as are required by Section 2.01,  with the
Mortgage Note endorsed as required by Section 2.01. No substitution will be made
in any  calendar  month after the  Determination  Date for such  month.  Monthly
Payments due with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of
substitution  shall not be part of the Trust  Fund and will be  retained  by the
Master  Servicer and remitted by the Master  Servicer to Residential  Funding on
the  next  succeeding   Distribution   Date.  For  the  month  of  substitution,
distributions to the Certificateholders  will include the Monthly Payment due on
a Deleted Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter  Residential Funding shall
be entitled to retain all amounts  received in respect of such Deleted  Mortgage
Loan.  The Master  Servicer shall amend or cause to be amended the Mortgage Loan
Schedule,  and, if the Deleted  Mortgage Loan was a Discount  Mortgage Loan, the
Schedule of Discount  Fractions,  for the benefit of the  Certificateholders  to
reflect the removal of such Deleted  Mortgage Loan and the  substitution  of the
Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans  and the  Master  Servicer  shall
deliver the amended  Mortgage Loan Schedule,  and, if the Deleted  Mortgage Loan
was a Discount Mortgage Loan, the amended Schedule of Discount Fractions, to the
Trustee. Upon such substitution, the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans
shall be subject to the terms of this  Agreement  and the  related  Subservicing
Agreement in all respects,  the related  Seller shall be deemed to have made the
representations and warranties with respect to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan contained in the related Seller's Agreement as of the date of substitution,
insofar as Residential  Funding's rights in respect of such  representations and
warranties are assigned to the Company pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, and
the Company and the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have made with respect to
any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, as of the date of substitution,
the covenants, representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.04, in
Section 2.03 hereof and in Section 4 of the Assignment Agreement, and the Master
Servicer  shall be obligated  to  repurchase  or  substitute  for any  Qualified
Substitute


                                              40

Mortgage  Loan as to which a  Repurchase  Event (as  defined  in the  Assignment
Agreement) has occurred pursuant to Section 4 of the Assignment Agreement.

        In connection with the substitution of one or more Qualified  Substitute
Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted  Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer will
determine  the amount (if any) by which the aggregate  principal  balance of all
such Qualified  Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less
than the aggregate Stated  Principal  Balance of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans
(in each case after application of the principal portion of the Monthly Payments
due  in  the  month  of   substitution   that  are  to  be  distributed  to  the
Certificateholders  in the month of  substitution).  Residential  Funding  shall
deposit the amount of such  shortfall  into the Custodial  Account on the day of
substitution, without any reimbursement therefor. Residential Funding shall give
notice  in  writing  to the  Trustee  of  such  event,  which  notice  shall  be
accompanied by an Officers'  Certificate as to the calculation of such shortfall
and  (subject to Section  10.01(f))  by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such  substitution will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust
Fund,  including  without  limitation,  any federal  tax imposed on  "prohibited
transactions"  under Section  860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions  after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code or (b) any portion of any
REMIC  to  fail  to  qualify  as  such  at any  time  that  any  Certificate  is
outstanding.

        It is  understood  and  agreed  that the  obligation  of the  Seller  or
Residential  Funding, as the case may be, to cure such breach or purchase (or in
the case of  Residential  Funding to  substitute  for) such  Mortgage Loan as to
which such a breach has occurred and is  continuing  shall  constitute  the sole
remedy respecting such breach available to the Certificateholders or the Trustee
on behalf of Certificateholders.  If the Master Servicer is Residential Funding,
then the Trustee shall also have the right to give the  notification and require
the purchase or substitution  provided for in the second preceding  paragraph in
the event of such a breach of a  representation  or warranty made by Residential
Funding in the  Assignment  Agreement.  In  connection  with the  purchase of or
substitution  for any such Mortgage  Loan by  Residential  Funding,  the Trustee
shall  assign to  Residential  Funding  all of the  Trustee's  right,  title and
interest  in respect of the  Seller's  Agreement  and the  Assignment  Agreement
applicable to such Mortgage Loan.

        Section 2.08 Purposes and Powers of the Trust.

        The  purpose of the trust,  as  created  hereunder,  is to engage in the
following activities:

     (a) to sell the  Certificates  to the Company in exchange  for the Mortgage
Loans;

        (b)    to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement;

     (c)  to  engage  in  those  activities  that  are  necessary,  suitable  or
convenient to accomplish  the foregoing or are  incidental  thereto or connected
therewith; and

        (d) subject to compliance with this  Agreement,  to engage in such other
activities as may be required in connection with  conservation of the Trust Fund
and the making of distributions to the Certificateholders.

        The trust is hereby  authorized to engage in the  foregoing  activities.
Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 11.01,  the trust shall not engage in
any  activity  other  than in  connection  with the  foregoing  or other than as
required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement  while any  Certificate is
outstanding,  and this Section  2.08 may not be amended,  without the consent of
the  Certificateholders  evidencing a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights of
the Certificates.

                                   ARTICLE III

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                                OF MORTGAGE LOANS

        Section 3.01  Master Servicer to Act as Servicer.

        (a) The Master  Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the respective Mortgage Loans
and shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through Subservicers as
provided in Section 3.02,  to do any and all things which it may deem  necessary
or desirable in  connection  with such  servicing  and  administration.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer in its own name or
in the name of a Subservicer  is hereby  authorized and empowered by the Trustee
when the Master  Servicer or the  Subservicer,  as the case may be,  believes it
appropriate  in its best  judgment,  to execute  and  deliver,  on behalf of the
Certificateholders  and the Trustee or any of them,  any and all  instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation,  or of partial or full release or discharge, or of
consent to assumption or modification in connection with a proposed  conveyance,
or of  assignment  of any  Mortgage  and Mortgage  Note in  connection  with the
repurchase  of a Mortgage  Loan and all other  comparable  instruments,  or with
respect to the  modification  or  re-recording  of a Mortgage for the purpose of
correcting the Mortgage,  the subordination of the lien of the Mortgage in favor
of a public utility company or government  agency or unit with powers of eminent
domain,  the  taking  of a  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  the  commencement,
prosecution  or  completion  of  judicial  or  non-judicial   foreclosure,   the
conveyance of a Mortgaged  Property to the related  Insurer,  the acquisition of
any property  acquired by  foreclosure  or deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  or the
management,  marketing and conveyance of any property acquired by foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Mortgage


                                              42

<PAGE>



Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties.  The Master Servicer further
is authorized and empowered by the Trustee, on behalf of the  Certificateholders
and the  Trustee,  in its own name or in the name of the  Subservicer,  when the
Master  Servicer  or the  Subservicer,  as  the  case  may  be,  believes  it is
appropriate  in its best  judgment to register any Mortgage  Loan on the MERS(R)
System,  or cause the removal from the  registration of any Mortgage Loan on the
MERS(R)  System,  to  execute  and  deliver,  on behalf of the  Trustee  and the
Certificateholders  or any of them,  any and all  instruments  of assignment and
other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or re- recording of
a  Mortgage  in the name of MERS,  solely as  nominee  for the  Trustee  and its
successors  and assigns.  Any expenses  incurred in connection  with the actions
described in the  preceding  sentence  shall be borne by the Master  Servicer in
accordance with Section 3.16(c), with no right of reimbursement;  provided, that
if, as a result of MERS discontinuing or becoming unable to continue  operations
in connection with the MERS System,  it becomes necessary to remove any Mortgage
Loan from  registration  on the MERS System and to arrange for the assignment of
the  related  Mortgages  to the  Trustee,  then any  related  expenses  shall be
reimbursable to the Master Servicer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  subject to
Section  3.07(a),  the Master  Servicer shall not permit any  modification  with
respect to any  Mortgage  Loan that would both  constitute a sale or exchange of
such  Mortgage  Loan  within the  meaning  of  Section  1001 of the Code and any
proposed,  temporary or final regulations  promulgated thereunder (other than in
connection  with a proposed  conveyance or assumption of such Mortgage Loan that
is treated as a Principal Prepayment in Full pursuant to Section 3.13(d) hereof)
and cause any REMIC formed under the Series  Supplement  to fail to qualify as a
REMIC under the Code.  The Trustee  shall  furnish the Master  Servicer with any
powers of attorney and other  documents  necessary or  appropriate to enable the
Master Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage Loans.  The Trustee shall
not be liable for any action  taken by the Master  Servicer  or any  Subservicer
pursuant  to such  powers  of  attorney.  In  servicing  and  administering  any
Nonsubserviced  Mortgage  Loan,  the Master  Servicer  shall,  to the extent not
inconsistent  with this  Agreement,  comply with the Program Guide as if it were
the  originator of such Mortgage Loan and had retained the servicing  rights and
obligations in respect thereof.  In connection with servicing and  administering
the Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer and any Affiliate of the Master Servicer
(i) may perform services such as appraisals and brokerage  services that are not
customarily  provided by servicers of mortgage  loans,  and shall be entitled to
reasonable  compensation  therefor in accordance with Section 3.10 and (ii) may,
at its own discretion and on behalf of the Trustee, obtain credit information in
the form of a "credit score" from a credit repository.

        (b) All costs  incurred  by the Master  Servicer or by  Subservicers  in
effecting the timely payment of taxes and assessments on the properties  subject
to the  Mortgage  Loans  shall  not,  for the  purpose  of  calculating  monthly
distributions to the Certificateholders,  be added to the amount owing under the
related Mortgage Loans,  notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so
permit,  and such costs shall be recoverable to the extent  permitted by Section
3.10(a)(ii).

        (c) The  Master  Servicer  may  enter  into  one or more  agreements  in
connection with the offering of pass-through  certificates  evidencing interests
in one or more of the  Certificates  providing  for the  payment  by the  Master
Servicer of amounts  received by the Master  Servicer as servicing  compensation
hereunder and required to cover certain  Prepayment  Interest  Shortfalls on the
Mortgage Loans, which payment obligation will thereafter be an obligation of the
Master Servicer hereunder.

        Section       3.02 Subservicing  Agreements  Between Master Servicer and
                      Subservicers;  Enforcement of  Subservicers'  and Sellers'
                      Obligations.

        (a) The Master Servicer may continue in effect  Subservicing  Agreements
entered into by Residential  Funding and Subservicers prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement,  and may enter into new Subservicing Agreements with
Subservicers,  for  the  servicing  and  administration  of all or  some  of the
Mortgage Loans. Each Subservicer of a Mortgage Loan shall be entitled to receive
and retain,  as provided in the related  Subservicing  Agreement  and in Section
3.07, the related  Subservicing  Fee from payments of interest  received on such
Mortgage Loan after payment of all amounts required to be remitted to the Master
Servicer  in respect of such  Mortgage  Loan.  For any  Mortgage  Loan that is a
Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer shall be entitled to receive
and retain an amount equal to the  Subservicing  Fee from  payments of interest.
Unless the context otherwise  requires,  references in this Agreement to actions
taken or to be taken by the Master  Servicer in  servicing  the  Mortgage  Loans
include  actions taken or to be taken by a  Subservicer  on behalf of the Master
Servicer.  Each Subservicing Agreement will be upon such terms and conditions as
are  generally   required  or  permitted  by  the  Program  Guide  and  are  not
inconsistent  with this Agreement and as the Master Servicer and the Subservicer
have agreed. A representative form of Subservicing Agreement is attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit E. With the approval of the Master Servicer,  a Subservicer
may  delegate its  servicing  obligations  to  third-party  servicers,  but such
Subservicer will remain obligated under the related Subservicing Agreement.  The
Master  Servicer  and a  Subservicer  may enter  into  amendments  thereto  or a
different form of Subservicing  Agreement,  and the form referred to or included
in the Program Guide is merely  provided for information and shall not be deemed
to limit in any respect the discretion of the Master Servicer to modify or enter
into  different  Subservicing  Agreements;  provided,  however,  that  any  such
amendments  or  different  forms  shall be  consistent  with and not violate the
provisions of either this Agreement or the Program Guide in a manner which would
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders.

        (b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder,  the Master Servicer,
for the benefit of the Trustee  and the  Certificateholders,  shall use its best
reasonable  efforts to enforce the  obligations  of each  Subservicer  under the
related  Subservicing  Agreement  and of each Seller under the related  Seller's
Agreement  insofar as the Company's  rights with respect to such  obligation has
been assigned to the Trustee hereunder,  to the extent that the  non-performance
of any such Seller's  obligation  would have a material and adverse  effect on a
Mortgage  Loan,  including,  without  limitation,  the  obligation to purchase a
Mortgage  Loan on account of  defective  documentation,  as described in Section
2.02, or on account of a breach of a representation or warranty, as described in
Section  2.04.  Such  enforcement,  including,  without  limitation,  the  legal
prosecution  of claims,  termination  of  Subservicing  Agreements  or  Seller's
Agreements, as appropriate, and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall
be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the Master
Servicer would employ in its good faith  business  judgment and which are normal
and usual in its general  mortgage  servicing  activities.  The Master  Servicer
shall  pay the  costs  of such  enforcement  at its own  expense,  and  shall be
reimbursed  therefor  only (i)  from a  general  recovery  resulting  from  such
enforcement to the extent, if any, that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in
respect of the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) from a specific  recovery of costs,
expenses or attorneys  fees against the party against whom such  enforcement  is
directed.  For  purposes  of  clarification  only,  the  parties  agree that the
foregoing is not intended to, and does not, limit the ability of the Master


                                              44

<PAGE>



Servicer to be reimbursed for expenses that are incurred in connection  with the
enforcement  of a Seller's  obligations  (insofar as the  Company's  rights with
respect  to  such  Seller's  obligations  have  been  assigned  to  the  Trustee
hereunder) and are reimbursable pursuant to Section 3.10(a)(viii).

        Section 3.03  Successor Subservicers.
                      ----------------------

        The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  terminate  any  Subservicing
Agreement  that may exist in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions of such
Subservicing  Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that  in the  event  of  termination  of  any  Subservicing
Agreement by the Master Servicer or the  Subservicer,  the Master Servicer shall
either act as servicer of the related Mortgage Loan or enter into a Subservicing
Agreement with a successor  Subservicer  which will be bound by the terms of the
related  Subservicing  Agreement.  If the Master  Servicer or any  Affiliate  of
Residential  Funding  acts as  servicer,  it will not assume  liability  for the
representations  and  warranties of the  Subservicer  which it replaces.  If the
Master  Servicer   enters  into  a  Subservicing   Agreement  with  a  successor
Subservicer,  the  Master  Servicer  shall use  reasonable  efforts  to have the
successor  Subservicer assume liability for the  representations  and warranties
made by the terminated Subservicer in respect of the related Mortgage Loans and,
in the event of any such  assumption  by the successor  Subservicer,  the Master
Servicer may, in the exercise of its business  judgment,  release the terminated
Subservicer from liability for such representations and warranties.

        Section 3.04  Liability of the Master Servicer.
                      --------------------------------

        Notwithstanding  any  Subservicing  Agreement,  any of the provisions of
this  Agreement  relating  to  agreements  or  arrangements  between  the Master
Servicer or a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or
otherwise,  the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trustee
and the  Certificateholders  for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage
Loans in accordance  with the  provisions of Section 3.01 without  diminution of
such  obligation  or  liability  by virtue of such  Subservicing  Agreements  or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Subservicer or the Company
and to the same extent and under the same terms and  conditions as if the Master
Servicer alone were servicing and  administering  the Mortgage Loans. The Master
Servicer  shall be entitled to enter into any agreement  with a  Subservicer  or
Seller for  indemnification of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

          Section 3.05  No  Contractual  Relationship  Between  Subservicer  and
               Trustee or Certificateholders.

        Any  Subservicing  Agreement  that may be  entered  into  and any  other
transactions or services  relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Subservicer
in its capacity as such and not as an  originator  shall be deemed to be between
the  Subservicer  and  the  Master  Servicer  alone  and  the  Trustee  and  the
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights,  obligations,  duties or liabilities  with respect to the Subservicer in
its  capacity  as such  except  as set  forth in  Section  3.06.  The  foregoing
provision  shall  not in any way  limit a  Subservicer's  obligation  to cure an
omission or defect or to  repurchase  a Mortgage  Loan as referred to in Section
2.02 hereof.

          Section 3.06 Assumption or Termination of  Subservicing  Agreements by
               Trustee.

        (a) If the Master  Servicer shall for any reason no longer be the master
servicer (including by reason of an Event of Default), the Trustee, its designee
or its successor shall thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the
Master  Servicer  under each  Subservicing  Agreement that may have been entered
into. The Trustee,  its designee or the successor servicer for the Trustee shall
be deemed to have assumed all of the Master  Servicer's  interest therein and to
have replaced the Master  Servicer as a party to the  Subservicing  Agreement to
the same  extent  as if the  Subservicing  Agreement  had been  assigned  to the
assuming party except that the Master  Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of
any liability or obligations under the Subservicing Agreement.

        (b) The Master  Servicer  shall,  upon request of the Trustee but at the
expense of the Master Servicer,  deliver to the assuming party all documents and
records  relating to each  Subservicing  Agreement  and the Mortgage  Loans then
being  serviced  and an  accounting  of  amounts  collected  and  held by it and
otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and  efficient  transfer of
each Subservicing Agreement to the assuming party.

          Section 3.07 Collection of Certain Mortgage Loan Payments; Deposits to
               Custodial Account.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall make  reasonable  efforts to collect all
payments  called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage  Loans,  and
shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and
the terms and provisions of any related Primary  Insurance  Policy,  follow such
collection procedures as it would employ in its good faith business judgment and
which  are  normal  and  usual in its  general  mortgage  servicing  activities.
Consistent  with the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer may in its discretion (i)
waive any late payment  charge or any prepayment  charge or penalty  interest in
connection  with the  prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the Due Date
for  payments  due on a Mortgage  Loan in  accordance  with the  Program  Guide;
provided,  however, that the Master Servicer shall first determine that any such
waiver  or  extension  will not  impair  the  coverage  of any  related  Primary
Insurance  Policy  or  materially  adversely  affect  the  lien  of the  related
Mortgage.  In the event of any such arrangement,  the Master Servicer shall make
timely  advances on the related  Mortgage  Loan during the  scheduled  period in
accordance  with  the  amortization  schedule  of  such  Mortgage  Loan  without
modification  thereof by reason of such arrangements  unless otherwise agreed to
by the  Holders  of the  Classes of  Certificates  affected  thereby;  provided,
however,  that no such  extension  shall be made if any such advance  would be a
Nonrecoverable Advance.  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Master
Servicer may also waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent
to the  postponement  of strict  compliance  with any such term or in any manner
grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Master Servicer's determination such
waiver,  modification,  postponement or indulgence is not materially  adverse to
the  interests of the  Certificateholders  (taking  into  account any  estimated
Realized Loss that might result absent such action); provided, however, that the
Master  Servicer may not modify  materially or permit any  Subservicer to modify
any Mortgage Loan,  including  without  limitation any  modification  that would
change the  Mortgage  Rate,  forgive  the payment of any  principal  or interest
(unless in  connection  with the  liquidation  of the related  Mortgage  Loan or
except in connection with prepayments to the extent that such  reamortization is
not  inconsistent  with the terms of the  Mortgage  Loan),  or extend  the final
maturity date of such Mortgage Loan, unless such


                                              46

<PAGE>



Mortgage  Loan is in default or, in the  judgment of the Master  Servicer,  such
default  is  reasonably  foreseeable;   and  provided,  further,  that  no  such
modification  shall reduce the interest rate on a Mortgage Loan below the sum of
the Pool Strip Rate and the sum of the rates at which the  Servicing Fee and the
Subservicing Fee with respect to such Mortgage Loan accrues.  In connection with
any  Curtailment  of a Mortgage  Loan,  the Master  Servicer,  to the extent not
inconsistent with the terms of the Mortgage Note and local law and practice, may
permit the  Mortgage  Loan to be  reamortized  such that the Monthly  Payment is
recalculated  as an  amount  that  will  fully  amortize  the  remaining  Stated
Principal  Balance  thereof by the original  Maturity Date based on the original
Mortgage Rate; provided,  that such re-amortization shall not be permitted if it
would  constitute  a  reissuance  of the  Mortgage  Loan for federal  income tax
purposes,  except if such reissuance is described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.860G-2(b)(3).

        (b) The Master Servicer shall establish and maintain a Custodial Account
in which the Master  Servicer  shall deposit or cause to be deposited on a daily
basis, except as otherwise  specifically provided herein, the following payments
and  collections  remitted by  Subservicers  or received by it in respect of the
Mortgage  Loans  subsequent  to the  Cut-off  Date  (other  than in  respect  of
principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date):

                      (i)  All  payments  on  account  of  principal,  including
               Principal  Prepayments  made by Mortgagors on the Mortgage  Loans
               and the principal  component of any Subservicer Advance or of any
               REO  Proceeds  received in  connection  with an REO  Property for
               which an REO Disposition has occurred;

                      (ii) All  payments on account of interest at the  Adjusted
               Mortgage Rate on the Mortgage Loans,  including Buydown Funds, if
               any, and the interest component of any Subservicer  Advance or of
               any REO Proceeds  received in connection with an REO Property for
               which an REO Disposition has occurred;

                    (iii)   Insurance   Proceeds,   Subsequent   Recoveries  and
               Liquidation   Proceeds  (net  of  any  related  expenses  of  the
               Subservicer);

                      (iv) All proceeds of any Mortgage Loans purchased pursuant
               to Section 2.02,  2.03, 2.04 or 4.07 and all amounts  required to
               be deposited in connection  with the  substitution of a Qualified
               Substitute Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04;

                    (v) Any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section
               3.07(c) or
               3.21;

                    (vi) All amounts transferred from the Certificate Account to
               the Custodial Account in accordance with Section 4.02(a);

                    (vii) Any amounts  realized by the  Subservicer and received
               by the Master  Servicer in respect of any Additional  Collateral;
               and



                                              47

<PAGE>



                    (viii)  Any  amounts  received  by the  Master  Servicer  in
               respect of Pledged Assets.

        The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Custodial Account shall be
exclusive,  it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments on the Mortgage Loans which are not part of the Trust
Fund  (consisting  of  payments  in respect of  principal  and  interest  on the
Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date) and payments or collections in
the nature of prepayment  charges or late payment charges or assumption fees may
but need not be deposited by the Master  Servicer in the Custodial  Account.  In
the event any amount not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account is so
deposited,  the Master  Servicer may at any time  withdraw  such amount from the
Custodial  Account,  any provision herein to the contrary  notwithstanding.  The
Custodial  Account  may  contain  funds that  belong to one or more trust  funds
created for mortgage  pass-through  certificates of other series and may contain
other  funds  respecting  payments  on mortgage  loans  belonging  to the Master
Servicer  or   serviced   or  master   serviced  by  it  on  behalf  of  others.
Notwithstanding  such  commingling  of funds,  the  Master  Servicer  shall keep
records that  accurately  reflect the funds on deposit in the Custodial  Account
that have been identified by it as being attributable to the Mortgage Loans.

        With respect to Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds,  REO Proceeds
and the proceeds of the purchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Sections 2.02,
2.03,  2.04 and 4.07  received in any calendar  month,  the Master  Servicer may
elect to treat such amounts as included in the Available Distribution Amount for
the Distribution Date in the month of receipt, but is not obligated to do so. If
the Master Servicer so elects, such amounts will be deemed to have been received
(and any related Realized Loss shall be deemed to have occurred) on the last day
of the month prior to the receipt thereof.

        (c) The  Master  Servicer  shall  use its  best  efforts  to  cause  the
institution  maintaining  the  Custodial  Account  to  invest  the  funds in the
Custodial  Account  attributable to the Mortgage Loans in Permitted  Investments
which shall  mature not later than the  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date next
following the date of such investment (with the exception of the Amount Held for
Future  Distribution)  and which shall not be sold or disposed of prior to their
maturities.  All income and gain realized from any such investment  shall be for
the benefit of the Master  Servicer as  additional  servicing  compensation  and
shall be subject to its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any
losses  incurred  in  respect  of  any  such  investments  attributable  to  the
investment of amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans shall be deposited in the
Custodial  Account by the Master  Servicer out of its own funds  immediately  as
realized without any right of reimbursement.

        (d) The Master Servicer shall give notice to the Trustee and the Company
of any change in the location of the  Custodial  Account and the location of the
Certificate Account prior to the use thereof.

        Section 3.08  Subservicing Accounts; Servicing Accounts.
                      -----------------------------------------

        (a) In those  cases where a  Subservicer  is  servicing a Mortgage  Loan
pursuant  to a  Subservicing  Agreement,  the Master  Servicer  shall  cause the
Subservicer,  pursuant to the Subservicing  Agreement, to establish and maintain
one or more Subservicing Accounts which shall


                                              48

<PAGE>



be an Eligible  Account or, if such  account is not an Eligible  Account,  shall
generally  satisfy  the  requirements  of the  Program  Guide  and be  otherwise
acceptable to the Master Servicer and each Rating Agency.  The Subservicer  will
be required  thereby to deposit into the  Subservicing  Account on a daily basis
all  proceeds  of  Mortgage  Loans  received  by  the   Subservicer,   less  its
Subservicing  Fees  and  unreimbursed  advances  and  expenses,  to  the  extent
permitted by the Subservicing  Agreement.  If the Subservicing Account is not an
Eligible  Account,  the Master  Servicer  shall be deemed to have  received such
monies upon receipt thereof by the  Subservicer.  The  Subservicer  shall not be
required to deposit in the  Subservicing  Account payments or collections in the
nature of prepayment  charges or late charges or  assumption  fees. On or before
the  date  specified  in the  Program  Guide,  but in no  event  later  than the
Determination Date, the Master Servicer shall cause the Subservicer, pursuant to
the Subservicing  Agreement,  to remit to the Master Servicer for deposit in the
Custodial  Account all funds held in the  Subservicing  Account  with respect to
each Mortgage Loan serviced by such Subservicer that are required to be remitted
to the Master Servicer.  The Subservicer will also be required,  pursuant to the
Subservicing  Agreement, to advance on such scheduled date of remittance amounts
equal to any scheduled  monthly  installments of principal and interest less its
Subservicing  Fees on any Mortgage  Loans for which  payment was not received by
the  Subservicer.  This obligation to advance with respect to each Mortgage Loan
will continue up to and  including the first of the month  following the date on
which  the  related  Mortgaged  Property  is  sold at a  foreclosure  sale or is
acquired by the Trust Fund by deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise. All such
advances  received by the Master  Servicer shall be deposited  promptly by it in
the Custodial Account.

        (b) The Subservicer may also be required,  pursuant to the  Subservicing
Agreement,  to remit to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Custodial Account
interest at the Adjusted  Mortgage  Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate plus the
rate per annum at which the  Servicing  Fee  accrues  in the case of a  Modified
Mortgage Loan) on any Curtailment  received by such  Subservicer in respect of a
Mortgage Loan from the related  Mortgagor during any month that is to be applied
by the  Subservicer  to reduce  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of the  related
Mortgage Loan as of the first day of such month, from the date of application of
such  Curtailment to the first day of the following month. Any amounts paid by a
Subservicer  pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall be for the benefit of the
Master Servicer as additional servicing compensation and shall be subject to its
withdrawal or order from time to time pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(iv) and (v).

        (c) In addition to the Custodial  Account and the  Certificate  Account,
the Master Servicer shall for any Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, and shall cause
the Subservicers  for Subserviced  Mortgage Loans to, establish and maintain one
or more Servicing  Accounts and deposit and retain therein all collections  from
the  Mortgagors  (or  advances  from  Subservicers)  for the  payment  of taxes,
assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,  Primary Insurance Policy premiums,  if
applicable,  or  comparable  items  for  the  account  of the  Mortgagors.  Each
Servicing Account shall satisfy the requirements for a Subservicing Account and,
to the extent  permitted by the Program  Guide or as is otherwise  acceptable to
the Master Servicer, may also function as a Subservicing Account. Withdrawals of
amounts  related to the Mortgage  Loans from the Servicing  Accounts may be made
only to effect timely payment of taxes, assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,
Primary  Insurance  Policy  premiums,  if applicable,  or comparable  items,  to
reimburse the Master Servicer or Subservicer out of related  collections for any
payments made  pursuant to Sections 3.11 (with respect to the Primary  Insurance
Policy) and 3.12(a) (with respect to hazard insurance), to refund to any


                                              49

<PAGE>



Mortgagors  any sums as may be  determined to be overages,  to pay interest,  if
required,  to Mortgagors  on balances in the  Servicing  Account or to clear and
terminate  the  Servicing  Account  at the  termination  of  this  Agreement  in
accordance with Section 9.01 or in accordance with the Program Guide. As part of
its servicing  duties,  the Master Servicer shall,  and the  Subservicers  will,
pursuant to the  Subservicing  Agreements,  be required to pay to the Mortgagors
interest on funds in this account to the extent required by law.

        (d) The Master  Servicer  shall advance the payments  referred to in the
preceding  subsection  that are not timely paid by the Mortgagors or advanced by
the  Subservicers on the date when the tax, premium or other cost for which such
payment is  intended  is due,  but the Master  Servicer  shall be required so to
advance only to the extent that such advances, in the good faith judgment of the
Master  Servicer,  will be recoverable  by the Master  Servicer out of Insurance
Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or otherwise.

          Section 3.09 Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding
               the Mortgage Loans.

        If   compliance   with  this  Section  3.09  shall  make  any  Class  of
Certificates  legal  for  investment  by  federally  insured  savings  and  loan
associations,  the Master Servicer shall provide,  or cause the  Subservicers to
provide,  to the Trustee,  the Office of Thrift  Supervision or the FDIC and the
supervisory  agents and examiners thereof access to the documentation  regarding
the Mortgage  Loans  required by applicable  regulations of the Office of Thrift
Supervision,  such access being afforded without charge but only upon reasonable
request and during normal business hours at the offices designated by the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer shall permit such representatives to photocopy any
such  documentation  and shall  provide  equipment  for that purpose at a charge
reasonably approximating the cost of such photocopying to the Master Servicer.

        Section 3.10  Permitted Withdrawals from the Custodial Account.

        (a) The Master Servicer may, from time to time as provided herein,  make
withdrawals from the Custodial Account of amounts on deposit therein pursuant to
Section  3.07 that are  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans for the  following
purposes:

                    (i) to make  deposits  into the  Certificate  Account in the
               amounts and in the manner provided for in Section 4.01;

                      (ii) to reimburse  itself or the related  Subservicer  for
               previously  unreimbursed  advances or expenses  made  pursuant to
               Sections 3.01,  3.07(a),  3.08, 3.11,  3.12(a),  3.14 and 4.04 or
               otherwise  reimbursable  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
               such  withdrawal  right  being  limited  to amounts  received  on
               particular  Mortgage  Loans  (including,  for this  purpose,  REO
               Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds and proceeds
               from the purchase of a Mortgage  Loan  pursuant to Section  2.02,
               2.03,  2.04 or 4.07)  which  represent  (A) Late  Collections  of
               Monthly  Payments for which any such advance was made in the case
               of Subservicer  Advances or Advances pursuant to Section 4.04 and
               (B)  recoveries of amounts in respect of which such advances were
               made in the case of Servicing Advances;

<PAGE>




                      (iii) to pay to itself or the related  Subservicer (if not
               previously  retained  by such  Subservicer)  out of each  payment
               received  by the Master  Servicer  on account  of  interest  on a
               Mortgage  Loan as  contemplated  by  Sections  3.14 and 3.16,  an
               amount equal to that remaining  portion of any such payment as to
               interest  (but  not  in  excess  of the  Servicing  Fee  and  the
               Subservicing  Fee,  if  not  previously   retained)  which,  when
               deducted,  will result in the  remaining  amount of such interest
               being interest at the Net Mortgage Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage
               Rate in the  case of a  Modified  Mortgage  Loan)  on the  amount
               specified in the  amortization  schedule of the related  Mortgage
               Loan as the  principal  balance  thereof at the  beginning of the
               period  respecting  which such  interest  was paid  after  giving
               effect to any previous Curtailments;

                      (iv) to pay to itself as additional servicing compensation
               any  interest  or  investment  income  earned  on funds and other
               property  deposited in or credited to the Custodial  Account that
               it is entitled to withdraw pursuant to Section 3.07(c);

                      (v) to pay to itself as additional servicing  compensation
               any Foreclosure  Profits, any amounts remitted by Subservicers as
               interest in respect of Curtailments  pursuant to Section 3.08(b),
               and  any  amounts  paid  by a  Mortgagor  in  connection  with  a
               Principal  Prepayment  in Full in  respect  of  interest  for any
               period  during  the  calendar   month  in  which  such  Principal
               Prepayment    in   Full   is   to   be    distributed    to   the
               Certificateholders;

                      (vi)  to  pay  to  itself,   a   Subservicer,   a  Seller,
               Residential Funding, the Company or any other appropriate Person,
               as the  case  may  be,  with  respect  to each  Mortgage  Loan or
               property  acquired in respect  thereof that has been purchased or
               otherwise  transferred pursuant to Section 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 4.07
               or 9.01,  all amounts  received  thereon  and not  required to be
               distributed to the Certificateholders as of the date on which the
               related Stated Principal Balance or Purchase Price is determined;

                      (vii) to reimburse  itself or the related  Subservicer for
               any  Nonrecoverable  Advance or Advances in the manner and to the
               extent  provided in  subsection  (c) below,  any Advance  made in
               connection  with a  modification  of a  Mortgage  Loan that is in
               default or, in the  judgment of the Master  Servicer,  default is
               reasonably foreseeable pursuant to Section 3.07(a), to the extent
               the  amount  of the  Advance  has been  added to the  outstanding
               principal   balance  of  the  Mortgage   Loan,   or  any  Advance
               reimbursable to the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(a);

               or  in  connection  with  enforcing,   in  accordance  with  this
               Agreement,   any  repurchase,   substitution  or  indemnification
               obligation of any Seller (other than an Affiliate of the Company)
               pursuant to the related Seller's Agreement;

                      (ix) to reimburse itself for Servicing  Advances  expended
               by it (a)  pursuant to Section  3.14 in good faith in  connection
               with the restoration of property  damaged by an Uninsured  Cause,

               Account that was not required to be deposited therein pursuant to
               Section 3.07.

        (b) Since,  in  connection  with  withdrawals  pursuant to clauses (ii),
(iii),  (v) and (vi), the Master  Servicer's  entitlement  thereto is limited to
collections  or other  recoveries  on the  related  Mortgage  Loan,  the  Master
Servicer  shall keep and maintain  separate  accounting,  on a Mortgage  Loan by
Mortgage  Loan basis,  for the purpose of  justifying  any  withdrawal  from the
Custodial Account pursuant to such clauses.

        (c) The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  reimburse  itself or the
related  Subservicer for any advance made in respect of a Mortgage Loan that the
Master Servicer determines to be a Nonrecoverable Advance by withdrawal from the
Custodial  Account of amounts on deposit  therein  attributable  to the Mortgage
Loans  on any  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date  succeeding  the date of such
determination.  Such  right of  reimbursement  in  respect  of a  Nonrecoverable
Advance  on any such  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date shall be limited to an
amount  not   exceeding  the  portion  of  such  advance   previously   paid  to
Certificateholders (and not theretofore reimbursed to the Master Servicer or the
related Subservicer).

          Section  3.11   Maintenance   of  the  Primary   Insurance   Policies;
               Collections Thereunder.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall not take, or permit any  Subservicer  to
take, any action which would result in non-coverage under any applicable Primary
Insurance  Policy of any loss which,  but for the actions of the Master Servicer
or Subservicer,  would have been covered  thereunder.  To the extent coverage is
available,  the Master Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and
effect each such Primary  Insurance  Policy until the  principal  balance of the
related Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged  Property is reduced to 80% or less
of  the  Appraised  Value  in  the  case  of  such  a  Mortgage  Loan  having  a
Loan-to-Value  Ratio at origination in excess of 80%, provided that such Primary
Insurance  Policy  was in  place as of the  Cut-off  Date  and the  Company  had
knowledge  of such  Primary  Insurance  Policy.  The  Master  Servicer  shall be
entitled to cancel or permit the discontinuation of any Primary Insurance Policy
as to any Mortgage Loan, if the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan is
reduced  below an  amount  equal to 80% of the  appraised  value of the  related
Mortgaged  Property as  determined  in any  appraisal  thereof after the Closing
Date,  or if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio  is  reduced  below  80% as a  result  of
principal  payments on the Mortgage  Loan after the Closing  Date.  In the event
that the Company  gains  knowledge  that as of the Closing Date, a Mortgage Loan
had a Loan-to-Value Ratio at origination in excess of 80% and is not the subject
of a Primary  Insurance  Policy (and was not  included in any  exception  to the
representation in Section 2.03(b)(iv)) and that such Mortgage Loan has a current
Loan-to-Value  Ratio in excess  of 80% then the  Master  Servicer  shall use its
reasonable  efforts to obtain and  maintain  a Primary  Insurance  Policy to the
extent  that such a policy is  obtainable  at a  reasonable  price.  The  Master
Servicer shall not cancel or refuse to renew any such Primary Insurance Policy


                                              52

<PAGE>



applicable to a  Nonsubserviced  Mortgage  Loan,  or consent to any  Subservicer
canceling or refusing to renew any such Primary Insurance Policy applicable to a
Mortgage  Loan  subserviced  by it, that is in effect at the date of the initial
issuance  of the  Certificates  and is  required  to be kept in force  hereunder
unless the replacement Primary Insurance Policy for such canceled or non-renewed
policy is maintained with an insurer whose  claims-paying  ability is acceptable
to each Rating  Agency for mortgage  pass-through  certificates  having a rating
equal to or better  than the  lower of the  then-current  rating  or the  rating
assigned to the Certificates as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency.

        (b) In connection with its activities as  administrator  and servicer of
the  Mortgage  Loans,  the  Master  Servicer  agrees to  present or to cause the
related  Subservicer  to  present,  on  behalf  of  the  Master  Servicer,   the
Subservicer,  if any, the Trustee and Certificateholders,  claims to the related
Insurer under any Primary Insurance  Policies,  in a timely manner in accordance
with such  policies,  and,  in this  regard,  to take or cause to be taken  such
reasonable  action as shall be  necessary to permit  recovery  under any Primary
Insurance  Policies  respecting  defaulted  Mortgage Loans.  Pursuant to Section
3.07,  any Insurance  Proceeds  collected by or remitted to the Master  Servicer
under  any  Primary  Insurance  Policies  shall be  deposited  in the  Custodial
Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

          Section 3.12  Maintenance of Fire Insurance and Omissions and Fidelity
               Coverage.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan (other than a Cooperative Loan) fire insurance with extended coverage in an
amount  which is equal to the  lesser  of the  principal  balance  owing on such
Mortgage  Loan  or 100  percent  of the  insurable  value  of the  improvements;
provided,  however,  that such coverage may not be less than the minimum  amount
required to fully compensate for any loss or damage on a replacement cost basis.
To the extent it may do so without breaching the related Subservicing Agreement,
the Master  Servicer  shall  replace  any  Subservicer  that does not cause such
insurance, to the extent it is available, to be maintained.  The Master Servicer
shall also cause to be maintained on property acquired upon foreclosure, or deed
in lieu of  foreclosure,  of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Cooperative  Loan),
fire  insurance  with extended  coverage in an amount which is at least equal to
the  amount  necessary  to avoid  the  application  of any  co-insurance  clause
contained in the related hazard insurance policy.  Pursuant to Section 3.07, any
amounts  collected by the Master  Servicer  under any such policies  (other than
amounts to be  applied to the  restoration  or repair of the  related  Mortgaged
Property  or property  thus  acquired or amounts  released to the  Mortgagor  in
accordance with the Master  Servicer's  normal  servicing  procedures)  shall be
deposited in the Custodial  Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section
3.10. Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer in maintaining any such insurance
shall  not,  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  monthly  distributions  to  the
Certificateholders,  be added to the  amount  owing  under  the  Mortgage  Loan,
notwithstanding  that the terms of the Mortgage Loan so permit. Such costs shall
be  recoverable  by the Master  Servicer  out of related  late  payments  by the
Mortgagor or out of Insurance  Proceeds and  Liquidation  Proceeds to the extent
permitted by Section  3.10.  It is  understood  and agreed that no earthquake or
other  additional  insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor or maintained on
property  acquired  in respect of a Mortgage  Loan other than  pursuant  to such
applicable  laws and  regulations  as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance. Whenever the improvements securing a Mortgage
Loan (other than a Cooperative  Loan) are located at the time of  origination of
such Mortgage Loan in a federally


                                              53

<PAGE>



designated  special  flood hazard area,  the Master  Servicer  shall cause flood
insurance (to the extent  available) to be maintained in respect  thereof.  Such
flood  insurance  shall be in an amount  equal to the  lesser of (i) the  amount
required to  compensate  for any loss or damage to the  Mortgaged  Property on a
replacement  cost basis and (ii) the maximum amount of such insurance  available
for the related  Mortgaged  Property under the national flood insurance  program
(assuming  that  the  area in  which  such  Mortgaged  Property  is  located  is
participating in such program).

        If the  Master  Servicer  shall  obtain  and  maintain  a  blanket  fire
insurance policy with extended coverage insuring against hazard losses on all of
the  Mortgage  Loans,  it shall  conclusively  be deemed to have  satisfied  its
obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 3.12(a), it being
understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which
case the Master  Servicer  shall,  in the event  that there  shall not have been
maintained on the related  Mortgaged  Property a policy complying with the first
sentence  of this  Section  3.12(a) and there shall have been a loss which would
have been covered by such policy,  deposit in the Certificate Account the amount
not  otherwise  payable  under the  blanket  policy  because of such  deductible
clause. Any such deposit by the Master Servicer shall be made on the Certificate
Account  Deposit Date next preceding the  Distribution  Date which occurs in the
month  following  the month in which  payments  under any such policy would have
been deposited in the Custodial  Account.  In connection  with its activities as
administrator  and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer agrees to
present,  on behalf of itself,  the Trustee and the  Certificateholders,  claims
under any such blanket policy.

        (b) The Master Servicer shall obtain and maintain at its own expense and
keep in full force and effect  throughout  the term of this  Agreement a blanket
fidelity bond and an errors and omissions  insurance  policy covering the Master
Servicer's  officers and  employees  and other  persons  acting on behalf of the
Master  Servicer in connection  with its activities  under this  Agreement.  The
amount  of  coverage  shall be at  least  equal to the  coverage  that  would be
required by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, whichever is greater, with respect to the
Master  Servicer if the Master  Servicer were  servicing and  administering  the
Mortgage Loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In the event that any such bond or
policy  ceases to be in effect,  the Master  Servicer  shall obtain a comparable
replacement  bond or  policy  from an  issuer  or  insurer,  as the case may be,
meeting the  requirements,  if any, of the Program  Guide and  acceptable to the
Company.  Coverage of the Master  Servicer under a policy or bond obtained by an
Affiliate of the Master  Servicer and  providing  the coverage  required by this
Section 3.12(b) shall satisfy the requirements of this Section 3.12(b).

          Section  3.13  Enforcement  of  Due-on-Sale  Clauses;  Assumption  and
               Modification Agreements; Certain Assignments.

        (a) When any Mortgaged Property is conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Master
Servicer or  Subservicer,  to the extent it has  knowledge  of such  conveyance,
shall enforce any due-on-sale clause contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,
to the extent permitted under applicable law and governmental  regulations,  but
only to the extent that such enforcement will not adversely affect or jeopardize
coverage under any Required Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

                      (i) the  Master  Servicer  shall  not be  deemed  to be in
               default  under this Section  3.13(a) by reason of any transfer or
               assumption  which the Master  Servicer is  restricted by law from
               preventing; and


                                              54

<PAGE>




                      (ii)  if  the  Master  Servicer   determines  that  it  is
               reasonably  likely  that  any  Mortgagor  will  bring,  or if any
               Mortgagor  does  bring,   legal  action  to  declare  invalid  or
               otherwise avoid enforcement of a due-on-sale  clause contained in
               any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,  the Master  Servicer shall not be
               required to enforce  the  due-on-sale  clause or to contest  such
               action.

        (b) Subject to the Master  Servicer's  duty to enforce  any  due-on-sale
clause  to the  extent  set  forth in  Section  3.13(a),  in any case in which a
Mortgaged Property is to be conveyed to a Person by a Mortgagor, and such Person
is to enter into an  assumption or  modification  agreement or supplement to the
Mortgage Note or Mortgage which requires the signature of the Trustee,  or if an
instrument of release signed by the Trustee is required  releasing the Mortgagor
from liability on the Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer is authorized,  subject
to the requirements of the sentence next following,  to execute and deliver,  on
behalf of the  Trustee,  the  assumption  agreement  with the Person to whom the
Mortgaged  Property  is  to be  conveyed  and  such  modification  agreement  or
supplement  to the  Mortgage  Note  or  Mortgage  or  other  instruments  as are
reasonable  or necessary to carry out the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage
or otherwise to comply with any  applicable  laws  regarding  assumptions or the
transfer of the Mortgaged Property to such Person;  provided,  however,  none of
such terms and requirements  shall either (i) both (A) constitute a "significant
modification"  effecting an exchange or  reissuance  of such Mortgage Loan under
the REMIC  Provisions  and (B) cause any portion of any REMIC  formed  under the
Series  Supplement  to fail to qualify as a REMIC  under the Code or (subject to
Section  10.01(f)),   result  in  the  imposition  of  any  tax  on  "prohibited
transactions" or (ii) constitute  "contributions"  after the start-up date under
the REMIC  Provisions.  The Master  Servicer  shall  execute  and  deliver  such
documents only if it reasonably  determines  that (i) its execution and delivery
thereof will not conflict  with or violate any terms of this  Agreement or cause
the unpaid  balance and interest on the  Mortgage  Loan to be  uncollectible  in
whole or in part,  (ii) any  required  consents of insurers  under any  Required
Insurance Policies have been obtained and (iii) subsequent to the closing of the
transaction  involving  the  assumption  or transfer (A) the Mortgage  Loan will
continue  to be secured by a first  mortgage  lien  pursuant to the terms of the
Mortgage,  (B) such transaction will not adversely affect the coverage under any
Required Insurance Policies,  (C) the Mortgage Loan will fully amortize over the
remaining term thereof, (D) no material term of the Mortgage Loan (including the
interest  rate on the  Mortgage  Loan) will be altered  nor will the term of the
Mortgage  Loan be  changed  and (E) if the  seller/transferor  of the  Mortgaged
Property is to be released  from  liability on the Mortgage  Loan,  such release
will  not  (based  on  the  Master   Servicer's  or  Subservicer's   good  faith
determination)  adversely affect the  collectability  of the Mortgage Loan. Upon
receipt of appropriate  instructions from the Master Servicer in accordance with
the  foregoing,  the Trustee shall execute any  necessary  instruments  for such
assumption  or  substitution  of  liability as directed in writing by the Master
Servicer.  Upon the closing of the transactions  contemplated by such documents,
the Master  Servicer shall cause the originals or true and correct copies of the
assumption agreement, the release (if any), or the modification or supplement to
the Mortgage  Note or Mortgage to be  delivered to the Trustee or the  Custodian
and deposited  with the Mortgage File for such Mortgage  Loan. Any fee collected
by the  Master  Servicer  or  such  related  Subservicer  for  entering  into an
assumption or substitution of liability agreement will be retained by the Master
Servicer or such Subservicer as additional servicing compensation.

        (c) The Master Servicer or the related Subservicer,  as the case may be,
shall be entitled to approve a request from a Mortgagor for a partial release of
the related Mortgaged Property,  the granting of an easement thereon in favor of
another Person,  any alteration or demolition of the related Mortgaged  Property
(or,  with respect to a Cooperative  Loan,  the related  Cooperative  Apartment)
without  any  right  of  reimbursement  or  other  similar  matters  if  it  has
determined, exercising its good faith business judgment in the same manner as it
would if it were the owner of the related  Mortgage Loan, that the security for,
and the timely  and full  collectability  of,  such  Mortgage  Loan would not be
adversely  affected  thereby and that any portion of any REMIC  formed under the
Series  Supplement  would not fail to  continue  to qualify as a REMIC under the
Code as a result  thereof  and  (subject  to  Section  10.01(f))  that no tax on
"prohibited  transactions"  or  "contributions"  after the  startup day would be
imposed on any such REMIC as a result  thereof.  Any fee collected by the Master
Servicer  or the  related  Subservicer  for  processing  such a request  will be
retained by the Master  Servicer or such  Subservicer  as  additional  servicing
compensation.

        (d)  Subject  to any  other  applicable  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement,  the  Trustee  and Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled to approve an
assignment in lieu of satisfaction  with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  provided
the  obligee  with  respect  to  such  Mortgage  Loan  following  such  proposed
assignment provides the Trustee and Master Servicer with a "Lender Certification
for  Assignment of Mortgage  Loan" in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit M, in
form and substance  satisfactory to the Trustee and Master  Servicer,  providing
the  following:  (i) that the substance of the assignment is, and is intended to
be, a refinancing  of such  Mortgage;  (ii) that the Mortgage Loan following the
proposed  assignment will have a rate of interest at least 0.25 percent below or
above  the  rate of  interest  on such  Mortgage  Loan  prior  to such  proposed
assignment;  and (iii) that such  assignment  is at the request of the  borrower
under the related  Mortgage  Loan.  Upon  approval of an  assignment  in lieu of
satisfaction  with  respect to any  Mortgage  Loan,  the Master  Servicer  shall
receive cash in an amount equal to the unpaid  principal  balance of and accrued
interest on such Mortgage Loan and the Master  Servicer  shall treat such amount
as a Principal  Prepayment  in Full with respect to such  Mortgage  Loan for all
purposes hereof.

        Section 3.14  Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

        (a) The Master  Servicer shall  foreclose  upon or otherwise  comparably
convert  (which may include an REO  Acquisition)  the  ownership  of  properties
securing such of the Mortgage  Loans as come into and continue in default and as
to which no satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for collection of delinquent
payments  pursuant to Section 3.07. In connection with such foreclosure or other
conversion, the Master Servicer shall, consistent with Section 3.11, follow such
practices and  procedures as it shall deem  necessary or advisable,  as shall be
normal and usual in its general  mortgage  servicing  activities and as shall be
required or permitted by the Program  Guide;  provided that the Master  Servicer
shall not be liable in any respect hereunder if the Master Servicer is acting in
connection  with any such  foreclosure  or other  conversion in a manner that is
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The Master Servicer,  however,
shall not be  required  to  expend  its own  funds or incur  other  reimbursable
charges in connection with any foreclosure,  or attempted  foreclosure  which is
not  completed,  or towards  the  restoration  of any  property  unless it shall
determine  (i) that  such  restoration  and/or  foreclosure  will  increase  the
proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Holders of  Certificates  of one
or more Classes after  reimbursement  to itself for such expenses or charges and
(ii) that such expenses or charges will be recoverable to it through


                                              56

<PAGE>



Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds, or REO Proceeds (respecting which it
shall have  priority  for purposes of  withdrawals  from the  Custodial  Account
pursuant to Section 3.10,  whether or not such expenses and charges are actually
recoverable  from  related  Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds  or  REO
Proceeds).  In the event of such a determination by the Master Servicer pursuant
to this Section 3.14(a),  the Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement
of such amounts pursuant to Section 3.10.

        In addition to the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer  shall use its best
reasonable  efforts to realize upon any  Additional  Collateral  for such of the
Additional Collateral Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which
no satisfactory  arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent  payments
pursuant to Section 3.07; provided that the Master Servicer shall not, on behalf
of the Trustee, obtain title to any such Additional Collateral as a result of or
in lieu of the disposition  thereof or otherwise;  and provided further that (i)
the Master Servicer shall not proceed with respect to such Additional Collateral
in any manner  that would  impair the  ability to recover  against  the  related
Mortgaged  Property,  and (ii) the Master  Servicer  shall  proceed with any REO
Acquisition in a manner that preserves the ability to apply the proceeds of such
Additional  Collateral  against amounts owed under the defaulted  Mortgage Loan.
Any proceeds realized from such Additional  Collateral (other than amounts to be
released to the Mortgagor or the related guarantor in accordance with procedures
that the  Master  Servicer  would  follow in  servicing  loans  held for its own
account,  subject  to the terms  and  conditions  of the  related  Mortgage  and
Mortgage  Note  and to the  terms  and  conditions  of any  security  agreement,
guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other agreement  governing the disposition of
the proceeds of such Additional  Collateral) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account,  subject to  withdrawal  pursuant to Section  3.10.  Any other  payment
received by the Master Servicer in respect of such Additional  Collateral  shall
be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section
3.10.

        For so long as the  Master  Servicer  is the Master  Servicer  under the
Credit  Support  Pledge  Agreement,   the  Master  Servicer  shall  perform  its
obligations  under the Credit Support Pledge  Agreement in accordance  with such
Agreement   and  in  a   manner   that  is  in  the   best   interests   of  the
Certificateholders.  Further,  the Master Servicer shall use its best reasonable
efforts to realize upon any Pledged  Assets for such of the Pledged  Asset Loans
as  come  into  and  continue  in  default  and  as  to  which  no  satisfactory
arrangements  can be made for  collection  of  delinquent  payments  pursuant to
Section  3.07;  provided  that the Master  Servicer  shall not, on behalf of the
Trustee,  obtain title to any such  Pledged  Assets as a result of or in lieu of
the disposition  thereof or otherwise;  and provided further that (i) the Master
Servicer  shall not proceed with  respect to such  Pledged  Assets in any manner
that would impair the ability to recover against the related Mortgaged Property,
and (ii) the Master  Servicer shall proceed with any REO Acquisition in a manner
that  preserves the ability to apply the proceeds of such Pledged Assets against
amounts owed under the defaulted  Mortgage Loan. Any proceeds realized from such
Pledged  Assets  (other  than  amounts to be released  to the  Mortgagor  or the
related  guarantor in accordance  with procedures that the Master Servicer would
follow in  servicing  loans held for its own  account,  subject to the terms and
conditions  of the  related  Mortgage  and  Mortgage  Note and to the  terms and
conditions of any security  agreement,  guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other
agreement  governing  the  disposition  of the proceeds of such Pledged  Assets)
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to
Section 3.10.  Any other payment  received by the Master  Servicer in respect of
such  Pledged  Assets shall be deposited  in the  Custodial  Account  subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.


                                              57

<PAGE>



        Concurrently  with the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer  may pursue any
remedies that may be available in connection  with a breach of a  representation
and warranty with respect to any such Mortgage Loan in accordance  with Sections
2.03 and 2.04.  However,  the Master  Servicer  is not  required  to continue to
pursue both foreclosure (or similar remedies) with respect to the Mortgage Loans
and remedies in connection with a breach of a representation and warranty if the
Master Servicer determines in its reasonable  discretion that one such remedy is
more likely to result in a greater  recovery as to the Mortgage  Loan.  Upon the
occurrence of a Cash  Liquidation or REO  Disposition,  following the deposit in
the Custodial Account of all Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds and other
payments and recoveries  referred to in the definition of "Cash  Liquidation" or
"REO  Disposition,"  as  applicable,  upon  receipt  by the  Trustee  of written
notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,  the Trustee or any
Custodian,  as the case may be, shall release to the Master Servicer the related
Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver such  instruments  of
transfer or  assignment  prepared by the Master  Servicer,  in each case without
recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the Master Servicer or its designee,
as the case may be, the related Mortgage Loan, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan
shall not be part of the Trust Fund.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this  Agreement,  in the Master  Servicer's  sole  discretion  with
respect  to any  defaulted  Mortgage  Loan or REO  Property  as to either of the
following provisions, (i) a Cash Liquidation or REO Disposition may be deemed to
have occurred if substantially all amounts expected by the Master Servicer to be
received in connection with the related defaulted  Mortgage Loan or REO Property
have been  received,  and (ii) for  purposes  of  determining  the amount of any
Liquidation Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds, REO Proceeds or any other unscheduled
collections  or the amount of any Realized  Loss,  the Master  Servicer may take
into account minimal amounts of additional  receipts  expected to be received or
any  estimated  additional  liquidation  expenses  expected  to be  incurred  in
connection with the related defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

        (b) If title to any Mortgaged  Property is acquired by the Trust Fund as
an REO Property by  foreclosure or by deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  the deed or
certificate  of sale shall be issued to the  Trustee or to its nominee on behalf
of  Certificateholders.  Notwithstanding  any  such  acquisition  of  title  and
cancellation  of the related  Mortgage Loan,  such REO Property shall (except as
otherwise expressly provided herein) be considered to be an Outstanding Mortgage
Loan held in the Trust Fund until such time as the REO  Property  shall be sold.
Consistent with the foregoing for purposes of all calculations hereunder so long
as such REO Property shall be considered to be an  Outstanding  Mortgage Loan it
shall be assumed that,  notwithstanding  that the indebtedness  evidenced by the
related  Mortgage  Note shall have been  discharged,  such Mortgage Note and the
related  amortization  schedule in effect at the time of any such acquisition of
title  (after  giving  effect  to  any  previous  Curtailments  and  before  any
adjustment  thereto by reason of any  bankruptcy  or similar  proceeding  or any
moratorium or similar waiver or grace period) remain in effect.

        (c) If the  Trust  Fund  acquires  any  REO  Property  as  aforesaid  or
otherwise in connection  with a default or imminent  default on a Mortgage Loan,
the  Master  Servicer  on behalf of the Trust  Fund  shall  dispose  of such REO
Property as soon as practicable,  giving due  consideration  to the interests of
the  Certificateholders,  but in all cases  within  three full  years  after the
taxable  year of its  acquisition  by the Trust  Fund for  purposes  of  Section
860G(a)(8)  of the  Code (or  such  shorter  period  as may be  necessary  under
applicable  state (including any state in which such property is located) law to
maintain  the  status of any  portion  of any  REMIC  formed  under  the  Series
Supplement as a

failing  to be  foreclosure  property  under  applicable  state  law) or, at the
expense of the Trust  Fund,  request,  more than 60 days before the day on which
such grace  period  would  otherwise  expire,  an extension of such grace period
unless the Master Servicer (subject to Section 10.01(f)) obtains for the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel,  addressed to the Trustee and the Master Servicer, to the
effect that the  holding by the Trust Fund of such REO  Property  subsequent  to
such  period  will  not  result  in  the  imposition  of  taxes  on  "prohibited
transactions"  as defined in Section  860F of the Code or cause any REMIC formed
under the Series  Supplement  to fail to qualify as a REMIC (for federal (or any
applicable   State  or  local)  income  tax  purposes)  at  any  time  that  any
Certificates are outstanding,  in which case the Trust Fund may continue to hold
such REO  Property  (subject  to any  conditions  contained  in such  Opinion of
Counsel).  The Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to be  reimbursed  from the
Custodial  Account for any costs  incurred in obtaining such Opinion of Counsel,
as  provided  in  Section  3.10.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this
Agreement,  no REO  Property  acquired  by the Trust  Fund  shall be rented  (or
allowed to continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust
Fund in such a manner or  pursuant  to any terms  that  would (i) cause such REO
Property  to fail to qualify as  "foreclosure  property"  within the  meaning of
Section  860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) subject the Trust Fund to the imposition
of any  federal  income  taxes on the  income  earned  from  such REO  Property,
including any taxes imposed by reason of Section 860G(c) of the Code, unless the
Master  Servicer has agreed to indemnify  and hold  harmless the Trust Fund with
respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

        (d) The proceeds of any Cash Liquidation, REO Disposition or purchase or
repurchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, as well
as any recovery resulting from a collection of Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance
Proceeds or REO Proceeds,  will be applied in the  following  order of priority:
first, to reimburse the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer in accordance
with Section  3.10(a)(ii);  second, to the  Certificateholders  to the extent of
accrued and unpaid  interest on the Mortgage  Loan,  and any related REO Imputed
Interest,  at the Net Mortgage  Rate (or the  Modified Net Mortgage  Rate in the
case of a Modified Mortgage Loan) to the Due Date prior to the Distribution Date
on which such amounts are to be distributed; third, to the Certificateholders as
a recovery of principal on the Mortgage Loan (or REO Property);  fourth,  to all
Servicing Fees and Subservicing  Fees payable therefrom (and the Master Servicer
and the Subservicer  shall have no claims for any  deficiencies  with respect to
such fees which result from the foregoing allocation); and fifth, to Foreclosure
Profits.

        (e) In the event of a default  on a  Mortgage  Loan one or more of whose
obligors is not a United States Person,  in connection  with any  foreclosure or
acquisition  of a deed in  lieu  of  foreclosure  (together,  "foreclosure")  in
respect of such Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer will cause  compliance  with
the provisions of Treasury  Regulation Section  1.1445-2(d)(3) (or any successor
thereto)  necessary to assure that no  withholding  tax  obligation  arises with
respect to the proceeds of such foreclosure  except to the extent,  if any, that
proceeds of such foreclosure are required to be remitted to the obligors on such
Mortgage Loan.

        Section 3.15  Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.
                      -----------------------------------------------

        (a) Upon becoming  aware of the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or
upon the receipt by the Master  Servicer of a notification  that payment in full
will be escrowed in a manner  customary for such purposes,  the Master  Servicer
will  immediately  notify the Trustee (if it holds the related Mortgage File) or
the Custodian by a  certification  of a Servicing  Officer (which  certification
shall  include a  statement  to the effect  that all  amounts  received or to be
received in  connection  with such payment which are required to be deposited in
the  Custodial  Account  pursuant  to  Section  3.07  have  been  or  will be so
deposited),  substantially in one of the forms attached hereto as Exhibit F, or,
in the case of the Custodian,  an electronic request in a form acceptable to the
Custodian,  requesting  delivery to it of the Mortgage File. Within two Business
Days of receipt of such certification and request, the Trustee shall release, or
cause  the  Custodian  to  release,  the  related  Mortgage  File to the  Master
Servicer.  The Master  Servicer  is  authorized  to execute  and  deliver to the
Mortgagor  the  request for  reconveyance,  deed of  reconveyance  or release or
satisfaction of mortgage or such instrument  releasing the lien of the Mortgage,
together  with the  Mortgage  Note with,  as  appropriate,  written  evidence of
cancellation  thereon  and to cause the  removal  from the  registration  on the
MERS(R)  System of such  Mortgage and to execute and  deliver,  on behalf of the
Trustee and the  Certificateholders  or any of them, any and all  instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation or of partial or full release. No expenses incurred
in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance  shall
be chargeable to the Custodial Account or the Certificate Account.

        (b) From time to time as is appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure
of any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Custodian, with a
copy to the Trustee,  a certificate of a Servicing Officer  substantially in one
of the forms attached as Exhibit F hereto, or, in the case of the Custodian,  an
electronic  request  in a form  acceptable  to the  Custodian,  requesting  that
possession  of all, or any document  constituting  part of, the Mortgage File be
released to the Master Servicer and certifying as to the reason for such release
and that such release will not  invalidate  any insurance  coverage  provided in
respect of the Mortgage Loan under any Required  Insurance Policy.  Upon receipt
of the foregoing,  the Trustee shall deliver, or cause the Custodian to deliver,
the Mortgage  File or any document  therein to the Master  Servicer.  The Master
Servicer  shall cause each Mortgage File or any document  therein so released to
be returned to the Trustee,  or the  Custodian as agent for the Trustee when the
need therefor by the Master  Servicer no longer exists,  unless (i) the Mortgage
Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation  Proceeds  relating to the Mortgage
Loan have been  deposited in the Custodial  Account or (ii) the Mortgage File or
such  document  has been  delivered  directly  or  through a  Subservicer  to an
attorney,  or to a public  trustee or other public  official as required by law,
for purposes of initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the
foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property either judicially or  non-judicially,  and
the Master  Servicer  has  delivered  directly or through a  Subservicer  to the
Trustee a  certificate  of a  Servicing  Officer  certifying  as to the name and
address of the Person to which such Mortgage File or such document was delivered
and the purpose or purposes of such delivery. In the event of the liquidation of
a Mortgage  Loan, the Trustee shall deliver the Request for Release with respect
thereto to the Master Servicer upon deposit of the related Liquidation  Proceeds
in the Custodial Account.

        (c) The Trustee or the Master  Servicer on the  Trustee's  behalf  shall
execute and deliver to the Master Servicer,  if necessary,  any court pleadings,
requests for trustee's sale or other  documents  necessary to the foreclosure or
trustee's sale in respect of a Mortgaged Property or to any


                                              60

<PAGE>



legal action  brought to obtain  judgment  against any Mortgagor on the Mortgage
Note or Mortgage  or to obtain a  deficiency  judgment,  or to enforce any other
remedies or rights  provided  by the  Mortgage  Note or  Mortgage  or  otherwise
available at law or in equity.  Together  with such  documents or pleadings  (if
signed by the  Trustee),  the Master  Servicer  shall  deliver to the  Trustee a
certificate of a Servicing  Officer  requesting that such pleadings or documents
be executed by the Trustee and  certifying  as to the reason such  documents  or
pleadings  are  required  and that the  execution  and  delivery  thereof by the
Trustee will not invalidate any insurance  coverage under any Required Insurance
Policy or  invalidate or otherwise  affect the lien of the Mortgage,  except for
the  termination of such a lien upon  completion of the foreclosure or trustee's
sale.

        Section 3.16  Servicing and Other Compensation; Compensating Interest.
                      --------------------------------------------------------

        (a) The Master Servicer,  as compensation for its activities  hereunder,
shall be entitled to receive on each  Distribution Date the amounts provided for
by clauses (iii),  (iv), (v) and (vi) of Section 3.10(a),  subject to clause (e)
below. The amount of servicing  compensation  provided for in such clauses shall
be accounted for on a Mortgage  Loan-by-Mortgage  Loan basis.  In the event that
Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds  and REO  Proceeds  (net of  amounts
reimbursable  therefrom  pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(ii))  in respect of a Cash
Liquidation  or REO  Disposition  exceed  the unpaid  principal  balance of such
Mortgage  Loan plus  unpaid  interest  accrued  thereon  (including  REO Imputed
Interest)  at a per annum rate equal to the  related Net  Mortgage  Rate (or the
Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan), the Master
Servicer  shall be entitled to retain  therefrom and to pay to itself and/or the
related   Subservicer,   any  Foreclosure  Profits  and  any  Servicing  Fee  or
Subservicing Fee considered to be accrued but unpaid.

        (b) Additional servicing compensation in the form of prepayment charges,
assumption  fees,  late  payment  charges,  investment  income on amounts in the
Custodial  Account or the Certificate  Account or otherwise shall be retained by
the Master Servicer or the Subservicer to the extent provided herein, subject to
clause (e) below.

        (c) The Master  Servicer  shall be required to pay, or cause to be paid,
all  expenses  incurred  by it  in  connection  with  its  servicing  activities
hereunder (including payment of premiums for the Primary Insurance Policies,  if
any,  to the extent  such  premiums  are not  required to be paid by the related
Mortgagors,  and the fees and  expenses of the Trustee  and any  Custodian)  and
shall not be entitled to reimbursement  therefor except as specifically provided
in Sections 3.10 and 3.14.

        (d) The Master  Servicer's right to receive  servicing  compensation may
not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of
all of its  responsibilities  and  obligations of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement.

        (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the amount of servicing
compensation  that the Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to receive  for its
activities  hereunder for the period ending on each  Distribution  Date shall be
reduced  (but not below zero) by an amount  equal to  Compensating  Interest (if
any) for such  Distribution  Date.  Such reduction  shall be applied during such
period as follows:  first, to any Servicing Fee or Subservicing Fee to which the
Master Servicer is entitled pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(iii) and second, to any
income or gain  realized  from any  investment  of funds  held in the  Custodial
Account or the Certificate Account to which the Master Servicer is


                                              61

<PAGE>



entitled pursuant to Sections 3.07(c) or 4.01(b),  respectively.  In making such
reduction,  the Master Servicer (i) will not withdraw from the Custodial Account
any such amount  representing  all or a portion of the Servicing Fee to which it
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.10(a)(iii) and (ii) will not withdraw from the
Custodial Account or Certificate Account any such amount to which it is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.07(c) or 4.01(b).

        Section 3.17 Reports to the Trustee and the Company.

        Not later than fifteen  days after each  Distribution  Date,  the Master
Servicer shall forward to the Trustee and the Company a statement,  certified by
a Servicing Officer, setting forth the status of the Custodial Account as of the
close of business on such  Distribution Date as it relates to the Mortgage Loans
and showing, for the period covered by such statement, the aggregate of deposits
in or  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account in respect of the Mortgage Loans
for each  category of deposit  specified  in Section  3.07 and each  category of
withdrawal specified in Section 3.10.

        Section 3.18  Annual Statement as to Compliance.
                      ---------------------------------

        The Master  Servicer  will deliver to the  Company,  the Trustee and any
Certificate Insurer on or before March 31 of each year, beginning with the first
March 31 that occurs at least six months  after the Cut-off  Date,  an Officers'
Certificate  stating,  as to each  signer  thereof,  that  (i) a  review  of the

its servicing of mortgage loans and its performance  under pooling and servicing
agreements,  including  this  Agreement,  has been  made  under  such  officers'
supervision, (ii) to the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review,
the Master  Servicer  has  complied in all  material  respects  with the minimum
servicing  standards  set forth in the Uniform  Single  Attestation  Program for
Mortgage Bankers and has fulfilled all of its material  obligations  relating to
this Agreement in all material  respects  throughout such year, or, if there has
been material  noncompliance  with such servicing  standards or a default in the
fulfillment  in all material  respects of any such  obligation  relating to this
Agreement,  such statement shall include a description of such  noncompliance or
specify  each such  default,  as the case may be,  known to such officer and the
nature and status  thereof  and (iii) to the best of such  officers'  knowledge,
each  Subservicer  has  complied  in all  material  respects  with  the  minimum
servicing  standards  set forth in the Uniform  Single  Attestation  Program for
Mortgage  Bankers and has  fulfilled all of its material  obligations  under its
Subservicing  Agreement in all material  respects  throughout  such year, or, if
there  has been  material  noncompliance  with  such  servicing  standards  or a
material  default  in the  fulfillment  of  such  obligations  relating  to this
Agreement,  such statement shall include a description of such  noncompliance or
specify  each such  default,  as the case may be,  known to such officer and the
nature and status thereof.

        Section 3.19  Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report.
                      -------------------------------------------------------

        On or before  March 31 of each year,  beginning  with the first March 31
that occurs at least six months after the Cut-off Date,  the Master  Servicer at
its expense shall cause a firm of independent public accountants, which shall be
members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,  to furnish a
report to the Company and the Trustee  stating its opinion that, on the basis of
an examination conducted by such firm substantially in accordance with standards
established  by the  American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants,  the
assertions made pursuant


                                              62

<PAGE>



to Section 3.18 regarding  compliance with the minimum  servicing  standards set
forth in the Uniform Single Attestation  Program for Mortgage Bankers during the
preceding calendar year are fairly stated in all material  respects,  subject to
such exceptions and other qualifications that, in the opinion of such firm, such
accounting  standards  require it to report.  In rendering such statement,  such
firm may rely, as to matters  relating to the direct servicing of mortgage loans
by  Subservicers,  upon  comparable  statements  for  examinations  conducted by
independent  public  accountants  substantially  in  accordance  with  standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  (rendered
within one year of such statement) with respect to such Subservicers.

        Section 3.20 Rights of the Company in Respect of the Master Servicer.

        The Master Servicer shall afford the Company,  upon  reasonable  notice,
during  normal  business  hours access to all records  maintained  by the Master
Servicer  in  respect  of its rights  and  obligations  hereunder  and access to
officers of the Master Servicer responsible for such obligations.  Upon request,
the Master  Servicer  shall  furnish the Company with its most recent  financial
statements and such other information as the Master Servicer possesses regarding
its business,  affairs,  property and  condition,  financial or  otherwise.  The
Master   Servicer  shall  also  cooperate  with  all  reasonable   requests  for
information  including,  but not limited to, notices, tapes and copies of files,
regarding  itself,  the Mortgage  Loans or the  Certificates  from any Person or
Persons identified by the Company or Residential  Funding.  The Company may, but
is not obligated to, enforce the  obligations of the Master  Servicer  hereunder
and may, but is not obligated to, perform,  or cause a designee to perform,  any
defaulted  obligation of the Master Servicer hereunder or exercise the rights of
the Master  Servicer  hereunder;  provided that the Master Servicer shall not be
relieved of any of its  obligations  hereunder by virtue of such  performance by
the Company or its designee.  The Company shall not have any  responsibility  or
liability  for any action or failure  to act by the Master  Servicer  and is not
obligated  to  supervise  the  performance  of the  Master  Servicer  under this
Agreement or otherwise.

        Section 3.21  Administration of Buydown Funds.
                      -------------------------------

        (a) With  respect to any Buydown  Mortgage  Loan,  the  Subservicer  has
deposited  Buydown  Funds in an account that  satisfies the  requirements  for a
Subservicing  Account (the "Buydown  Account").  The Master Servicer shall cause
the  Subservicing  Agreement to require that upon receipt from the  Mortgagor of
the amount due on a Due Date for each Buydown  Mortgage  Loan,  the  Subservicer
will withdraw from the Buydown Account the predetermined amount that, when added
to the  amount  due on such date from the  Mortgagor,  equals  the full  Monthly
Payment  and  transmit  that  amount  in  accordance   with  the  terms  of  the
Subservicing  Agreement to the Master Servicer together with the related payment
made by the Mortgagor or advanced by the Subservicer.

        (b) If the Mortgagor on a Buydown Mortgage Loan prepays such loan in its
entirety  during  the period  (the  "Buydown  Period")  when  Buydown  Funds are
required to be applied to such Buydown  Mortgage Loan, the Subservicer  shall be
required to  withdraw  from the  Buydown  Account  and remit any  Buydown  Funds
remaining  in the  Buydown  Account  in  accordance  with  the  related  buydown
agreement.  The amount of Buydown Funds which may be remitted in accordance with
the related  buydown  agreement may reduce the amount required to be paid by the
Mortgagor  to fully  prepay the related  Mortgage  Loan.  If the  Mortgagor on a
Buydown Mortgage Loan defaults on such


                                              63

<PAGE>



Mortgage Loan during the Buydown  Period and the property  securing such Buydown
Mortgage Loan is sold in the liquidation  thereof (either by the Master Servicer
or the insurer under any related  Primary  Insurance  Policy),  the  Subservicer
shall be  required to withdraw  from the Buydown  Account the Buydown  Funds for
such Buydown  Mortgage Loan still held in the Buydown Account and remit the same
to the  Master  Servicer  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of the  Subservicing
Agreement for deposit in the  Custodial  Account or, if instructed by the Master
Servicer,  pay to the insurer under any related Primary  Insurance Policy if the
Mortgaged  Property is  transferred to such insurer and such insurer pays all of
the loss incurred in respect of such default. Any amount so remitted pursuant to
the preceding  sentence will be deemed to reduce the amount owed on the Mortgage
Loan.

                         PAYMENTS TO CERTIFICATEHOLDERS

        Section 4.01  Certificate Account.
                      -------------------

        (a) The Master  Servicer on behalf of the Trustee  shall  establish  and
maintain a Certificate  Account in which the Master  Servicer  shall cause to be
deposited  on behalf of the Trustee on or before 2:00 P.M. New York time on each
Certificate Account Deposit Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds
an amount  equal to the sum of (i) any  Advance for the  immediately  succeeding
Distribution  Date,  (ii) any amount required to be deposited in the Certificate
Account pursuant to Section  3.12(a),  (iii) any amount required to be deposited
in the Certificate Account pursuant to Section 3.16(e) or Section 4.07, (iv) any
amount  required to be paid  pursuant to Section 9.01 and (v) all other  amounts
constituting the Available  Distribution  Amount for the immediately  succeeding
Distribution Date.

        (b) The Trustee shall,  upon written  request from the Master  Servicer,
invest or cause the institution  maintaining  the Certificate  Account to invest
the funds in the Certificate Account in Permitted Investments  designated in the
name of the  Trustee  for the  benefit of the  Certificateholders,  which  shall
mature or be payable on demand not later than the  Business  Day next  preceding
the  Distribution  Date next following the date of such investment  (except that
(i) any  investment in the  institution  with which the  Certificate  Account is
maintained may mature or be payable on demand on such Distribution Date and (ii)
any other  investment  may mature or be  payable on demand on such  Distribution
Date  if the  Trustee  shall  advance  funds  on such  Distribution  Date to the
Certificate   Account  in  the  amount  payable  on  such   investment  on  such
Distribution  Date,  pending  receipt  thereof to the extent  necessary  to make
distributions on the Certificates) and shall not be sold or disposed of prior to
maturity. Subject to Section 3.16(e), all income and gain realized from any such
investment  shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer and shall be subject
to its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any losses  incurred
in respect of any such investments shall be deposited in the Certificate Account
by the Master Servicer out of its own funds  immediately as realized without any
right of reimbursement.

of Certificates, the Mortgage Pool and, if the Mortgage Pool is comprised of two
or more Loan Groups,  each Loan Group, to the extent applicable.  This statement

are no less  convenient  for the  Certificateholders.  The Trustee shall provide
prior   notification   to   the   Company,   the   Master   Servicer   and   the
Certificateholders  regarding  any such  modification.  In addition,  the Master
Servicer shall provide to any manager of a trust fund  consisting of some or all
of the Certificates,  upon reasonable request, such additional information as is
reasonably  obtainable by the Master  Servicer at no  additional  expense to the
Master Servicer.

        (b) Within a  reasonable  period of time after the end of each  calendar
year,  the Master  Servicer shall  prepare,  or cause to be prepared,  and shall
forward,  or cause to be  forwarded,  to each  Person who at any time during the
calendar year was the Holder of a Certificate, other than a Class R Certificate,
a statement  containing the information set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
exhibit to the Series Supplement  referred to in subsection (a) above aggregated

was a Certificateholder.  Such obligation of the Master Servicer shall be deemed
to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially  comparable  information
shall be provided by the Master  Servicer  pursuant to any  requirements  of the
Code.

        (c) Within a  reasonable  period of time after the end of each  calendar
year,  the Master  Servicer shall  prepare,  or cause to be prepared,  and shall

calendar year was the Holder of a Class R  Certificate,  a statement  containing
the applicable  distribution  information provided pursuant to this Section 4.03
aggregated  for such calendar year or applicable  portion  thereof  during which
such  Person was the Holder of a Class R  Certificate.  Such  obligation  of the
Master  Servicer  shall be deemed  to have been  satisfied  to the  extent  that
substantially  comparable  information  shall be provided by the Master Servicer
pursuant to any requirements of the Code.

        (d)  Upon the  written  request  of any  Certificateholder,  the  Master
Servicer,  as soon as  reasonably  practicable,  shall  provide  the  requesting
Certificateholder with such information as is necessary and appropriate,  in the

                      Company; Advances by the Master Servicer.

        (a) Prior to the close of business on the Determination Date, the Master
Servicer  shall  furnish a written  statement  to the Trustee,  any  Certificate

required to be  withdrawn  from the  Custodial  Account and  deposited  into the
Certificate  Account on the immediately  succeeding  Certificate Account Deposit
Date  pursuant to clause  (iii) of Section  4.01(a).  The  determination  by the
Master  Servicer of such  amounts  shall,  in the absence of obvious  error,  be
presumptively  deemed to be correct for all purposes  hereunder  and the Trustee
shall be protected in relying  upon the same  without any  independent  check or
verification.

        (b) On or before  2:00 P.M.  New York time on each  Certificate  Account
Deposit Date, the Master  Servicer  shall either (i) deposit in the  Certificate

related  Distribution  Date,  which shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the
aggregate  amount of  Monthly  Payments  (with  each  interest  portion  thereof
adjusted to the Net  Mortgage  Rate),  less the amount of any related  Servicing
Modifications,  Debt Service  Reductions or reductions in the amount of interest
collectable  from the Mortgagor  pursuant to the  Soldiers'  and Sailors'  Civil
Relief Act of 1940, as amended,  or similar  legislation or regulations  then in
effect,  on the  Outstanding  Mortgage  Loans as of the related Due Date,  which
Monthly  Payments were  delinquent as of the close of business as of the related
Determination  Date;  provided  that no  Advance  shall be made if it would be a
Nonrecoverable  Advance,  (ii) withdraw from amounts on deposit in the Custodial
Account  and deposit in the  Certificate  Account all or a portion of the Amount
Held for Future  Distribution  in discharge of any such  Advance,  or (iii) make
advances in the form of any  combination of (i) and (ii)  aggregating the amount
of such Advance.  Any portion of the Amount Held for Future Distribution so used
shall be replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the  Certificate  Account
on or before 11:00 A.M. New York time on any future Certificate  Account Deposit
Date to the  extent  that  funds  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans that are
available in the  Custodial  Account for deposit in the  Certificate  Account on
such   Certificate   Account  Deposit  Date  shall  be  less  than  payments  to
Certificateholders  required to be made on the following  Distribution Date. The
Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to use any Advance made by a Subservicer  as
described in Section 3.07(b) that has been deposited in the Custodial Account on
or before  such  Distribution  Date as part of the  Advance  made by the  Master
Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.04. The amount of any reimbursement pursuant
to Section 4.02(a) in respect of outstanding  Advances on any Distribution  Date
shall be allocated to specific  Monthly Payments due but delinquent for previous
Due Periods,  which  allocation  shall be made,  to the extent  practicable,  to
Monthly Payments which have been delinquent for the longest period of time. Such
allocations  shall be  conclusive  for purposes of  reimbursement  to the Master
Servicer from recoveries on related Mortgage Loans pursuant to Section 3.10.

        The   determination   by  the  Master   Servicer  that  it  has  made  a
Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute a
Nonrecoverable  Advance,  shall be evidenced by an Officers'  Certificate of the
Master Servicer delivered to the Company and the Trustee.

        If the Master  Servicer  determines as of the Business Day preceding any
Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date  that it will be unable  to  deposit  in the
Certificate  Account an amount equal to the Advance  required to be made for the
immediately succeeding Distribution Date, it shall give notice to the Trustee of
its inability to advance (such notice may be given by telecopy),  not later than
3:00 P.M.,  New York time, on such Business Day,  specifying the portion of such
amount  that it will be unable to  deposit.  Not later than 3:00 P.M.,  New York
time, on the Certificate Account Deposit Date the Trustee shall, unless by 12:00
Noon, New York time, on such day the Trustee shall have been notified in writing
(by  telecopy)  that the Master  Servicer  shall  have  directly  or  indirectly
deposited in the  Certificate  Account such portion of the amount of the Advance
as to which  the  Master  Servicer  shall  have  given  notice  pursuant  to the
preceding  sentence,  pursuant to Section 7.01,  (a) terminate all of the rights
and  obligations of the Master  Servicer under this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.01 and (b) assume the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer
hereunder,  including the  obligation to deposit in the  Certificate  Account an
amount equal to the Advance for the immediately succeeding Distribution Date.

        The Trustee shall deposit all funds it receives pursuant to this Section
4.04 into the Certificate Account.

        Section 4.05  Allocation of Realized Losses.

        As provided in Section 4.05 of the Series Supplement.

with  respect  to the  receipt  of  mortgage  interests  received  in a trade or
business, the reports of foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property
and the information returns relating to cancellation of indebtedness income with
respect to any Mortgaged  Property required by Sections 6050H,  6050J and 6050P,
respectively,  of the Code, and deliver to the Trustee an Officers'  Certificate
on or before  March 31 of each year  stating  that such reports have been filed.
Such reports  shall be in form and  substance  sufficient  to meet the reporting
requirements imposed by Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P of the Code.

        Section 4.07  Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.
                      ---------------------------------------------

        As to any  Mortgage  Loan which is  delinquent  in payment by 90 days or
more, the Master  Servicer may, at its option,  purchase such Mortgage Loan from
the Trustee at the Purchase Price  therefor.  If at any time the Master Servicer
makes a payment to the Certificate  Account  covering the amount of the Purchase
Price for such a Mortgage Loan, and the Master Servicer  provides to the Trustee
a  certification  signed by a Servicing  Officer stating that the amount of such
payment has been deposited in the  Certificate  Account,  then the Trustee shall
execute  the  assignment  of such  Mortgage  Loan at the  request  of the Master
Servicer without recourse to the Master Servicer, which shall succeed to all the
Trustee's  right,  title and  interest  in and to such  Mortgage  Loan,  and all
security and documents relative thereto.  Such assignment shall be an assignment
outright and not for  security.  The Master  Servicer  will  thereupon  own such
Mortgage, and all such security and documents, free of any further obligation to
the Trustee or the Certificateholders with respect thereto.

        If,  however  the  Master  Servicer  shall have  exercised  its right to
repurchase  a Mortgage  Loan  pursuant  to this  Section  4.07 upon the  written
request of and with funds provided by the Junior Certificateholder and thereupon
transferred  such  Mortgage  Loan to the  Junior  Certificateholder,  the Master
Servicer shall so notify the Trustee in writing.

        Section 4.08  Surety Bond.
                      -----------

        (a) If a Required Surety Payment is payable  pursuant to the Surety Bond
with respect to any Additional  Collateral  Loan,  the Master  Servicer shall so
notify the  Trustee as soon as  reasonably  practicable  and the  Trustee  shall
promptly  complete the notice in the form of Attachment 1 to the Surety Bond and
shall  promptly  submit  such  notice to the  Surety  as a claim for a  Required
Surety.  The Master Servicer shall upon request assist the Trustee in completing
such  notice and shall  provide  any  information  requested  by the  Trustee in
connection therewith.

        (b) Upon receipt of a Required  Surety Payment from the Surety on behalf
of the Holders of  Certificates,  the Trustee shall deposit such Required Surety
Payment in the  Certificate  Account and shall  distribute  such Required Surety
Payment,  or the proceeds thereof,  in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.02.

        (c) The Trustee shall (i) receive as  attorney-in-fact of each Holder of
a Certificate  any Required Surety Payment from the Surety and (ii) disburse the
same to the Holders of such Certificates as set forth in Section 4.02.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                THE CERTIFICATES

        Section 5.01  The Certificates.

        (a) The  Senior,  Class M,  Class B and  Class R  Certificates  shall be
substantially  in the forms set forth in Exhibits  A, B, C and D,  respectively,
and shall,  on original  issue,  be executed and delivered by the Trustee to the
Certificate  Registrar for  authentication  and delivery to or upon the order of
the  Company  upon  receipt  by the  Trustee  or one or more  Custodians  of the
documents  specified in Section 2.01. The Certificates  shall be issuable in the
minimum  denominations  designated  in the  Preliminary  Statement to the Series
Supplement.

        The Certificates  shall be executed by manual or facsimile  signature on
behalf of an authorized officer of the Trustee.  Certificates bearing the manual
or facsimile  signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers
of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee,  notwithstanding that such individuals or
any of them have ceased to hold such  offices  prior to the  authentication  and
delivery of such  Certificate  or did not hold such  offices at the date of such
Certificates.  No  Certificate  shall be  entitled  to any  benefit  under  this
Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate
a certificate of  authentication  substantially  in the form provided for herein
executed by the Certificate Registrar by manual signature,  and such certificate
upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence,  and the only evidence,  that
such


                                              68

<PAGE>



Certificate  has  been  duly   authenticated   and  delivered   hereunder.   All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

        (b) Except as provided below,  registration  of Book-Entry  Certificates
may not be transferred by the Trustee except to another  Depository  that agrees
to hold such Certificates for the respective  Certificate  Owners with Ownership
Interests therein.  The Holders of the Book-Entry  Certificates shall hold their
respective  Ownership Interests in and to each of such Certificates  through the
book-entry facilities of the Depository and, except as provided below, shall not
be entitled to Definitive  Certificates in respect of such Ownership  Interests.
All transfers by Certificate Owners of their respective  Ownership  Interests in
the  Book-Entry  Certificates  shall be made in accordance  with the  procedures
established by the Depository  Participant or brokerage firm  representing  such
Certificate  Owner.  Each  Depository  Participant  shall transfer the Ownership
Interests  only  in  the  Book-Entry   Certificates  of  Certificate  Owners  it
represents or of brokerage  firms for which it acts as agent in accordance  with
the Depository's normal procedures.

        The  Trustee,  the Master  Servicer and the Company may for all purposes
(including  the making of payments due on the  respective  Classes of Book-Entry
Certificates)  deal with the Depository as the authorized  representative of the
Certificate  Owners  with  respect  to  the  respective  Classes  of  Book-Entry
Certificates  for the purposes of  exercising  the rights of  Certificateholders
hereunder.  The rights of  Certificate  Owners  with  respect to the  respective
Classes of Book-Entry  Certificates shall be limited to those established by law
and agreements between such Certificate  Owners and the Depository  Participants
and brokerage firms representing such Certificate Owners.  Multiple requests and
directions  from,  and  votes  of,  the  Depository  as  Holder  of any Class of
Book-Entry  Certificates  with  respect to any  particular  matter  shall not be
deemed  inconsistent  if they are made with  respect  to  different  Certificate
Owners.  The Trustee may establish a reasonable  record date in connection  with
solicitations  of consents from or voting by  Certificateholders  and shall give
notice to the Depository of such record date.

        If (i)(A) the Company advises the Trustee in writing that the Depository
is no longer  willing or able to  properly  discharge  its  responsibilities  as
Depository and (B) the Company is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii)
the  Company  at its option  advises  the  Trustee in writing  that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Depository, the Trustee shall notify
all Certificate  Owners,  through the Depository,  of the occurrence of any such
event and of the availability of Definitive  Certificates to Certificate  Owners
requesting   the  same.   Upon  surrender  to  the  Trustee  of  the  Book-Entry
Certificates by the Depository,  accompanied by registration  instructions  from
the  Depository  for  registration  of  transfer,  the  Trustee  shall issue the
Definitive  Certificates.  Neither  the  Company,  the Master  Servicer  nor the
Trustee shall be liable for any actions taken by the  Depository or its nominee,
including,  without  limitation,  any delay in delivery of such instructions and
may  conclusively   rely  on,  and  shall  be  protected  in  relying  on,  such
instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates all references herein
to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Company in connection with
the issuance of the Definitive  Certificates pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall
be deemed to be imposed upon and  performed by the Trustee,  and the Trustee and
the Master Servicer shall  recognize the Holders of the Definitive  Certificates
as Certificateholders hereunder.

        (c) From time to time Residential  Funding, as the initial Holder of the
Class A-V  Certificates,  may exchange such Holder's Class A-V  Certificates for
Subclasses  of Class A-V  Certificates  to be issued  under  this  Agreement  by
delivering a "Request for Exchange" substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit N executed by an authorized officer, which Subclasses, in the aggregate,
will   represent  the   Uncertificated   Class  A-V  REMIC   Regular   Interests
corresponding  to the Class A-V  Certificates so surrendered  for exchange.  Any
Subclass so issued  shall bear a  numerical  designation  commencing  with Class
A-V-1 and continuing sequentially thereafter, and will evidence ownership of the
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interest or Interests specified in writing by such
initial  Holder to the  Trustee.  The  Trustee  may  conclusively,  without  any
independent  verification,  rely on,  and  shall be  protected  in  relying  on,
Residential  Funding's  determinations  of the  Uncertificated  Class  A-V REMIC
Regular Interests corresponding to any Subclass, the Initial Notional Amount and
the initial  Pass-Through  Rate on a Subclass  as set forth in such  Request for
Exchange and the Trustee  shall have no duty to determine if any  Uncertificated
Class  A-V  REMIC  Regular  Interest   designated  on  a  Request  for  Exchange
corresponds  to a Subclass which has  previously  been issued.  Each Subclass so
issued shall be  substantially  in the form set forth in Exhibit A and shall, on
original  issue,  be executed and  delivered  by the Trustee to the  Certificate
Registrar for  authentication  and delivery in accordance with Section  5.01(a).
Every  Certificate  presented or surrendered  for exchange by the initial Holder
shall (if so  required  by the  Trustee or the  Certificate  Registrar)  be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written  instrument of transfer  attached to
such  Certificate and shall be completed to the  satisfaction of the Trustee and
the  Certificate  Registrar  duly executed by, the initial Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.  The  Certificates of any Subclass of Class
A-V  Certificates  may be transferred  in whole,  but not in part, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.02.

        Section 5.02  Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.
                      -----------------------------------------------------

        (a) The Trustee shall cause to be kept at one of the offices or agencies
to be appointed by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.12
a Certificate  Register in which,  subject to such reasonable  regulations as it
may prescribe,  the Trustee shall provide for the  registration  of Certificates
and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein  provided.  The Trustee
is initially  appointed  Certificate  Registrar  for the purpose of  registering
Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The
Certificate Registrar,  or the Trustee, shall provide the Master Servicer with a
certified list of Certificateholders as of each Record Date prior to the related
Determination Date.

        (b) Upon surrender for  registration  of transfer of any  Certificate at
any office or agency of the  Trustee  maintained  for such  purpose  pursuant to
Section  8.12 and,  in the case of any Class M, Class B or Class R  Certificate,
upon  satisfaction of the conditions set forth below,  the Trustee shall execute
and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
designated  transferee or  transferees,  one or more new  Certificates of a like
Class (or Subclass) and aggregate Percentage Interest.

        (c)  At  the  option  of  the  Certificateholders,  Certificates  may be
exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like Class (or
Subclass) and aggregate Percentage Interest,  upon surrender of the Certificates
to be exchanged at any such office or agency.  Whenever any  Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange the Trustee shall execute and the Certificate


                                              70

<PAGE>



Registrar shall  authenticate  and deliver the  Certificates of such Class which
the  Certificateholder  making  the  exchange  is  entitled  to  receive.  Every
Certificate  presented  or  surrendered  for  transfer or exchange  shall (if so
required by the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be
accompanied  by a written  instrument  of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the  Certificate  Registrar  duly executed by, the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

        (d) No  transfer,  sale,  pledge  or  other  disposition  of a  Class  B
Certificate  shall  be  made  unless  such  transfer,   sale,  pledge  or  other
disposition is exempt from the  registration  requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended,  and any  applicable  state  securities  laws or is made in
accordance  with said Act and laws.  In the event that a  transfer  of a Class B
Certificate  is to be made  either  (i)(A) the Trustee  shall  require a written
Opinion of Counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Company that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption,
describing the applicable  exemption and the basis  therefor,  from said Act and
laws or is being made  pursuant to said Act and laws,  which  Opinion of Counsel
shall not be an  expense of the  Trustee,  the  Company  or the Master  Servicer
(except that, if such transfer is made by the Company or the Master  Servicer or
any Affiliate  thereof,  the Company or the Master  Servicer  shall provide such
Opinion of Counsel at their own expense);  provided that such Opinion of Counsel
will not be  required  in  connection  with  the  initial  transfer  of any such
Certificate  by the  Company  or any  Affiliate  thereof  to the  Company  or an
Affiliate of the Company and (B) the Trustee  shall  require the  transferee  to
execute a representation letter,  substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto,
and the Trustee shall require the transferor to execute a representation letter,
substantially  in the form of Exhibit I hereto,  each  acceptable to and in form
and  substance  satisfactory  to the Company and the Trustee  certifying  to the
Company  and  the   Trustee  the  facts   surrounding   such   transfer,   which
representation  letters  shall not be an expense of the Trustee,  the Company or
the Master Servicer;  provided,  however, that such representation  letters will
not be required in connection  with any transfer of any such  Certificate by the
Company or any Affiliate  thereof to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company,
and the Trustee  shall be entitled to  conclusively  rely upon a  representation
(which, upon the request of the Trustee, shall be a written representation) from
the Company,  of the status of such transferee as an Affiliate of the Company or
(ii) the  prospective  transferee  of such a  Certificate  shall be  required to
provide the  Trustee,  the Company and the Master  Servicer  with an  investment
letter  substantially  in the form of Exhibit J  attached  hereto (or such other
form as the Company in its sole discretion deems  acceptable),  which investment
letter  shall not be an  expense  of the  Trustee,  the  Company  or the  Master
Servicer,  and which  investment  letter states that,  among other things,  such
transferee (A) is a "qualified  institutional buyer" as defined under Rule 144A,
acting for its own  account or the  accounts of other  "qualified  institutional
buyers"  as  defined  under  Rule  144A,  and (B) is  aware  that  the  proposed
transferor intends to rely on the exemption from registration requirements under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Rule 144A. The Holder of any
such  Certificate  desiring to effect any such transfer,  sale,  pledge or other
disposition shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Company,
the Master Servicer and the Certificate Registrar against any liability that may
result if the transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is not so exempt or is
not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

        (e) (i) In the case of any Class B or Class R Certificate  presented for
registration in the name of any Person,  either (A) the Trustee shall require an
Opinion of Counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer to the effect that the purchase or
holding of such Class B or Class R Certificate is permissible under applicable


                                              71

law, will not  constitute  or result in any  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction
under  Section 406 of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"),  or Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable provisions of any
subsequent  enactments),  and will not subject the  Trustee,  the Company or the
Master  Servicer  to any  obligation  or  liability  (including  obligations  or
liabilities  under  ERISA or  Section  4975 of the  Code) in  addition  to those
undertaken in this  Agreement,  which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense
of the  Trustee,  the  Company or the  Master  Servicer  or (B) the  prospective
Transferee shall be required to provide the Trustee,  the Company and the Master
Servicer  with a  certification  to the  effect  set forth in  paragraph  six of
Exhibit H (with  respect to any Class B  Certificate)  or paragraph  fourteen of
Exhibit  G-1 (with  respect to any Class R  Certificate),  which the Trustee may
rely upon without further inquiry or investigation, or such other certifications
as the Trustee may deem  desirable or necessary in order to establish  that such
Transferee or the Person in whose name such registration is requested either (a)
is not an  employee  benefit  plan  or  other  plan  subject  to the  prohibited
transaction  provisions  of ERISA or  Section  4975 of the Code,  or any  Person
(including an  investment  manager,  a named  fiduciary or a trustee of any such
plan) who is using  "plan  assets" of any such plan to effect  such  acquisition
(each,  a "Plan  Investor") or (b) in the case of any Class B  Certificate,  the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) such Transferee is an insurance company,
(ii) the source of funds used to purchase or hold such  Certificate (or interest
therein)  is  an  "insurance  company  general  account"  (as  defined  in  U.S.
Department of Labor Prohibited  Transaction Class Exemption  ("PTCE") 95-60, and
(iii) the  conditions  set forth in  Sections  I and III of PTCE 95-60 have been
satisfied  (each entity that satisfies  this clause (b), a "Complying  Insurance
Company").

                      (ii)  Any  Transferee  of a  Class M  Certificate  will be
               deemed to have  represented  by virtue of its purchase or holding
               of such  Certificate  (or interest  therein) that either (a) such
               Transferee  is not a Plan  Investor,  (b) it has  acquired and is
               holding such  Certificate  in reliance on Prohibited  Transaction
               Exemption  ("PTE") 94-29, 59 Fed. Reg. 14674 (March 29, 1994), as
               amended by PTE 97-34, 62 Fed. Reg. 39021 (July 21, 1997), and PTE
               2000-58,  65 Fed.  Reg.  67765  (November  13,  2000)  (the  "RFC
               Exemption"),  and that it  understands  that  there  are  certain
               conditions to the  availability  of the RFC  Exemption  including
               that such Certificate must be rated, at the time of purchase, not
               lower than "BBB-" (or its equivalent) by Standard & Poor's, Fitch
               or  Moody's  or (c)  such  Transferee  is a  Complying  Insurance
               Company.

                      (iii)  (A) If any  Class M  Certificate  (or any  interest
               therein)  is acquired or held by any Person that does not satisfy
               the conditions  described in paragraph (ii) above,  then the last
               preceding Transferee that either (i) is not a Plan Investor, (ii)
               acquired such  Certificate in compliance  with the RFC Exemption,
               or (iii) is a Complying  Insurance Company shall be restored,  to
               the extent  permitted  by law, to all rights and  obligations  as
               Certificate  Owner  thereof  retroactive  to  the  date  of  such
               Transfer of such Class M Certificate.  The Trustee shall be under
               no  liability  to any Person for making any  payments due on such
               Certificate to such preceding Transferee.

                             (B)   Any   purported   Certificate   Owner   whose
                      acquisition  or  holding  of any Class M  Certificate  (or
                      interest therein) was effected in violation of the

                      restrictions  in this Section  5.02(e) shall indemnify and
                      hold  harmless  the  Company,   the  Trustee,  the  Master
                      Servicer, any Subservicer,  each Underwriter and the Trust
                      Fund from and  against  any and all  liabilities,  claims,
                      costs or expenses  incurred by such parties as a result of
                      such acquisition or holding.

        (f) (i) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership  Interest in a
Class R Certificate  shall be deemed by the  acceptance or  acquisition  of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to
have  irrevocably  authorized the Trustee or its designee under clause  (iii)(A)
below to deliver  payments to a Person  other than such Person and to  negotiate
the terms of any mandatory  sale under clause  (iii)(B) below and to execute all
instruments of transfer and to do all other things  necessary in connection with
any such sale. The rights of each Person  acquiring any Ownership  Interest in a
Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:

                      Interest  in a Class R  Certificate  shall be a  Permitted
                      Transferee  and shall  promptly  notify the Trustee of any
                      change or  impending  change in its status as a  Permitted
                      Transferee.

                             (B) In connection with any proposed Transfer of any
                      Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate,  the Trustee
                      shall  require  delivery to it, and shall not register the
                      Transfer of any Class R Certificate  until its receipt of,
                      (I) an affidavit and agreement (a "Transfer  Affidavit and
                      Agreement,"  in the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit G-1)
                      from  the  proposed  Transferee,  in  form  and  substance
                      satisfactory  to the  Master  Servicer,  representing  and
                      warranting,  among  other  things,  that it is a Permitted
                      Transferee,   that  it  is  not  acquiring  its  Ownership
                      Interest in the Class R Certificate that is the subject of
                      the proposed  Transfer as a nominee,  trustee or agent for
                      any Person who is not a Permitted Transferee,  that for so
                      long as it retains  its  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
                      Certificate,  it  will  endeavor  to  remain  a  Permitted
                      Transferee,  and that it has  reviewed the  provisions  of
                      this Section  5.02(f) and agrees to be bound by them,  and
                      (II) a certificate, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
                      G-2,  from the  Holder  wishing  to  transfer  the Class R
                      Certificate,  in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the
                      Master Servicer,  representing and warranting, among other
                      things,  that no purpose of the  proposed  Transfer  is to
                      impede the assessment or collection of tax.

                             (C)  Notwithstanding  the  delivery  of a  Transfer
                      Affidavit  and  Agreement by a proposed  Transferee  under
                      clause (B) above, if a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee
                      who is assigned  to this  Agreement  has actual  knowledge
                      that  the   proposed   Transferee   is  not  a   Permitted
                      Transferee,  no  Transfer  of an  Ownership  Interest in a
                      Class R Certificate to such proposed  Transferee  shall be
                      effected.

                             (D) Each Person  holding or acquiring any Ownership
                      Interest  in a  Class R  Certificate  shall  agree  (x) to
                      require a Transfer  Affidavit and Agreement from any other
                      Person  to whom  such  Person  attempts  to  transfer  its
                      Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate and (y) not to
                      transfer  its  Ownership  Interest  unless it  provides  a
                      certificate to the Trustee in the form attached  hereto as
                      Exhibit G-2.

                             (E) Each Person  holding or  acquiring an Ownership
                      Interest  in a  Class  R  Certificate,  by  purchasing  an
                      Ownership Interest in such Certificate, agrees to give the
                      Trustee written notice that it is a "pass-through interest
                      holder"   within  the   meaning  of   Temporary   Treasury
                      Regulations Section  1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A)  immediately upon
                      acquiring an Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate,
                      if it is, or is holding an Ownership Interest in a Class R
                      Certificate  on  behalf  of,  a   "pass-through   interest
                      holder."

                      (ii) The Trustee will register the Transfer of any Class R
               Certificate only if it shall have received the Transfer Affidavit
               and  Agreement,  a  certificate  of the  Holder  requesting  such
               transfer  in the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit G-2 and all of
               such other  documents as shall have been  reasonably  required by
               the Trustee as a condition to such registration. Transfers of the
               Class  R   Certificates   to   Non-United   States   Persons  and
               Disqualified  Organizations (as defined in Section  860E(e)(5) of
               the Code) are prohibited.

                      (iii) (A) If any Disqualified  Organization shall become a
               holder  of  a  Class  R  Certificate,  then  the  last  preceding
               Permitted  Transferee shall be restored,  to the extent permitted
               by  law,  to  all  rights  and   obligations  as  Holder  thereof
               retroactive to the date of  registration of such Transfer of such
               Class R Certificate. If a Non-United States Person shall become a
               holder of a Class R Certificate,  then the last preceding  United
               States Person shall be restored,  to the extent permitted by law,
               to all rights and  obligations as Holder  thereof  retroactive to
               the  date of  registration  of  such  Transfer  of  such  Class R
               Certificate.   If  a  transfer  of  a  Class  R  Certificate   is
               disregarded  pursuant to the  provisions of Treasury  Regulations
               Section  1.860E-1 or Section  1.860G-3,  then the last  preceding
               Permitted  Transferee shall be restored,  to the extent permitted
               by  law,  to  all  rights  and   obligations  as  Holder  thereof
               retroactive to the date of  registration of such Transfer of such
               Class R  Certificate.  The Trustee shall be under no liability to
               any  Person  for  any  registration  of  Transfer  of a  Class  R
               Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section 5.02(f)
               or for making any payments due on such  Certificate to the holder
               thereof  or for  taking  any other  action  with  respect to such
               holder under the provisions of this Agreement.

                             (B) If any  purported  Transferee  shall  become  a
                      Holder  of a  Class  R  Certificate  in  violation  of the
                      restrictions  in this  Section  5.02(f)  and to the extent
                      that the  retroactive  restoration  of the  rights  of the
                      Holder of such Class R Certificate  as described in clause
                      (iii)(A) above shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
                      then the Master  Servicer  shall  have the right,  without
                      notice to the  holder or any prior  holder of such Class R
                      Certificate, to sell such Class


                                              74

                      R  Certificate  to a  purchaser  selected  by  the  Master
                      Servicer on such terms as the Master  Servicer may choose.
                      Such  purported  Transferee  shall  promptly  endorse  and
                      deliver each Class R Certificate  in  accordance  with the
                      instructions of the Master Servicer. Such purchaser may be
                      the Master  Servicer itself or any Affiliate of the Master
                      Servicer.   The   proceeds  of  such  sale,   net  of  the
                      commissions (which may include  commissions payable to the
                      Master  Servicer or its  Affiliates),  expenses  and taxes
                      due, if any,  will be  remitted by the Master  Servicer to
                      such purported Transferee. The terms and conditions of any
                      sale under this clause (iii)(B) shall be determined in the
                      sole  discretion  of the Master  Servicer,  and the Master
                      Servicer  shall  not be  liable  to any  Person  having an
                      Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate as a result of
                      its exercise of such discretion.

                      (iv) The Master Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee,  shall
               make  available,  upon  written  request  from the  Trustee,  all
               information  necessary to compute any tax imposed (A) as a result
               of the Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate
               to any Person who is a Disqualified  Organization,  including the
               information   regarding  "excess  inclusions"  of  such  Class  R
               Certificates  required  to be provided  to the  Internal  Revenue
               Service and certain Persons as described in Treasury  Regulations
               Sections  1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E-2(a)(5),  and (B) as a result
               of any  regulated  investment  company,  real  estate  investment
               trust,   common  trust  fund,   partnership,   trust,  estate  or
               organization  described in Section 1381 of the Code that holds an
               Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate  having as among its
               record  holders  at any time  any  Person  who is a  Disqualified
               Organization.   Reasonable   compensation   for  providing   such
               information  may be  required  by the Master  Servicer  from such
               Person.

                      (v) The provisions of this Section 5.02(f) set forth prior
               to this  clause  (v) may be  modified,  added  to or  eliminated,
               provided that there shall have been  delivered to the Trustee the
               following:

                             (A) written notification from each Rating Agency to
                      the  effect   that  the   modification,   addition  to  or
                      elimination of such  provisions will not cause such Rating
                      Agency to downgrade its then-current  ratings,  if any, of
                      any Class of the Senior,  Class M or Class B  Certificates
                      below the lower of the  then-current  rating or the rating
                      assigned to such  Certificates  as of the Closing  Date by
                      such Rating Agency; and

                             (B)  subject  to  Section  10.01(f),  an  Officers'
                      Certificate of the Master Servicer stating that the Master
                      Servicer has  received an Opinion of Counsel,  in form and
                      substance  satisfactory  to the  Master  Servicer,  to the
                      effect that such  modification,  addition to or absence of
                      such  provisions  will not cause any  portion of any REMIC
                      formed under the Series  Supplement to cease to qualify as
                      a REMIC and will not cause  (x) any  portion  of any REMIC
                      formed  under the  Series  Supplement  to be subject to an
                      entity-level  tax  caused by the  Transfer  of any Class R
                      Certificate to a Person that is a

                      Disqualified  Organization or (y) a  Certificateholder  or
                      another Person to be subject to a REMIC-related tax caused
                      by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate  to a Person that
                      is not a Permitted Transferee.

        (g) No service  charge  shall be made for any  transfer  or  exchange of
Certificates  of any  Class,  but  the  Trustee  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover  any tax or  governmental  charge  that may be  imposed  in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

     (h) All  Certificates  surrendered  for  transfer  and  exchange  shall  be
destroyed by the Certificate Registrar.

        Section 5.03  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

        If (i) any  mutilated  Certificate  is  surrendered  to the  Certificate
Registrar,  or the Trustee and the  Certificate  Registrar  receive  evidence to
their  satisfaction of the destruction,  loss or theft of any  Certificate,  and
(ii) there is  delivered  to the  Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar  such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them  harmless,
then, in the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate  Registrar that
such  Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,  the Trustee shall
execute  and the  Certificate  Registrar  shall  authenticate  and  deliver,  in
exchange  for or in lieu  of any  such  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Certificate,  a new Certificate of like tenor, Class and Percentage Interest but
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate  under this  Section,  the  Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental  charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the
Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar)  connected  therewith.  Any  duplicate
Certificate  issued  pursuant to this  Section  shall  constitute  complete  and
indefeasible  evidence of ownership in the Trust Fund, as if originally  issued,
whether or not the lost,  stolen or destroyed  Certificate shall be found at any
time.

        Section 5.04  Persons Deemed Owners.
                      ---------------------

        Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee,  any Certificate  Insurer,  the
Certificate  Registrar and any agent of the Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the
Trustee,  any  Certificate  Insurer or the  Certificate  Registrar may treat the
Person  in  whose  name  any  Certificate  is  registered  as the  owner of such
Certificate for the purpose of receiving  distributions pursuant to Section 4.02
and for all other purposes  whatsoever,  except as and to the extent provided in
the  definition  of  "Certificateholder,"  and neither the  Company,  the Master
Servicer,  the Trustee, any Certificate  Insurer, the Certificate  Registrar nor
any agent of the Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee,  any  Certificate
Insurer or the Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary
except as provided in Section 5.02(f).

        Section 5.05  Appointment of Paying Agent.
                      ---------------------------

        The  Trustee  may  appoint  a Paying  Agent  for the  purpose  of making
distributions to the  Certificateholders  pursuant to Section 4.02. In the event
of any  such  appointment,  on or  prior to each  Distribution  Date the  Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trustee  shall  deposit or cause to be deposited  with
the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to make the payments to the Certificateholders
in the


                                              76

amounts and in the manner  provided for in Section 4.02,  such sum to be held in
trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

        The Trustee  shall cause each Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying  Agent shall agree with the Trustee
that such  Paying  Agent  will hold all sums held by it for the  payment  to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the  Certificateholders  entitled
thereto  until such sums shall be paid to such  Certificateholders.  Any sums so
held by such Paying Agent shall be held only in Eligible  Accounts to the extent
such sums are not distributed to the  Certificateholders  on the date of receipt
by such Paying Agent.

                       THE COMPANY AND THE MASTER SERVICER

          Section 6.01  Respective  Liabilities  of the  Company  and the Master
               Servicer.

        The Company and the Master  Servicer  shall each be liable in accordance
herewith only to the extent of the  obligations  specifically  and  respectively
imposed upon and undertaken by the Company and the Master  Servicer  herein.  By
way of  illustration  and not  limitation,  the  Company  is not  liable for the
servicing  and  administration  of the  Mortgage  Loans,  nor is it obligated by
Section 7.01 or Section 10.01 to assume any  obligations of the Master  Servicer
or to appoint a designee  to assume such  obligations,  nor is it liable for any
other  obligation  hereunder that it may, but is not obligated to, assume unless
it elects to assume such obligation in accordance herewith.

          Section 6.02  Merger or  Consolidation  of the  Company  or the Master
               Servicer; Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties by Master
               Servicer.

        (a) The  Company and the Master  Servicer  will each keep in full effect
its  existence,  rights and  franchises as a  corporation  under the laws of the
state of its incorporation,  and will each obtain and preserve its qualification
to do  business  as a foreign  corporation  in each  jurisdiction  in which such
qualification   is  or  shall  be   necessary   to  protect  the   validity  and
enforceability of this Agreement,  the Certificates or any of the Mortgage Loans
and to perform its respective duties under this Agreement.

        (b) Any Person  into which the  Company  or the Master  Servicer  may be
merged  or  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting  from  any  merger  or
consolidation  to which the Company or the Master  Servicer shall be a party, or
any Person  succeeding  to the  business of the Company or the Master  Servicer,
shall be the  successor of the Company or the Master  Servicer,  as the case may
be,  hereunder,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act
on the  part of any of the  parties  hereto,  anything  herein  to the  contrary
notwithstanding;  provided,  however,  that the successor or surviving Person to
the Master  Servicer  shall be qualified to service  mortgage loans on behalf of
Fannie Mae or Freddie  Mac;  and  provided  further  that each  Rating  Agency's
ratings,  if any,  of the  Senior,  Class M or Class B  Certificates  in  effect
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation will not be qualified, reduced
or withdrawn as a result  thereof (as  evidenced by a letter to such effect from
each Rating Agency).

        (c) Notwithstanding  anything else in this Section 6.02 and Section 6.04
to the  contrary,  the Master  Servicer  may assign its rights and  delegate its
duties and obligations under this Agreement;  provided that the Person accepting
such  assignment or  delegation  shall be a Person which is qualified to service
mortgage   loans  on  behalf  of  Fannie  Mae  or  Freddie  Mac,  is  reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company,  is willing to service the Mortgage
Loans and executes and delivers to the Company and the Trustee an agreement,  in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, which
contains an  assumption by such Person of the due and punctual  performance  and
observance  of each  covenant  and  condition to be performed or observed by the
Master Servicer under this Agreement; provided further that each Rating Agency's


                                              78

<PAGE>



rating of the Classes of Certificates that have been rated in effect immediately
prior to such  assignment  and  delegation  will not be  qualified,  reduced  or
withdrawn  as a result of such  assignment  and  delegation  (as  evidenced by a
letter  to such  effect  from  each  Rating  Agency).  In the  case of any  such
assignment  and  delegation,  the Master  Servicer  shall be  released  from its
obligations  under this Agreement,  except that the Master Servicer shall remain
liable for all  liabilities  and  obligations  incurred by it as Master Servicer
hereunder  prior to the  satisfaction  of the conditions to such  assignment and
delegation set forth in the next preceding sentence.

          Section 6.03  Limitation  on  Liability  of the  Company,  the  Master
               Servicer and Others.

        Neither  the  Company,  the Master  Servicer  nor any of the  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents of the Company or the Master  Servicer  shall be
under any liability to the Trust Fund or the  Certificateholders  for any action
taken or for refraining  from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to
this  Agreement,  or for  errors  in  judgment;  provided,  however,  that  this
provision shall not protect the Company,  the Master Servicer or any such Person
against any breach of warranties or representations made herein or any liability
which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance,  bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard
of obligations and duties  hereunder.  The Company,  the Master Servicer and any
director,  officer,  employee or agent of the Company or the Master Servicer may
rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and
submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising  hereunder.  The Company,
the Master Servicer and any director,  officer, employee or agent of the Company
or the Master  Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trust Fund and held harmless
against any loss,  liability or expense  incurred in  connection  with any legal
action  relating to this  Agreement  or the  Certificates,  other than any loss,
liability or expense  related to any specific  Mortgage  Loan or Mortgage  Loans
(except as any such loss,  liability or expense shall be otherwise  reimbursable
pursuant  to this  Agreement)  and any loss,  liability  or expense  incurred by
reason of willful misfeasance,  bad faith or gross negligence in the performance
of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties
hereunder.

        Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Master  Servicer  shall  be  under  any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal or administrative action,
proceeding,  hearing or  examination  that is not  incidental to its  respective
duties  under this  Agreement  and which in its  opinion  may  involve it in any
expense or liability; provided, however, that the Company or the Master Servicer
may  in its  discretion  undertake  any  such  action,  proceeding,  hearing  or
examination that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement
and the  rights  and  duties of the  parties  hereto  and the  interests  of the
Certificateholders  hereunder.  In such event,  the legal  expenses and costs of
such action,  proceeding,  hearing or  examination  and any liability  resulting
therefrom  shall be expenses,  costs and  liabilities of the Trust Fund, and the
Company and the Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed  therefor out
of amounts  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans on  deposit  in the  Custodial
Account as provided by Section 3.10 and, on the Distribution  Date(s)  following
such reimbursement,  the aggregate of such expenses and costs shall be allocated
in reduction of the Accrued Certificate  Interest on each Class entitled thereto
in the same  manner as if such  expenses  and  costs  constituted  a  Prepayment
Interest Shortfall.

        Section 6.04  Company and Master Servicer Not to Resign.
                      -----------------------------------------

        Subject to the  provisions of Section 6.02,  neither the Company nor the
Master  Servicer shall resign from its respective  obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon  determination that its duties hereunder are no longer
permissible  under  applicable  law.  Any  such  determination   permitting  the
resignation  of the  Company or the Master  Servicer  shall be  evidenced  by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Trustee.  No such resignation
by the Master  Servicer shall become  effective until the Trustee or a successor
servicer  shall  have  assumed  the  Master  Servicer's   responsibilities   and
obligations in accordance with Section 7.02.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                     DEFAULT

        Section 7.01  Events of Default.

        Event of Default,  wherever used herein,  means any one of the following
events  (whatever  reason  for such  Event of  Default  and  whether it shall be
voluntary or  involuntary  or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any
judgment,  decree or order of any court or any order,  rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body):

                      (i) the Master  Servicer shall fail to distribute or cause
               to be distributed to the Holders of Certificates of any Class any
               distribution   required  to  be  made  under  the  terms  of  the
               Certificates  of such  Class and this  Agreement  and,  in either
               case,  such failure shall  continue  unremedied for a period of 5
               days after the date upon which  written  notice of such  failure,
               requiring  such failure to be remedied,  shall have been given to
               the  Master  Servicer  by the  Trustee  or the  Company or to the
               Master  Servicer,  the  Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
               Certificates  of  such  Class  evidencing   Percentage  Interests
               aggregating not less than 25%; or

                      (ii) the Master  Servicer shall fail to observe or perform
               in any material  respect any other of the covenants or agreements
               on the part of the Master Servicer  contained in the Certificates
               of any Class or in this Agreement and such failure shall continue
               unremedied  for a period of 30 days  (except  that such number of
               days shall be 15 in the case of a failure to pay the  premium for
               any Required  Insurance  Policy)  after the date on which written
               notice of such failure,  requiring the same to be remedied, shall
               have been  given to the  Master  Servicer  by the  Trustee or the
               Company,  or to the Master Servicer,  the Company and the Trustee
               by the Holders of  Certificates of any Class  evidencing,  in the
               case of any such Class, Percentage Interests aggregating not less
               than 25%; or

                      (iii)  a  decree   or  order  of  a  court  or  agency  or
               supervisory  authority having  jurisdiction in the premises in an
               involuntary  case under any  present  or future  federal or state
               bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing a conservator
               or receiver or  liquidator  in any  insolvency,  readjustment  of
               debt,   marshalling   of  assets  and   liabilities   or  similar
               proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs,

               shall have been  entered  against  the Master  Servicer  and such
               decree or order  shall have  remained  in force  undischarged  or
               unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

                      (iv) the Master  Servicer shall consent to the appointment
               of a conservator  or receiver or  liquidator  in any  insolvency,
               readjustment of debt,  marshalling of assets and liabilities,  or
               similar  proceedings  of, or relating to, the Master  Servicer or
               of, or relating to, all or  substantially  all of the property of
               the Master Servicer; or

                      (v)  the  Master  Servicer  shall  admit  in  writing  its
               inability to pay its debts  generally as they become due,  file a
               petition  to take  advantage  of, or  commence a  voluntary  case
               under, any applicable insolvency or reorganization  statute, make
               an assignment  for the benefit of its  creditors,  or voluntarily
               suspend payment of its obligations; or

                      (vi) the Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee pursuant
               to  Section   4.04(b)  that  it  is  unable  to  deposit  in  the
               Certificate Account an amount equal to the Advance.

        If an Event of  Default  described  in clauses  (i)-(v) of this  Section
shall  occur,  then,  and in each and every such case,  so long as such Event of
Default shall not have been remedied, either the Company or the Trustee may, and
at the  direction  of Holders of  Certificates  entitled  to at least 51% of the
Voting Rights,  the Trustee shall,  by notice in writing to the Master  Servicer
(and to the  Company if given by the  Trustee or to the  Trustee if given by the
Company),  terminate all of the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer
under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds  thereof,
other than its rights as a Certificateholder  hereunder.  If an Event of Default
described in clause (vi) hereof shall occur, the Trustee shall, by notice to the
Master  Servicer and the Company,  immediately  terminate  all of the rights and
obligations  of the  Master  Servicer  under  this  Agreement  and in and to the
Mortgage  Loans  and  the  proceeds   thereof,   other  than  its  rights  as  a
Certificateholder  hereunder  as  provided in Section  4.04(b).  On or after the
receipt by the Master Servicer of such written  notice,  all authority and power
of the  Master  Servicer  under  this  Agreement,  whether  with  respect to the
Certificates  (other  than  as a  Holder  thereof)  or  the  Mortgage  Loans  or
otherwise, shall subject to Section 7.02 pass to and be vested in the Trustee or
the  Trustee's  designee  appointed  pursuant  to  Section  7.02;  and,  without
limitation,  the  Trustee is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to execute  and
deliver, on behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any
and all documents and other instruments,  and to do or accomplish all other acts
or things  necessary  or  appropriate  to effect the  purposes of such notice of
termination,  whether to complete the transfer and  endorsement or assignment of
the Mortgage  Loans and related  documents,  or otherwise.  The Master  Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the  termination of the Master
Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation,
the transfer to the Trustee or its designee for administration by it of all cash
amounts  which  shall at the time be credited  to the  Custodial  Account or the
Certificate  Account or  thereafter  be received  with  respect to the  Mortgage
Loans. No such  termination  shall release the Master Servicer for any liability
that it would  otherwise  have  hereunder  for any act or omission  prior to the
effective time of such termination.

        Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of Residential Funding
in its  capacity as Master  Servicer  hereunder,  Residential  Funding  shall be
entitled  to  receive,  out of any late  collection  of a Monthly  Payment  on a
Mortgage  Loan  which  was  due  prior  to the  notice  terminating  Residential
Funding's rights and obligations as Master Servicer hereunder and received after
such notice,  that portion to which Residential Funding would have been entitled
pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(ii), (vi) and (vii) as well as its Servicing Fee in
respect thereof,  and any other amounts payable to Residential Funding hereunder
the  entitlement  to which  arose  prior to the  termination  of its  activities
hereunder.  Upon the  termination  of  Residential  Funding  as Master  Servicer
hereunder the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a copy of the Program Guide.

        Section 7.02  Trustee or Company to Act; Appointment of Successor.
                      ---------------------------------------------------

        (a) On and  after  the time the  Master  Servicer  receives  a notice of
termination pursuant to Section 7.01 or resigns in accordance with Section 6.04,
the Trustee or, upon notice to the Company and with the Company's consent (which
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) a designee  (which meets the standards set
forth  below) of the  Trustee,  shall be the  successor  in all  respects to the
Master  Servicer  in its  capacity  as  servicer  under this  Agreement  and the
transactions  set forth or  provided  for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities,  duties and liabilities  relating thereto placed on the Master
Servicer (except for the  responsibilities,  duties and liabilities contained in
Sections 2.02 and 2.03(a),  excluding the duty to notify related Subservicers or
Sellers as set forth in such Sections, and its obligations to deposit amounts in
respect of losses incurred prior to such notice or termination on the investment
of funds  in the  Custodial  Account  or the  Certificate  Account  pursuant  to
Sections  3.07(c) and  4.01(b) by the terms and  provisions  hereof);  provided,
however,  that any failure to perform such duties or responsibilities  caused by
the  preceding  Master  Servicer's  failure to provide  information  required by
Section  4.04 shall not be  considered  a default by the Trustee  hereunder.  As
compensation  therefor,  the Trustee shall be entitled to all funds  relating to
the Mortgage Loans which the Master  Servicer would have been entitled to charge
to the Custodial  Account or the Certificate  Account if the Master Servicer had
continued to act  hereunder  and, in  addition,  shall be entitled to the income
from any Permitted  Investments  made with amounts  attributable to the Mortgage
Loans held in the Custodial Account or the Certificate  Account.  If the Trustee
has become the successor to the Master  Servicer in accordance with Section 6.04
or Section 7.01, then notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling to so act, or shall, if it is unable to so act, appoint, or petition a
court of competent  jurisdiction to appoint,  any  established  housing and home
finance  institution,  which  is  also a  Fannie  Mae- or  Freddie  Mac-approved
mortgage servicing institution,  having a net worth of not less than $10,000,000
as the successor to the Master  Servicer  hereunder in the  assumption of all or
any part of the  responsibilities,  duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer
hereunder.  Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder,
the Trustee shall become  successor to the Master Servicer and shall act in such
capacity as  hereinabove  provided.  In  connection  with such  appointment  and
assumption,  the Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such
successor  out of  payments  on Mortgage  Loans as it and such  successor  shall
agree;  provided,  however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
permitted the initial Master Servicer hereunder.  The Company,  the Trustee, the
Custodian  and such  successor  shall  take such  action,  consistent  with this
Agreement,  as  shall be  necessary  to  effectuate  any  such  succession.  The
Servicing  Fee for any  successor  Master  Servicer  appointed  pursuant to this
Section 7.02 will be lowered with respect to those Mortgage Loans, if any, where
the Subservicing Fee accrues at a rate of less than 0.20% per annum in the event
that the


                                              82

<PAGE>



successor  Master  Servicer is not servicing such Mortgage Loans directly and it
is necessary to raise the related  Subservicing Fee to a rate of 0.20% per annum
in order to hire a Subservicer with respect to such Mortgage Loans.

        (b) In connection  with the  termination  or  resignation  of the Master
Servicer  hereunder,  either (i) the successor  Master  Servicer,  including the
Trustee if the Trustee is acting as successor Master  Servicer,  shall represent
and  warrant  that it is a member of MERS in good  standing  and shall  agree to
comply  in all  material  respects  with the  rules  and  procedures  of MERS in
connection  with the servicing of the Mortgage  Loans that are  registered  with
MERS, in which case the  predecessor  Master  Servicer shall  cooperate with the
successor  Master  Servicer in causing MERS to revise its records to reflect the
transfer of servicing to the successor  Master Servicer as necessary under MERS'
rules and regulations,  or (ii) the predecessor  Master Servicer shall cooperate
with the  successor  Master  Servicer in causing  MERS to execute and deliver an
assignment of Mortgage in recordable  form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to
the Trustee and to execute and deliver such other  notices,  documents and other
instruments  as may be  necessary  or  desirable  to effect a  transfer  of such
Mortgage Loan or servicing of such  Mortgage  Loan on the MERS(R)  System to the
successor Master Servicer.  The predecessor  Master Servicer shall file or cause
to be  filed  any such  assignment  in the  appropriate  recording  office.  The
predecessor  Master  Servicer  shall  bear any and all  fees of  MERS,  costs of
preparing  any  assignments  of  Mortgage,  and fees and  costs  of  filing  any
assignments  of Mortgage  that may be required  under this  subsection  (b). The
successor  Master  Servicer  shall cause such  assignment to be delivered to the
Trustee or the Custodian  promptly upon receipt of the original with evidence of
recording  thereon or a copy certified by the public  recording  office in which
such assignment was recorded.

        Section 7.03  Notification to Certificateholders.
                      ----------------------------------

        (a) Upon any such  termination  or  appointment  of a  successor  to the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee shall give prompt  written  notice thereof to the
Certificateholders  at their respective  addresses  appearing in the Certificate
Register.

        (b) Within 60 days after the  occurrence  of any Event of  Default,  the
Trustee  shall  transmit by mail to all Holders of  Certificates  notice of each
such Event of  Default  hereunder  known to the  Trustee,  unless  such Event of
Default shall have been cured or waived.

        Section 7.04  Waiver of Events of Default.
                      ---------------------------

        The Holders representing at least 66% of the Voting Rights affected by a
default  or Event of  Default  hereunder  may  waive  such  default  or Event of
Default; provided,  however, that (a) a default or Event of Default under clause
(i) of Section  7.01 may be waived  only by all of the  Holders of  Certificates
affected by such default or Event of Default and (b) no waiver  pursuant to this
Section 7.04 shall affect the Holders of Certificates in the manner set forth in
Section  11.01(b)(i)  or (ii).  Upon any such  waiver of a  default  or Event of
Default by the Holders  representing  the requisite  percentage of Voting Rights
affected by such  default or Event of Default,  such default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose
hereunder.  No such waiver shall extend to any  subsequent  or other  default or
Event of  Default or impair any right  consequent  thereon  except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

        Section 8.01  Duties of Trustee.
                      -----------------

        (a) The  Trustee,  prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default  and
after the  curing or waiver of all Events of  Default  which may have  occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are  specifically  set
forth in this Agreement. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not
been cured or waived),  the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested  in it by this  Agreement,  and use the same  degree of care and skill in
their  exercise  as  a  prudent   investor  would  exercise  or  use  under  the
circumstances in the conduct of such investor's own affairs.

        (b)  The  Trustee,  upon  receipt  of  all  resolutions,   certificates,
statements,  opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically  required to be furnished  pursuant to any
provision  of this  Agreement,  shall  examine  them to  determine  whether they
conform to the  requirements  of this  Agreement.  The Trustee  shall notify the
Certificateholders  of any such documents which do not materially conform to the
requirements  of  this  Agreement  in the  event  that  the  Trustee,  after  so
requesting, does not receive satisfactorily corrected documents.

        The Trustee shall  forward or cause to be forwarded in a timely  fashion
the  notices,  reports and  statements  required to be  forwarded by the Trustee
pursuant to Sections 4.03,  4.06, 7.03 and 10.01. The Trustee shall furnish in a
timely fashion to the Master  Servicer such  information as the Master  Servicer
may reasonably  request from time to time for the Master Servicer to fulfill its
duties as set forth in this Agreement.  The Trustee covenants and agrees that it
shall perform its obligations hereunder in a manner so as to maintain the status
of any portion of any REMIC formed under the Series  Supplement as a REMIC under
the REMIC Provisions and (subject to Section 10.01(f)) to prevent the imposition
of any federal, state or local income,  prohibited transaction,  contribution or
other tax on the Trust  Fund to the  extent  that  maintaining  such  status and
avoiding  such taxes are  reasonably  within the  control of the Trustee and are
reasonably within the scope of its duties under this Agreement.

        (c) No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent  action,  its own negligent failure
to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, however, that:

                      (i) Prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default,  and
               after the curing or waiver of all such  Events of  Default  which
               may have  occurred,  the duties and  obligations  of the  Trustee
               shall be  determined  solely by the  express  provisions  of this
               Agreement,  the  Trustee  shall  not be  liable  except  for  the
               performance of such duties and  obligations  as are  specifically
               set forth in this Agreement,  no implied covenants or obligations
               shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee and, in the
               absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee,  the Trustee may
               conclusively  rely,  as to the  truth of the  statements  and the
               correctness  of  the  opinions   expressed   therein,   upon  any
               certificates or opinions  furnished to the Trustee by the Company
               or the

                    Master  Servicer and which on their face, do not  contradict
                    the requirements of this Agreement;

                      (ii) The  Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable for an
               error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible  Officer or
               Responsible  Officers of the  Trustee,  unless it shall be proved
               that the Trustee was  negligent  in  ascertaining  the  pertinent
               facts;

                      (iii) The  Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable  with
               respect to any action  taken,  suffered or omitted to be taken by
               it  in  good  faith  in   accordance   with  the   direction   of
               Certificateholders   of  any  Class  holding  Certificates  which
               evidence, as to such Class,  Percentage Interests aggregating not
               less than 25% as to the time,  method and place of conducting any
               proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
               any  trust  or  power  conferred  upon the  Trustee,  under  this
               Agreement;

                      (iv) The Trustee  shall not be charged  with  knowledge of
               any  default  (other  than a default in  payment to the  Trustee)
               specified  in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 or an Event of
               Default under clauses (iii),  (iv) and (v) of Section 7.01 unless
               a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee  assigned to and working in
               the  Corporate  Trust  Office  obtains  actual  knowledge of such
               failure or event or the Trustee  receives  written notice of such
               failure or event at its  Corporate  Trust  Office from the Master
               Servicer, the Company or any Certificateholder; and

                      (v) Except to the extent  provided  in  Section  7.02,  no
               provision in this  Agreement  shall require the Trustee to expend
               or risk its own funds (including,  without limitation, the making
               of  any  Advance)  or  otherwise  incur  any  personal  financial
               liability  in the  performance  of any of its  duties as  Trustee
               hereunder,  or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
               the Trustee  shall have  reasonable  grounds for  believing  that
               repayment  of funds or adequate  indemnity  against  such risk or
               liability is not reasonably assured to it.

        (d) The Trustee shall timely pay, from its own funds,  the amount of any
and all federal,  state and local taxes  imposed on the Trust Fund or its assets
or transactions  including,  without  limitation,  (A) "prohibited  transaction"
penalty  taxes as defined in Section 860F of the Code,  if, when and as the same
shall be due and  payable,  (B) any tax on  contributions  to a REMIC  after the
Closing  Date  imposed  by  Section  860G(d) of the Code and (C) any tax on "net
income from foreclosure property" as defined in Section 860G(c) of the Code, but
only if such  taxes  arise out of a breach  by the  Trustee  of its  obligations
hereunder,  which breach  constitutes  negligence  or willful  misconduct of the
Trustee.

        Section 8.02  Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.
                      -------------------------------------

        (a)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:



                                              85

<PAGE>



                      (i) The Trustee may rely and shall be  protected in acting
               or  refraining  from  acting  upon  any   resolution,   Officers'
               Certificate,  certificate  of auditors or any other  certificate,
               statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
               order, appraisal,  bond or other paper or document believed by it
               to be genuine and to have been signed or  presented by the proper
               party or parties;

                      (ii) The Trustee may consult  with counsel and any Opinion
               of  Counsel  shall  be  full  and  complete   authorization   and
               protection  in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted
               by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion
               of Counsel;

                      (iii) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
               any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this  Agreement or to
               institute,  conduct  or defend  any  litigation  hereunder  or in
               relation hereto at the request,  order or direction of any of the
               Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
               unless such Certificateholders  shall have offered to the Trustee
               reasonable security or indemnity against the costs,  expenses and
               liabilities  which may be incurred  therein or  thereby;  nothing
               contained  herein  shall,  however,  relieve  the  Trustee of the
               obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (which has
               not been cured or  waived),  to  exercise  such of the rights and
               powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same degree
               of care and skill in their  exercise as a prudent  investor would
               exercise  or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of such
               investor's own affairs;

                      (iv) The Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable for any
               action  taken,  suffered  or  omitted  by it in  good  faith  and
               believed  by it to be  authorized  or within  the  discretion  or
               rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement;

                      (v)  Prior  to  the  occurrence  of an  Event  of  Default
               hereunder and after the curing or waiver of all Events of Default
               which may have  occurred,  the Trustee shall not be bound to make
               any  investigation  into  the  facts  or  matters  stated  in any
               resolution,  certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
               notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or
               document,  unless  requested  in  writing  so to do by Holders of
               Certificates  of  any  Class   evidencing,   as  to  such  Class,
               Percentage  Interests,  aggregating not less than 50%;  provided,
               however,  that if the  payment  within a  reasonable  time to the
               Trustee  of the  costs,  expenses  or  liabilities  likely  to be
               incurred  by it in the  making of such  investigation  is, in the
               opinion of the Trustee,  not reasonably assured to the Trustee by
               the security  afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement,  the
               Trustee may require reasonable  indemnity against such expense or
               liability as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense
               of every such  examination  shall be paid by the Master Servicer,
               if an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, and
               otherwise by the Certificateholder requesting the investigation;

                      (vi) The  Trustee  may execute any of the trusts or powers
               hereunder or perform any duties  hereunder  either directly or by
               or through agents or attorneys; and

<PAGE>



                      (vii)  To the  extent  authorized  under  the Code and the
               regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  each  Holder  of a Class R
               Certificate  hereby  irrevocably   appoints  and  authorizes  the
               Trustee to be its  attorney-in-fact  for  purposes of signing any
               Tax Returns required to be filed on behalf of the Trust Fund. The
               Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust Fund and deliver to the
               Master Servicer in a timely manner any Tax Returns prepared by or
               on behalf of the Master  Servicer that the Trustee is required to
               sign as determined by the Master Servicer  pursuant to applicable
               federal,  state or  local  tax  laws,  provided  that the  Master
               Servicer  shall  indemnify  the  Trustee for signing any such Tax
               Returns that contain errors or omissions.

        (b)  Following the issuance of the  Certificates,  the Trustee shall not
accept any  contribution  of assets to the Trust Fund unless (subject to Section
10.01(f)) it shall have obtained or been furnished with an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect  that such  contribution  will not (i) cause any portion of any REMIC
formed  under the  Series  Supplement  to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time
that any Certificates are outstanding or (ii) cause the Trust Fund to be subject
to any federal tax as a result of such contribution (including the imposition of
any federal tax on "prohibited  transactions"  imposed under Section  860F(a) of
the Code).

        Section 8.03  Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Mortgage Loans.
                      -----------------------------------------------------

        The recitals  contained herein and in the  Certificates  (other than the
execution of the  Certificates and relating to the acceptance and receipt of the
Mortgage  Loans) shall be taken as the  statements  of the Company or the Master
Servicer as the case may be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.  The  Trustee  makes  no  representations  as to  the  validity  or
sufficiency  of  this  Agreement  or  of  the  Certificates   (except  that  the
Certificates  shall be duly and  validly  executed  and  authenticated  by it as
Certificate  Registrar) or of any Mortgage Loan or related document,  or of MERS
or the MERS(R) System.  Except as otherwise  provided herein,  the Trustee shall
not be  accountable  for the use or  application  by the  Company  or the Master
Servicer of any of the Certificates or of the proceeds of such Certificates,  or
for the use or  application  of any  funds  paid to the  Company  or the  Master
Servicer in respect of the Mortgage  Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from the
Custodial  Account  or the  Certificate  Account  by the  Company  or the Master
Servicer.

        Section 8.04  Trustee May Own Certificates.

        The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee  of  Certificates  with the same  rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

     Section  8.05  Master   Servicer  to  Pay  Trustee's   Fees  and  Expenses;
Indemnification.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee and
any co-trustee  from time to time,  and the Trustee and any co-trustee  shall be
entitled  to,  reasonable  compensation  (which  shall  not  be  limited  by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust)
for all services  rendered by each of them in the execution of the trusts hereby
created  and in the  exercise  and  performance  of any of the powers and duties
hereunder of the Trustee and


                                              87

<PAGE>



any  co-trustee,  and the Master  Servicer will pay or reimburse the Trustee and
any  co-trustee  upon request for all  reasonable  expenses,  disbursements  and
advances  incurred or made by the Trustee or any  co-trustee in accordance  with
any of the provisions of this Agreement  (including the reasonable  compensation
and the  expenses  and  disbursements  of its  counsel  and of all  persons  not
regularly  in its  employ,  and the  expenses  incurred  by the  Trustee  or any
co-trustee in connection with the appointment of an office or agency pursuant to
Section 8.12) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from
its negligence or bad faith.

        (b) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold
the Trustee harmless  against,  any loss,  liability or expense incurred without
negligence or willful  misconduct on the Trustee's  part,  arising out of, or in
connection with, the acceptance and administration of the Trust Fund,  including
the costs  and  expenses  (including  reasonable  legal  fees and  expenses)  of
defending   itself  against  any  claim  in  connection  with  the  exercise  or
performance  of any of its  powers  or  duties  under  this  Agreement  and  the
Custodial Agreement, provided that:

                      (i) with respect to any such claim, the Trustee shall have
               given the Master Servicer  written notice thereof  promptly after
               the Trustee shall have actual knowledge thereof;

                      (ii) while maintaining  control over its own defense,  the
               Trustee  shall  cooperate  and  consult  fully  with  the  Master
               Servicer in preparing such defense; and

                      (iii)  notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the
               contrary,  the Master Servicer shall not be liable for settlement
               of any  claim by the  Trustee  entered  into  without  the  prior
               consent  of  the  Master  Servicer  which  consent  shall  not be
               unreasonably withheld.

        No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations created by
this Section  8.05(b) of the Master  Servicer to indemnify the Trustee under the
conditions and to the extent set forth herein.

        Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  indemnification  provided  by the
Master Servicer in this Section 8.05(b) shall not pertain to any loss, liability
or expense of the Trustee,  including the costs and expenses of defending itself
against any claim,  incurred in connection with any actions taken by the Trustee
at the  direction  of the  Certificateholders  pursuant  to the  terms  of  this
Agreement.

        Section 8.06  Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.
                      ------------------------------------

        The Trustee  hereunder shall at all times be a corporation or a national
banking  association  having its principal office in a state and city acceptable
to the Company and organized and doing  business under the laws of such state or
the United States of America,  authorized under such laws to exercise  corporate
trust powers,  having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or  examination  by federal or state  authority.  If such
corporation or national banking  association  publishes  reports of condition at
least  annually,  pursuant  to  law  or to the  requirements  of  the  aforesaid
supervising  or examining  authority,  then for the purposes of this Section the
combined  capital  and  surplus  of such  corporation  shall be deemed to be its
combined


                                              88

<PAGE>



capital  and  surplus as set forth in its most  recent  report of  condition  so
published.  In case at any time  the  Trustee  shall  cease  to be  eligible  in
accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Section,  the  Trustee  shall  resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07.

        Section 8.07 Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

        (a) The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts
hereby created by giving  written notice thereof to the Company.  Upon receiving
such notice of  resignation,  the  Company  shall  promptly  appoint a successor
trustee by written instrument,  in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall
be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee.  If
no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted  appointment
within 30 days after the giving of such  notice of  resignation,  the  resigning
Trustee may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor trustee.

        (b) If at any time the Trustee  shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the  provisions  of  Section  8.06 and shall fail to resign  after  written
request  therefor by the  Company,  or if at any time the Trustee  shall  become
incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged  bankrupt or insolvent,  or a receiver
of the Trustee or of its  property  shall be  appointed,  or any public  officer
shall take  charge or control of the  Trustee or of its  property or affairs for
the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Company may
remove the Trustee and appoint a  successor  trustee by written  instrument,  in
duplicate,  one copy of which  instrument  shall be  delivered to the Trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor  trustee.  In addition,  in the event that
the Company determines that the Trustee has failed (i) to distribute or cause to
be distributed to the  Certificateholders  any amount required to be distributed
hereunder, if such amount is held by the Trustee or its Paying Agent (other than
the Master  Servicer  or the  Company)  for  distribution  or (ii) to  otherwise
observe or perform in any material  respect any of its covenants,  agreements or
obligations  hereunder,  and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period
of 5 days (in respect of clause (i) above) or 30 days (in respect of clause (ii)
above) after the date on which written  notice of such failure,  requiring  that
the same be remedied,  shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company, then
the Company  may remove the  Trustee and appoint a successor  trustee by written
instrument  delivered as provided in the preceding sentence.  In connection with
the appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to the preceding  sentence,  the
Company  shall,  on or  before  the date on which any such  appointment  becomes
effective,  obtain  from  each  Rating  Agency  written  confirmation  that  the
appointment  of any such  successor  trustee will not result in the reduction of
the  ratings  on any  class of the  Certificates  below  the  lesser of the then
current or original ratings on such Certificates.

        (c) The Holders of  Certificates  entitled to at least 51% of the Voting
Rights may at any time remove the  Trustee  and  appoint a successor  trustee by
written  instrument or  instruments,  in  triplicate,  signed by such Holders or
their  attorneys-in-fact duly authorized,  one complete set of which instruments
shall be delivered  to the  Company,  one complete set to the Trustee so removed
and one complete set to the successor so appointed.

        (d) Any  resignation  or removal of the  Trustee  and  appointment  of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in
Section 8.08.

        Section 8.08  Successor Trustee.
                      -----------------

        (a) Any  successor  trustee  appointed as provided in Section 8.07 shall
execute,  acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor  trustee
an  instrument   accepting  such  appointment   hereunder,   and  thereupon  the
resignation  or removal of the  predecessor  trustee shall become  effective and
such  successor  trustee  shall become  effective  and such  successor  trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become fully vested with all
the rights,  powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor  hereunder,  with
the like  effect as if  originally  named as  trustee  herein.  The  predecessor
trustee shall deliver to the  successor  trustee all Mortgage  Files and related
documents and statements held by it hereunder  (other than any Mortgage Files at
the time held by a  Custodian,  which  shall  become the agent of any  successor
trustee  hereunder),  and the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the predecessor
trustee shall execute and deliver such  instruments  and do such other things as
may  reasonably be required for more fully and certainly  vesting and confirming
in the successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

        (b) No successor  trustee shall accept  appointment  as provided in this
Section unless at the time of such  acceptance  such successor  trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06.

        (c) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in
this Section,  the Company  shall mail notice of the  succession of such trustee
hereunder  to all Holders of  Certificates  at their  addresses  as shown in the
Certificate  Register.  If the Company  fails to mail such notice within 10 days
after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee,  the successor trustee
shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.

        Section 8.09  Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.
                      ----------------------------------

        Any corporation or national  banking  association into which the Trustee
may be  merged  or  converted  or  with  which  it may  be  consolidated  or any
corporation  or  national  banking   association   resulting  from  any  merger,
conversion  or  consolidation  to which  the  Trustee  shall be a party,  or any
corporation or national  banking  association  succeeding to the business of the
Trustee,  shall  be  the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,  provided  such
corporation  or  national  banking  association  shall  be  eligible  under  the
provisions of Section 8.06,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the  parties  hereto,  anything  herein to the
contrary  notwithstanding.  The Trustee  shall mail notice of any such merger or
consolidation  to the  Certificateholders  at  their  address  as  shown  in the
Certificate Register.

        Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

        (a)  Notwithstanding  any other provisions  hereof, at any time, for the
purpose of meeting any legal  requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee  acting  jointly shall have the power and shall
execute and deliver all  instruments to appoint one or more Persons  approved by
the Trustee to act as co-trustee or  co-trustees,  jointly with the Trustee,  or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and
to vest in such Person or  Persons,  in such  capacity,  such title to the Trust
Fund, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section


                                              90

<PAGE>



8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Master Servicer
and the Trustee may consider  necessary  or  desirable.  If the Master  Servicer
shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it
of a request so to do, or in case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.  No
co-trustee or separate trustee  hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06 hereunder and no notice to
Holders  of  Certificates  of  the  appointment  of  co-trustee(s)  or  separate
trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08 hereof.

        (b) In the case of any  appointment of a co-trustee or separate  trustee
pursuant  to this  Section  8.10 all  rights,  powers,  duties  and  obligations
conferred  or imposed  upon the Trustee  shall be  conferred or imposed upon and
exercised or performed by the Trustee,  and such separate  trustee or co-trustee
jointly,  except to the extent that under any law of any  jurisdiction  in which
any particular act or acts are to be performed  (whether as Trustee hereunder or
as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent
or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights,  powers,
duties and obligations  (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any
portion  thereof in any such  jurisdiction)  shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

        (c) Any notice,  request or other  writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as  effectively  as if given to each of them.  Every  instrument  appointing any
separate  trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee,  upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred,  shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately,
as may be provided  therein,  subject to all the  provisions of this  Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording  protection to, the Trustee.  Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.

        (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time,  constitute the
Trustee,  its agent or attorney-in-fact,  with full power and authority,  to the
extent not  prohibited  by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name.  If any separate  trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties,  rights,  remedies  and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee,  to the extent  permitted by law,  without the  appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

        Section 8.11  Appointment of Custodians.
                      -------------------------

        The  Trustee  may,  with the  consent  of the  Master  Servicer  and the
Company,  appoint one or more  Custodians who are not Affiliates of the Company,
the Master Servicer or any Seller to hold all or a portion of the Mortgage Files
as agent for the Trustee,  by entering  into a Custodial  Agreement.  Subject to
Article  VIII,  the Trustee  agrees to comply  with the terms of each  Custodial
Agreement and to enforce the terms and provisions  thereof against the Custodian
for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each Custodian shall be a depository
institution  subject to supervision by federal or state authority,  shall have a
combined  capital and surplus of at least  $15,000,000 and shall be qualified to
do  business  in the  jurisdiction  in which it holds any  Mortgage  File.  Each
Custodial  Agreement  may be amended  only as  provided  in Section  11.01.  The
Trustee shall notify the


                                              91

<PAGE>



Certificateholders of the appointment of any Custodian (other than the Custodian
appointed as of the Closing Date) pursuant to this Section 8.11.

        Section 8.12  Appointment of Office or Agency.
                      -------------------------------

        The Trustee will maintain an office or agency in the City of New York at
the  address  designated  in  Section  11.05  of  the  Series  Supplement  where
Certificates  may be surrendered for  registration of transfer or exchange.  The
Trustee will  maintain an office at the address  stated in Section  11.05 of the
Series Supplement where notices and demands to or upon the Trustee in respect of
this Agreement may be served.

               Certificates; Termination Upon Purchase by the Master Servicer or
               Liquidation of All Mortgage Loans.

        (a)  Subject  to  Section   9.02,   the   respective   obligations   and
responsibilities  of the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee  created
hereby in respect of the Certificates  (other than the obligation of the Trustee
to make certain payments after the Final Distribution Date to Certificateholders
and the  obligation of the Company to send certain  notices as  hereinafter  set
forth) shall  terminate upon the last action required to be taken by the Trustee
on the Final Distribution Date pursuant to this Article IX following the earlier
of:

                      (i) the later of the final  payment  or other  liquidation
               (or any Advance with respect  thereto) of the last  Mortgage Loan
               remaining  in the Trust Fund or the  disposition  of all property
               acquired upon  foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any
               Mortgage Loan, or

                      (ii) the  purchase by the Master  Servicer of all Mortgage
               Loans and all property  acquired in respect of any Mortgage  Loan
               remaining  in the  Trust  Fund  at a price  equal  to 100% of the
               unpaid  principal  balance of each Mortgage Loan or, if less than
               such  unpaid  principal  balance,  the fair  market  value of the
               related underlying property of such Mortgage Loan with respect to
               Mortgage  Loans as to which title has been  acquired if such fair
               market value is less than such unpaid  principal  balance (net of
               any unreimbursed  Advances  attributable to principal) on the day
               of repurchase plus accrued  interest  thereon at the Net Mortgage
               Rate (or Modified  Net Mortgage  Rate in the case of any Modified
               Mortgage Loan) to, but not including,  the first day of the month
               in which such repurchase price is distributed, provided, however,
               that in no event shall the trust created hereby  continue  beyond
               the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of
               the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy,  the late ambassador of the
               United  States  to the  Court of St.  James,  living  on the date
               hereof and provided  further  that the  purchase  price set forth
               above shall be increased as is  necessary,  as  determined by the
               Master Servicer, to avoid  disqualification of any portion of any
               REMIC formed under the Series Supplement as a REMIC.


                                              92

        The right of the Master Servicer to purchase all the assets of the Trust
Fund pursuant to clause (ii) above is conditioned upon the Pool Stated Principal
Balance  as  of  the  Final   Distribution  Date,  prior  to  giving  effect  to
distributions to be made on such Distribution  Date, being less than ten percent
of the Cut-off Date Principal  Balance of the Mortgage  Loans.  If such right is
exercised by the Master  Servicer,  the Master  Servicer shall be deemed to have
been  reimbursed for the full amount of any  unreimbursed  Advances  theretofore
made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans. In addition,  the Master Servicer
shall provide to the Trustee the certification  required by Section 3.15 and the
Trustee and any  Custodian  shall,  promptly  following  payment of the purchase
price,  release to the Master  Servicer the  Mortgage  Files  pertaining  to the
Mortgage Loans being purchased.

        In addition to the foregoing, on any Distribution Date on which the Pool
Stated Principal Balance,  prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on
such  Distribution  Date, is less than ten percent of the Cut-off Date Principal
Balance of the Mortgage  Loans,  Master  Servicer  shall have the right,  at its
option, to purchase the Certificates in whole, but not in part, at a price equal
to the outstanding  Certificate  Principal Balance of such Certificates plus the
sum of Accrued  Certificate  Interest  thereon for the related  Interest Accrual
Period and any previously  unpaid Accrued  Certificate  Interest.  If the Master
Servicer  exercises  this right to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates,  the
Master  Servicer  will  promptly   terminate  the  respective   obligations  and
responsibilities  created hereby in respect of the Certificates pursuant to this
Article IX.

        (b) The Master  Servicer  shall give the  Trustee not less than 60 days'
prior notice of the Distribution  Date on which the Master Servicer  anticipates
that the final  distribution  will be made to  Certificateholders  (whether as a
result of the  exercise  by the Master  Servicer  of its right to  purchase  the
assets  of the  Trust  Fund  or  otherwise)  or on  which  the  Master  Servicer
anticipates that the Certificates will be purchased (as a result of the exercise
by the Master Servicer to purchase the outstanding Certificates).  Notice of any
termination,  specifying the anticipated Final Distribution Date (which shall be
a  date  that  would   otherwise  be  a   Distribution   Date)  upon  which  the
Certificateholders  may  surrender  their  Certificates  to the  Trustee  (if so
required  by the  terms  hereof)  for  payment  of the  final  distribution  and
cancellation  or  notice  of  any  purchase  of  the  outstanding  Certificates,
specifying  the  Distribution  Date upon which the Holders may  surrender  their
Certificates  to the Trustee for payment,  shall be given promptly by the Master
Servicer (if it is exercising its right to purchase the assets of the Trust Fund
or to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates),  or by the Trustee (in any other
case) by letter to the  Certificateholders  mailed not earlier than the 15th day
and not later  than the 25th day of the month next  preceding  the month of such
final distribution specifying:

                      (i) the  anticipated  Final  Distribution  Date upon which
               final payment of the  Certificates is anticipated to be made upon
               presentation  and  surrender  of  Certificates  at the  office or
               agency of the Trustee therein  designated where required pursuant
               to this  Agreement  or, in the case of the purchase by the Master
               Servicer of the outstanding  Certificates,  the Distribution Date
               on which such purchase is to be made,

                      (ii) the amount of any such final payment,  or in the case
               of the  purchase of the  outstanding  Certificates,  the purchase
               price, in either case, if known, and


                                              93

<PAGE>




                      (iii) that the Record Date  otherwise  applicable  to such
               Distribution Date is not applicable, or in the case of the Senior
               Certificates,  or in the  case  of all  of  the  Certificates  in
               connection  with the exercise by the Master Servicer of its right
               to purchase the Certificates, that payment will be made only upon
               presentation  and surrender of the  Certificates at the office or
               agency of the Trustee therein specified.

        If the Master Servicer is obligated to give notice to Certificateholders
as aforesaid, it shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at the time
such  notice is given to  Certificateholders  and,  if the  Master  Servicer  is
exercising its rights to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates,  it shall give
such  notice  to each  Rating  Agency  at the  time  such  notice  is  given  to
Certificateholders.  As a result of the  exercise by the Master  Servicer of its
right to  purchase  the  assets of the Trust  Fund,  the Master  Servicer  shall
deposit  in the  Certificate  Account  before  the  Final  Distribution  Date in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the purchase price for the assets
of the Trust Fund,  computed as provided  above.  As a result of the exercise by
the Master Servicer of its right to purchase the outstanding  Certificates,  the
Master Servicer shall deposit in an Eligible Account,  established by the Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trustee and separate from the  Certificate  Account in
the name of the Trustee in trust for the registered holders of the Certificates,
before the  Distribution  Date on which such purchase is to occur in immediately
available  funds an amount  equal to the  purchase  price for the  Certificates,
computed as above  provided,  and provide notice of such deposit to the Trustee.
The Trustee will withdraw  from such account the amount  specified in subsection
(c) below.

        (c) In the  case  of the  Senior  Certificates,  upon  presentation  and
surrender of the Certificates by the Certificateholders thereof, and in the case
of the Class M and Class B Certificates,  upon presentation and surrender of the
Certificates by the  Certificateholders  thereof in connection with the exercise
by the Master Servicer of its right to purchase the  Certificates and otherwise,
in  accordance  with  Section  4.01(a),  the  Trustee  shall  distribute  to the
Certificateholders  (i) the amount otherwise  distributable on such Distribution
Date, if not in connection with the Master Servicer's election to repurchase the
assets of the Trust Fund or the outstanding Certificates,  or (ii) if the Master
Servicer  elected  to so  repurchase  the  assets  of  the  Trust  Fund  or  the
outstanding  Certificates,  an amount determined as follows: (A) with respect to
each Certificate the outstanding  Certificate  Principal  Balance thereof,  plus
Accrued Certificate Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period thereon and
any previously unpaid Accrued Certificate Interest,  subject to the priority set
forth in Section 4.02(a), and (B) with respect to the Class R Certificates,  any
excess of the amounts available for distribution (including the repurchase price
specified  in clause  (ii) of  subsection  (a) of this  Section)  over the total
amount distributed under the immediately preceding clause (A).  Nothwithstanding
the reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of any Class of Subordinate
Certificates  to zero,  such  Class  will be  outstanding  hereunder  until  the
termination of the respective  obligations and  responsibilities of the Company,
the Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder in accordance with Article IX.

        (d) If any Certificateholders shall not surrender their Certificates for
final payment and cancellation on or before the Final  Distribution  Date (if so
required by the terms hereof), the Trustee shall on such date cause all funds in
the   Certificate   Account   not   distributed   in   final   distribution   to
Certificateholders  to be  withdrawn  therefrom  and  credited to the  remaining
Certificateholders by depositing such funds in a separate escrow account for the
benefit of such Certificateholders, and


                                              94

<PAGE>



the Master  Servicer  (if it  exercised  its right to purchase the assets of the
Trust  Fund),  or the Trustee  (in any other  case) shall give a second  written
notice to the remaining  Certificateholders  to surrender their Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within
six  months  after  the  second  notice  any  Certificate  shall  not have  been
surrendered  for  cancellation,  the  Trustee  shall take  appropriate  steps as
directed  by the Master  Servicer to contact  the  remaining  Certificateholders
concerning   surrender  of  their  Certificates.   The  costs  and  expenses  of
maintaining  the escrow  account and of contacting  Certificateholders  shall be
paid out of the assets which remain in the escrow account. If within nine months
after the second notice any  Certificates  shall not have been  surrendered  for
cancellation,  the  Trustee  shall  pay  to  the  Master  Servicer  all  amounts
distributable  to the holders thereof and the Master  Servicer shall  thereafter
hold such amounts until distributed to such Holders. No interest shall accrue or
be payable to any  Certificateholder on any amount held in the escrow account or
by the  Master  Servicer  as a result  of such  Certificateholder's  failure  to
surrender its  Certificate(s)  for final payment thereof in accordance with this
Section 9.01.

        (e) If any  Certificateholders do not surrender their Certificates on or
before the Distribution Date on which a purchase of the outstanding Certificates
is to be made, the Trustee shall on such date cause all funds in the Certificate
Account  deposited therein by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 9.01(b) to
be  withdrawn  therefrom  and  deposited  in a separate  escrow  account for the
benefit of such Certificateholders,  and the Master Servicer shall give a second
written notice to such  Certificateholders  to surrender their  Certificates for
payment of the purchase  price  therefor.  If within six months after the second
notice any Certificate  shall not have been  surrendered for  cancellation,  the
Trustee  shall take  appropriate  steps as  directed  by the Master  Servicer to
contact  the  Holders  of  such  Certificates   concerning  surrender  of  their
Certificates.  The costs and expenses of  maintaining  the escrow account and of
contacting  Certificateholders  shall be paid out of the assets  which remain in
the  escrow  account.  If  within  nine  months  after  the  second  notice  any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation in accordance with
this  Section  9.01,  the Trustee  shall pay to the Master  Servicer all amounts
distributable  to the Holders thereof and the Master  Servicer shall  thereafter
hold such amounts until distributed to such Holders. No interest shall accrue or
be payable to any  Certificateholder on any amount held in the escrow account or
by the  Master  Servicer  as a result  of such  Certificateholder's  failure  to
surrender its  Certificate(s)  for payment in accordance with this Section 9.01.
Any  Certificate  that is not  surrendered on the  Distribution  Date on which a
purchase  pursuant to this Section 9.01 occurs as provided  above will be deemed
to have been  purchased  and the Holder as of such date will have no rights with
respect  thereto  except to receive the purchase  price therefor minus any costs
and expenses  associated with such escrow account and notices allocated thereto.
Any  Certificates  so  purchased  or  deemed  to  have  been  purchased  on such
Distribution Date shall remain  outstanding  hereunder until the Master Servicer
has terminated the respective obligations and responsibilities created hereby in
respect of the  Certificates  pursuant to this  Article IX. The Master  Servicer
shall be for all purposes the Holder thereof as of such date.

        Section 9.02  Additional Termination Requirements.
                      -----------------------------------

        (a) Each REMIC that  comprises  the Trust  Fund shall be  terminated  in
accordance  with the  following  additional  requirements,  unless  (subject  to
Section  10.01(f)) the Trustee and the Master  Servicer have received an Opinion
of Counsel  (which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee) to
the effect that the failure of each such REMIC to comply with the requirements


                                              95

<PAGE>



of this Section 9.02 will not (i) result in the imposition on the Trust of taxes
on "prohibited  transactions," as described in Section 860F of the Code, or (ii)
cause  any  such  REMIC  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  at any  time  that any
Certificate is outstanding:

                      (i)  The  Master   Servicer   shall   establish  a  90-day
               liquidation  period for each such REMIC and specify the first day
               of such period in a statement  attached to the Trust Fund's final
               Tax Return pursuant to Treasury regulations Section 1.860F-1. The
               Master  Servicer also shall satisfy all of the  requirements of a
               qualified  liquidation for a REMIC under Section 860F of the Code
               and regulations thereunder;

                      (ii) The Master  Servicer  shall notify the Trustee at the
               commencement of such 90-day  liquidation  period and, at or prior
               to the time of making of the final  payment on the  Certificates,
               the  Trustee  shall  sell  or  otherwise  dispose  of  all of the
               remaining  assets of the Trust Fund in accordance  with the terms
               hereof; and

                      (iii) If the Master  Servicer or the Company is exercising
               its right to purchase  the assets of the Trust  Fund,  the Master
               Servicer shall,  during the 90-day  liquidation  period and at or
               prior to the Final Distribution Date,  purchase all of the assets
               of the Trust Fund for cash.

        (b) Each  Holder of a  Certificate  and the Trustee  hereby  irrevocably
approves  and appoints the Master  Servicer as its  attorney-in-fact  to adopt a
plan of complete  liquidation for each REMIC at the expense of the Trust Fund in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

        Section 9.03 Termination of Multiple REMICs.

        If the REMIC  Administrator  makes two or more separate REMIC elections,
the  applicable   REMIC  shall  be  terminated  on  the  earlier  of  the  Final
Distribution  Date and the date on which it is deemed to receive the last deemed
distributions on the related Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests and the last
distribution due on the Certificates is made.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                REMIC PROVISIONS

        Section 10.01 REMIC Administration.

        (a) The REMIC  Administrator  shall make an  election to treat the Trust
Fund as one or more REMICs under the Code and, if  necessary,  under  applicable
state  law.  The  assets of each  such  REMIC  will be set  forth in the  Series
Supplement. Such election will be made on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal
tax or information  return (including Form 8811) or any appropriate state return
for the taxable  year ending on the last day of the  calendar  year in which the
Certificates  are issued.  For the purposes of each REMIC election in respect of
the Trust Fund,  Certificates  and  interests to be  designated  as the "regular
interests"  and the sole class of "residual  interests" in the REMIC will be set
forth in Section 10.03 of the Series Supplement. The REMIC Administrator and the
Trustee shall not permit the creation of any "interests"  (within the meaning of
Section 860G of


                                              96

<PAGE>



the Code) in any REMIC  elected  in  respect  of the Trust  Fund  other than the
"regular interests" and "residual interests" so designated.

        (b) The Closing Date is hereby  designated  as the "startup  day" of the
Trust Fund within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

        (c)  The  REMIC   Administrator   shall  hold  a  Class  R   Certificate
representing a 0.01% Percentage  Interest each Class of the Class R Certificates
and shall be designated  as "the tax matters  person" with respect to each REMIC
in the manner  provided  under  Treasury  regulations  section  1.860F-4(d)  and
Treasury regulations section 301.6231(a)(7)-1.  The REMIC Administrator,  as tax
matters  person,  shall (i) act on behalf of each REMIC in  relation  to any tax
matter or controversy involving the Trust Fund and (ii) represent the Trust Fund
in any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to an examination or audit
by any governmental  taxing authority with respect thereto.  The legal expenses,
including without  limitation  attorneys' or accountants' fees, and costs of any
such proceeding and any liability  resulting  therefrom shall be expenses of the
Trust  Fund and the  REMIC  Administrator  shall be  entitled  to  reimbursement
therefor out of amounts  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans on deposit in the
Custodial  Account as provided by Section  3.10 unless such legal  expenses  and
costs are incurred by reason of the REMIC  Administrator's  willful misfeasance,
bad faith or gross  negligence.  If the  REMIC  Administrator  is no longer  the
Master Servicer  hereunder,  at its option the REMIC  Administrator may continue
its duties as REMIC Administrator and shall be paid reasonable  compensation not
to exceed  $3,000 per year by any  successor  Master  Servicer  hereunder for so
acting as the REMIC Administrator.

        (d) The REMIC Administrator shall prepare or cause to be prepared all of
the Tax Returns  that it  determines  are  required  with  respect to each REMIC
created hereunder and deliver such Tax Returns in a timely manner to the Trustee
and the  Trustee  shall sign and file such Tax Returns in a timely  manner.  The
expenses of  preparing  such returns  shall be borne by the REMIC  Administrator
without any right of reimbursement  therefor.  The REMIC Administrator agrees to
indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Trustee  with respect to any tax or liability
arising  from the  Trustee's  signing  of Tax  Returns  that  contain  errors or
omissions.  The Trustee and Master  Servicer  shall  promptly  provide the REMIC
Administrator with such information as the REMIC  Administrator may from time to
time request for the purpose of enabling the REMIC  Administrator to prepare Tax
Returns.

        (e) The REMIC  Administrator  shall  provide (i) to any  Transferor of a
Class R Certificate  such information as is necessary for the application of any
tax relating to the transfer of a Class R Certificate to any Person who is not a
Permitted Transferee,  (ii) to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall forward to the
Certificateholders,  such  information or reports as are required by the Code or
the REMIC  Provisions  including  reports  relating to interest,  original issue
discount and market  discount or premium (using the Prepayment  Assumption)  and
(iii) to the Internal  Revenue  Service the name,  title,  address and telephone
number of the person who will serve as the representative of each REMIC.

        (f) The  Master  Servicer  and the REMIC  Administrator  shall take such
actions and shall cause each REMIC created hereunder to take such actions as are
reasonably within the Master Servicer's or the REMIC Administrator's control and
the scope of its duties more specifically set


                                              97

<PAGE>



forth  herein as shall be  necessary or desirable to maintain the status of each
REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC  Provisions  (and the Trustee  shall assist the
Master Servicer and the REMIC Administrator,  to the extent reasonably requested
by the  Master  Servicer  and the  REMIC  Administrator  to do so).  The  Master
Servicer and the REMIC  Administrator  shall not knowingly or intentionally take
any action,  cause the Trust Fund to take any action or fail to take (or fail to
cause to be taken) any action reasonably  within their respective  control that,
under the REMIC Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i)
endanger  the  status of any  portion  of any  REMIC  formed  under  the  Series
Supplement  as a REMIC or (ii) result in the  imposition  of a tax upon any such
REMIC  (including  but not  limited  to the tax on  prohibited  transactions  as
defined  in Section  860F(a)(2)  of the Code and the tax on  contributions  to a
REMIC set forth in  Section  860G(d) of the Code)  (either  such  event,  in the
absence of an Opinion of  Counsel  or the  indemnification  referred  to in this
sentence,  an "Adverse  REMIC  Event")  unless the Master  Servicer or the REMIC
Administrator, as applicable, has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense
of the party  seeking to take such  action  or, if such party  fails to pay such
expense,  and the Master  Servicer or the REMIC  Administrator,  as  applicable,
determines that taking such action is in the best interest of the Trust Fund and
the Certificateholders, at the expense of the Trust Fund, but in no event at the
expense of the Master Servicer,  the REMIC  Administrator or the Trustee) to the
effect that the contemplated action will not, with respect to each REMIC created
hereunder,  endanger  such  status or,  unless the  Master  Servicer,  the REMIC
Administrator or both, as applicable,  determine in its or their sole discretion
to indemnify the Trust Fund against the imposition of such a tax,  result in the
imposition of such a tax.  Wherever in this Agreement a contemplated  action may
not be taken because the timing of such action might result in the imposition of
a tax on the Trust Fund, or may only be taken  pursuant to an Opinion of Counsel
that such  action  would not  impose a tax on the Trust  Fund,  such  action may
nonetheless be taken provided that the indemnity given in the preceding sentence
with respect to any taxes that might be imposed on the Trust Fund has been given
and  that all  other  preconditions  to the  taking  of such  action  have  been
satisfied. The Trustee shall not take or fail to take any action (whether or not
authorized   hereunder)   as  to  which  the  Master   Servicer   or  the  REMIC
Administrator,  as applicable, has advised it in writing that it has received an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect  that an Adverse  REMIC  Event could occur with
respect to such action. In addition,  prior to taking any action with respect to
any REMIC created  hereunder or any related assets thereof,  or causing any such
REMIC to take any action,  which is not expressly  permitted  under the terms of
this  Agreement,  the Trustee will consult with the Master Servicer or the REMIC
Administrator,  as  applicable,  or its  designee,  in writing,  with respect to
whether such action could cause an Adverse  REMIC Event to occur with respect to
any such REMIC, and the Trustee shall not take any such action or cause any such
REMIC to take any such  action  as to which  the  Master  Servicer  or the REMIC
Administrator,  as  applicable,  has advised it in writing that an Adverse REMIC
Event  could  occur.  The  Master  Servicer  or  the  REMIC  Administrator,   as
applicable,  may consult with counsel to make such written advice,  and the cost
of same shall be borne by the party  seeking  to take the  action not  expressly
permitted  by this  Agreement,  but in no event  at the  expense  of the  Master
Servicer  or the REMIC  Administrator.  At all times as may be  required  by the
Code, the Master Servicer will to the extent within its control and the scope of
its duties more specifically set forth herein, maintain substantially all of the
assets of each REMIC created  hereunder as  "qualified  mortgages" as defined in
Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code and "permitted investments" as defined in Section
860G(a)(5) of the Code.

        (g) In the event that any tax is imposed on "prohibited transactions" of
any REMIC  created  hereunder as defined in Section  860F(a)(2)  of the Code, on
"net income from  foreclosure  property" of any such REMIC as defined in Section
860G(c) of the Code,  on any  contributions  to any such REMIC after the Startup

Provisions or other  applicable  provisions  of federal,  state and local law or
ordinances.

(b)  unless  the  Master  Servicer  has  determined  in its sole  discretion  to
indemnify  the Trust Fund against such tax,  cause such REMIC to be subject to a
tax on  "prohibited  transactions"  or  "contributions"  pursuant  to the  REMIC
Provisions.

               qualification  of the Trust Fund as a REMIC at all times that any
               Certificate  is  outstanding  or to avoid or minimize the risk of
               the  imposition of any tax on the Trust Fund pursuant to the Code
               that would be a claim  against the Trust Fund,  provided that the
               Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A)
               such  action  is  necessary   or   desirable  to  maintain   such
               qualification  or to avoid or minimize the risk of the imposition
               of any such tax and (B) such action will not adversely  affect in

               not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel,  adversely  affect in
               any material respect the interests of any  Certificateholder  and
               (C) such  change  shall not result in a  reduction  of the rating
               assigned  to any  Class of  Certificates  below  the lower of the
               then-current  rating or the rating assigned to such  Certificates
               as of the Closing Date, as evidenced by a letter from each Rating
               Agency to such effect,

                      (v) to  modify,  eliminate  or add  to the  provisions  of
               Section  5.02(f)  or  any  other  provision  hereof   restricting
               transfer  of the Class R  Certificates,  by virtue of their being
               the  "residual  interests"  in a  REMIC,  provided  that (A) such
               change shall not result in  reduction  of the rating  assigned to

               Agency to such effect,  and (B) such change shall not (subject to
               Section 10.01(f)),  as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (at the
               expense of the party seeking so to modify,  eliminate or add such
               provisions),  cause any  REMIC  created  hereunder  or any of the
               Certificateholders (other than the transferor) to be subject to a
               federal  tax  caused  by a  transfer  to a  Person  that is not a
               Permitted Transferee,


                                             101

                      (vi) to make any other  provisions with respect to matters
               or  questions  arising  under this  Agreement  or such  Custodial
               Agreement  which shall not be  materially  inconsistent  with the
               provisions  of this  Agreement,  provided  that such action shall
               not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel,  adversely  affect in
               any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder, or

                    (vii) to amend any  provision  herein or therein that is not
               material to any of the Certificateholders.

        (b) This  Agreement or any Custodial  Agreement may also be amended from
time to time by the  Company,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the
consent of the Holders of Certificates evidencing in the aggregate not less than
66% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates with a Certificate
Principal  Balance greater than zero affected  thereby for the purpose of adding
any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
of this Agreement or such Custodial  Agreement or of modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of Certificates of such Class; provided,  however, that no
such amendment shall:

                      (i)  reduce  in any  manner  the  amount  of, or delay the
               timing of,  payments  which are required to be distributed on any
               Certificate   without   the   consent   of  the  Holder  of  such
               Certificate,

                      (ii) reduce the aforesaid  percentage of  Certificates  of
               any Class the  Holders  of which are  required  to consent to any
               such  amendment,  in any such case  without  the  consent  of the

        (c)  Notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  of this  Agreement,  the
Trustee  shall not consent to any  amendment to this  Agreement  unless it shall
have first  received an Opinion of Counsel  (subject to Section  10.01(f) and at
the  expense  of the party  seeking  such  amendment)  to the  effect  that such
amendment  or the  exercise  of any power  granted to the Master  Servicer,  the
Company or the Trustee in accordance  with such amendment will not result in the
imposition  of a federal tax on the Trust Fund or cause any REMIC  created under
the  Series  Supplement  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  at any  time  that any
Certificate is outstanding.

        (d) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee shall
furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment to the Custodian
and each  Certificateholder.  It  shall  not be  necessary  for the  consent  of
Certificateholders  under this Section 11.01 to approve the  particular  form of
any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance  thereof.  The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing
the  authorization  of the  execution  thereof  by  Certificateholders  shall be
subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

        (e) The Company shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to obtain
and  deliver  to  the  Trustee  any  corporate  guaranty,   payment  obligation,
irrevocable  letter  of  credit,   surety  bond,  insurance  policy  or  similar
instrument or a reserve  fund,  or any  combination  of the  foregoing,  for the
purpose of protecting the Holders of the Class B Certificates against any or all
Realized Losses or


                                             102

other  shortfalls.  Any such instrument or fund shall be held by the Trustee for
the benefit of the Class B Certificateholders, but shall not be and shall not be
deemed to be under any  circumstances  included in the Trust Fund. To the extent
that any such  instrument or fund  constitutes a reserve fund for federal income
tax purposes,  (i) any reserve fund so established  shall be an outside  reserve
fund and not an asset of the Trust  Fund,  (ii) any such  reserve  fund shall be
owned by the Company,  and (iii)  amounts  transferred  by the Trust Fund to any
such reserve fund shall be treated as amounts  distributed  by the Trust Fund to
the Company or any  successor,  all within the  meaning of Treasury  Regulations
Section  1.860G-2(h) as it reads as of the Cut-off Date. In connection  with the
provision of any such  instrument  or fund,  this  Agreement  and any  provision
hereof may be modified,  added to,  deleted or  otherwise  amended in any manner
that is related or incidental to such instrument or fund or the establishment or
administration thereof, such amendment to be made by written instrument executed
or consented to by the Company but without the consent of any  Certificateholder
and  without the consent of the Master  Servicer or the Trustee  being  required
unless  any such  amendment  would  impose  any  additional  obligation  on,  or
otherwise adversely affect the interests of the Senior  Certificateholders,  the
Class M  Certificateholders,  the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable;
provided that the Company  obtains  (subject to Section  10.01(f)) an Opinion of
Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent counsel) to the effect that
any such amendment will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust
Fund,  including  without  limitation,  any federal  tax imposed on  "prohibited
transactions"  under Section  860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions  after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code and (b) any REMIC created
hereunder  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC at any time that any  Certificate  is
outstanding.  In the event that the Company  elects to provide such  coverage in
the  form  of  a  limited  guaranty   provided  by  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation,  the  Company  may elect  that the text of such  amendment  to this
Agreement  shall be  substantially  in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (in
which case  Residential  Funding's  Subordinate  Certificate  Loss Obligation as
described in such exhibit shall be established by Residential  Funding's consent
to such  amendment) and that the limited  guaranty shall be executed in the form
attached  hereto as Exhibit K, with such changes as the Company shall deem to be
appropriate;  it being understood that the Trustee has reviewed and approved the
content of such forms and that the  Trustee's  consent  or  approval  to the use
thereof is not required.

                      --------------------------------------

        (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is subject

properties  subject to the Mortgages are situated,  and in any other appropriate
public  recording  office or elsewhere,  such  recordation to be effected by the
Master Servicer and at its expense on direction by the Trustee  (pursuant to the
request  of  Holders  of  Certificates  entitled  to at least 25% of the  Voting
Rights),  but only upon  direction  accompanied  by an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such recordation  materially and beneficially  affects the interests
of the Certificateholders.

        (b) For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this Agreement as
herein  provided  and  for  other  purposes,  this  Agreement  may  be  executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts,  each of which  counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original,  and such counterparts shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.

                                       SERIES ________

               evidencing a percentage  interest in the distributions  allocable
               To the Class  [A-___]  certificates  with respect to a trust fund
               Consisting   primarily  of  a  pool  of   conventional   one-  to
               Four-family  fixed  interest rate first mortgage loans formed and
               sold by RESIDENTIAL FUNDING MORTGAGE SECURITIES I, INC.

        This  Certificate  is payable  solely from the assets of the Trust Fund,
and does not  represent  an  obligation  of or interest in  Residential  Funding
Mortgage Securities I, Inc., the Master Servicer,  the Trustee referred to below
or  GMAC  Mortgage  Group,  Inc.  or  any  of  their  affiliates.  Neither  this
certificate  nor the underlying  mortgage loans are guaranteed or insured by any
governmental  agency  or  instrumentality  or by  residential  funding  mortgage

A-v]  certificates],  both as specified  above)] in certain  distributions  with
respect to the trust  fund  consisting  primarily  of an  interest  in a pool of
conventional  one- to four-family  fixed interest rate first mortgage loans (the
"mortgage loans"), formed and sold by residential funding mortgage securities I,
inc. (Hereinafter called the "company," which term includes any successor entity
under the agreement referred to below). The trust fund was created pursuant to a
series  supplement,  dated as specified  above, to the standard terms of pooling
and servicing agreement dated as of ________________ (together, the "pooling and
servicing  agreement" or the "agreement") among the company, the master servicer
and  _______________,  as trustee (the  "trustee"),  a summary of certain of the
pertinent provisions of which is set forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined
herein,  the  capitalized  terms used herein have the  meanings  assigned in the
agreement.  This  certificate  is issued  under  and is  subject  to the  terms,
provisions  and conditions of the  agreement,  to which  agreement the holder of
this  certificate by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by which such
holder is bound.

        Pursuant to the terms of the agreement,  a distribution  will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  business  day,  the
business day  immediately  following (the  "distribution  date"),  commencing as
described  in the  agreement,  to the person in whose name this  certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a business  day, the business day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "record date"),
from the available  distribution amount in an amount equal to the product of the
percentage  interest  evidenced by this certificate and the amount [(of interest
and  principal,  if any)]  required  to be  distributed  to  holders of Class A-
certificates on such distribution date. [the [interest  only/Class A-v] notional
amount  of  the  [interest  only/Class  A-v]  certificates  as of  any  date  of
determination is equal to the aggregate stated principal balance of the mortgage
loans corresponding to the uncertificated remic regular interests represented by
such [interest only/Class A-v] certificates.]

        Distributions  on this  certificate  will be made  either by the  master
servicer  acting on behalf of the trustee or by a paying agent  appointed by the
trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the person entitled thereto if such person shall have so notified the
master  servicer or such paying agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
certificate register.

        Notwithstanding  the above,  the final  distribution on this certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the trustee for that purpose in the city and state of New York.  The [initial
certificate  principal  balance]  [initial  [interest  only/Class  A-v] notional
amount] of this  certificate  is set forth  above.] [the  certificate  principal
balance  hereof  will be  reduced to the extent of  distributions  allocable  to
principal and any realized losses allocable hereto.]

        This  certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue  of  certificates
issued in several classes  designated as mortgage  pass-through  certificates of
the series specified hereon (herein collectively called the "certificates").

        The certificates are limited in right of payment to certain  collections
and recoveries respecting the mortgage loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the agreement. In the



<PAGE>



event master servicer funds are advanced with respect to any mortgage loan, such
advance is  reimbursable to the master  servicer,  to the extent provided in the
agreement, from related recoveries on such mortgage loan or from other cash that
would have been distributable to certificateholders.

        As provided in the  agreement,  withdrawals  from the custodial  account
and/or the certificate account created for the benefit of certificateholders may
be made by the  master  servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the company  and the master  servicer  of  advances  made,  or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

        The agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions  therein provided,  the
amendment of the agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  company,  the  master  servicer  and  the  trustee  and the  rights  of the
certificateholders  under the  agreement at any time by the company,  the master
servicer  and the  trustee  with the  consent  of the  holders  of  certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  percentage  interests of
each class of certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the holder of
this  certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  certificate  and of any  certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  certificate.  The  agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of
any of the certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the holders of certain  classes of  certificates.  As provided in the
agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth, the transfer of
this  certificate is registrable in the  certificate  register upon surrender of
this  certificate  for  registration  of  transfer  at the  offices or  agencies
appointed by the trustee in the city and state of New York, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied  by an assignment  in the form below or other written  instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee and the certificate  registrar duly
executed by the holder  hereof or such  holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in
writing, and thereupon one or more new certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing  the same class and aggregate  percentage  interest will be issued to
the designated transferee or transferees.

        The  certificates are issuable only as registered  certificates  without
coupons in classes and in denominations  specified in the agreement. As provided
in  the  agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
certificates are  exchangeable for new certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate percentage interest, as requested by the
holder surrendering the same.

        No service charge will be made for any such  registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        The  company,  the master  servicer,  the  trustee  and the  certificate
registrar and any agent of the company, the master servicer,  the trustee or the
certificate  registrar  may treat the person in whose name this  certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the company,  the
master  servicer,  the trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.




<PAGE>



        This  certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the state of New York.

        The obligations  created by the agreement in respect of the certificates
and the  trust  fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last mortgage loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any mortgage  loan and (ii) the purchase by the master  servicer
from the trust fund of all remaining mortgage loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  mortgage  loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
certificates.  The agreement permits,  but does not require, the master servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the agreement all remaining
mortgage loans and all property acquired in respect of any mortgage loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  certificates  from the holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the pool stated
principal  balance of the mortgage loans as of the distribution  date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the cut-off date principal balance of the mortgage loans.

        Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions of this  certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

        Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
certificate  registrar,  by  manual  signature,  this  certificate  shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Servicing  Agreement dated as of  ________________  (together,  the "Pooling and
Servicing  Agreement" or the "Agreement") among the Company, the Master Servicer
and  ___________,  as  trustee  (the  "Trustee"),  a summary  of  certain of the
pertinent provisions of which is set forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined
herein,  the  capitalized  terms used herein have the  meanings  assigned in the
Agreement.  This  Certificate  is issued  under  and is  subject  to the  terms,
provisions  and conditions of the  Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of
this  Certificate by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

        Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution  will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount (of interest
and  principal,  if any)  required to be  distributed  to Holders of Class M-___
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

        Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the  Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the

Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the

        Notwithstanding  the above,  the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial

Certificate  Principal  Balance  hereof  will be  reduced  to the  extent of the
distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable hereto.

interest herein) that either (A) such transferee is not a Plan Investor,  (B) it
has acquired and is holding this  Certificate  in reliance on the RFC  Exemption
and that it understands that there are certain conditions to the availability of

or Moody's or (C) the transferee is a Complying  Insurance Company. In addition,
any purported Certificate Owner whose acquisition or holding of this Certificate
(or interest  herein) was effected in violation of the  restrictions  in Section
5.02(e) of the Agreement  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  the
Trustee,  the  Master  Servicer,  any  Subservicer,  and the Trust Fund from and
against any and all  liabilities,  claims,  costs or  expenses  incurred by such
parties as a result of such acquisition or holding.

        This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue  of  Certificates
issued in several Classes  designated as Mortgage  Pass-Through  Certificates of
the Series specified hereon (herein collectively called the "Certificates").



<PAGE>



        The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain  collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

        As provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the Company  and the Master  Servicer  of  advances  made,  or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

        The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions  therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Company,  the  Master  Servicer  and  the  Trustee  and the  rights  of the
Certificateholders  under the  Agreement at any time by the Company,  the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

        As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

        The  Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

        No service charge will be made for any such  registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        The  Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the



<PAGE>



Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected
by notice to the contrary.

        This  Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

        The obligations  created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

        Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Certificate  Registrar,  by  manual  signature,  this  Certificate  shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Mortgage Securities I, Inc., the Master Servicer,  the Trustee referred to below

Terms of Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of ________________ (together,
the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement" or the "Agreement") among the Company, the

certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the
extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings
assigned in the  Agreement.  This  Certificate is issued under and is subject to
the terms,  provisions and conditions of the Agreement,  to which  Agreement the
Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by
which such Holder is bound.

        Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, a distribution will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing on
the first  Distribution  Date specified  above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate  is  registered at the close of business on the last day (or if such
last day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately preceding such last
day) of the month next  preceding  the month of such  distribution  (the "Record
Date"), from the Available Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product
of the  Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  and the amount (of
interest and principal, if any) required to be distributed to Holders of Class B
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

        Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the  Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

        Notwithstanding  the above,  the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of this  Certificate  is set forth  above.  The
Certificate  Principal  Balance  hereof  will be  reduced  to the  extent of the
distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable hereto.

        No  transfer  of this  Class B  Certificate  will  be made  unless  such
transfer is exempt from the  registration  requirements of the Securities Act of
1933,  as  amended,  and  any  applicable  state  securities  laws or is made in
accordance  with said Act and laws.  In the event that such a transfer  is to be
made,  (i) the  Trustee  or the  Company  may  require  an  opinion  of  counsel
acceptable  to and in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the  Trustee and the
Company that such transfer is exempt  (describing  the applicable  exemption and
the  basis  therefor)  from  or is  being  made  pursuant  to  the  registration
requirements  of the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended,  and of any applicable
statute of any state and (ii) the transferee shall execute an investment  letter
in the form  described by Section  5.02(e) of the  Agreement.  The Holder hereof
desiring to effect such transfer shall,  and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee, the Company,  the Master Servicer and the Certificate  Registrar acting
on behalf of the Trustee  against any liability  that may result if the transfer
is not so exempt or is not made in accordance  with such Federal and state laws.
In connection  with any such transfer,  the Trustee will also require either (i)
an opinion of counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory  to
the  Trustee,   the  Company  and  the  Master  Servicer  with  respect  to  the
permissibility  of such transfer under the Employee  Retirement  Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended



<PAGE>



("ERISA"),  and  Section  4975 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code (the  "Code") and
stating,  among other things,  that the  transferee's  acquisition  of a Class B
Certificate will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) a  representation
letter,  in the form as  described  by the  Agreement,  either  stating that the
transferee  is not an employee  benefit or other plan subject to the  prohibited
transaction  provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a "Plan"),  or any
other person (including an investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee of
any Plan)  acting,  directly  or  indirectly,  on behalf  of or  purchasing  any
Certificate with "plan assets" of any Plan, or stating that the transferee is an
insurance  company,  the  source  of  funds  to be  used by it to  purchase  the
Certificate is an "insurance  company  general  account"  (within the meaning of
Department of Labor Prohibited  Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 95-60), and
the purchase is being made in reliance  upon the  availability  of the exemptive
relief afforded under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60.

        This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue  of  Certificates
issued in several Classes  designated as Mortgage  Pass-Through  Certificates of
the Series specified hereon (herein collectively called the "Certificates").

        The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain  collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

        As provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the Company  and the Master  Servicer  of  advances  made,  or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

        The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions  therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Company,  the  Master  Servicer  and  the  Trustee  and the  rights  of the
Certificateholders  under the  Agreement at any time by the Company,  the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

        As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar duly executed



<PAGE>



by the Holder hereof or such Holder's  attorney duly authorized in writing,  and
thereupon one or more new  Certificates of authorized  denominations  evidencing
the  same  Class  and  aggregate  Percentage  Interest  will  be  issued  to the
designated transferee or transferees.

        The  Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

        No service charge will be made for any such  registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        The  Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

        This  Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

        The obligations  created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

        Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Certificate  Registrar,  by  manual  signature,  this  Certificate  shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

               evidencing a percentage  interest in any distributions  allocable
               to the Class R[-__]  Certificates  with respect to the Trust Fund

               four-family  fixed  interest rate first mortgage loans formed and
               sold by RESIDENTIAL FUNDING MORTGAGE SECURITIES I, INC.

        This  Certificate  is payable  solely from the assets of the Trust Fund,
and does not  represent  an  obligation  of or interest in  Residential  Funding
Mortgage Securities I, Inc., the Master Servicer,  the Trustee referred to below

Terms of Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of ________________ (together,
the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement" or the "Agreement") among the Company, the
Master  Servicer  and  ___________,  as trustee  (the  "Trustee"),  a summary of
certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the
extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings
assigned in the  Agreement.  This  Certificate is issued under and is subject to
the terms,  provisions and conditions of the Agreement,  to which  Agreement the
Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by
which such Holder is bound.

        Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution  will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount (of interest
and  principal,  if any)  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of  Class R
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

        Each  Holder of this  Certificate  will be  deemed to have  agreed to be
bound by the restrictions set forth in the Agreement to the effect that (i) each
person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate must be a
United  States  Person and a  Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) the  transfer  of any
Ownership  Interest in this Certificate will be conditioned upon the delivery to
the Trustee of,  among other  things,  an  affidavit  to the effect that it is a
United States Person and Permitted Transferee,  (iii) any attempted or purported
transfer of any  Ownership  Interest in this  Certificate  in  violation of such
restrictions  will be  absolutely  null and void and will  vest no rights in the
purported  transferee,  and (iv) if any person other than a United States Person
and a Permitted  Transferee  acquires any Ownership Interest in this Certificate
in violation of such restrictions,  then the Company will have the right, in its
sole  discretion and without notice to the Holder of this  Certificate,  to sell
this Certificate to a purchaser selected by the Company,  which purchaser may be
the Company,  or any affiliate of the Company,  on such terms and  conditions as
the Company may choose.

        Notwithstanding  the above,  the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of this  Certificate  is set forth  above.  The
Certificate   Principal  Balance  hereof  will  be  reduced  to  the  extent  of
distributions  allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable  hereto.
Notwithstanding  the reduction of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof to
zero,  this  Certificate  will remain  outstanding  under the  Agreement and the
Holder hereof may have additional  obligations with respect to this Certificate,
including  tax   liabilities,   and  may  be  entitled  to  certain   additional
distributions  hereon,  in  accordance  with the  terms  and  provisions  of the
Agreement.

        No transfer  of this Class  R[-__]  Certificate  will be made unless the
Trustee has received either (i) an opinion of counsel  acceptable to and in form
and substance  satisfactory to the Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer
with respect to the permissibility of such transfer under the



<PAGE>



Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974,  as amended  ("ERISA"),  and
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and stating,  among other
things,  that the  transferee's  acquisition  of a Class R Certificate  will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) a representation  letter,  in the form
as described by the  Agreement,  stating that the  transferee is not an employee
benefit or other plan subject to the prohibited  transaction provisions of ERISA
or  Section  4975 of the Code (a  "Plan"),  or any other  person  (including  an
investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee of any Plan) acting, directly
or indirectly,  on behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with "plan assets" of
any Plan.

        This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue  of  Certificates
issued in several Classes  designated as Mortgage  Pass-Through  Certificates of
the Series specified hereon (herein collectively called the "Certificates").

        The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain  collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

        As provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the Company  and the Master  Servicer  of  advances  made,  or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

        The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions  therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Company,  the  Master  Servicer  and  the  Trustee  and the  rights  of the
Certificateholders  under the  Agreement at any time by the Company,  the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

        As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.



<PAGE>



        The  Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

        No service charge will be made for any such  registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        The  Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

        This  Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

        The obligations  created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

        Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions of this  Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof,  which further provisions shall for all purpose
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

        Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Certificate  Registrar,  by  manual  signature,  this  Certificate  shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

               (1)    Each party is duly  organized,  validly  existing,  and in
                      good  standing  under  the  laws  of its  jurisdiction  of
                      organization,  is qualified,  if necessary, to do business
                      and in good standing in each  jurisdiction  in which it is
                      required to be so qualified,  and has the requisite  power
                      and  authority  to enter into this  Contract and all other
                      agreements  which are contemplated by this Contract and to
                      carry out its  obligations  hereunder and under the Guides
                      and under such other agreements.

               (2)    This  Contract  has been  duly  authorized,  executed  and
                      delivered  by each  party  and  constitutes  a  valid  and
                      legally  binding  agreement of each party  enforceable  in
                      accordance with its terms.

               (3)    There is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or
                      threatened,  and no basis  therefor  is  known  to  either

                      validity of this Contract.

               (4)    Insofar as its capacity to carry out any obligation  under
                      this Contract is concerned,  neither party is in violation
                      of  any  charter,   articles  of  incorporation,   bylaws,

                           FORM OF TRANSFER AFFIDAVIT AND AGREEMENT

STATE OF              )
                      ) ss.:
COUNTY OF             )

                 [NAME OF OFFICER], being first duly sworn, deposes and says:

        1.  That he is  [Title  of  Officer]  of  [Name  of  Owner]  (record  or
beneficial  owner of the Mortgage  Pass-Through  Certificates,  Series  _______,
Class  R[-__]  (the  "Owner")),  a  [savings  institution]   [corporation]  duly
organized and existing under the laws of [the State of ] [the United States], on
behalf of which he makes this affidavit and agreement.

        2.  That  the  Owner  (i)  is  not  and  will  not  be  a  "disqualified
organization"  or an electing large  partnership as of [date of transfer] within
the  meaning of  Sections  860E(e)(5)  and 775,  respectively,  of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or an electing  large  partnership
under  Section  775(a) of the Code,  (ii) will  endeavor to remain  other than a
disqualified  organization  for so long as it retains its ownership  interest in
the  Class  R[-__]  Certificates,  and  (iii)  is  acquiring  the  Class  R[-__]
Certificates  for its own account or for the account of another Owner from which
it has received an affidavit  and  agreement in  substantially  the same form as
this affidavit and agreement.  (For this purpose, a "disqualified  organization"
means an electing  large  partnership  under Section 775 of the Code, the United
States,   any  state  or   political   subdivision   thereof,   any   agency  or
instrumentality  of any of the foregoing (other than an  instrumentality  all of
the activities of which are subject to tax and, except for the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation,  a majority of whose board of directors is not selected by
any  such  governmental   entity)  or  any  foreign  government,   international
organization  or any agency or  instrumentality  of such foreign  government  or
organization,  any rural electric or telephone cooperative,  or any organization
(other than certain farmers' cooperatives) that is generally exempt from federal
income tax unless such organization is subject to the tax on unrelated  business
taxable income).

        3.  That the  Owner is aware  (i) of the tax that  would be  imposed  on
transfers of Class R[-__] Certificates to disqualified organizations or electing
large  partnerships,  under the Code,  that  applies to all  transfers  of Class
R[-__]  Certificates  after March 31,  1988;  (ii) that such tax would be on the
transferor  (or, with respect to transfers to electing  large  partnerships,  on
each such  partnership),  or, if such transfer is through an agent (which person
includes a broker, nominee or middleman) for a disqualified organization, on the
agent;  (iii) that the person  (other than with respect to transfers to electing
large partnerships)  otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability
for the tax if the  transferee  furnishes to such person an  affidavit  that the
transferee is not a disqualified organization and, at the time of transfer, such
person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false; and (iv) that
the Class R[-__] Certificates may be "noneconomic residual interests" within the
meaning of Treasury  regulations  promulgated  pursuant to the Code and that the
transferor of a noneconomic  residual  interest will remain liable for any taxes
due with respect to the income on such residual interest,  unless no significant
purpose of the transfer was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.



<PAGE>




        4. That the Owner is aware of the tax imposed on a "pass-through entity"
holding  Class  R[-__]  Certificates  if either  the  pass-through  entity is an
electing  large  partnership  under  Section  775 of the  Code or if at any time
during the taxable year of the pass-through  entity a disqualified  organization
is the record holder of an interest in such entity.  (For this purpose,  a "pass
through  entity"  includes  a  regulated   investment  company,  a  real  estate
investment  trust or common  trust fund,  a  partnership,  trust or estate,  and
certain cooperatives.)

        5. The Owner is either (i) a citizen or resident  of the United  States,
(ii) a  corporation,  partnership  or other entity treated as a corporation or a
partnership for U.S.  federal income tax purposes and created or organized in or
under the laws of the  United  States,  any state  thereof  or the  District  of
Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States person
under any applicable Treasury regulations), (iii) an estate that is described in
Section 7701(a)(30)(D) of the Code, or (iv) a trust that is described in Section
7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code.

        6. The Owner hereby  agrees that it will not cause income from the Class
R[-__]  Certificates to be attributable to a foreign permanent  establishment or
fixed base (within the meaning of an applicable  income tax treaty) of the Owner
of another United States taxpayer.

        7.  That the  Owner is aware  that the  Trustee  will not  register  the
transfer  of any  Class  R[- __]  Certificates  unless  the  transferee,  or the
transferee's  agent,  delivers to it an  affidavit  and  agreement,  among other
things,  in  substantially  the same form as this affidavit and  agreement.  The
Owner expressly agrees that it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows
or believes  that any of the  representations  contained in such  affidavit  and
agreement are false.

        8. That the Owner has reviewed the restrictions set forth on the face of
the Class  R[-__]  Certificates  and the  provisions  of Section  5.02(f) of the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement under which the Class R[-__]  Certificates were
issued (in  particular,  clause  (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) of Section  5.02(f) which
authorize  the Trustee to deliver  payments to a person other than the Owner and
negotiate  a  mandatory  sale by the  Trustee in the event the Owner  holds such
Certificates in violation of Section 5.02(f)).  The Owner expressly agrees to be
bound by and to comply with such restrictions and provisions.

        9.  That  the  Owner   consents  to  any  additional   restrictions   or
arrangements that shall be deemed necessary upon advice of counsel to constitute
a reasonable  arrangement to ensure that the Class R[-__] Certificates will only
be  owned,  directly  or  indirectly,  by an  Owner  that is not a  disqualified
organization.

        10.    The Owner's Taxpayer Identification Number is ________________.

        11.  This  affidavit  and  agreement  relates  only to the Class  R[-__]
Certificates  held by the Owner and not to any other  holder of the Class R[-__]
Certificates. The Owner understands that the liabilities described herein relate
only to the Class R[-__] Certificates.

     12.  That no purpose of the Owner  relating  to the  transfer of any of the
Class R[-__] Certificates by the Owner is or will be to impede the assessment or
collection of any tax; in making



<PAGE>



this  representation,  the Owner  warrants  that the Owner is familiar  with (i)
Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c) and recent amendments thereto, effective
as of July 19,  2002,  and (ii) the  preamble  describing  the  adoption  of the
amendments to such regulation, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

        13. That the Owner has no present  knowledge or expectation that it will
be  unable  to pay  any  United  States  taxes  owed by it so long as any of the
Certificates remain outstanding.  In this regard, the Owner hereby represents to
and for the  benefit  of the  person  from whom it  acquired  the  Class  R[-__]
Certificate  that the Owner  intends to pay taxes  associated  with holding such
Class R[- __]  Certificate as they become due, fully  understanding  that it may
incur tax  liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the Class R[-__]
Certificate.

        14. That the Owner has no present  knowledge or expectation that it will
become insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding for so long as any of the
Class R[-__] Certificates remain outstanding.

        15. (a) The  Purchaser  is not an  employee  benefit  plan or other plan
subject to the  prohibited  transaction  provisions  of the Employee  Retirement
Income  Security  Act of 1974,  as amended  ("ERISA"),  or  Section  4975 of the
Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code"),  or an  investment
manager,  named  fiduciary  or a trustee of any such plan,  or any other  Person
acting, directly or indirectly,  on behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with
"plan assets" of any such plan; or

               (b) The Purchaser  will provide the Trustee,  the Company and the
Master  Servicer  with an  opinion  of  counsel  acceptable  to and in form  and
substance  satisfactory  to the Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer to
the effect that the purchase of  Certificates  is permissible  under  applicable
law, will not  constitute  or result in any  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction
under ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code and will not subject the  Trustee,  the
Company  or the  Master  Servicer  to any  obligation  or  liability  (including
obligations or liabilities  under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in addition
to those undertaken in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

        In addition, the Purchaser hereby certifies, represents and warrants to,
and covenants  with, the Company,  the Trustee and the Master  Servicer that the
Purchaser  will not  transfer  such  Certificates  to any Plan or person  unless
either such Plan or person meets the requirements set forth in either (a) or (b)
above.

        Capitalized  terms used but not defined  herein  shall have the meanings
assigned in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

Background

   This document contains final regulations regarding the proposed amendments to
26 CFR part 1 under  section  860E of the  Internal  Revenue  Code  (Code).  The
regulations  provide the circumstances under which a transferor of a noneconomic
REMIC  residual   interest   meeting  the   investigation   and   representation
requirements  may avail  itself  of the safe  harbor by  satisfying  either  the
formula test or the asset test.
   Final regulations  governing REMICs,  issued in 1992, contain rules governing
the transfer of noneconomic REMIC residual interests.  In general, a transfer of
a  noneconomic  residual  interest  is  disregarded  for all tax  purposes  if a
significant purpose of the transfer is to




<PAGE>

enable the  transferor to impede the  assessment or collection of tax. A purpose
to impede the assessment or collection of tax (a wrongful purpose) exists if the
transferor,  at the time of the transfer,  either knew or should have known that
the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the
REMIC's taxable income.
   Under a safe harbor, the transferor of a REMIC noneconomic  residual interest
is presumed not to have a wrongful  purpose if two  requirements  are satisfied:
(1) the  transferor  conducts a  reasonable  investigation  of the  transferee's
financial  condition  (the  investigation  requirement);  and (2) the transferor
secures a  representation  from the transferee to the effect that the transferee
understands the tax obligations  associated with holding a residual interest and
intends to pay those taxes (the representation requirement).
   The IRS and Treasury have been concerned that some transferors of noneconomic
residual  interests claim they satisfy the safe harbor even in situations  where
the economics of the transfer  clearly  indicate the  transferee is unwilling or
unable to pay the tax associated with holding the interest.  For this reason, on
February  7, 2000,  the IRS  published  in the Federal  Register  (65 FR 5807) a
notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-100276-97; REG-122450-98) designed to clarify
the safe harbor by adding the  "formula  test," an economic  test.  The proposed
regulation provides that the safe harbor is unavailable unless the present value
of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the residual interest
does not exceed the sum of: (1) The present value of any consideration  given to
the  transferee to acquire the  interest;  (2) the present value of the expected
future  distributions  on  the  interest;  and  (3)  the  present  value  of the
anticipated  tax  savings  associated  with  holding  the  interest as the REMIC
generates losses.
   The notice of proposed  rulemaking also contained  rules for FASITs.  Section
1.860H-6(g) of the proposed regulations  provides  requirements for transfers of
FASIT  ownership  interests  and adopts a safe harbor by  reference  to the safe
harbor provisions of the REMIC regulations.
   In January 2001, the IRS published Rev. Proc.  2001-12 (2001-3 I.R.B. 335) to
set forth an alternative  safe harbor that taxpayers could use while the IRS and
the  Treasury  considered  comments  on  the  proposed  regulations.  Under  the
alternative safe harbor, if a transferor meets the investigation requirement and
the representation  requirement but the transfer fails to meet the formula test,
the transferor  may invoke the safe harbor if the transferee  meets a two- prong
test (the asset test). A transferee generally meets the first prong of this test
if, at the time of the transfer, and in each of the two years preceding the year
of  transfer,  the  transferee's  gross  assets  exceed $100 million and its net
assets exceed $10 million. A transferee



<PAGE>



generally  meets  the  second  prong of this test if it is a  domestic,  taxable
corporation  and agrees in writing  not to transfer  the  interest to any person
other  than  another  domestic,  taxable  corporation  that also  satisfies  the
requirements  of the asset test. A  transferor  cannot rely on the asset test if
the transferor knows, or has reason to know, that the transferee will not comply
with its written agreement to limit the restrictions on subsequent  transfers of
the residual interest.
   Rev. Proc.  2001-12 provides that the asset test fails to be satisfied in the
case of a transfer or assignment of a noneconomic residual interest to a foreign
branch of an otherwise  eligible  transferee.  If such a transfer or  assignment
were permitted,  a corporate taxpayer might seek to claim that the provisions of
an  applicable  income tax treaty  would  resource  excess  inclusion  income as
foreign  source  income,  and that,  as a  consequence,  any U.S. tax  liability
attributable  to the excess  inclusion  income  could be offset by  foreign  tax
credits.  Such a claim would impede the  assessment or collection of U.S. tax on
excess inclusion income,  contrary to the congressional purpose of assuring that
such income will be taxable in all events. See, e.g., sections 860E(a)(1),  (b),
(e) and 860G(b) of the Code.
   The Treasury and the IRS have  learned  that certain  taxpayers  transferring
noneconomic residual interests to foreign branches have attempted to rely on the
formula  test to obtain  safe  harbor  treatment  in an  effort  to  impede  the
assessment or collection of U.S. tax on excess  inclusion  income.  Accordingly,
the  final  regulations  provide  that if a  noneconomic  residual  interest  is
transferred  to a  foreign  permanent  establishment  or  fixed  base  of a U.S.
taxpayer,  the transfer is not eligible for safe harbor  treatment  under either
the asset  test or the  formula  test.  The  final  regulations  also  require a
transferee  to  represent  that it will not cause  income  from the  noneconomic
residual  interest to be attributable to a foreign  permanent  establishment  or
fixed base.
   Section 1.860E -1(c)(8) provides  computational rules that a taxpayer may use
to  qualify  for  safe  harbor   status   under  the   formula   test.   Section
1.860E-1(c)(8)(i)  provides that the transferee is presumed to pay tax at a rate
equal to the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).  Some  commentators
were  concerned that this presumed rate of taxation was too high because it does
not take into  consideration  taxpayers  subject to the alternative  minimum tax
rate. In light of the comments received,  this provision has been amended in the
final regulations to allow certain transferees that compute their taxable income
using the alternative  minimum tax rate to use the alternative  minimum tax rate
applicable to corporations.
   Additionally, Sec. 1.860E-1(c)(8)(iii) provides that the present

values in the formula test are to be computed using a discount rate



<PAGE>



equal to the applicable  Federal  short-term rate prescribed by section 1274(d).
This is a change from the proposed  regulation and Rev. Proc.  2001-12. In those
publications  the  provision  stated that "present  values are computed  using a
discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate prescribed in section 1274(d)
compounded  semiannually"  and that "[a] lower  discount rate may be used if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly borrows, in the course of its trade
or  business,  substantial  funds at such  lower  rate from an  unrelated  third
party." The IRS and the Treasury  Department  have learned  that,  based on this
provision,  certain taxpayers have been attempting to use unrealistically low or
zero interest rates to satisfy the formula test,  frustrating  the intent of the
test.  Furthermore,  the  Treasury  Department  and the IRS believe  that a rule
allowing  for a rate  other than a rate based on an  objective  index  would add
unnecessary complexity to the safe harbor. As a result, the rule in the proposed
regulations  that  permits a transferee  to use a lower  discount  rate,  if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly  borrows  substantial funds at such
lower rate, is not included in the final regulations; and the Federal short-term
rate  has  been  substituted  for  the  applicable  Federal  rate.  To  simplify
taxpayers' computations, the final regulations allow use of any of the published
short-term  rates,  provided  that  the  present  values  are  computed  with  a
corresponding  period  of  compounding.  With the  exception  of the  provisions
relating to transfers to foreign  branches,  these  changes  generally  have the
proposed  applicability  date of February 4, 2000,  but  taxpayers may choose to
apply the interest  rate formula set forth in the proposed  regulation  and Rev.
Proc. 2001-12 for transfers occurring before August 19, 2002.
   It is anticipated that when final regulations are adopted with
respect to

[[Page 47453]]

FASITs,  Sec.  1.860H-6(g)  of the  proposed  regulations  will  be  adopted  in
substantially  its  present  form,  with the result  that the final  regulations
contained  in this  document  will  also  govern  transfers  of FASIT  ownership
interests with substantially the same applicability date as is contained in this
document.

Effect on Other Documents

   Rev. Proc. 2001-12 (2001-3 I.R.B. 335) is obsolete for transfers of
noneconomic residual interests in REMICs occurring on or after August
19, 2002.

Special Analyses



<PAGE>



   It is hereby  certified  that these  regulations  will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is
based  on the  fact  that it is  unlikely  that a  substantial  number  of small
entities will hold REMIC residual interests. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis  under  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter  6) is not
required.  It  has  been  determined  that  this  Treasury  decision  is  not  a
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.  Therefore, a
regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that sections
553(b) and 553(d) of the  Administrative  Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter 5) do
not apply to these regulations.

Drafting Information

   The principal author of these  regulations is Courtney  Shepardson.  However,
other  personnel  from the IRS and  Treasury  Department  participated  in their
development.

hereby  certifies the following  facts:  Neither the Seller nor anyone acting on
its behalf has offered, transferred,  pledged, sold or otherwise disposed of the

144A Securities or any other similar security with, any person in any manner, or
made any general  solicitation  by means of general  advertising or in any other
manner,  or taken any other action,  that would constitute a distribution of the
Rule 144A  Securities  under the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act"),  or that  would  render the  disposition  of the Rule 144A  Securities  a
violation of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or require registration pursuant thereto,
and that the Seller has not offered the Rule 144A Securities to any person other
than the Buyer or  another  "qualified  institutional  buyer" as defined in Rule
144A under the 1933 Act.

        2. The Buyer warrants and represents to, and covenants with, the Seller,
the Trustee and the Master Servicer (as defined in the Series Supplement,  dated
as of ________________, to the Standard Terms of Pooling and Servicing Agreement
dated  as  of  ________________  (the  "Agreement")  among  Residential  Funding
Corporation as Master Servicer,  Residential Funding Mortgage Securities I, Inc.

        institutional investor having such knowledge and experience in financial

               (c) The Buyer has been furnished with all  information  regarding
        the Rule 144A  Securities  that it has  requested  from the Seller,  the
        Trustee or the Servicer.

               (d)  Neither  the  Buyer nor  anyone  acting  on its  behalf  has
        offered,  transferred,  pledged,  sold or otherwise disposed of the Rule
        144A  Securities,  any interest in the Rule 144A Securities or any other
        similar security to, or solicited any offer to buy or accept a transfer,
        pledge or other disposition of the Rule 144A Securities, any interest in
        the  Rule  144A  Securities  or any  other  similar  security  from,  or
        otherwise  approached  or  negotiated  with  respect  to the  Rule  144A
        Securities,  any  interest  in the Rule  144A  Securities  or any  other
        similar  security  with,  any person in any manner,  or made any general
        solicitation by means of general  advertising or in any other manner, or
        taken any other action, that would constitute a distribution of the Rule
        144A Securities  under the 1933 Act or that would render the disposition
        of the Rule 144A  Securities a violation of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or
        require  registration  pursuant  thereto,  nor  will it act,  nor has it
        authorized  or will it authorize  any person to act, in such manner with
        respect to the Rule 144A Securities.

               (e) The Buyer is a "qualified  institutional  buyer" as that term
        is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and has  completed  either of
        the forms of  certification to that effect attached hereto as Annex 1 or

        144A, or (ii) pursuant to another exemption from registration  under the
        1933 Act.

is made of any changes in the  information and  conclusions  herein.  Until such

        Section 12.01. Subordinate Certificate Loss Coverage;  Limited Guaranty.
(a) Subject to subsection  (c) below,  prior to the later of the third  Business
Day prior to each  Distribution  Date or the  related  Determination  Date,  the
Master Servicer shall determine  whether it or any Sub-Servicer will be entitled
to any  reimbursement  pursuant to Section 4.02(a) on such Distribution Date for
Advances or Sub-Servicer  Advances  previously made, (which will not be Advances
or Sub-Servicer Advances that were made with respect to delinquencies which were
subsequently determined to be Excess Special Hazard Losses, Excess Fraud Losses,
Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses or  Extraordinary  Losses)  and,  if so,  the  Master
Servicer shall demand payment from Residential Funding of an amount equal to the
amount of any Advances or Sub-Servicer  Advances  reimbursed pursuant to Section
4.02(a),  to the extent such  Advances or  Sub-Servicer  Advances  have not been
included in the amount of the Realized Loss in the related  Mortgage  Loan,  and
shall distribute the same to the Class B  Certificateholders  in the same manner
as if such amount were to be distributed pursuant to Section 4.02(a).

        (b)  Subject to  subsection  (c) below,  prior to the later of the third

provided, however, that the amount of such demand in respect of any Distribution
Date shall in no event be greater than the sum of (i) the  additional  amount of
Accrued  Certificate  Interest  that  would  have  been  paid  for  the  Class B

Corporation of any failure of Residential Funding to make any payments hereunder
and  shall  demand  payment  pursuant  to the  limited  guaranty  (the  "Limited
Guaranty"),  executed by General Motors Acceptance  Corporation,  of Residential
Funding's  obligation  to make payments  pursuant to this Section,  in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the Amount Available and (ii) such required payments,
by  delivering to General  Motors  Acceptance  Corporation a written  demand for

Distribution Date for such month, with a copy to the Master Servicer.

        (e) All payments made by Residential Funding pursuant to this Section or
amounts  paid under the  Limited  Guaranty  shall be  deposited  directly in the
Certificate Account, for distribution on the Distribution Date for such month to
the Class B Certificateholders.

        (f) The  Company  shall  have the  option,  in its sole  discretion,  to

Certificate  Loss  Obligation  another  instrument  in the  form of a  corporate
guaranty,  an irrevocable  letter of credit, a surety bond,  insurance policy or
similar  instrument  or a reserve fund;  provided  that (i) the Company  obtains
(subject to the provisions of Section 10.01(f) as if the Company was substituted
for the Master Servicer solely for the purposes of such provision) an Opinion of
Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent counsel) to the effect that
obtaining such  substitute  corporate  guaranty,  irrevocable  letter of credit,
surety bond,  insurance  policy or similar  instrument  or reserve fund will not
cause  either (a) any  federal  tax to be imposed on the Trust  Fund,  including

reduction,  deletion or cancellation is made in accordance with Section 11.01(e)
and,  provided  further that the Company  obtains  (subject to the provisions of
Section  10.01(f)  as if the  Company was  substituted  for the Master  Servicer
solely for the purposes of such provision),  in the case of a material amendment
or  supersession  (but not a reduction,  cancellation or deletion of the Limited
Guaranty or the Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation),  an Opinion of Counsel
(which  need not be an opinion of  Independent  counsel)  to the effect that any
such amendment or  supersession  will not cause either (a) any federal tax to be

"contributions  after the startup date" under Section  860G(d)(1) of the Code or
