  to a Company repurchase option and are repurchased by the Company at the Optionee&#146;s
  exercise price, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of
  such Option or such repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for
  issuance under the Plan. However, except as adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2,
  in no event shall more than five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Stock

  recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
  split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares
  or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments

  outstanding Options, in the ISO Share Issuance Limit set forth in Section&nbsp;4.1,
  in the Section&nbsp;162(m) Grant Limit set forth in Section&nbsp;5.4, and in
  the exercise price per share of any outstanding Options in order to prevent
  dilution or enlargement of Optionees&#146; rights under the Plan. Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to
  this Section&nbsp;4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and
  in no event may the exercise price of any Option be decreased to an amount less
  than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option. The adjustments
  determined by the Board pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4.2 shall be final, binding
  and conclusive. </blockquote>
<p>5. <B><U>Eligibility and Option Limitations</u>. </B> </p>

  <FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT>Consultants<FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT>
  and <FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT>Directors<FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT>
  shall include prospective Employees, prospective Consultants and prospective
  Directors to whom Options are granted in connection with written offers of an
  employment or other service relationship with the Participating Company Group.
  Eligible persons may be granted more than one (1) Option. However, eligibility
  in accordance with this Section shall not entitle any person to be granted an
  Option, or, having been granted an Option, to be granted an additional Option.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>5.2 <B>Option Grant Restrictions<I>.</I></b> Any person who is not an Employee
  on the effective date of the grant of an Option to such person may be granted
  only a Nonstatutory Stock Option. An Incentive Stock Option granted to a prospective
  Employee upon the condition that such person become an Employee shall be deemed
  granted effective on the date such person commences Service with a Participating
  Company, with an exercise price determined as of such date in accordance with
  Section&nbsp;6.1. </blockquote>
<blockquote>5.3 <B>Fair Market Value Limitation<I>.</I></b> To the extent that options designated
  as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock option plans of the Participating
  Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by an Optionee for the
  first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater
  than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portions of such options which
  exceed such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes
  of this Section&nbsp;5.3, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall
  be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair
  Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect
  to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a different
  limitation from that set forth in this Section&nbsp;5.3, such different limitation
  shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect
  to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If an
  Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory
  Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section&nbsp;5.3,
  the Optionee may designate which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising.
  In the absence of such designation, the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised
  the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first. Separate certificates
  representing each such portion shall be issued upon the exercise of the Option.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>5.4 <B>Section&nbsp;162(m) Grant Limit.</b> Subject to adjustment as provided in
  Section&nbsp;4.2, at any such time as a Participating Company is a &quot;publicly
  held corporation&quot; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m), no Employee
  or prospective Employee shall be granted one or more Options within any fiscal
  year of the Company which in the aggregate are for the purchase of more than
  four hundred thousand (400,000) shares. An Option which is canceled in the same
  fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted shall continue to be counted
  against the Section&nbsp;162(m) Grant Limit for such period. </blockquote>
<p>6. <B><U>Terms and Conditions of Options</u>. </B> </p>
<p>&#9;Options shall be evidenced by Option Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Board shall from time to time establish.  No Option or purported Option shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Option Agreement.  Option Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and, except as otherwise set forth in Section&nbsp;7 with respect to Outside Director Options, shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>

  in the discretion of the Board; provided, however, that (a)&nbsp;the exercise
  price per share for an Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than the Fair
  Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option,
  (b)&nbsp;the exercise price per share for a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall
  be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share
  of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option, and (c)&nbsp;no Incentive
  Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner Optionee shall have an exercise
  price per share less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market
  Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option. Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory
  Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum exercise
  price set forth above if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or
  substitution for another option in a manner qualifying under the provisions
  of Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code. </blockquote>
<blockquote>6.2 <B>Exercisability and Term of Options<I>.</I></b> Options shall be exercisable
  at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms,
  conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by
  the Board and set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option; provided,
  however, that (a)&nbsp;no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of
  ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such Option, (b)&nbsp;no
  Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner Optionee shall be exercisable
  after the expiration of five (5) years after the effective date of grant of
  such Option, and (c)&nbsp;no Option granted to a prospective Employee, prospective
  Consultant or prospective Director may become exercisable prior to the date
  on which such person commences Service with a Participating Company. Subject
  to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the Board in the grant of an
  Option, any Option granted hereunder shall terminate ten (10) years after the
  effective date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance
  with its provisions. </blockquote>
<blockquote>6.3 <B>Payment of Exercise Price. </B> </blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(a) <B></B><I><B>Forms of Consideration Authorized.</b></i> Except as otherwise
  provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock
  being purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i)&nbsp;in cash, by check
  or cash equivalent, (ii)&nbsp;by tender to the Company, or attestation to the
  ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market Value
  (as determined by the Company without regard to any restrictions on transferability
  applicable to such stock by reason of federal or state securities laws or agreements
  with an underwriter for the Company) not less than the exercise price, (iii)&nbsp;by
  delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions
  to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a
  sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the
  exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying
  with the provisions of Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated from time to time by
  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (a <I><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT><B>Cashless
  Exercise</B><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</font></I>), (iv)&nbsp;provided
  that the Optionee is an Employee (unless otherwise not prohibited by law, including,
  without limitation, any regulation promulgated by the Board of Governors of
  the Federal Reserve System) and in the Company&#146;s sole discretion at the
  time the Option is exercised, by delivery of the Optionee&#146;s promissory
  note in a form approved by the Company for the aggregate exercise price, provided
  that, if the Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware, the Optionee
  shall pay in cash that portion of the aggregate exercise price not less than
  the par value of the shares being acquired, (v)&nbsp;by such other consideration
  as may be approved by the Board from time to time to the extent permitted by
  applicable law, or (vi)&nbsp;by any combination thereof. The Board may at any
  time or from time to time, by approval of or by amendment to the standard forms
  of Option Agreement described in Section&nbsp;8, or by other means, grant Options
  which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in
  payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms
  of consideration. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(b) <B><I>Limitations on Forms of Consideration. </i></B> </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(i) <B>Tender of Stock.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be
  exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares
  of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation
  of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption
  of the Company&#146;s stock. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, an Option
  may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership,
  of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee
  for more than six (6) months (and not used for another Option exercise by attestation
  during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>
    <blockquote>(Ii) <B>Cashless Exercise.</b> The Company reserves, at any and
      all times, the right, in the Company&#146;s sole and absolute discretion,
      to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures
      for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise. </blockquote>
  </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(iii) <b>Payment by Promissory Note.</B>  No promissory note shall be permitted if the exercise of an Option using a promissory note would be a violation of any law.  Any permitted promissory note shall be on such terms as the Board shall determine at the time the Option is granted.  The Board shall have the authority to permit or require the Optionee to secure any promissory note used to exercise an Option with the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the Option or with other collateral acceptable to the Company.  Unless otherwise provided by the Board, if the Company at any time is subject to the regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other governmental entity affecting the extension of credit in connection with the Company&#146;s securities, any promissory note shall comply with such applicable regulations, and the Optionee shall pay the unpaid principal and accrued interest, if any, to the extent necessary to comply with such applicable regulations.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.4 <B>Tax Withholding<I>.</I></b> The Company shall have the right, but not the
  obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable upon the exercise of
  an Option, or to accept from the Optionee the tender of, a number of whole shares
  of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to
  all or any part of the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required
  by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to such
  Option or the shares acquired upon the exercise thereof. Alternatively or in
  addition, in its discretion, the Company shall have the right to require the
  Optionee, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, including
  by means of a Cashless Exercise, to make adequate provision for any such tax
  withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group arising in connection
  with the Option or the shares acquired upon the exercise thereof. The Fair Market
  Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding
  obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum
  statutory withholding rates. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver
  shares of Stock or to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant
  to the Option Agreement until the Participating Company Group&#146;s tax withholding
  obligations have been satisfied by the Optionee. </blockquote>
<blockquote>6.5 <B>Repurchase Rights<I>.</I></b> Shares issued under the Plan may be subject
  to a right of first refusal, one or more repurchase options, or other conditions
  and restrictions as determined by the Board in its discretion at the time the
  Option is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any
  repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable,
  to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the
  Company, each Optionee shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer
  restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly
  present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock
  acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends
  evidencing any such transfer restrictions. </blockquote>
<blockquote>6.6 <B>Effect of Termination of Service. </B> </blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(a) <B><I>Option Exercisability</i>.</b> Subject to earlier termination of the
  Option as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Board
  in the grant of an Option and set forth in the Option Agreement, an Option shall
  be exercisable after an Optionee&#146;s termination of Service only during the
  applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section 6.6 and thereafter
  shall terminate: </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(i) <B>Disability.</b> If the Optionee&#146;s Service with the Participating Company
  Group terminates because of the Disability of the Optionee, the Option, to the
  extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Optionee&#146;s
  Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee&#146;s
  guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve
  (12) months (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board, in its
  discretion) after the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated,
  but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the Option&#146;s term
  as set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option (the <I><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT><B>Option
  Expiration Date</B><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</font></I>).
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(ii) <B>Death.</b> If the Optionee&#146;s Service with the Participating Company
  Group terminates because of the death of the Optionee, the Option, to the extent
  unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service
  terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee&#146;s legal representative or
  other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the
  Optionee&#146;s death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months
  (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board, in its discretion)
  after the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated, but in any event
  no later than the Option Expiration Date. The Optionee&#146;s Service shall
  be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Optionee dies within
  three (3) months (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board,
  in its discretion) after the Optionee&#146;s termination of Service. </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>
    <blockquote>(Iii) <B>Other Termination of Service.</b> If the Optionee&#146;s
      Service with the Participating Company Group terminates for any reason,
      except Disability or death, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable
      by the Optionee on the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated,
      may be exercised by the Optionee at any time prior to the expiration of
      three (3) months (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board,
      in its discretion) after the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated,
      but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote>
  </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(b) <B><I>Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law</i>.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing,
  if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in
  Section&nbsp;6.6(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section&nbsp;11 below,
  the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months (or such longer period
  of time as determined by the Board, in its discretion) after the date the Optionee
  is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event
  no later than the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(c) <B><I>Extension if Optionee Subject to Section&nbsp;16(b</i>).</b> Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section&nbsp;6.6(a)
  of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Optionee
  to suit under Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain
  exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i)&nbsp;the tenth (10th) day following
  the date on which a sale of such shares by the Optionee would no longer be subject
  to such suit, (ii)&nbsp;the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the
  Optionee&#146;s termination of Service, or (iii)&nbsp;the Option Expiration
  Date. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>6.7 <B>Transferability of Options.</b> During the lifetime of the Optionee, an
  Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or the Optionee&#146;s guardian
  or legal representative. No Option shall be assignable or transferable by the
  Optionee, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Board, in its discretion, and
  set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option, a Nonstatutory Stock
  Option shall be assignable or transferable subject to the applicable limitations,
  if any, described in the General Instructions to Form S-8 Registration Statement
  under the Securities Act. </blockquote>

<P>&#9;&#9;Outside Director Options shall be evidenced by Option Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Board shall from time to time establish.  Such Option Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions and those terms and conditions set forth in Section 6 which are not inconsistent with the following:</P>



<blockquote>7.1 <B>Exercise Price<I>.</I></b> The exercise price per share of Stock subject
  to an Outside Director Option shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock
  on the date of grant of such Option. </blockquote>
<blockquote>7.2 <B>Exercise Period<I>.</I></b> Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or
  in the Option Agreement evidencing such Outside Director Option, each Outside
  Director Option shall vest and become exercisable in three (3) substantially
  equal installments on each of the first three (3) anniversaries of the date
  of grant of such Option, provided that the Optionee&#146;s Service has not terminated
  prior to the relevant date. Each Outside Director Option shall terminate and
  cease to be exercisable on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant
  of such Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the
  Plan or the Option Agreement evidencing such Option. </blockquote>
<blockquote>7.3 <B>Effect of Termination of Service on Outside Director Options.</b> Subject
  to earlier termination of the Outside Director Option as otherwise provided
  herein, if the Optionee&#146;s Service with the Participating Company Group
  terminates for any reason, including the Disability or death of the Optionee,
  the Outside Director Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the
  date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated, may be exercised by the
  Optionee (or the Optionee&#146;s guardian, legal representative or other person
  who acquired the right to exercise the Outside Director Option by reason of
  the Optionee&#146;s death) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12)
  months after the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated, but in
  any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote>
<p>8. <B><U>Standard Forms of Option Agreement</u>. </B> </p>
<blockquote>8.1 <B>Option Agreement<I>.</I></b> Unless otherwise provided by the Board at the
  time the Option is granted, an Option shall comply with and be subject to the
  terms and conditions set forth in the appropriate form of Option Agreement approved
  by the Board and as amended from time to time. </blockquote>
<blockquote>8.2 <B>Authority to Vary Terms<I>.</I></b> The Board shall have the authority from
  time to time to vary the terms of any standard form of Option Agreement described
  in this Section&nbsp;8 either in connection with the grant or amendment of an
  individual Option or in connection with the authorization of a new standard
  form or forms; provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such
  new, revised or amended standard form or forms of Option Agreement are not inconsistent
  with the terms of the Plan. </blockquote>
<p>9. <B><U>Change in Control</u>. </B> </p>
<blockquote>9.1 <B>Definitions. </B> </blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(a) An <I><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT><B>Ownership Change
  Event</B><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</font></I> shall be deemed
  to have occurred if any of the following occurs with respect to the Company:
  (i) the direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series of related
  transactions by the shareholders of the Company of more than fifty percent (50%)
  of the voting stock of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which
  the Company is a party; (iii) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially
  all of the assets of the Company; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the
  Company. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(b) A <I>&quot;<B>Change in Control</B>&quot;</I> shall mean an Ownership Change
  Event or a series of related Ownership Change Events (collectively, a <I>&quot;<B>Transaction</B>&quot;</I>)
  wherein the shareholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do
  not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions
  as their ownership of shares of the Company<FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</FONT>s
  voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial
  ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power
  of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or, in the case of a Transaction
  described in Section 9.1(a)(iii), the corporation or other business entity to
  which the assets of the Company were transferred (the <I>&quot;<B>Transferee</B>&quot;</I>),
  as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial
  ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership
  of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities
  which own the Company or the Transferee, as the case may be, either directly
  or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities. The
  Board shall have the right to determine whether multiple sales or exchanges
  of the voting securities of the Company or multiple Ownership Change Events
  are related, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>9.2 <B>Effect of Change in Control on Options<I>.</I></b> In the event of a Change
  in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation
  or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the <I><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</FONT><B>Acquiring
  Corporation</B><FONT FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;</font></I>), may,
  without the consent of the Optionee, either assume the Company&#146;s rights
  and obligations under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options
  substantially equivalent options for the Acquiring Corporation&#146;s stock.
  Any Options which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation
  in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the
  Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of
  the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired
  upon exercise of an Option prior to the Change in Control and any consideration
  received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall
  continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Option Agreement
  evidencing such Option except as otherwise provided in such Option Agreement.
  Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of
  which is subject to the outstanding Options immediately prior to an Ownership
  Change Event described in Section&nbsp;9.1(a)(i) constituting a Change in Control
  is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership
  Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power
  of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations
  that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1504(a)
  of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section&nbsp;1504(b) of the
  Code, the outstanding Options shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise
  provides in its discretion. </blockquote>
<blockquote>9.3 <B>Effect of Change in Control on Outside Director Options<I>.</I></b> In the
  event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Outside Director Option held
  by an Optionee whose Service has not terminated prior to such date shall be
  immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior
  to the Change in Control. The exercise or vesting of any Outside Director Option
  that was permissible solely by reason of this Section&nbsp;9.3 shall be conditioned
  upon the consummation of the Change in Control. In addition, the provisions
  of Section 9.2 shall apply equally to Outside Director Options. </blockquote>
<p>10. <B><U>Provision of Information</u>. </B> </p>
<P>&#9;Each Optionee shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company&#146;s common stockholders.</P>

<B>11. <U>Compliance with Securities Law</u>.
</B>
<P>&#9;The grant of Options and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Options shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities.  Options may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition, no Option may be exercised unless (a)&nbsp;a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (b)&nbsp;in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company&#146;s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the exercise of any Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.</P>

<B>12. <U>Termination or Amendment of Plan</u>.</b>



<P>&#9;The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time.  However, subject to changes in applicable law, regulations or rules that would permit otherwise, without the approval of the Company&#146;s shareholders, there shall be (a)&nbsp;no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section&nbsp;4.2), (b)&nbsp;no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, and (c)&nbsp;no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company&#146;s shareholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule.  No termination or amendment of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Option unless expressly provided by the Board.  In any event, no termination or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Option without the consent of the Optionee, unless such termination or amendment is required to enable an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule.</P>

<P>&#9;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Secretary of the Company certifies that the foregoing sets forth the Applied Signal Technology, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan as duly adopted by the Board on November 16, 2000 and as amended through January 20, 2003.</P>

  shall be exercisable on and after the Initial Vesting Date and prior to the
  termination of the Option (as provided in Section 6) in an amount not to exceed
  the number of Vested Shares less the number of shares previously acquired upon
  exercise of the Option. In no event shall the Option be exercisable for more
  shares than the Number of Option Shares, as adjusted pursuant to Section 9.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>4.2 <b>Method of Exercise<i>.</i></b> Exercise of the Option shall be by written
  notice to the Company which must state the election to exercise the Option,
  the number of whole shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised
  and such other representations and agreements as to the Optionee&#146;s investment
  intent with respect to such shares as may be required pursuant to the provisions
  of this Option Agreement. The written notice must be signed by the Optionee
  and must be delivered in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt
  requested, by confirmed facsimile transmission, or by such other means as the
  Company may permit, to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, or other
  authorized representative of the Participating Company Group, prior to the termination
  of the Option as set forth in Section 6, accompanied by full payment of the
  aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased.
  The Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such
  written notice and the aggregate Exercise Price. </blockquote>
<blockquote>4.3 <b>Payment of Exercise Price.</b> </blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(a) <b><i>Forms of Consideration Authorized</i>.</b> Except as otherwise provided
  below, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock
  for which the Option is being exercised shall be made (i)&nbsp;in cash, by check,
  or cash equivalent, (ii)&nbsp;by tender to the Company, or attestation to the
  ownership, of whole shares of Stock owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market
  Value not less than the aggregate Exercise Price, (iii) by means of a Cashless
  Exercise, as defined in Section 4.3(b), or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(b) <b><i>Limitations on Forms of Consideration.</i></b> </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(i) <b>Tender of Stock.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be
  exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares
  of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation
  of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption
  of the Company&#146;s stock. The Option may not be exercised by tender to the
  Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares
  either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months (and not
  used for another option exercise by attestation during such period) or were
  not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company. </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>
    <blockquote>(Ii) <b>Cashless Exercise.</b> A <i>&quot;<b>Cashless Exercise</b>&quot;</i>
      means the delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable
      instructions to a broker in a form acceptable to the Company providing for
      the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect
      to some or all of the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the
      Option pursuant to a program or procedure approved by the Company (including,
      without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of
      Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors
      of the Federal Reserve System). The Company reserves, at any and all times,
      the right, in the Company&#146;s sole and absolute discretion, to decline
      to approve or terminate any such program or procedure. </blockquote>
  </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>4.4 <b>Tax Withholding<i>.</i></b> At the time the Option is exercised, in whole
  or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Optionee
  hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to
  the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including
  by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any
  sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding
  obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection
  with the Option. The Option is not exercisable unless the tax withholding obligations
  of the Participating Company Group are satisfied. Accordingly, the Company shall
  have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations
  of the Participating Company Group have been satisfied by the Optionee. </blockquote>
<blockquote>4.5 <b>Certificate Registration<i>.</i></b> Except in the event the Exercise Price
  is paid by means of a Cashless Exercise, the certificate for the shares as to
  which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Optionee,
  or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Optionee. </blockquote>
<blockquote>4.6 <b>Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of Shares<i>.</i></b> The
  grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the
  Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal,
  state or foreign law with respect to such securities. The Option may not be
  exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute
  a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other
  law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system
  upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be
  exercised unless (i)&nbsp;a registration statement under the Securities Act
  shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the
  shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii)&nbsp;in the opinion of legal
  counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may
  be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration
  requirements of the Securities Act. THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION
  MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY,
  THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH
  THE OPTION IS VESTED. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory
  body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares
  subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
  of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority
  shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option,
  the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may
  be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law
  or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto
  as may be requested by the Company. </blockquote>
<blockquote>4.7 <b>Fractional Shares<i>.</i></b> The Company shall not be required to issue
  fractional shares upon the exercise of the Option. </blockquote>
<p>5. <b><u>Nontransferability of the Option</u>.</b> </p>
<p>&#9;&#9;The Option may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee
      only by the Optionee or the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
      guardian or legal representative and may not be assigned or transferred
      in any manner except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
      Following the death of the Optionee, the Option, to the extent provided
      in Section 7, may be exercised by the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
      legal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased
      Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s will or under
      the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.</p>
    <b>6. <u>Termination of the Option</u>.</b>
    <p>&#9;&#9;The Option shall terminate and may no longer be exercised after
      the first to occur of (a)&nbsp;the Option Expiration Date, (b)&nbsp;the
      last date for exercising the Option following termination of the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
      Service as described in Section 7, or (c)&nbsp;a Change in Control to the
      extent provided in Section 8.</p>

<p>7. <b><u>Effect of Termination of Service</u>.</b> </p>
<blockquote>7.1 <b>Option Exercisability.</b> If the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  Service terminates any reason, including the Disability or death of the Optionee,
  the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the
  Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s Service terminated,
  may be exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  guardian, legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise
  the Option by reason of the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  death) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date
  on which the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s Service
  terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote>
<blockquote>7.2 <b>Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law<i>.</i></b> Notwithstanding the foregoing,
  if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods set forth in
  Section 7.1 is prevented by the provisions of Section 4.6, the Option shall
  remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Optionee is notified
  by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than
  the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote>
<blockquote>7.3 <b>Extension if Optionee Subject to Section 16(b).</b> Notwithstanding the
  foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section
  7.1 of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Optionee
  to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain exercisable
  until the earliest to occur of (i)&nbsp;the tenth (10th) day following the date
  on which a sale of such shares by the Optionee would no longer be subject to
  such suit, (ii)&nbsp;the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  termination of Service, or (iii)&nbsp;the Option Expiration Date. </blockquote>
<p>8. <b><u>Change in Control</u>.</b> </p>
<blockquote>8.1 <b>Definitions.</b> </blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(a) An <i>&quot;<b>Ownership Change Event</b>&quot;</i> shall be deemed to have
  occurred if any of the following occurs with respect to the Company: (i) the
  direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series of related transactions
  by the shareholders of the Company of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting
  stock of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is
  a party; (iii) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of
  the assets of the Company; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>(b) A <i>&quot;<b>Change in Control</b>&quot;</i> shall mean an Ownership Change
  Event or a series of related Ownership Change Events (collectively, a <i>&quot;<b>Transaction</b>&quot;</i>)
  wherein the shareholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do
  not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions
  as their ownership of shares of the Company<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial
  ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power
  of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or, in the case of a Transaction
  described in Section 8.1(a)(iii), the corporation or other business entity to
  which the assets of the Company were transferred (the <i>&quot;<b>Transferee</b>&quot;</i>),
  as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial
  ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership
  of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities
  which own the Company or the Transferee, as the case may be, either directly
  or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities. The
  Board shall have the right to determine whether multiple sales or exchanges
  of the voting securities of the Company or multiple Ownership Change Events
  are related, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. </blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>8.2 <b>Effect of Change in Control on Option<i>.</i></b> In the event of a Change
  in Control, and provided that the Optionee&#146;s Service has not terminated
  prior to such date, any unexercised portion of the Option shall be immediately
  exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior to the Change
  in Control. Any exercise of the Option that was permissible solely by reason
  of this Section&nbsp;8.2 shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change
  in Control. In addition, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing
  corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the
  <i>&quot;<b>Acquiring Corporation</b>&quot;</i>), may, without the consent of
  the Optionee, either assume the Company<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  rights and obligations under the Option or substitute for the Option a substantially
  equivalent option for the Acquiring Corporation<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
  stock. The Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of
  the date of the Change in Control to the extent that the Option is neither assumed
  or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change
  in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of the Option prior to the Change
  in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control
  with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions
  of this Option Agreement except as otherwise provided herein. Furthermore, notwithstanding
  the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the Option
  immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 8.1(a)(i)
  constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation
  and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%)
  of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation
  or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the
  meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section
  1504(b) of the Code, the Option shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise
  provides in its discretion. </blockquote>
<p>9. <b><u>Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure</u>.</b> </p>
<p>&#9;&#9;In the event of any change in the Stock through merger, consolidation,
      reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
      dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off,
      combination of shares, exchange of shares or similar change in the capital
      structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number,
      Exercise Price and class of shares of stock subject to the Option in order
      to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Optionee&#146;s rights under the
      Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from
      an adjustment pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9 shall be rounded down to the
      nearest whole number, and in no event may the Exercise Price be decreased
      to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the
      Option. The adjustments determined by the Board pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9
      shall be final, binding and conclusive.</p>
    <b>10. <u>Rights as a Shareholder, Employee or Consultant</u>.</b>
    <p>&#9;&#9;The Optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect

      in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue
      in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any
      right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Optionee<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&#146;</font>s
