the extent amounts received from the Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full
the outstanding Swingline Loans requested or required to be refunded. If any
portion of any such amount paid to the Swingline Lender shall be recovered by or
on behalf of the Borrower from the Swingline Lender in bankruptcy or otherwise,
the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentages (unless the amounts so recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower
pertain to a Swingline Loan extended after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default of which the Administrative Agent has
received notice in the manner required pursuant to Section 13.5 and which such
Event of Default has not been waived by the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as

the date the applicable Revolving Credit Loan would have been made, purchase an
undivided participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be refunded in an
amount equal to its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the aggregate
amount of such Swingline Loan. Each Lender will immediately transfer to the
Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its
participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will deliver to such
Lender a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of
such funds and for such amount. Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender
has received from any Lender such Lender's participating interest in a Swingline
Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the
Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its participating interest in
such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was
outstanding and funded).

and from time to time, upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent, to permanently reduce, without premium or penalty,
(i) the entire Revolving Credit Commitment at any time or (ii) portions of the
Revolving Credit Commitment, from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount
not less than $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
The amount of each partial permanent reduction shall be applied pro rata to
reduce the remaining mandatory reduction amounts required under Section 2.6(b),
and such reduction shall permanently reduce the Lenders' Revolving Credit
Commitments pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentages.

         (b) Mandatory Reduction. If at any time proceeds ("Excess Proceeds")
remain after the prepayment in full of Term Loans pursuant to Section 4.4(b),
the Revolving Credit Commitment shall be permanently reduced on the date of the
required prepayment under Section 4.4(b) by an amount equal to the amount of
such Excess Proceeds.

         (c) Corresponding Payment. Each permanent reduction permitted or
required pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be accompanied by a payment of
principal, first to the principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans, second
to the principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and third, to any
Letters of Credit then outstanding, in each case sufficient to reduce the
aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Swingline Loans and L/C
Obligations, as applicable, after such reduction to the Revolving Credit
Commitment as so reduced and if the Revolving Credit Commitment as so reduced is
less than the aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, the
Borrower shall be required to deposit cash collateral in a cash collateral
account opened by the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the aggregate
then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Such cash
collateral shall be applied in accordance with Section 12.2(b). Any reduction of
the Revolving Credit Commitment to zero shall be accompanied by payment of all
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans (and furnishing of cash
collateral satisfactory to the Administrative Agent for all L/C Obligations) and
shall result in the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment and the
Swingline Commitment and the Revolving Credit Facility. Such cash collateral
shall be applied in accordance with Section 12.2(b). If the reduction of the
Revolving Credit Commitment requires the repayment of any LIBOR Rate Loan, such
repayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to
Section 5.9.

         SECTION 2.7 Termination of Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving
Credit Facility shall terminate on the earliest of (a) January 22, 2006, (b) the
date of termination by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.6 of the entire
Revolving Credit Commitment, or (c) the date of termination by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders pursuant to Section 12.2(a).

         SECTION 2.8 Increase of Revolving Credit Commitment. So long as no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time
prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Borrower shall have the right
from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
the Administrative Agent to increase the Revolving Credit Commitment; provided
that (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Revolving Credit


                                       25
<PAGE>

Commitment and the failure by any Lender to respond to a request for such
increase shall be deemed to be a refusal of such request by such Lender, (ii)
the Borrower shall only be permitted to request such an increase on one (1)
occasion, (iii) such requested increase shall be in a minimum principal amount
of $25,000,000, (iv) in no event shall the Revolving Credit Commitment be
increased to an aggregate amount greater than Two Hundred Twenty-Five Million
Dollars ($225,000,000), (v) in no event shall the aggregate amount of increases
requested pursuant to this Section 2.8 exceed Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000), (vi) the Borrower and an existing Lender or a Person not
theretofore a Lender, as applicable, shall execute a Lender Addition and
Acknowledgement Agreement, which shall be acknowledged by the Administrative
Agent and each Guarantor and shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (vii) the Administrative Agent
shall have received a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Borrower authorizing the increase contemplated in this Section 2.8.

         (a) Any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment which is
accomplished by increasing the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender or
Lenders who are at the time of such increase party to this Agreement (which
Lender or Lenders shall consent to such increase in their sole and absolute
discretion) shall be accomplished as follows: (i) this Agreement will be amended
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and those Lender(s) whose
Commitment(s) is or are being increased (but without any requirement that the
consent of any other Lenders be obtained) to reflect the revised Revolving
Credit Commitment of each of the Lenders, (ii) the Administrative Agent will
update the Register to reflect the revised Revolving Credit Commitment and
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of each of the Lenders, (iii) the
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages
of L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans will be reallocated on the effective date
of such increase among the Lenders in accordance with their revised Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentages (and the Lenders agree to make all payments and
adjustments necessary to effect the reallocation and the Borrower shall pay any
and all costs required pursuant to Section 5.9 in connection with such
reallocation as if such reallocation were a repayment) and (iv) if requested,
the Borrower will deliver new Revolving Credit Note(s) to the Lender or Lenders
whose Commitment(s) is or are being increased reflecting the revised Revolving
Credit Commitment amount of such Lender(s);

         (b) Any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment which is
accomplished by addition of a new Lender under this Agreement shall be
accomplished as follows: (i) such new Lender shall be subject to the consent of
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) this Agreement will be amended by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and such new Lender (but without any requirement that the
consent of any other Lenders be obtained) to reflect the addition of such new
Lender as a Lender hereunder, (iii) the Administrative Agent will update the
Register to reflect the revised Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of each of the Lenders, (iv) the outstanding Revolving
Credit Loans and Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages of L/C Obligations and
Swingline Loans will be reallocated on the effective date of such increase among
the Lenders in accordance with their revised Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentages (and the Lenders agree to make all payments and adjustments
necessary to effect the reallocation and the Borrower shall pay any and all
costs required pursuant to Section 5.9 in connection with such reallocation as
if such reallocation were a repayment) and (v) if requested the Borrower will
deliver a Revolving Credit Note to such new Lender; and

                                       26
<PAGE>

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, upon any voluntary reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment
pursuant to Section 2.6, the Borrower shall no longer have the option to request
an increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.8.


                                   ARTICLE III

                            LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY

         SECTION 3.1 L/C Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the L/C Participants set
forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue standby letters of credit ("Letters of
Credit") for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day from the Closing
Date through but not including the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date in such form as may be approved from time to time
by the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent; provided, that the Issuing
Lender shall have no obligation to issue, and the L/C Participants shall have no
obligation to participate in, any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to
such issuance, (a) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (b)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, plus the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans, plus the aggregate
amount of L/C Obligations would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment. Each
Letter of Credit (other than the Existing Letters of Credit) shall (i) be in a
minimum amount of $25,000 unless otherwise agreed to by the Issuing Lender, (ii)
be a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of the Borrower or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, incurred in the
ordinary course of business, (iii) expire on a date satisfactory to the Issuing
Lender and the Administrative Agent, which date shall be no later than the
earlier of (A) one (1) year after the date of its issuance (but any Letter of
Credit issued hereunder may, by its terms and consistent with the terms hereof,
be renewable annually with the consent of the Issuing Bank), and (B) the fifth
(5th) Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (iv) be
subject to the Uniform Customs and/or ISP98, as set forth in the Application or
as determined by the Issuing Lender and, to the extent not inconsistent
therewith, the laws of the State of New York. As of the Closing Date, each of
the Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and
outstanding hereunder. The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to
issue, and the L/C Participants shall have no obligation to participate in, any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the
Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any
Applicable Law. References herein to "issue" and derivations thereof with
respect to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions or modifications of
any existing Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires.

         SECTION 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower
may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit
by delivering to the Issuing Lender an Application therefor, completed to the
satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and
other papers and information ("L/C Supporting Documentation") as the Issuing
Lender and the Administrative Agent may request. The Borrower will
contemporaneously deliver to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative


                                       27
<PAGE>

Agent's Office a copy of such Application and L/C Supporting Documentation. Upon
receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender shall process such Application
and the L/C Supporting Documentation delivered to it in connection therewith in
accordance with its customary procedures and shall, after approving the same and
receiving confirmation from the Administrative Agent that sufficient
availability exists under the Revolving Credit Facility for issuance of such
Letter of Credit, subject to Section 3.1 and Article VI hereof, promptly issue
the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender
be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days
after its receipt of the Application therefor and all L/C Supporting
Documentation relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit
to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by the Issuing Lender
and the Borrower; provided that the Issuing Lender shall not issue a Letter of
Credit from and after the date which is one (1) day after it has received
written notice from the Administrative Agent (upon the request of the Required
Lenders) that one or more of the applicable conditions to Extensions of Credit
specified in Section 6.3 is not then satisfied until such conditions are
satisfied or waived in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (and the
Issuing Lender shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such notice and
shall have no obligation to independently investigate the accuracy of such
notice and shall have no liability to the Borrower in respect thereof if such
notice proves to be inaccurate). The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and
promptly notify each Lender of the issuance and upon request by any Lender,
furnish to such Lender a copy of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such
Lender's participation therein.

         SECTION 3.3 Commissions and Other Charges.

         (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants, a letter of credit commission
with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the face amount of
such Letter of Credit multiplied by the Applicable Margin with respect to
Revolving Credit Loans that are LIBOR Rate Loans (determined on a per annum
basis). Such commission shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.
The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof,
distribute to the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants all commissions
received pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) in accordance with their respective
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages.

         (b) In addition to the foregoing commission, the Borrower shall pay the
Issuing Lender, for its own account, an issuance fee with respect to each Letter
of Credit in an amount equal to the face amount of such Letter of Credit
multiplied by one-eighth of one percent (.125%) per annum. Such issuance fee
shall be billed by the Issuing Lender and shall be payable by the Borrower in
equal quarterly payments, in arrears, on the last Business Day of each calendar
quarter and on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

         (c) In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower
shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs
and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing,
effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of
Credit.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.4  L/C Participations.

         (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to
each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of
Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase
and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk
an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage in the Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and
in respect of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder and the amount of each
draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft
is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not
reimbursed in full by the Borrower through a Revolving Credit Loan or otherwise
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay
to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender's address for notices
specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is
not so reimbursed.

         (b) Upon becoming aware of any amount required to be paid by any L/C
Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any
unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter
of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and each L/C
Participant of the amount and due date of such required payment and such L/C
Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender the amount specified on the
applicable due date. If any such amount is paid to the Issuing Lender after the
date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender
on demand, in addition to such amount, the product of (i) such amount, times
(ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate as determined by the Administrative
Agent during the period from and including the date such payment is due to the
date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times
(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during
such period and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Issuing
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 3.4(b) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. With respect to payment to the
Issuing Lender of the unreimbursed amounts described in this Section 3.4(b), if
the L/C Participants receive notice that any such payment is due (A) prior to
1:00 p.m. (Charlotte time) on any Business Day, such payment shall be due that
Business Day, and (B) after 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte time) on any Business Day, such
payment shall be due on the following Business Day.

         (c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment
under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such payment in accordance with this
Section 3.4, the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of
Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, or any payment of
interest on account thereof), the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C
Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, that in the event that any
such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by
the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the
portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

                                       29
<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. In the event of
any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to reimburse (either
with the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Loan as provided for in this Section 3.5
or with funds from other sources), the Issuing Lender not later than 1:00 p.m.
(Charlotte time) on the next succeeding Business Day for the amount of (a) such
draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in Section 3.3(c) incurred by the
Issuing Lender in connection with such payment. The Issuing Lender shall deliver
written notice of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing
Lender that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Issuing Lender for such
drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely
given a Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting that the
Lenders make a Revolving Credit Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate on such
date in the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in
Section 3.3(c) incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment,
and the Lenders shall make a Revolving Credit Loan bearing interest at the Base
Rate in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse the
Issuing Lender for the amount of the related drawing and costs and expenses.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving
Credit Loan in accordance with this Section 3.5 to reimburse the Issuing Lender
for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without
limitation, non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.3(a) or
Article VI. If the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with
funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as
provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at
the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Loans which were
then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full.

         SECTION 3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under this
Article III (including, without limitation, the Reimbursement Obligation) shall
be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective
of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have
or have had against the Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit
or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lender, the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and
the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation under Section 3.5 shall not be affected
by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be
invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and
any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter
of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against
any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing
Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or
omissions caused by the Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or
the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the
related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any
liability of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent or any L/C Participant
to the Borrower. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in
connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit
shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such
Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each
draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment
are in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

         SECTION 3.7 Effect of Application. To the extent that any provision of
any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the
provisions of this Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                               TERM LOAN FACILITY

         SECTION 4.1 Term Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to make a Term Loan to the Borrower on
the Closing Date. The Term Loan shall be funded by each Lender in a principal
amount equal to such Lender's Term Loan Percentage of the aggregate principal
amount of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date, which aggregate principal
amount shall equal the total Term Loan Commitment as of the Closing Date.

         SECTION 4.2 Procedure for Advance of Term Loan. The Borrower shall give
the Administrative Agent an irrevocable Notice of Borrowing prior to 1:00 p.m.
(Charlotte time) on the Closing Date requesting that the Lenders make the Term
Loan as a Base Rate Loan on such date. Upon receipt of such Notice of Borrowing
from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
thereof. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Charlotte time) on the Closing Date, each
Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Borrower, at the office of the Administrative Agent in immediately available
funds, the amount of such Term Loan to be made by such Lender on such borrowing
date. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to
disburse the proceeds of the Term Loan in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to such Person or Persons as may be designated by the Borrower.

         SECTION 4.3 Repayment of Term Loan. The Borrower shall repay the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in consecutive quarterly
installments on the last Business Day of each of April, July, October and
January commencing April 30, 2003 as set forth below, except as the amount of
individual installments may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.4 hereof:

If not sooner paid, the Term Loan shall be paid in full, together with accrued
interest thereon, on the Term Loan Maturity Date.


         SECTION 4.4 Prepayments of Term Loan.

         (a) Optional Prepayment of Term Loan. The Borrower shall have the right

disposition or series of related sales or other dispositions of assets by the
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries other than sales or other

                  (vi) Excess Cash Flow. No later than one hundred (100) days

                  (vii) Notice; Manner of Payment. Upon the occurrence of any
event triggering the prepayment requirement under Sections 4.4(b)(i) through and
including 4.4(b)(vi), the Borrower shall promptly deliver a Notice of Prepayment
to the Administrative Agent and upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders. Each prepayment under this Section
4.4(b) shall be applied as follows: first, to reduce in inverse order of
maturity the remaining scheduled principal installments of the Term Loans and
(ii) second, to the extent of any excess, to reduce permanently the Revolving
Credit Commitment, pursuant to Section 2.6(b).

         Amounts repaid under the Term Loans pursuant to Section 4.3 or prepaid
under the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 4.4 may not be reborrowed and will
constitute a permanent reduction in such Term Loan Commitment. Each prepayment
shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9
hereof.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary, any Term
Loan Lender shall have the right to refuse its pro rata share (based on Term
Loan Percentage) of any such mandatory prepayment at which time the remaining
amount shall be applied first, to temporarily reduce the Revolving Credit Loans,
and then, to the extent of any remaining funds, the Borrower may elect to (a)
prepay the outstanding Term Loans in the manner set forth in this Section 4.4
regardless of the election of the Term Loan Lender or (b) retain such excess
amount. No prepayment or repayment pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall affect any

         SECTION 4.5 Term Notes. Except as otherwise provided in Section
14.10(a) - (e), each Lender's Term Loan and the obligation of the Borrower to
repay such Term Loan shall be evidenced by a separate Term Note executed by the
Borrower payable to the order of such Lender.

                             GENERAL LOAN PROVISIONS

         SECTION 5.1 Interest.

         (a) Interest Rate Options. Subject to the provisions of this Section
5.1, at the election of the Borrower, (i) Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans
shall bear interest at (A) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin as set forth
in Section 5.1(c) or (B) the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin as set forth
in Section 5.1(c) (provided that the LIBOR Rate shall not be available until
three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date) and (ii) any Swingline Loans
shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The Borrower
shall select the rate of interest and Interest Period, if any, applicable to any
Loan at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given pursuant to Section 2.3 or
Section 4.2, as applicable, or at the time a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
is given pursuant to Section 5.2. Any Loan or any portion thereof as to which
the Borrower has not duly specified an interest rate as provided herein shall be
deemed a Base Rate Loan.

         (b) Interest Periods. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, the
Borrower, by giving notice at the times described in Section 5.1(a), shall elect
an interest period (each, an "Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan,
which Interest Period shall be a period of one (1), two (2), three (3) or six
(6) months with respect to each LIBOR Rate Loan; provided that:

                  (i) the Interest Period shall commence on the date of advance
of or conversion to any LIBOR Rate Loan and, in the case of immediately
successive Interest Periods, each successive Interest Period shall commence on
the date on which the immediately preceding Interest Period expires;

                  (ii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
succeeding Business Day; provided, that if any Interest Period with respect to a
LIBOR Rate Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but
is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
such Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day;

                  (iii) any Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Rate Loan
that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which
there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of
such Interest Period) shall end on the last Business Day of the relevant
calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;

                  (iv) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable, and the
Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to select Interest Periods which will
permit the Borrower to make mandatory reductions of the Revolving Credit
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and the quarterly principal installment
payments pursuant to Section 4.3 without payment of any amounts pursuant to
Section 5.9; and

                  (v) there shall be no more than eight (8) Interest
Periods in effect at any time.

                                       35

         (c) Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin provided for in Section
5.1(a) with respect to any Loan (the "Applicable Margin") shall be based upon
the table set forth below and shall be determined and adjusted quarterly on the
date (each a "Calculation Date") ten (10) Business Days after the date by which
the Borrower is required to provide an Officer's Compliance Certificate for the
most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower; provided that (a) the
initial Applicable Margin shall be based on Pricing Level II (as shown below)
and shall remain at Pricing Level II until the first Calculation Date occurring
after the Closing Date and, thereafter the Pricing Level shall be determined by
reference to the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended
fiscal quarter of the Borrower preceding the applicable Calculation Date, and
(b) if the Borrower fails to provide the Officer's Compliance Certificate as
required by Section 8.2 for the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the
Borrower preceding the applicable Calculation Date, the Applicable Margin from
such Calculation Date shall be based on Pricing Level I (as shown below) until
such time as an appropriate Officer's Compliance Certificate is provided, at
which time the Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the Leverage
Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the
Borrower preceding such Calculation Date. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, the Applicable Margin shall be effective from one Calculation Date
until the next Calculation Date. Any adjustment in the Applicable Margin shall
be applicable to all Extensions of Credit then existing or subsequently made or
issued.

         (d) Default Rate. Subject to Section 12.3, at the discretion of the
Administrative Agent or as directed by the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) the Borrower shall no
longer have the option to request LIBOR Rate Loans or Swingline Loans, (ii) all
outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two
percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable to LIBOR Rate Loans until the
end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter at a rate equal to two
percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (iii)
all outstanding Base Rate Loans and other Obligations arising hereunder or under
any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two
percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans or such
other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Interest
shall continue to accrue on the Notes after the filing by or against the
Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any act or
law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief, whether state, federal or
foreign.

                                       36
<PAGE>

         (e) Interest Payment and Computation. Interest on each Base Rate Loan
shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
commencing March 31, 2003; and interest on each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be payable
on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and if such Interest
Period extends over three (3) months, at the end of each three (3) month
interval during such Interest Period. Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans and all fees
payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and assessed
for the actual number of days elapsed and interest on Base Rate Loans shall be
computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year and assessed for the actual number
of days elapsed.

         (f) Maximum Rate. In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the
aggregate of all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under any of the Notes
charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to any
of the Notes exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law which
a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable hereto. In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders
have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable
rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum
rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall at the Administrative
Agent's option (i) promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the
Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or (ii) apply such excess to the
principal balance of the Obligations on a pro rata basis. It is the intent
hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or
indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be
paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.

         SECTION 5.2 Notice and Manner of Conversion or Continuation of Loans.
Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then
continuing, the Borrower shall have the option to (a) convert at any time
following the third Business Day after the Closing Date all or any portion of
any outstanding Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) in a principal
amount equal to $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
into one or more LIBOR Rate Loans and (b) upon the expiration of any Interest
Period, (i) convert all or any part of its outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans in a
principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess
thereof into Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or (ii) continue such
LIBOR Rate Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans. Whenever the Borrower desires to convert
or continue Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent irrevocable prior written notice in the form attached as Exhibit E (a
"Notice of Conversion/Continuation") not later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte time)
three (3) Business Days before the day on which a proposed conversion or
continuation of such Loan is to be effective specifying (A) the Loans to be
converted or continued, and, in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan to be converted
or continued, the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (B) the effective
date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the
principal amount of such Loans to be converted or continued, and (D) the
Interest Period to be applicable to such converted or continued LIBOR Rate Loan.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of such Notice of
Conversion/Continuation.

                                       37
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.3 Fees.

         (a) Commitment Fee. Commencing on the Closing Date, the Borrower shall
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, a
non-refundable commitment fee at a rate per annum equal to the applicable rate
based upon the table set forth below (the "Commitment Fee Rate") on the average
daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that the
amount of outstanding Swingline Loans shall not be considered usage of the
Revolving Credit Commitment for the purpose of calculating such commitment fee.
The commitment fee shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each
calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement commencing March 31, 2003,
and on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Such commitment fee shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with the Lenders' respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages. The
Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined and adjusted quarterly on each
Calculation Date; provided, however, that (a) the initial Commitment Fee Rate
shall be based on Pricing Level II (as shown below) and shall remain at Pricing
Level II until the first Calculation Date occurring after the Closing Date and
thereafter the Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the Leverage
Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the
Borrower preceding the applicable Calculation Date, and (b) if the Borrower
fails to provide the Officer's Compliance Certificate as required by Section 8.2
for the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower preceding the
applicable Calculation Date, the Commitment Fee Rate from such Calculation Date
shall be based on Pricing Level I (as shown below) until such time as an
appropriate Officer's Compliance Certificate is provided, at which time the
Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio as of the
last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower preceding
such Calculation Date. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Commitment Fee Rate shall be effective from one Calculation Date until the next
Calculation Date.

--------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

         (b) Administrative Agent's and Other Fees. In order to compensate the
Administrative Agent for structuring and syndicating the Loans and for its
obligations hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, the fees set forth in the separate fee letter agreement
executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent dated December 30, 2002.

         SECTION 5.4 Manner of Payment. Each payment by the Borrower on account
of the principal of or interest on the Loans or of any fee, commission or other
amounts (including the Reimbursement Obligation) payable to the Lenders under
this Agreement or any Note shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte
time) on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office for the account of the
Lenders (other than as set forth below) pro rata in accordance with their
respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages or Term Loan Percentages, as
applicable, (except as specified below), in Dollars, in immediately available
funds and shall be made without any set-off, counterclaim or deduction
whatsoever. Any payment received after such time but before 3:00 p.m. (Charlotte
time) on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of


                                       38
<PAGE>

Section 12.1, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on
the next succeeding Business Day. Any payment received after 3:00 p.m.
(Charlotte time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day for all purposes. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of each
such payment, the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender at its
address for notices set forth herein its pro rata share of such payment in
accordance with such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or Term
Loan Percentage, as applicable, (except as specified below) and shall wire
advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender. Each payment to the
Administrative Agent of the L/C Participants' commissions shall be made in like
manner, but for the account of the L/C Participants. Each payment to the
Administrative Agent of Administrative Agent's fees or expenses shall be made
for the account of the Administrative Agent and any amount payable to any Lender
under Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 or 14.2 shall be paid to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the applicable Lender. Subject to Section 5.1(b)(ii) if
any payment under this Agreement or any Note shall be specified to be made upon
a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day
which is a Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in computing any interest if payable along with such payment.

         SECTION 5.5 Crediting of Payments and Proceeds. In the event that the
Borrower shall fail to pay any of the Obligations when due and the Obligations
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 12.2, all payments received by the
Lenders upon the Notes and the other Obligations and all net proceeds from the
enforcement of the Obligations shall be applied: (a) first to all expenses then
due and payable by the Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
(b) then to all indemnity obligations then due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) then to all Administrative
Agent's and Issuing Lender's fees then due and payable by the Borrower hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents, (d) then to all commitment and other fees
and commissions then due and payable by the Borrower hereunder, (e) then to
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest on the
Reimbursement Obligation (pro rata in accordance with all such amounts due), (f)
then to the principal amount of the Notes and the Reimbursement Obligation and
any payments (including any termination payments and any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon) due in respect of any Hedging Agreement with any Lender or the
Administrative Agent (which such Hedging Agreement is permitted hereunder) (pro
rata in accordance with all such amounts due) and (g) then to the cash
collateral account described in Section 12.2(b) to the extent of any L/C
Obligations then outstanding, in that order.

         SECTION 5.6 Adjustments. If any Lender (a "Benefited Lender") shall at
any time receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or
interest thereon, or if any Lender shall at any time receive any collateral in
respect to the Obligations owing to it (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by
set-off or otherwise) (other than pursuant to Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 or
14.2) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received
by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the similar Obligations owing to such
other Lender, or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash
from the other Lenders such portion of each such other Lender's Extensions of
Credit, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited
Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower
agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Extensions
of Credit may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation,
rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were
the direct holder of such portion.

                                       39
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.7 Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of
Credit; Assumption by the Administrative Agent. The obligations of the Lenders
under this Agreement to make the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of
Credit are several and are not joint or joint and several. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to a
proposed borrowing date that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of the amount to be borrowed
on such date (which notice shall not release such Lender of its obligations
hereunder), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the proposed borrowing date in
accordance with Sections 2.3(b) and 4.2, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative
Agent on a date after such borrowing date, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent on demand an amount, until paid, equal to the product of
(a) the amount not made available by such Lender in accordance with the terms
hereof, times (b) the daily average Federal Funds Rate during such period as
determined by the Administrative Agent, times (c) a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days that elapse from and including such borrowing date
to the date on which such amount not made available by such Lender in accordance
with the terms hereof shall have become immediately available to the
Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 5.7
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage or Term Loan Percentage, as applicable, of such borrowing
is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three
(3) Business Days after such borrowing date, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such amount made available by the Administrative Agent with
interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder,
on demand, from the Borrower. The failure of any Lender to make available its
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or Term Loan Percentage, as applicable,
of any Loan requested by the Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender
of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage or Term Loan Percentage, as applicable, of such Loan available on the
borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or Term Loan
Percentage, as applicable, of such Loan available on the borrowing date.
Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, any Lender that fails
to make available its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or Term Loan
Percentage, as applicable, shall not (a) have any voting or consent rights under
or with respect to any Loan Document or (b) constitute a "Lender" (or be
included in the calculation of Required Lenders hereunder) for any voting or
consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document.

         SECTION 5.8 Changed Circumstances.

                                       40
<PAGE>

         (a) Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. If with respect to
any Interest Period the Administrative Agent or any Lender (after consultation
with the Administrative Agent) shall determine that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets generally, deposits in
eurodollars, in the applicable amounts are not being quoted via the Dow Jones
Market Screen 3750 or offered to the Administrative Agent or such Lender for
such Interest Period or that the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period
with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lender of funding such Loan, then the Administrative
Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer
exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of
the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan
shall be suspended, and the Borrower shall repay in full (or cause to be repaid
in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan
together with accrued interest thereon, on the last day of the then current
Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan or convert the then
outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as
of the last day of such Interest Period.

         (b) Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. If, after the date hereof,
the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall
make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their
respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or
maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice
to the Borrower and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Administrative
Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the
obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of the
Borrower to convert any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be
suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans hereunder,
and (ii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR
Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a
LIBOR Rate Loan, the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan shall immediately be converted
to a Base Rate Loan for the remainder of such Interest Period.

         (c) Increased Costs. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or
any change in, any Applicable Law, or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the
Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of such Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency:

                  (i) shall (except as provided in Section 5.11(e)) subject any
of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to any Note, Letter of Credit or Application or shall
change the basis of taxation of payments to any of the Lenders (or any of their
respective Lending Offices) of the principal of or interest on any Note, Letter
of Credit or Application or any other amounts due under this Agreement in
respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of franchise tax or tax on the
overall net income of any of the Lenders or any of their respective Lending
Offices imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or is or
should be qualified to do business or such Lending Office is located); provided
that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any amounts pursuant to this
Section 5.8(c)(i) to the extent that such amounts are duplicative of any amounts
paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.11; or

                                       41
<PAGE>

                  (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System), special deposit, insurance or capital or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) or
shall impose on any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices)
or the foreign exchange and interbank markets any other condition affecting any
Note; and the result of any of the foregoing events described in clause (i) or
(ii) above is to increase the costs to any of the Lenders of maintaining any
LIBOR Rate Loan or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce
the yield or amount of any sum received or receivable by any of the Lenders
under this Agreement or under the Notes in respect of a LIBOR Rate Loan or
Letter of Credit or Application, then such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower of such fact and demand compensation therefor and, within fifteen (15)
days after such notice by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
Lenders for such increased cost or reduction. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge which will
entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 5.8(c); provided,
that the Administrative Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Lenders
or the Borrower in the event it fails to do so. The amount of such compensation
shall be determined, in the applicable Lender's sole discretion, based upon the
assumption that such Lender funded its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or
Term Loan Percentage, as applicable, of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London
interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which
such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender
setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for
manifest error.

         SECTION 5.9 Indemnity. The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the
Lenders against any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to each
Lender's obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to
effect, fund or maintain any Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the
Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection
with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow,
continue or convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or
conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor. The amount of such loss or expense shall be
determined, in the applicable Lender's sole discretion, based upon the
assumption that such Lender funded its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or
Term Loan Percentage, as applicable, of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London
interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which
such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender
setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for
manifest error.

                                       42
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.10 Capital Requirements. If either (a) the introduction of,
or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any Applicable Law or (b)
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or comparable
agency or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law),
has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of,
or has affected or would affect the amount of capital required to be maintained
by, any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of,
or with reference to the Commitments and other commitments of this type, below
the rate which such Lender or such other corporation could have achieved but for
such introduction, change or compliance, then within five (5) Business Days
after written demand by any such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
from time to time as specified by such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender or other corporation for such reduction. A certificate as
to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such
Lender, shall, in the absence of manifest error, be presumed to be correct and
binding for all purposes.

         SECTION 5.11 Taxes.

         (a) Payments Free and Clear. Except as otherwise provided in Section
5.11(e), any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes or
the Letters of Credit shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholding, and all liabilities with respect thereto excluding, (i) in the case
of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, income and franchise taxes imposed
by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or is or should be qualified to do
business or any political subdivision thereof and (ii) in the case of each
Lender, income and franchise taxes imposed by the jurisdiction of such Lender's
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or
under any Note or in respect of any Letter of Credit to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, (A) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.11(e), the
sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.11) such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the
amount such party would have received had no such deductions or withholdings
been made, (B) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings, (C) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or
other authority in accordance with Applicable Law, and (D) the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent and such Lender evidence of such payment to
the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in the manner
provided in Section 5.11(d).

         (b) Stamp and Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any
present or future stamp, registration, recordation or documentary taxes or any
other similar fees or charges or excise or property taxes, levies of the United
States or any state or political subdivision thereof or any applicable foreign
jurisdiction which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the
Loans, the Letters of Credit or the other Loan Documents, or the perfection of
any rights or security interest in respect thereof (hereinafter referred to as
"Other Taxes").

                                       43
<PAGE>

         (c) Indemnity. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.11(e), the
Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full
amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes and
Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
5.11) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and
any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted. Such indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days
from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor.

         (d) Evidence of Payment. Within thirty (30) days after the date of any
payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender, at its address referred to in
Section 14.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Delivery of Tax Forms. To the extent required by Applicable Law to
reduce or eliminate withholding or payment of taxes, each Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, with a copy to the
Administrative Agent, on the Closing Date or concurrently with the delivery of
the relevant Assignment and Acceptance, as applicable, (i) two United States
Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, Forms W-8ECI or Forms W-8BEN, as applicable
(or successor forms) properly completed and certifying in each case that such
Lender is entitled to a complete exemption from withholding or deduction for or
on account of any United States federal income taxes, and (ii) an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case
may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding taxes.
Each such Lender further agrees to deliver to the Borrower, with a copy to the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, two Form W-9, Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or
successor applicable forms or manner of certification, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously
delivered by it to the Borrower, certifying in the case of a Form W-9, Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor forms) that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes (unless in any such case an event (including,
without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior
to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders
such forms inapplicable or the exemption to which such forms relate unavailable
and such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is
not entitled to receive payments without deduction or withholding of United
States federal income taxes) and, in the case of a Form W-9, Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.
Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, the Borrower
shall not be required to pay additional amounts to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent under Section 5.11 or Section 5.8(c), (i) if such Lender or
the Administrative Agent fails to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.11(e), other than to the extent that such failure is due to a change in law
occurring after the date on which such Lender or the Administrative Agent became
a party to this Agreement or (ii) that are the result of such Lender's or the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as applicable.

                                       44
<PAGE>

         (f) Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower
contained in this Section 5.11 shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.

         SECTION 5.12 Replacement of Lenders.

         (a) Request for Compensation. If any Lender requests compensation
pursuant to Section 5.8 or Section 5.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay
any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.11, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (A) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.8, Section 5.10 or Section 5.11, as the case may
be, in the future and (B) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost
or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.

         (b) Lender Replacement. If any Lender requests compensation pursuant to
Section 5.8 or Section 5.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 5.11, then the Borrower may, upon notice to such
Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in Section 14.10), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided
that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (B) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, breakage costs
and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts) and (C) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation pursuant to Section 5.8 or Section 5.10,
after giving effect to any such assignment, no claim for compensation under
Section 5.8 or Section 5.10 would reasonably be expected to be asserted by the
replacement Lender. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment
and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

         (c) Effect of Replacement. To the extent that any Lender (a "Replaced
Lender") is required to assign all of its interests, rights and obligations
under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee (a "Replacement Lender") pursuant
to this Section 5.12, upon the execution of all applicable assignment documents
and the satisfaction of all other conditions set forth herein, the Replacement
Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to be
a Lender hereunder, except with respect to the indemnification provisions under
this Agreement, which provisions shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.

Borrower shall not be obligated to make any payment to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender pursuant to Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 or 5.11 in respect of any
amounts or costs accruing in or allocable to any period prior to the 120th day
preceding written demand by such Lender or the Administrative Agent upon the
Borrower for payment therefor (unless such amounts or costs prior to such 120
day period result from the retroactive effect of any of the events described in
Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 or 5.11 giving rise to such written demand and which
occurred during such 120 day period).

         SECTION 5.14 Security. The Obligations of the Borrower and the
Guarantors shall be secured as provided in the Security Documents (including,
without limitation, the Mortgages, if applicable, under the terms of Section
9.13).

Etc. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Loan Documents to which each such Person is a party, in
accordance with their respective terms, the Extensions of Credit hereunder and

time, the giving of notice or otherwise, (i) require any Governmental Approval
or violate any Applicable Law relating to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default

the extent that it could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, no event has occurred which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or
both would permit, the revocation or termination of any such rights, and neither
the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary thereof is liable to any Person for
infringement under Applicable Law with respect to any such rights as a result of
its business operations.

         (i) ERISA.

                  (i) As of the Closing Date, neither the Borrower nor any ERISA
Affiliate maintains or contributes to, or has any obligation under, any Employee
Benefit Plans other than those identified on Schedule 7.1(i);

                  (ii) The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate is in material
compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the regulations and
published interpretations thereunder with respect to all Employee Benefit Plans
except for any required amendments for which the remedial amendment period as
defined in Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired and except where a
failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service
to be so qualified, and each trust related to such plan has been determined to
be exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code except for such plans that have not
yet received determination letters but for which the remedial amendment period
for submitting a determination letter has not yet expired. No liability has been
incurred by the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate which remains unsatisfied for
any taxes or penalties with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or any
Multiemployer Plan except for a liability that could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (iii) As of the Closing Date, no Pension Plan has been
terminated, nor has any accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section

ERISA or the terms of any Pension Plan prior to the due dates of such
contributions under Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, in each
case where such event could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; nor has there been any event requiring any disclosure under Section
4041(c)(3)(C) or 4063(a) of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan;

                  (iv) Except where the failure of any of the following
representations to be correct in all material respects could not reasonably be

Affiliate has: (A) engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in
Section 406 of the ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, (B) incurred any liability
to the PBGC which remains outstanding other than the payment of premiums and

                                       53
<PAGE>

                  (v) No Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur; and

                  (vi) Except where the failure of any of the following
representations to be correct could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, no proceeding, claim (other than a benefits claim in
the ordinary course of business), lawsuit and/or investigation is existing or,
to the best knowledge of the Borrower after due inquiry, threatened concerning
or involving any (A) employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA) currently maintained or contributed to by the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate, (B) Pension Plan or (C) Multiemployer Plan.

         (j) Margin Stock. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is
engaged principally or as one of its activities in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" (as each
such term is defined or used, directly or indirectly, in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). No part of the proceeds of
any of the Loans or Letters of Credit will be used for purchasing or carrying
margin stock or for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent
with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of such Board of Governors.

         (k) Government Regulation. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
thereof is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company" (as each such term is defined or used in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended) and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is, or
after giving effect to any Extension of Credit will be, subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or the Interstate Commerce
Act, each as amended, or any other Applicable Law which limits its ability to
incur or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (l) Material Contracts. Schedule 7.1(l) sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all Material Contracts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the Closing Date not listed on any other Schedule hereto; other
than as set forth in Schedule 7.1(l), each such Material Contract is, and after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents will be, in full force and effect in accordance with the terms
thereof. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have delivered to the Administrative
Agent a true and complete copy of each written Material Contract required to be
listed on Schedule 7.1(l) or any other Schedule hereto. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary (nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any other party thereto)
is in breach of or in default under any Material Contract in any material
respect.

         (m) Employee Relations. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has a
stable work force in place and is not, as of the Closing Date, party to any
collective bargaining agreement nor has any labor union been recognized as the
representative of its employees. The Borrower knows of no pending, threatened or
contemplated strikes, work stoppage or other collective labor disputes involving
its employees or those of its Subsidiaries.

         (n) Burdensome Provisions. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
thereof is a party to any indenture, agreement, lease or other instrument, or
subject to any corporate or partnership restriction, Governmental Approval or
Applicable Law which is so unusual or burdensome as in the foreseeable future
could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and


                                       54
<PAGE>

its Subsidiaries do not presently anticipate that future expenditures needed to
meet the provisions of any statutes, orders, rules or regulations of a
Governmental Authority will be so burdensome as to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Other than the Indenture, no Subsidiary is party to any agreement or
instrument or otherwise subject to any restriction or encumbrance that restricts
or limits its ability to make dividend payments or other distributions in
respect of its capital stock to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or to transfer
any of its assets or properties to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary in each
case other than existing under or by reason of the Loan Documents or Applicable
Law.

         (o) Financial Statements. The audited Consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of September 29, 2002 and the related audited
statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the Fiscal Year
then ended, copies of which have been furnished to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender, are complete and correct and fairly present on a Consolidated basis
the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the results of the operations and changes of
financial position for the periods then ended (other than customary year-end
adjustments for unaudited financial statements). All such financial statements,
including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no Debt, obligation
or other unusual forward or long-term commitment which is not fairly reflected
in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto other than Debt
incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to the date thereof and
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent.

         (p) No Material Adverse Change. Except as publicly disclosed by the
Borrower prior to the Closing Date, since September 29, 2002, there has been no
material adverse change in the properties, business, operations, prospects, or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and no
event has occurred or condition arisen that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         (q) Solvency. As of the Closing Date and after giving effect to each
Extension of Credit made hereunder, the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
will be Solvent.

         (r) Titles to Properties. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
such title to the real property owned or leased by it as is necessary or
desirable to the conduct of its business and valid and legal title to all of its
personal property and assets, including, but not limited to, those reflected on
the balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to
Section 7.1(o), except those which have been disposed of by the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries subsequent to such date which dispositions have been in the
ordinary course of business or as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder.

         (s) Liens. None of the properties and assets of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof is subject to any Lien, except Liens permitted pursuant to
Section 11.2. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof has signed any
such financing statement or any security agreement authorizing any secured party
thereunder to file any such financing statement with respect to any Lien
remaining effective as of the Closing Date, except to perfect those Liens
permitted by Section 11.2.

                                       55
<PAGE>

         (t) Debt and Guaranty Obligations. Schedule 7.1(t) is a complete and
correct listing of all Debt and Guaranty Obligations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in excess of $2,500,000. The Borrower and
its Subsidiaries have performed and are in compliance in all material respects
with all of the terms of such Debt and Guaranty Obligations and all instruments
and agreements relating thereto, and no default or event of default, or event or
condition which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a
default or event of default on the part of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries exists with respect to any such Debt or Guaranty Obligation.

         (u) Litigation. Except for matters existing on the Closing Date and set
forth on Schedule 7.1(u), there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or in any other way
relating adversely to or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or any
of their respective properties in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind
or before or by any Governmental Authority except for any such actions, suits or
proceedings which individually and in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (v) Absence of Defaults. No event has occurred or is continuing which
constitutes a Default or an Event of Default, or which constitutes, or which
with the passage of time or giving of notice or both would constitute, a default
or event of default by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof under any Material
Contract or judgment, decree or order to which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties may be bound or which would require the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries to make any payment thereunder prior to the scheduled maturity date
therefor.

         (w) Senior Debt Status. The Obligations of the Borrower and each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under this Agreement and each of the other Loan
Documents rank and shall continue to rank senior in priority of payment to all
Subordinated Debt of each such Person and is designated as "Senior Indebtedness"
under all instruments and documents relating to all Subordinated Debt of such
Person.

         (x) Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written information,
reports and other papers and data produced by or on behalf of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary thereof (other than financial projections, which shall be subject
to the standard set forth in Section 8.1(c)) and furnished to the Lenders were,
at the time the same were so furnished, complete and correct to the extent
necessary to give the recipient a true and accurate knowledge of the subject
matter in all material respects. No document furnished or written statement made
to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
thereof in connection with the negotiation, preparation or execution of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents contains or will contain any untrue
statement of a fact material to the creditworthiness of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or omits or will omit to state a fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading. The Borrower is not aware of
any facts which it has not disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent
having a Material Adverse Effect, or insofar as the Borrower can now foresee,
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

made in or in connection with any amendment thereto) shall constitute

and warranties made under this Agreement shall be made or deemed to be made at
and as of the Closing Date (except those that are expressly made as of a
specific date), shall survive the Closing Date and shall not be waived by the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Lenders or any borrowing hereunder.

to request borrowings or Letters of Credit thereunder; provided, that upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 12.1(j) or (k), the
Credit Facility shall be automatically terminated and all Obligations (other
than Hedging Obligations) shall automatically become due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
expressly waived, anything in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document to
the contrary notwithstanding.

         (b) Letters of Credit. With respect to all Letters of Credit with
respect to which any amount shall remain undrawn and unexpired at the time of an
acceleration pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall at such
time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an


                                       77
<PAGE>

amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters
of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of
Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay the
other Obligations on a pro rata basis. After all such Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been fully drawn upon, the Reimbursement Obligation shall have
been satisfied and all other Obligations shall have been paid in full, the
balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the
Borrower.

         (c) Rights of Collection. Exercise on behalf of the Lenders all of its
other rights and remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and
Applicable Law, in order to satisfy all of the Borrower's Obligations.

         SECTION 12.3 Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Non-Waiver; etc. The
enumeration of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders set forth in this Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive and the
exercise by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of any right or remedy
shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies, all of which
shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to any other right or remedy given
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or that may now or hereafter exist
at law or in equity or by suit or otherwise. No delay or failure to take action
on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right,
power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default. No course of
dealing between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or their
respective agents or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge
any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or to
constitute a waiver of any Event of Default.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 13.1 Appointment. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
designates and appoints Wachovia as Administrative Agent of such Lender under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents for the term hereof and each such
Lender irrevocably authorizes Wachovia, as Administrative Agent for such Lender,
to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement
and such other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement or such other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and
therein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or otherwise exist
against the Administrative Agent. Any reference to the Administrative Agent in
this Article XIII shall be deemed to refer to the Administrative Agent solely in
its capacity as Administrative Agent and not in its capacity as a Lender.

                                       78
<PAGE>

         SECTION 13.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute
any of its respective duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by the Administrative Agent with reasonable care.

         SECTION 13.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact,
Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or
omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents (except for actions occasioned directly by
its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b)
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with,
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents or for any failure of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 13.4 Reliance by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such
Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 14.10. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, when expressly
required hereby or by the relevant other Loan Documents, all the Lenders) as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
and the Notes in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, when
expressly required hereby, all the Lenders), and such request and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders
and all future holders of the Notes.

                                       79
<PAGE>

         SECTION 13.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default unless it has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or,
when expressly required hereby, all the Lenders); provided that unless and until
the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders, except to the extent that
other provisions of this Agreement expressly require that any such action be
taken or not be taken only with the consent and authorization or the request of
the Lenders or Required Lenders, as applicable.

         SECTION 13.6 Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent and Other
Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact, Subsidiaries or Affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken,
including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and made its own decision
to make its Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and
enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself
as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder or by the other Loan Documents, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Administrative
Agent or any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact, Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

         SECTION 13.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such and (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
ratably according to the respective amounts of their Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentages or Term Loan Percentages, as applicable, from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any
time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Notes or any Reimbursement Obligation) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any documents, reports or other
information provided to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or contemplated


                                       80
<PAGE>

by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable
for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting directly from the Administrative Agent's bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 13.7 shall survive the
payment of the Notes, any Reimbursement Obligation and all other amounts payable
hereunder and the termination of this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.8 The Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates may make
loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative
Agent hereunder. With respect to any Loans made or renewed by it and any Note
issued to it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued by it or
participated in by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms
"Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity.

         SECTION 13.9 Resignation of the Administrative Agent; Successor
Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent, which successor shall have minimum capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty
(30) days after the Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then
the Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which successor shall have minimum capital and surplus of
at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 13.9 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 13.10 Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent. The
Documentation Agent and the Syndication Agent, in their respective capacities as
documentation and syndication agents, shall have no duties or responsibilities
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 14.1 Notices.

         (a) Method of Communication. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing (for
purposes hereof, the term "writing" shall include information in electronic
format such as electronic mail and internet web pages), or by telephone
subsequently confirmed in writing. Any notice shall be effective if delivered by
hand delivery or sent via electronic mail, posting on an internet web page,
telecopy, recognized overnight courier service or certified mail, return receipt
requested, and shall be presumed to be received by a party hereto (i) on the
date of delivery if delivered by hand or sent by electronic mail, posting on an
internet web page, telecopy, (ii) on the next Business Day if sent by recognized
overnight courier service and (iii) on the third Business Day following the date
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. A telephonic notice to the
Administrative Agent as understood by the Administrative Agent will be deemed to
be the controlling and proper notice in the event of a discrepancy with or
failure to receive a confirming written notice.

         (b) Addresses for Notices.  Notices to any party shall be sent to
it at the following  addresses,  or any other address as to which all the other

                                            Register


         (c) Administrative Agent's Office. The Administrative Agent hereby
designates its office located at the address set forth above, or any subsequent
office which shall have been specified for such purpose by written notice to the
Borrower and Lenders, as the Administrative Agent's Office referred to herein,
to which payments due are to be made and at which Loans will be disbursed and
Letters of Credit issued.

         SECTION 14.2 Expenses; Indemnity. The Borrower will (a) pay all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all costs of electronic
or internet distribution of any information hereunder) of the Administrative
Agent in connection with (i) the preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and each other Loan Document, whenever the same shall be executed and
delivered, including, without limitation, all out-of-pocket syndication and due
diligence expenses and reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent and (ii) the preparation, execution and delivery of any

Lender actually incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement
of any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and Lenders under the
Credit Facility, including, without limitation, in connection with any workout,
restructuring, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, creating and perfecting
Liens in favor of Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any

limitation, reasonable attorney's and consultant's fees, except to the extent

                                       83
<PAGE>

         SECTION 14.3 Set-off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights,
upon and after the occurrence of any Event of Default and during the continuance
thereof, the Lenders and any assignee or participant of a Lender in accordance
with Section 14.10 are hereby authorized by the Borrower at any time or from
time to time, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such
notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, including, but not
limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured
or unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the
Lenders, or any such assignee or participant to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations irrespective of
whether or not (a) the Lenders shall have made any demand under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have
declared any or all of the Obligations to be due and payable as permitted by
Section 12.2 and although such Obligations shall be contingent or unmatured.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, each Lender agrees to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such set-off and application.

         SECTION 14.4 Governing Law. This Agreement, the Notes and the other
Loan Documents, unless otherwise expressly set forth therein, shall be governed
by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
(including Section 5-1401 and Section 5-1402 of the General Obligations Law of
the State of New York), without reference to the conflicts of law principles
thereof.

         SECTION 14.5      Jurisdiction and Venue.

         (a) Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably consents to the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Mecklenburg
County, North Carolina and New York, New York (and any courts from which an
appeal from any of such courts must or may be taken), in any action, claim or
other proceeding arising out of any dispute in connection with this Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents, any rights or obligations hereunder or
thereunder, or the performance of such rights and obligations. The Borrower
hereby irrevocably consents to the service of a summons and complaint and other
process in any action, claim or proceeding brought by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan
Documents, any rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder, or the performance
of such rights and obligations, on behalf of itself or its property, in the
manner specified in Section 14.1. Nothing in this Section 14.5 shall affect the
right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Applicable Law or affect the right of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring any action or proceeding against the
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any other jurisdictions.

                                       84
<PAGE>

         (b) Venue. The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection it may
have now or in the future to the laying of venue in the aforesaid jurisdictions
in any action, claim or other proceeding arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder or thereunder. The Borrower irrevocably waives, in connection
with such action, claim or proceeding, any plea or claim that the action, claim
or other proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         SECTION 14.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH
LENDER AND THE BORROWER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, CLAIM OR OTHER
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE, JUDICIAL PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, ANY
RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS.

         SECTION 14.7 Reversal of Payments. To the extent the Borrower makes a
payment or payments to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the
Lenders or the Administrative Agent receives any payment or proceeds of the
collateral which payments or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or
required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or proceeds repaid, the Obligations or part thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Administrative
Agent.

         SECTION 14.8 Injunctive Relief; Punitive Damages.

         (a) The Borrower recognizes that, in the event the Borrower fails to
perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lenders.
Therefore, the Borrower agrees that the Lenders, at the Lenders' option, shall
be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case
without the necessity of proving actual damages.

         (b) The Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower (on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby agree that no such Person shall have a
remedy of punitive or exemplary damages against any other party to a Loan
Document and each such Person hereby waives any right or claim to punitive or
exemplary damages that they may now have or may arise in the future in
connection with any Dispute, whether such Dispute is resolved through
arbitration or judicially.

         SECTION 14.9 Accounting Matters. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in
accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time, provided that, if the
Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an
amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change
occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the

Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof


                                       85

for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or
after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision
shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately
before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been
withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance therewith.

         SECTION 14.10 Successors and Assigns; Participations.

         (a) Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
all future holders of the Notes, and their respective successors and assigns,
except that the Borrower shall not assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
Lender.

         (b) Assignment by Lenders. Each Lender may, in accordance with
Applicable Law, sell or assign to any Lender, any Affiliate of a Lender or in
the case of the Term Loans, any Approved Fund, and, with the consent of the
Borrower (so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing) and the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consents shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, assign to one or more other Eligible
Assignees (any of the foregoing assignees or purchasers, a "Purchasing Lender")
all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of
the Extensions of Credit at the time owing to it and the Notes held by it);
provided that:

                  (i) each such  assignment  shall be of a  constant,  and
not a  varying,  percentage  of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement;

                  (ii) if less than all of the assigning Lender's Revolving
Credit Commitment or Term Loan Commitment, as applicable, is to be assigned, the
Commitment so assigned shall not be less than $5,000,000 with respect to the
Revolving Credit Facility and $1,000,000 (or otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower) with respect to the Term Loan Facility,
unless such sale or assignment is made to an existing Lender, to an Affiliate
thereof, or (with respect to any Term Loan) to an Approved Fund, in which case
no minimum amount shall apply;

                  (iii) the Purchasing Lender shall have delivered to the
Administrative Agent all United States Internal Revenue Service Forms required
pursuant to Section 5.11(e) and all of the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance substantially in the
form of Exhibit G attached hereto (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), together
with (to the extent requested by any Purchasing Lender) any Note or Notes
subject to such assignment;

                  (iv) no assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment, or
participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans shall be made without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, the
Issuing Lender and (so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing) the Borrower (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld);

                                       86
<PAGE>

                  (v) where consent of the Borrower to an assignment to a
Purchasing Lender is required hereunder (including consent to an assignment to
an Approved Fund), the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five
(5) Business Days after the date written notice thereof has been delivered by
the assigning Lender (through the Administrative Agent) unless such consent is
expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth (5th) Business Day;

                  (vi) such assignment shall not, without the consent of the
Borrower, require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to or qualify the Loans or the Notes
under the blue sky laws of any state; and

                  (vii) the assigning Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent an assignment fee of $3,500 upon the execution by such Lender of the
Assignment and Acceptance; provided that no such fee shall be payable upon any
assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate thereof; and provided further that, in
any case of contemporaneous assignments by a Lender (including a group of
affiliated Lenders that are funds managed by the same investment advisor) to a
single assignee or more than one fund managed by the same investment advisor
(which funds are not then Lenders hereunder), only a single $3,500 fee shall be
payable for all such contemporaneous assignments..

Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date
shall be at least five (5) Business Days after the execution thereof (unless
otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent), (A) the Purchasing Lender
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereby
and (B) the Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such assignment,
be released from its obligations under this Agreement.

         (c) Rights and Duties Upon Assignment. By executing and delivering an
Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Purchasing
Lender thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties
hereto as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance.

         (d) Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders and the amount of the Extensions of
Credit with respect to each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error,
and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and by any Lender solely to the extent of any entries applicable to such Lender
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e) Issuance of New Notes. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and a Purchasing Lender together with
any Note or Notes (if applicable) subject to such assignment and (if applicable)
the written consent to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is substantially in the form of
Exhibit G:

                                       87
<PAGE>

                  (i)      accept such Assignment and Acceptance;

                  (ii)     record the information contained therein in the
                           Register;

                  (iii)    give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and the
                           Borrower; and

                  (iv)     promptly deliver a copy of such Assignment and
                           Acceptance to the Borrower.

Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of notice, the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, in exchange for the surrendered
Note or Notes, if any, a new Note or Notes to the order of such Purchasing
Lender (to the extent requested thereby) in amounts equal to the Revolving
Credit Commitment and/or the Term Loan Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance and a new Note or Notes to the order of the assigning
Lender (to the extent requested thereby) in an amount equal to the Revolving
Credit Commitment and/or the Term Loan Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such
new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the
effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in
substantially the form of the assigned Notes delivered to the assigning Lender.
Each surrendered Note or Notes shall be canceled and returned to the Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender which has
not been issued a Note or Notes hereunder may at any time deliver a written
request for a Note or Notes to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of notice, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, a Note or Notes (as applicable) to the
order of such Lender in amounts equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment and/or
the Term Loan Commitment of such Lender. Upon receipt thereby, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver such Note or Notes to such Lender.

         (f) Participations. Each Lender may, without notice to or the consent
of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and in accordance with Applicable
Law, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (any such bank
or other entity, a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Extensions of Credit and the Notes held by it); provided that:

                  (i) each such participation shall be in an amount not less
than $5,000,000 with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and $1,000,000 (or
otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) with respect to
the Term Loan Facility;

                  (ii) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or its Term
Loan Commitment, as applicable) shall remain unchanged;

                  (iii) such  Lender  shall  remain  solely  responsible  to
the other  parties  hereto  for the performance of such obligations;

                                       88
<PAGE>

                  (iv) such  Lender  shall  remain the holder of the Notes
held by it for all  purposes of this Agreement;

                  (v) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement;

                  (vi) such Lender shall not permit such Participant the right
to approve any waivers, amendments or other modifications to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document other than waivers, amendments or modifications which
would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any Loan or Reimbursement
Obligation, extend the term or increase the amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitment and/or the Term Loan Commitment of such Lender, reduce the amount of
any fees to which such Participant is entitled, extend any scheduled payment
date for principal of any Loan or, except as expressly contemplated hereby or
thereby, release substantially all of the Collateral; and

                  (vii) any such disposition shall not, without the consent of
the Borrower, require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to apply to qualify the Loans or the Notes
under the blue sky law of any state.

The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 5.7, Section 5.8, Section 5.9, Section 5.10, Section 5.11 and Section
14.3 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 14.10; provided that a
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
5.7, Section 5.8, Section 5.9, Section 5.10, and Section 5.11 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent and such
Participant shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent all United States
Internal Revenue Service Forms required pursuant to Section 5.11(e).

         (g) Disclosure of Information; Confidentiality. The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall maintain as confidential, and shall cause their
Affiliates to maintain as confidential, all non-public information with respect
to the Borrower obtained pursuant to the Loan Documents (or any Hedging
Agreement with a Lender or the Administrative Agent) in accordance with their
customary procedures for handling confidential information; provided, that the
Administrative Agent may disclose information relating to this Agreement to Gold
Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to consist of
deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications and
provided further, that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may disclose any
such information to the extent such disclosure is (i) required by law or
requested or required pursuant to any legal process, (ii) requested by, or
required to be disclosed to, any rating agency, or regulatory or similar
authority (including, without limitation, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners) or (iii) used in any suit, action or proceeding for the purpose
of defending itself, reducing its liability or protecting any of its claims,
rights, remedies or interests under or in connection with the Loan Documents (or
any Hedging Agreement with a Lender or the Administrative Agent). Any Lender
may, in connection with any assignment, proposed assignment, participation or
proposed participation pursuant to this Section 14.10, disclose to the
Purchasing Lender, proposed Purchasing Lender, Participant, proposed
Participant, or to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparty's professional advisor any


                                       89
<PAGE>

information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of
the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such disclosure, each such Purchasing
Lender, proposed Purchasing Lender, Participant or proposed Participant,
contractual counterparty or professional advisor shall agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 14.10(g).

         (h) Certain Pledges or Assignments. Any Lender may at any time pledge
or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to secure obligations of such Lender,
including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         SECTION 14.11 Amendments, Waivers and Consents. Except as set forth
below or as specifically provided in any Loan Document (including, without
limitation, Section 2.8), any term, covenant, agreement or condition of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents may be amended or waived by the
Lenders, and any consent given by the Lenders, if, but only if, such amendment,
waiver or consent is in writing signed by the Required Lenders (or by the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and delivered to
the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an amendment, signed by the
Borrower; provided, that except as specifically set forth in Section 2.8, no
amendment, waiver or consent shall (a) increase the Revolving Credit Commitment
or Term Loan Commitment of any Lender, (b) reduce the Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage, the rate of interest or fees payable on any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation, (c) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan
or Reimbursement Obligation, (d) extend the originally scheduled time or times
of payment or prepayment of the principal of any Loan or Reimbursement
Obligation or the time or times of payment of interest on any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation (including, without limitation, the date of any
principal amortization payment set forth in Section 4.3 or the final maturity
date) or any fee or commission with respect thereto (including any waiver of a
payment default), (e) permit any subordination of the principal or interest on
any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, (f) release the Borrower from the
Obligations (other than Hedging Obligations) hereunder, (g) permit any
assignment (other than as specifically permitted or contemplated in this
Agreement) of any of the Borrower's rights and obligations hereunder, (h)

Security Document (other than asset sales permitted pursuant to Section 11.5 and
as otherwise specifically permitted or contemplated in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Section 5.12(b)) or the applicable Security
Document) or (i) amend the provisions of this Section 14.11 or the definition of
Required Lenders, in each case, without the prior written consent of each Lender
or (j) extend the time of the obligation of the Lenders holding Revolving Credit
Commitments to make or issue or participate in Letters of Credit, in any case,
without the written consent of each Lender holding Revolving Credit Loans or a
Revolving Credit Commitment.

         In addition, no amendment, waiver or consent to the provisions of
Section 4.4(b)(vii) with respect to the order of application of amounts prepaid,
Section 5.4 with respect to the pro rata treatment of payments, or Section 5.5
with respect to the order of application of proceeds shall be made without the

and other authorizations granted to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and
any Persons designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to any

coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the
Obligations remain unpaid or unsatisfied, any of the Commitments remain in
effect or the Credit Facility has not been terminated.

         SECTION 14.14 Survival of Indemnities. Notwithstanding any termination
of this Agreement, the indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders are entitled under the provisions of this Article XIV and any other
provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in full
force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
against events arising after such termination as well as before.

Agreement.

Agreement or any other Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent

such provision or the remaining provisions hereof or thereof or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 14.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and shall be
binding upon all parties, their successors and assigns, and all of which taken

itself and the Lenders, upon repayment of the outstanding principal of and all
accrued interest on the Loans, payment of all outstanding fees and expenses

Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this Agreement shall
control; provided, that any provision of the Security Documents which imposes
additional burdens on the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or further restricts the
rights of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or gives the Administrative Agent or
Lenders additional rights shall not be deemed to be in conflict or inconsistent
with this Agreement and shall be given full force and effect.

contained in Articles IX, X, or XI hereof shall be given independent effect.
Accordingly, the Borrower shall not engage in any transaction or other act
