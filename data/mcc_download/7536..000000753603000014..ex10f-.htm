</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 <I>Option Grants.</I>  The following Options shall be granted under the Plan:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Each Non-Employee Director serving on the Board as of the Effective Date of the Plan shall receive an Option to purchase 4,000 Shares as of the Effective Date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each Non-Employee Director who becomes a member of the Board after the Effective Date of the Plan shall receive an Option to purchase 15,000 Shares as of the earlier of the date on which he or she is initially elected to serve on the Board by vote of the Company's stockholders or the date on which he or she is initially appointed to serve on the Board pursuant to the Company's bylaws and articles of incorporation as then in effect.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each Non-Employee Director serving on the Board as of the date immediately following each annual meeting of the Company's shareholders occurring after the Effective Date of the Plan shall receive an Option to purchase 4,000 Shares as of each such date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A former employee of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company shall be entitled to receive an Option under subsection 3.1(a), (b), and (c) provided that he or she qualifies as a Non-Employee Director as of the date that such Option would be granted under the provisions of such subsection.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 <I>Purchase Price.</I>  The purchase price for Shares under each Option shall be equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date of grant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3 <I>Vesting.</I>  Each Option shall become exercisable with respect to 50% of the Shares subject thereto effective as of each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date; provided, that the Optionee continues to serve on the Board as of such dates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all Options held by an Optionee shall become fully (100%) exercisable in the event of the Optionee's Retirement, Disability, Qualifying Termination, death, or upon the earlier occurrence of a Corporate Event, as provided under Article 7. If an Optionee ceases to serve on the Board for any reason other than Retirement, Disability, a Qualifying Termination or death, that portion of an Option which is not then vested shall automatically be forfeited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4 <I>Duration.</I>  Each Option shall terminate on the date which is the tenth anniversary of the grant date, unless terminated earlier as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) If an Optionee's service on the Board terminates for any reason other than cause, Retirement, Disability or death, the Optionee may for a period of ninety (90) days after such termination exercise any Option to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Option or portion thereof has become vested and exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Plan, after which time the Option shall automatically terminate in full.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If an Optionee's service on the Board terminates for cause, all Options granted to the Optionee hereunder shall immediately terminate in full and no rights thereunder may be exercised.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If an Optionee's service on the Board terminates by reason of the Optionee's Retirement or Disability, the Optionee may, for a period of three (3) years after such termination, exercise any Option in part or in full, after which time the Option shall automatically terminate in full.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In the event of the death of an Optionee while serving on the Board, any Option granted to the Optionee shall be exercisable (to the extent provided under Section 3.3) by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the Optionee's estate, as the case may be, for a period of three (3) years after the Optionee's death. In the event an Option is exercised by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased Optionee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Shares thereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons exercising the Option are the duly appointed legal representatives of the deceased Optionee's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) For purposes of this Section 3.4, an Optionee shall not be deemed to have terminated service on the Board during any period the Optionee continues to serve as an honorary or emeritus Board member.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5 <I>Amount of Stock.</I>  There may be issued under the Plan an aggregate of not more than 300,000 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.6. Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may either be authorized but unissued Shares or reacquired Shares, or both. In the event that Options shall terminate or expire without being exercised in whole or in part, the Shares underlying the unexercised portion of such Options may be the subject of future Options granted pursuant to the terms of the Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6 <I>Dilution and Other Adjustments.</I>  In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares or other similar event (including extraordinary dividends), if the Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, that such change equitably requires an adjustment in the number or kind of shares available under the Plan, the number and kind of shares that may be the subject of future Option grants under the Plan, the number or kind of shares which are subject to outstanding Options, or the purchase price per share relating thereto, such adjustment shall be made by the Board and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.7 <I>Exercise of Options.</I>  An Option may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time during the applicable exercise period by giving written notice of exercise to the Secretary of the Company specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. Notice of exercise of an Option must be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price either by cash or check or in Shares owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market Value at the date of exercise equal to such purchase price, or in a combination of the foregoing. No Shares shall be issued in connection with the exercise of an Option until full payment therefor has been received by the Company. An Optionee shall have the rights of a shareholder only with respect to Shares for which certificates have been issued to the Optionee.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.8 <I>Nontransferability of Options.</I>  No Option granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and such Option shall be exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.9 <I>Right of First Refusal.</I>  Shares acquired under the Plan by an Optionee may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any way (including a transfer by gift or by reason of the death of the Optionee) until the Optionee (or his legal representative, legatee or distributee of his estate) first offers to sell the Shares to the Company as herein provided. The price per share at which the Shares shall be offered to the Company shall be the Fair Market Value on the date the Optionee's offer is received by the Secretary of the Company. If the Company fails to accept the offer to purchase such Shares within seven (7) days after such date, the Shares shall thereafter be free of all restrictions under the Plan.</P>

</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is intended to be self-effectuating and does not require the exercise of discretion with respect to the granting or terms of any Options.

As such the Board is authorized to make any rulings and determinations that it deems to be appropriate and consistent with the terms and intent of the Plan and all such rulings and determinations shall be final and binding upon all parties for all purposes. Any member of the Board making a claim or request to the Board with respect to his or her rights or interests under the Plan shall recuse himself or herself from the Board's determination with respect to such claim or request.</P>

No such termination or amendment of the Plan shall adversely affect any right of any Optionee with respect to any Option theretofore granted without such Optionee's written consent.</P>
