acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the Warrant based on the relative value of the Common Stock and the common stock of the successor entity or purchasing entity). The Company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale, unless
prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the Company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Registered Holders of the Warrant representing a majority of the shares of Common Stock originally acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the Warrant, excluding any shares previously issued under the Warrant), the obligation to deliver to each
such holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire.</FONT></TD>
