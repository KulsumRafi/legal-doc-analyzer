Section 5(g) shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Bank, which may be the accounting firm then regularly retained by the Bank (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the

Executive. As a result of uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, or as a result of a subsequent determination by the Internal Revenue Service or
a judicial authority, it is possible that the Bank should have made Gross-Up Payments (&#147;Underpayment&#148;), or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the Bank which should not have been made (&#147;Overpayments&#148;). In either such
event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred. In the case of the Underpayment, the amount of such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Bank to or for the benefit of the Executive.
In the case of an Overpayment, the Executive shall, at the direction and expense of the Bank, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including the filing of returns and claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures
established by, the Bank, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Bank to correct such Overpayment, including repayment of such Overpayment to the Bank. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

account for any business combination into which they may become a party under the &#147;pooling-of-interests&#148; method of accounting. The Bank does not believe that any provision of the foregoing Amendment to Employment Agreement will affect the
Bank or Holding Company&#146;s ability to so account for any business combination. Due to the uncertainties associated with the accounting rules governing the pooling-of- interests method, however, it is possible that the provisions of this
Amendment may impact the Bank or Holding Company&#146;s ability to use pooling-of-interests accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, in the event the Board of Directors determines it to be in the best interests of the Bank or Holding
Company to account for a business combination under the pooling-of-interests method and, in the written opinion of the Accounting Firm referred to above, if any provision of this Amendment makes a business combination to which the Bank or Holding
Company is a party ineligible for pooling-of interests accounting under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 16, as modified or amended, that but for such provision of this Amendment to Employment Agreement would otherwise be eligible for such
accounting treatment, then the Bank and Executive agree that the terms of this Amendment shall be rescinded to the extent necessary to enable the business combination to so qualify for such accounting treatment. </FONT></P><P
