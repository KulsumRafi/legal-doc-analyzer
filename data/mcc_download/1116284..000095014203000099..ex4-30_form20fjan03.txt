         2.3      CONSIDERATION

         (a)      PURCHASE PRICE. The total consideration to be paid by Buyer
for the Assets (the "PURCHASE PRICE") shall consist of the following: (i)
$1,780,205 payable in cash at the Closing (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"), (ii) that
number of Buyer Parent Subordinate Voting Shares equal to $2,500,000 divided by
the Closing Price (the "BUYER SHARES"), which shall be held by Buyer as provided
below in this SECTION 2.3 pursuant to the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement, and
(iii) the Earn-Out Amount, which shall be paid as provided below. If prior to
the Closing, there is any stock dividend or stock split or reclassification of
the outstanding Buyer Parent Subordinate Voting Shares, then in such event any
and all new, substituted, or additional securities to which Seller would have
been entitled by reason of their ownership of the Buyer Shares had the Closing
occurred prior to such event shall be considered Buyer Shares for the purposes
of the Agreement and the consideration to be received by Seller shall be

Shares shall be issued, and each fractional share thereof shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole number.

         (b)      LOCK-UP. The Buyer Shares will be held by Buyer pursuant to

         (c)      CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF EARN-OUT AMOUNT. On or before sixty
(60) days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of
Annual Buyer Revenues and the Earn-out Amount based on such Annual Buyer
Revenues (the "ANNUAL BUYER REVENUES STATEMENT"). If Seller disputes Buyer's
Annual Buyer Revenues Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer of its objections
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Annual Buyer Revenues Statement and
shall set forth in reasonable detail in such notice the reason for Seller's
objections. If Seller fails to deliver such notice within such time period, (i)
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Annual Buyer Revenues Statement and
shall not be entitled to dispute such Annual Buyer Revenues Statement and (ii)
Buyer shall pay the Earn-out Amount reflected on the Annual Buyer Revenues
Statement to Buyer as provided below within the earlier of ten (10) days after
the end of the objection period or notification from Seller that it does not
object to the Annual Buyer Revenues Statement. If Seller delivers such notice,
Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve their dispute over the
Annual Buyer Revenues Statement within sixty (60) days after Buyer's receipt of
Seller's notice. If they are unable to do so within such 60-day period, the
dispute shall be submitted to an audit partner experienced in the business
conducted by Buyer of an independent nationally-recognized accounting firm in
the United States as shall be mutually acceptable to Sellers and Buyer (an
"INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM") who shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, and who shall resolve the dispute within 10 days. The decision of
the Independent Accounting Firm as to the Annual Buyer Revenues Statement shall
be final and binding upon the Buyer and Seller, except to the extent of any
merely computational errors present on the face of the Annual Buyer Revenues
Statement which, once corrected, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller. One-half of the expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne by Seller, and the remaining one-half of such expenses shall be borne by
Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in the determination of
the Annual Buyer Revenues Statement, including without limitation, allowing
Seller and the Independent Accounting Firm full access to the books and records
of Buyer. Any party shall make any payment required to comply with such decision
within ten (10) days after such decision is reached. Payment of any Earn-out
Amount shall be made by check to Seller at the address set forth in SECTION
12.2, or at such other place in the United States of America as Seller shall
designate to Buyer in writing, or by wire transfer to an account designated by
Seller in writing. If any payment of any Earn-out Amount is due on a day which
is not a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the next succeeding Business
Day.

         Ad valorem real and tangible personal property taxes with respect to
the Assets for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs shall be prorated
between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing Date on the basis of no applicable
discount. If the amount of such taxes with respect to any of the Assets for the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs has not been determined as of the
Closing Date, then the taxes with respect to such Assets for the preceding
calendar year, on the basis of no applicable discount, shall be used to
calculate such prorations, with known changes in valuation or millage applied.
The prorated taxes shall be an adjustment to the Cash Consideration to be paid
at the Closing. If the actual amount of any such taxes varies by more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) from estimates used at the Closing to prorate such
taxes, then the parties shall re-prorate such taxes within ten (10) days
following request by either party based on the actual amount of the tax bill.

         2.6      ALLOCATION

         The Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with EXHIBIT 2.6.
After the Closing, the parties shall make consistent use of the allocation and
fair market value specified in EXHIBIT 2.6 for all Tax purposes and in all
filings, declarations and reports with the IRS in respect thereof, including the
reports required to be filed under Section 1060 of the Code. In any Proceeding
related to the determination of any Tax, neither Buyer nor Seller or Founders
shall contend or represent that such allocation is not a correct allocation.

         2.7      CLOSING

         The purchase and sale provided for in the Agreement (the "CLOSING")
will take place at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP, 2505 N. Plano Road,
Suite 4000, Richardson, Texas 75082, commencing at 10:00 a.m. (Richardson time)

agree. Subject to the provisions of Article 8, failure to consummate the
purchase and sale provided for in the Agreement on the date and time and at the
place determined pursuant to this SECTION 2.7 will not result in the termination
of the Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under the
Agreement. In such a situation, the Closing will occur as soon as practicable,
subject to Article 8.

                                   ARTICLE III

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLING PARTIES

         The Selling Parties jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Buyer and Buyer Parent that the following representations and warranties are
correct and complete as of the date hereof except as set forth in the disclosure
schedule attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "DISCLOSURE LETTER"). Nothing in the
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein, however, unless the Disclosure Letter
identifies the exception with reasonably sufficient detail. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a
document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to
a representation or warranty made herein (unless


                                       18
<PAGE>

the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or
other item itself). The Disclosure Letter will be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs contained in this Article.

         3.1      ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING; AUTHORITY; ENFORCEABILITY

         (a)      Seller is a limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing in the State of Delaware. Each of the Limited
Partner and the General Partner is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing in the State of Delaware. Seller Parent is
a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing in the
State of Delaware. Each of Seller, Limited Partner, General Partner and Seller
Parent has delivered true and correct copies of its Governing Documents to
Buyer. Each of the Selling Parties has the requisite power and authority: (a) to
carry on its business as currently conducted; (b) to own and use the properties
owned and used by it; and (c) to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements
and consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Selling Parties is
duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on such Selling Party. No Selling Party is in violation of any of the provisions
of its Governing Documents. Seller has no Subsidiary and does not own any shares
of capital stock or other securities of any other Person.

         (b)      The execution and delivery by each of the Selling Parties of
the Transaction Agreements and the consummation by the Selling Parties of the
Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Selling Parties, and no other proceedings on the part
of the Selling Parties are necessary to authorize the Transaction Agreements or
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The Agreement has been, and the
other Transaction Agreements when executed by the Selling Parties will be, duly
and validly executed and delivered by each of the Selling Parties, and, assuming
each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and Buyer Parent, the Agreement constitutes, and each of the other
Transaction Agreements when executed by the Selling Parties will constitute, a
valid and binding agreement of each of the Selling Parties enforceable against
them in accordance with its terms, subject, however, as to enforcement, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights
and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in equity or at law.

         3.2      NO CONFLICT

         Except as set forth on Part 3.2, the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements do not, and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default

consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and present fairly
in all material respects, as of their respective dates, the consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of Seller Parent (subject, in the
case of Interim Financial Statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments
that may be required upon audit that would not be material, either individually
or in the aggregate). Any pro-forma or provisional financial statement or
financial information provided to the Buyer prior to the Closing were prepared

Financial Statements. All of the Assets are reflected on the Interim Balance
Sheet.

         3.4      BOOKS AND RECORDS

         The books of account and other financial Records of Seller, all of
which have been made available to Buyer, are complete and correct and represent
actual, bona fide transactions and have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices and the requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act
(regardless of whether Seller is subject to that Section or not), including the
maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls. The minute books and
organizational records of Seller, all of which have been made available to
Buyer, contain accurate and complete Records of all meetings held, and action
taken, and no meeting has been held for which minutes have not been prepared or
are not contained in such organizational books.

         3.5      SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS

         Except as set forth in Part 3.5, the Assets (a) constitute all of the
assets, tangible and intangible, of any nature whatsoever, necessary to operate
Seller's business in the manner presently operated by Seller; and (b) include
all of the operating assets of Seller. Except as set forth on Part 3.5, no
Related Person of Seller owns any asset necessary to conduct Seller's business
as presently conducted.

         3.6      TITLE TO ASSETS; ENCUMBRANCES

         (a)      Seller has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all the Assets set forth on the Interim Balance Sheet free and

conduct of the business or disposed of in the Ordinary Course of Business since
the date of the Interim Balance Sheet; (b) Encumbrances specifically identified
in the Financial Statements; and (c) Encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due

other assets used by it in its business.

         (b)      Each of the Selling Parties warrants to Buyer that, at the

ENCUMBRANCES").

         3.7      INVENTORIES

         All items included in the Inventories consist of a quality and quantity
usable and, with respect to finished goods, saleable, in the Ordinary Course of
Business of Seller except for obsolete items and items of below-standard
quality, all of which have been written off or written down to net realizable
value as set forth in Part 3.7. Seller is not in possession of any inventory not
owned by Seller, including goods already sold. All of the Inventories have been
valued at net realizable value at its weighted average cost. Inventories now on
hand that were purchased after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet were
purchased in the Ordinary Course of Business of Seller at a cost not exceeding
market prices prevailing at the time of purchase. Work-in-process Inventories
are now valued, and will be valued on the Closing Date, according to GAAP.

         3.8      PRODUCT WARRANTIES

         Each product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by Seller has
been in material conformity with all applicable contractual commitments and all
warranties, and Seller has no Liability for replacement or repair thereof or
other damages in connection therewith arising out of products manufactured,
sold, leased or delivered, except as set forth in Part 3.8. Except as set forth
in Part 3.8, no product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by Seller is
subject to any express guaranty, warranty, or other indemnity made Seller.
Seller has no Liability arising out of any injury to individuals or property as
a result of the ownership, possession, or use of any product manufactured, sold,
leased, or delivered by Seller, except as set forth in Part 3.8.

         3.9      CONDITION OF FACILITIES; PERSONAL PROPERTY

         Seller does not own any real property. Part 3.9 contains an accurate
description (by location, name of lessor, date of lease and term expiry date) of
all Real Property Leases included within the Assets (collectively, the
"FACILITIES"). Except as set forth on Part 3.9, the Facilities are not subject
to any Encumbrances, encroachments, building or use restrictions, exceptions,
reservations or limitations, except those which do not, taken as a whole, result
in a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or which prevent any continued use
thereof in the usual and normal conduct of Seller's business. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of any Selling Party, threatened condemnation
proceedings relating to any of the Facilities. All of the Tangible Personal
Property owned or used by Seller is in good operating condition and repair,
except for ordinary wear and tear, and are usable in the Ordinary Course of
Business of Seller and free from latent and patent defects. No item of Tangible
Personal Property is in need of repair or replacement other than as part of
routine maintenance in the Ordinary Course of Business of Seller. Except as
disclosed in Part 3.9, at Closing all Tangible Personal Property used in
Seller's business will be at the Facilities.

         3.10     NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

         Seller does not have any Liability except for: (a) liabilities for
which fully funded reserves are specifically identified in the Interim Balance
Sheet; and (b) liabilities of a short-term nature which have arisen in the
Ordinary Course of Business of Seller since the date of the Interim Balance
Sheet.

         3.11     TAXES

         Each of the Selling Parties has timely filed all Tax Returns required
to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such Tax Returns have been
timely filed and granted and have not expired, and all such filed Tax Returns
are complete and accurate in all respects. Each of the Selling Parties has paid
all Taxes required to be paid by it. The most recent financial statements
contained in the Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes
payable by Selling Parties for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued
through the date of such financial statements. No deficiencies for any Taxes
have been proposed,


                                       21
<PAGE>

asserted or assessed against any Selling Party that are not adequately reserved
for on the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. There is no pending
dispute with any taxing authority relating to any of Selling Parties' Tax
Returns and there is no tax audit, assessment or reassessment of any Tax Return
of any Selling Party pending or currently in process. All Taxes that each
Selling Party is or was required by law to withhold or collect have been duly
withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the proper
Governmental Body. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon any of the assets of
any Selling Party, except Encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due and
payable. Consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not result in the
imposition or creation of any Taxes or Encumbrances on the Assets, except for
Taxes that shall remain the Liability of Seller.

         3.12     NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

         Except as set forth on Part 3.12, since the date of the Audited Balance

that would have been prohibited under SECTION 5.1.

         3.13     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         (a)      Part 3.13 lists all employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) and collective bargaining, employment or severance
agreements or other similar arrangements which Seller sponsors, maintains, or to
which contributions are made, for the benefit of employees of Seller or any
Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any profit-sharing, deferred
compensation, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation, or other
equity-based compensation, pension, retainer, consulting, retirement, severance,
change in control, health, medical, dental or other welfare plan, agreement or
arrangement, and any plan, agreement or arrangement providing for "fringe

         (b)      Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true and
complete copies of all documents, trust agreements, summary plan descriptions,
and any other instrument under which an Employee Plan is established or operated
or summary descriptions of any such Employee Plan not otherwise in writing.

its terms. Each Employee Plan has been established and administered in

each Employee Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Body or
distributed to any participant of each Employee Plan have been duly and timely
filed or distributed.

         (e)      No actions, suits, disputes or claims (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the Knowledge of
any Selling Party, threatened with respect to any Employee Plan. No audits,
inquiries, reviews, proceedings, claims, or demands are pending with any
Governmental Body with respect to any Employee Plan.

         (f)      No Employee Plan provides for or continues medical or health
benefits, or life insurance or other death benefits (through insurance or
otherwise) for any employee or any dependent or beneficiary of any employee
after such employee's retirement or other termination of employment except as
required by applicable law (e.g. COBRA), and there has been no communication to
any employee that could reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee any such
benefits.


                                       22
<PAGE>

         (g)      Except as set forth in the Employee Plans, the Contemplated
Transactions will not entitle any individual to severance pay, and will not
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any individual.

         (h)      With respect to any Employee Plan, all required or
discretionary (in accordance with historical practices) payments, premiums,
contributions, reimbursements, or accruals for all periods ending prior to or as
of the Closing shall have been made or properly accrued on the current balance
sheets or will be properly accrued on the books and records of Seller as of the
Closing Date. None of the Employee Plans has any unfunded liabilities which are
not reflected on the current balance sheet or the books and records of Seller.

         (i)      No Employee Plan of Seller and no Employee Plan of any of
Seller's ERISA Affiliates is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code, and neither Seller nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has at any
time contributed to or had any obligation to contribute to or has any liability
(contingent or otherwise) to any "multiemployer plan," as that term is defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA. "ERISA AFFILIATE" means any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) that is as of the date of the Agreement, or at any
time within six (6) years preceding the date hereof would have been, treated as
a "single employer" with Seller under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code.

         (j)      Except for any formal written qualification requirement with
respect to which the remedial amendment period set forth in Section 401(b) of
the Code, and any regulations, rulings or other IRS releases thereunder, has not
expired, each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
and is so qualified in form and operation under Section 401(a) of the Code.

         (k)      Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer each updated
determination letter for Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code.

COBRA. To Seller's Knowledge, no key employee or group of employees has any

Seller; or (ii) a mass layoff (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of

transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any similar state or local law. Seller will not

liability being imposed on Seller under the WARN Act, and Seller shall be
responsible for giving any and all notices, to the extent required, and
complying with the provisions of the WARN Act in connection with the
transactions governed by this Agreement for any "employment losses" that occur

the Intellectual Property Rights used by Seller in the operation of its business
("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"). No Confidential Information material to the
business of Seller as currently operated has been disclosed or authorized to be

Information or under circumstances in which the Third Party is under a legal

         (k)      Infringement.

         3.23     BROKERS, FINDERS OR FINANCIAL ADVISORS

         Except as set forth on Part 3.23, no broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person, is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the

behalf of any of the Selling Parties.

         3.24     SECURITIES LAW MATTERS

         (a)      Seller alone, or its representative, has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters and such experience in evaluating
and investing in companies such as Buyer Parent as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Buyer Shares. Seller has the
financial ability to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Buyer
Shares being acquired hereunder, has adequate means for providing for its
current needs and contingencies and has no need for liquidity with respect to
its investment in Buyer Parent. Seller is an "accredited investor" as such term
is defined in Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act.

         (b)      Seller is acquiring the Buyer Shares for its own account, for
investment purposes only, and not with the view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof. Seller understands that the Buyer Shares have
not been distributed pursuant to a prospectus in Canada pursuant to applicable
legislation and have not been registered under the Securities Act, or under the
securities laws of various states of the United States or under the securities
laws of Canada, by reason of a specified exemption from the registration
provisions thereunder which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide
nature of Seller's investment intent as expressed herein. Seller acknowledges
that its representations and warranties contained herein are being relied upon
by Buyer Parent as a basis for the exemption of the issuance of the Buyer Shares
hereunder from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities laws.

         (c)      Seller acknowledges that the Buyer Shares must be held
indefinitely until they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and
under applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is
available and that Buyer and Buyer Parent have no obligation whatsoever to
register the Buyer Shares. Seller has been advised or is aware of the provisions
of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permits limited resale of
the securities purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions including, among other things, the availability of certain
current public information about Buyer Parent and compliance with applicable
requirements regarding the holding period and the amount of securities to be
sold and the manner of sale. Seller understands that only Buyer Parent can take
action to register the Buyer Shares.

         (d)      Seller acknowledges that the Buyer Shares must also be held in
accordance with applicable securities laws in Canada and Seller undertakes not
to sell, transfer or assign the Buyer Shares in contravention of the applicable
laws in force in Canada.

         (e)      Seller or its representative has had an opportunity to discuss
the Buyer Parent's business, management, financial affairs and acquisition plans
with its management, to review the Buyer Parent's facilities, and to obtain such
additional information concerning Seller's investment in the Buyer Shares in
order for Seller to evaluate its merits and risks, and Seller has determined
that the Buyer Shares are a suitable investment for Seller and that at this time
Seller could bear a complete loss of its investment.

         (f)      Seller is aware that no U.S. or Canada federal, state,
provincial or other agency has passed upon or made any finding or determination
concerning the fairness of the Contemplated Transactions or the adequacy of the
disclosure of the exhibits and schedules hereto or thereto.


                                       30
<PAGE>

         (g)      Seller understands that all certificates for the Buyer Shares
issued to Seller shall bear a legend in substantially the following form and
including such legend as may be required under Canadian securities laws:

         "THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
         1933, AS AMENDED, OR QUALIFIED UNDER ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE
         SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED
         OF WITHOUT SUCH REGISTRATION OR THE DELIVERY TO THE ISSUER OF AN
         OPINION OF COUNSEL, OR SUCH OTHER DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
         TO THE ISSUER, THAT SUCH DISPOSITION WILL NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF
         SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY
         STATE SECURITIES LAWS."

         (h)      Seller understands that the Buyer Shares will not be
registered at the time of their issuance under the Securities Act for the reason
that the sale provided for in the Agreement is exempt pursuant to Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act and that the reliance of the Buyer Parent on such
exemption is predicated in part on Seller's representations set forth herein.
Seller further understands that the Buyer Shares will not be distributed
pursuant to a prospectus in Canada at the time of their issuance for the reason
that the sale provided for in the Agreement is exempt under applicable Canadian
securities laws.

         3.25     SOLVENCY

         Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions: (i) Seller will be able to pay its Liabilities as they become due;
(ii) Seller will have assets (calculated at fair market value) that exceed its
Liabilities; and (iii) taking into account all pending and threatened
litigation, final judgments against Seller in actions for money damages are not
reasonably anticipated to be rendered at a time when, or in amounts such that,
Seller will be unable to satisfy any such judgments promptly in accordance with
their terms (taking into account the maximum probable amount of such judgments
in any such actions and the earliest reasonable time at which such judgments
might be rendered) as well as all other obligations of Seller. Seller will
receive reasonably equivalent value for the Assets in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. Set forth on Part 3.25 is a list of Seller's
creditors as of the date of this Agreement and the amounts owed to such
creditors.

         3.26     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

expenditures of Seller.

                  (i)      any person who is an official, officer, agent,

                  (iii)    any candidate for political or political party
         office; or


                                       31
<PAGE>

                  (iv)     any other individual or entity;

while knowing or having reason to believe that all or any portion of such money
or thing of value would be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly,
to any such official, officer, agent, employee, representative, political party,
political party official, candidate, individual, or any entity affiliated with
such customer, political party or official or political office, in contravention
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any Legal Requirement.

         (b)      Except as set forth in Part 3.27(b), Seller has made all
payments to Third Parties by check mailed to such Third Parties' principal place
of business or by wire transfer to a bank located in the same jurisdiction as
such party's principal place of business.

         (c)      Each transaction is properly and accurately recorded on the
books and Records of Seller, and each document upon which entries in Seller's
books and Records are based is complete and accurate in all respects. Seller
maintains a system of internal accounting controls adequate to insure that
Seller maintains no off-the-books accounts and that Seller's assets are used
only in accordance with Seller's management directives.

         (d)      Seller has at all times been in compliance with all Legal
Requirements relating to export control and trade embargoes. No product sold or
service provided by Seller during the last five (5) years has been, directly or
indirectly, sold to or performed on behalf of any person or entity of Cuba,
Iraq, Iran, Libya North Korea, Sudan or Syria.

         (e)      Except as set forth in Part 3.27(e), Seller has not violated
the antiboycott prohibitions contained in 50 U.S.C. sect. 2401 et seq. or taken
any action that can be penalized under Section 999 of the Code. Except as set
forth in Part 3.27(e), during the last five (5) years, Seller has not been a
party to, is not a beneficiary under and has not performed any service or sold
any product under any Seller Contract under which a product has been sold to
customers in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates or the Republic of Yemen.

         3.28     BUDGET

         The break-even budget with sales of $6,000,000 delivered by or on
behalf of the Selling Parties to Buyer was prepared in good faith based on and
using assumptions that the Selling Parties believe to be reasonable.

         3.29     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

         Seller has at all times collected its accounts receivable in full
without any setoff within ninety (90) days after the day on which it first
became due and payable other than the accounts listed on Part 3.29.

         3.30     DISCLOSURE

         Each of the Selling Parties has made or caused to be made such inquiry
as a prudent individual could be expected to make with respect to each of the
representations, warranties and statements contained in the Agreement and in
each of the parts, certificates, documents and other writings referred to herein
or furnished to Buyer and Buyer Parent hereunder, and none of the same contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein not misleading, and all such statements,
taken as a whole, together with the Transaction Agreements, do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make

those matters disclosed herein, there are not any facts which


                                       32
<PAGE>

should reasonably be made known to Buyer and Buyer Parent relating to the
Selling Parties not herein disclosed, which might be reasonably expected to
materially diminish Buyer's and Buyer Parent's appreciation of the worth or
profitability of Seller, or which, if known by Buyer and Buyer Parent, might be
reasonably expected to deter Buyer and Buyer Parent from completing the
Contemplated Transactions.

         9.1      PAYMENT OF ALL TAXES RESULTING FROM SALE OF ASSETS BY SELLER

         Selling Parties shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes resulting from
or payable in connection with the sale of the Assets pursuant to the Agreement,
regardless of the Person on whom such Taxes are imposed by Legal Requirements.

         9.2      PAYMENT OF OTHER RETAINED LIABILITIES

         In addition to payment of Taxes pursuant to SECTION 9.1, Selling
Parties shall pay, or make adequate provision for the payment, in full all of
the Retained Liabilities and other Liabilities of Seller under the Agreement.
Selling Parties shall pay all indebtedness owing to The Frost National Bank
promptly after receipt by Seller of any tax refund, to the extent of the tax
refund.

         9.3      REMOVING EXCLUDED ASSETS

         On or before the Closing Date, Selling Parties shall remove all
Excluded Assets from all Facilities and other Real Property to be occupied by
Buyer. Such removal shall be done in such manner as to avoid any damage to the
Facilities and other properties to be occupied by Buyer and any disruption of
the business operations to be conducted by Buyer after the Closing. Any damage
to the Assets or to the Facilities resulting from such removal shall be paid by
Selling Parties at the Closing. Should Selling Parties fail to remove the
Excluded Assets as required by this Section, Buyer shall have the right, but not
the obligation, (a) to remove the Excluded Assets at Selling Parties' sole cost
and expense; (b) to store the Excluded Assets and to charge Selling Parties all
storage costs associated therewith; (c) to treat the Excluded Assets as
unclaimed and to proceed to dispose of the same under the laws governing
unclaimed property; or (d) to exercise any other right or remedy conferred by
the Agreement or otherwise available at law or in equity. Selling Parties shall
promptly reimburse Buyer for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with any Excluded Assets not removed by Selling Parties on or before
the Closing Date.

         9.4      REPORTS AND RETURNS

         Seller shall promptly after the Closing prepare and file all reports

conducted using the Assets, to and including the Effective Time.

         9.5      ASSISTANCE IN PROCEEDINGS

         The parties to this Agreement will cooperate with each other and their
respective counsel in the contest or defense of, and make available its
personnel and provide any testimony and access to its books and Records in
connection with, any Proceeding involving or relating to (a) any Contemplated
Transaction; or (b) any action, activity, circumstance, condition, conduct,
event, fact, failure to act, incident, occurrence, plan, practice, situation,
status or transaction on or before the Closing Date involving Seller or its
business or Founders.

         9.6      NONCOMPETITION; NONSOLICITATION; NONDISPARAGEMENT

         (a)      NONCOMPETITION. None of the Selling Parties shall, for a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, within Canada, the United
States, the European Union and in any other country in which


                                       44
<PAGE>

Buyer or Seller presently conducts or may conduct business, engage in any
business which develops, manufactures and sells high-performance test,
measurement and automation instruments that are used in a variety of
applications in the telecommunications and data communications networking
industries and includes any other technologies and/or applications which are
directly competitive with the business of the Seller or Buyer as the business of
the Seller and Buyer may change from time to time (the "Business") in the future
(or in the case of the Founders, as such Business is conducted during their
respective terms of employment with Seller and Buyer), without the prior written
consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, including,
without limitation, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in
conjunction with any other person, as employee, principal, agent, shareholder or
in any other manner whatsoever, carry on or be engaged in or be concerned with
or lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of, or permit their names
to be used or employed by any person or entity engaged or concerned with or
interested in the Business.

         (b)      NONSOLICITATION. For a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date, none of the Selling Parties shall, directly or indirectly:

                  (i)      solicit the business of any Person who is or was a
         customer of Seller as of the Closing or during the year preceding the
         Closing if the solicitation is not made, directly or indirectly, by a
         Person who is engaged, or intends to engage, in whole or in part in a
         business similar to the Business;

                  (ii)     cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any
         customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee, employee,
         consultant or other business relation of Buyer to cease doing business
         with Buyer, to deal with any competitor of Buyer or in any way
         interfere with its relationship with Buyer;

                  (iii)    cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any
         customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee, employee,
         consultant or other business relation of Seller on the Closing Date or
         within the year preceding the Closing Date to cease doing business with
         Buyer, to deal with any competitor of Buyer or in any way interfere
         with its relationship with Buyer; or

                  (iv)     hire, retain or attempt to hire or retain any
         employee or independent contractor of Buyer or in any way interfere
         with the relationship between Buyer and any of its employees or
         independent contractors.

         (c)      NONDISPARAGEMENT. After the Closing Date, none of the Selling
Parties will disparage Buyer, Buyer Parent or any of their respective
shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents.

         (d)      MODIFICATION OF COVENANT. If a court or tribunal of competent
jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained in SECTION 9.6(A)
through (C) is invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court
or tribunal will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This SECTION 9.6 will be enforceable
as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed. This SECTION 9.6 is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve
Buyer's legitimate business interests and the value of the Assets and to prevent
any unfair advantage conferred on Selling Parties.

         9.7      CUSTOMER AND OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

         After the Closing, Selling Parties will cooperate with Buyer in its
efforts to continue and maintain for the benefit of Buyer those business
relationships of Selling Parties existing prior to the Closing and relating to
the business to be operated by Buyer after the Closing, including relationships
with lessors, employees, regulatory authorities, licensors, customers, suppliers
and others, and Selling Parties will satisfy the Retained Liabilities in a
manner that is not detrimental to any of such relationships. Selling Parties
will refer to Buyer all inquiries relating to such business. No Selling Party
nor any of their respective employees or agents shall take any action that would
tend to diminish the value of the Assets after the Closing or that would
interfere with the business of Buyer and Buyer Parent to be engaged in after the
Closing, including disparaging the name or business of Buyer or Buyer Parent.

         9.8      EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         (a)      INFORMATION ON ACTIVE EMPLOYEES

         For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "ACTIVE EMPLOYEES" shall
mean all employees employed on the Closing Date by Seller for its business who
are set forth on Part 3.20.

         (b)      EMPLOYMENT OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES BY BUYER

                  (i)      Buyer may make an offer of employment to any Active
         Employee, whose acceptance of such offer will be effective on the
         Closing Date (the "HIRED ACTIVE EMPLOYEES"). Subject to Legal
         Requirements, Buyer will have reasonable access to the Facilities and
         personnel Records (including performance appraisals, disciplinary
         actions and grievances) of Seller for the purpose of preparing for and
         conducting employment interviews with all Active Employees and will
         conduct the interviews as expeditiously as possible prior to the
         Closing Date. Access will be provided by Seller upon reasonable prior
         notice during normal business hours. Effective immediately before the
         Closing, Seller will terminate the employment of all of the Active
         Employees.

                  (ii)     No Selling Party or their Related Persons shall
         solicit the continued employment of any Active Employee (unless and
         until Buyer has informed Seller in writing that the particular Active
         Employee will not receive any employment offer from Buyer) or the
         employment of any Hired Active Employee after the Closing.

                  (iii)    It is understood and agreed that (A) Buyer's
         expressed intention to extend offers of employment as set forth in this
         section shall not constitute any Contract or understanding (expressed
         or implied) of any obligation on the part of Buyer to a post-Closing
         employment relationship of any fixed term or duration or upon any terms
         or conditions other than those that Buyer may establish pursuant to
         individual offers of employment; and (B) employment offered by Buyer is
         "at will" and may be terminated by Buyer or by an employee at any time
         for any reason (subject to any written commitments to the contrary made
         by Buyer or an employee and Legal Requirements). Nothing in this
         Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right
         of Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Hired
         Active Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably
         the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations,
         salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of employment of
         such employees.

         (c)      SALARIES AND BENEFITS

                  (i)      Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all
         wages and other remuneration due to Active Employees with respect to
         their services as employees of Seller through the close of business on
         the Closing Date, including pro rata bonus payments and all vacation
         pay earned prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall be solely liable for
         any severance payment required to be made to its employees due to the
         Contemplated Transactions.

                  (ii)     Seller shall be liable for any claims made or
         incurred by Active Employees and their beneficiaries through the
         Closing Date under the Employee Plans. For purposes of the immediately
         preceding sentence, a charge will be deemed incurred, in the case of
         hospital, medical or dental benefits, when the services that are the
         subject of the charge are performed and, in the case of other benefits
         (such as disability or life insurance), when an event has occurred or
         when a condition has been diagnosed that entitles the employee to the
         benefit.

         (d)      GENERAL EMPLOYEE PROVISIONS

                  (i)      Seller shall give any notices required by Legal
         Requirements and take whatever other actions with respect to the plans,
         programs and policies described in this SECTION 9.8 as may be necessary
         to carry out the arrangements described in this SECTION 9.8.

                  (ii)     If any of the arrangements described in this SECTION
         9.8 are determined by the IRS or other Governmental Body to be
         prohibited by law, Seller and Buyer shall modify such arrangements to
         as closely as possible reflect their expressed intent and retain the
         allocation of economic benefits and burdens to the parties contemplated
         herein in a manner that is not prohibited by law.

                  (iii)    Seller shall provide Buyer with completed I-9 forms
         and attachments with respect to all Hired Active Employees, except for
         such employees as Seller certifies in writing to Buyer are exempt from
         such requirement.

                  (iv)     Buyer shall not have any responsibility, liability or
         obligation, whether to Active Employees, former employees, their
         beneficiaries or to any other Person, with respect to any employee
         benefit plans, practices, programs or arrangements (including the
         establishment, operation or termination thereof and the notification
         and provision of COBRA coverage extension) maintained by Seller.

         9.9      FURTHER ASSURANCES

         The parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other and with their
respective Representatives in connection with any steps required to be taken as
part of their respective obligations under the Agreement, and shall (a) furnish
upon request to each other such further information; (b) execute and deliver to
each other such other documents; and (c) do such other acts and things, all as
the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of the Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that,
neither Buyer nor Buyer Parent shall be required to dispose of or make any
material change to its business to comply with SECTION 9.9.

         9.10     RETENTION OF AND ACCESS TO RECORDS

         After the Closing Date, Buyer shall retain for a period consistent with
Buyer's record-retention policies and practices those Records of Seller
delivered to Buyer. Buyer also shall provide Selling Parties

and their Representatives reasonable access thereto, during normal business
hours and on at least three days' prior written notice, to enable them to
prepare financial statements or tax returns or deal with tax audits or third
party claims. After the Closing Date, Selling Parties shall provide Buyer and
its Representatives reasonable access to Records that are Excluded Assets,
during normal business hours and on at least three days' prior written notice,
for any reasonable business purpose specified by Buyer in such notice.

         9.11     DISTRIBUTION OF BUYER SHARES

         After the Closing, if Seller desires to distribute the Buyer Shares,
subject to the Lock Up Agreement, to the ultimate beneficial owners of Seller
Parent set forth on EXHIBIT 9.11 (the "ULTIMATE BENEFICIAL OWNERS"), then,
subject to all Legal Requirements and at the expense of Seller, Buyer and Buyer
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in effecting
the transfer of the Buyer Shares into the names of the Ultimate Beneficial
Owners in the percentages set forth on EXHIBIT 9.11; provided, that such Buyer
Shares must be distributed to the Ultimate Beneficial Owners pro rata according
to their respective ownership interest in Seller Parent and no Ultimate
Beneficial Owner may furnish any consideration for the Buyer Shares that are
distributed; provided, further, that each of the Ultimate Beneficial Owners must
deliver an executed investment representation letter in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, must agree in writing to be bound by the Lock Up
Agreement as if the Ultimate Beneficial Owner were a party thereto and must
appoint Seller in writing as the Ultimate Beneficial Owner's representative for
all purposes under the Lock Up Agreement.

         9.12     OPERATION OF BUYER

         From the Closing Date until 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not terminate the employment of any of the twenty (20) individuals whose
name is set forth on Part 9.12 (the "COVERED EMPLOYEES"), except for just cause.
If Buyer terminates the employment of an aggregate of four (4) or more of the
Covered Employees without just cause on or before the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (the termination of the fourth Covered Employee and any additional
termination of a Covered Employee thereafter being a "TERMINATION EVENT"), the
Earn Out Amount shall be adjusted with respect to each Termination Event by
reducing each dollar threshold within the definition of "EARN OUT AMOUNT" by an
amount equal to the product of (x) the subject dollar threshold, multiplied by
(y) the Covered Employee Percentage, multiplied by (z) the Remaining Term
Percentage.

the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Selling Parties.

         10.8     RIGHT OF SETOFF

         Except as prohibited by Section 6.12, upon notice to Selling Parties
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, Buyer may set off any amount
to which it may be entitled under this Article 10 or under the Note against
amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement and may give notice of a claim
under the Lock-Up Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise
such right of setoff or to give a notice of a claim will constitute an election
of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other
remedies that may be available to it. With respect to claims under Article 10,
Buyer shall be entitled to set off such claim against amounts due to Seller
under SECTION 2.3(C) only to the extent that such claim exceeds the Value (as
defined in the Lock-Up Agreement) of the Buyer Shares then held by Buyer under
the Lock-Up Agreement.

         10.9     THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS

         (a)      Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under
SECTION 10.2, 10.3 OR 10.4 (an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") of notice of the assertion
of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall give notice to
the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an "INDEMNIFYING PERSON")
of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify
the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim
is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.

         (b)      If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying
Person pursuant to SECTION 10.9(A) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to


                                       51
<PAGE>

participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it
wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the
Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith
that joint representation would be inappropriate; or (ii) the Indemnifying
Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its
financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification
with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After
notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not,
so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified
Person under this Article 10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses
with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such
assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of the Agreement that the
claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification; and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims
may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person's
Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal
Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person;
and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its
Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) days
after the Indemnified Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified
Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party
Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a
result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying
Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such
Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any
determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of the
Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).

         (d)      Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 12.7, the parties to
this Agreement hereby consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in
which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Person may have
under the Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged
therein and agree that process may be served on the parties to this Agreement
with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

         (e)      With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this Article 10: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully
informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at
all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel; and
(ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good
faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any
Third-Party Claim.

         (f)      With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this Article 10, the parties agree to cooperate in such a
manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of
all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its
best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or
participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information
(consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure); and (ii) all
communications between any party hereto and counsel


                                       52
<PAGE>

responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall,
to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privilege.

         10.10    OTHER CLAIMS

         A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought
and shall be paid promptly after such notice except to the extent that the claim
has been satisfied pursuant to SECTION 10.8.

         10.11    INDEMNIFICATION IN CASE OF STRICT LIABILITY OR
                  INDEMNITEE NEGLIGENCE

         THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE 10 SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED UPON PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE ACTS,
CLAIMS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE BULK SALES
LAW, ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ACT, OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
LAW OR PRODUCTS LIABILITY, SECURITIES OR OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENT) AND REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT)
ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE
OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

         11.1     DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

         (a)      As used in this Article 11, the term "CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION" includes any and all of the following information of Selling
Parties, Buyer or Buyer Parent that has been or may hereafter be disclosed in
any form, whether in writing, orally, electronically or otherwise, or otherwise
made available by observation, inspection or otherwise by either party (Buyer
and Buyer Parent on the one hand or Selling Parties, collectively, on the other
hand) or its Representatives (collectively, a "DISCLOSING PARTY") to the other
party or its Representatives (collectively, a "RECEIVING PARTY"):

                  (i)      all information that is a trade secret under
         applicable trade secret or other law;

                  (ii)     all information concerning product specifications,
         data, know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches,
         schematics, data sheets, work product, techniques, programs,
         photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past,
         current and planned research and development, current and planned
         manufacturing or distribution methods and processes, customer lists,
         current and anticipated customer requirements, price lists, market
         studies, business plans, computer hardware and computer software and
         database technologies, systems, structures and architectures;

                  (iii)    all information concerning the business and affairs
         of the Disclosing Party (which includes historical and current
         financial statements, financial projections and budgets, tax returns
         and accountants' materials, historical, current and projected sales,
         capital spending budgets and plans, business plans, strategic plans,
         marketing and advertising plans, publications, client, customer and
         supplier lists and files, contracts, the names and backgrounds of key
         personnel and personnel training techniques and materials, however
         documented), and all information obtained from review


                                       53
<PAGE>

         of the Disclosing Party's documents or property or discussions with the
         Disclosing Party regardless of the form of the communication; and

                  (iv)     all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries
         and other material prepared by the Receiving Party to the extent
         containing or based, in whole or in part, upon any information included
         in the foregoing.

         (b)      Any trade secrets of a Disclosing Party shall also be entitled
to all of the protections and benefits under applicable trade secret law and any
other applicable law. If any information that a Disclosing Party deems to be a
trade secret is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade
secret for purposes of this Article 11, such information shall still be
considered Confidential Information of that Disclosing Party for purposes of
this Article 11 to the extent included within the definition. In the case of
trade secrets, each of Buyer, Buyer Parent or any Selling Party hereby waives
any requirement that the other party submit proof of the economic value of any
trade secret or post a bond or other security.

         11.2     RESTRICTED USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

         (a)      Each Receiving Party acknowledges the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and
agrees that such Confidential Information (i) shall be kept confidential by the
Receiving Party; (ii) shall not be used for any reason or purpose other than to
evaluate and consummate the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) without
limiting the foregoing, shall not be disclosed by the Receiving Party to any
Person, except in each case as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of the
Agreement or with the prior written consent of an authorized representative of
Seller with respect to Confidential Information of Selling Parties (each, a
"SELLER CONTACT") or an authorized representative of Buyer with respect to
Confidential Information of Buyer or Buyer Parent (each, a "BUYER CONTACT").
Each of Buyer, Buyer Parent and any Selling Party shall disclose the
Confidential Information of the other party only to its Representatives who
require such material for the purpose of evaluating the Contemplated
Transactions and are informed by Buyer, Buyer Parent or any Selling Party, as
the case may be, of the obligations of this Article 11 with respect to such
information. Each of Buyer, Buyer Parent and any Selling Party shall (i) enforce
the terms of this Article 11 as to its respective Representatives; (ii) take
such action to the extent necessary to cause its Representatives to comply with
the terms and conditions of this Article 11; and (iii) be responsible and liable
for any breach of the provisions of this Article 11 by it or its
Representatives.

         (b)      Unless and until the Agreement is terminated, Selling Parties
shall maintain as confidential any Confidential Information (including for this
purpose any information of any Selling Party of the type referred to in SECTIONS
11.1(A)(I), (II) and (III), whether or not disclosed to Buyer or Buyer Parent)
of any Selling Party relating to any of the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Seller may use any Confidential
Information of Seller before the Closing in the Ordinary Course of Business in
connection with the transactions permitted by SECTION 5.1.

         (c)      From and after the Closing, the provisions of SECTION 11.2(A)
above shall not apply to or restrict in any manner Buyer or Buyer Parent's use
of any Confidential Information of Selling Parties relating to any of the Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities.

         11.3     EXCEPTIONS

         SECTIONS 11.2(A) and (B) do not apply to that part of the Confidential
Information of a Disclosing Party that a Receiving Party demonstrates (a) was,
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
breach of this Article 11 or the Confidentiality Agreement by the Receiving
Party or its Representatives; (b) was or is developed by the Receiving Party
independently of and without reference to


                                       54
<PAGE>

any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (c) was, is or becomes
available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a Third Party
not bound by a confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other
obligation restricting disclosure. No Selling Party shall disclose any
Confidential Information of any Selling Party relating to any of the Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities in reliance on the exceptions in clauses (b) or (c)
above.

         11.4     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         If a Receiving Party becomes compelled in any Proceeding or is
requested by a Governmental Body having regulatory jurisdiction over the
Contemplated Transactions to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise
constrained by this Article 11, that Receiving Party shall provide the
Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such compulsion or request so that it may
seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Article 11. In the absence of a
protective order or other remedy, the Receiving Party may disclose that portion
(and only that portion) of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
that, based upon advice of the Receiving Party's counsel, the Receiving Party is
legally compelled to disclose or that has been requested by such Governmental
Body, provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded by any
Person to whom any Confidential Information is so disclosed. The provisions of
this SECTION 11.4 do not apply to any Proceedings between the parties to the
Agreement.

         11.5     RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

         If this Agreement is terminated, each Receiving Party shall (a) destroy
all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party prepared or generated by
the Receiving Party without retaining a copy of any such material; (b) promptly
deliver to the Disclosing Party all other Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party, together with all copies thereof, in the possession, custody
or control of the Receiving Party or, alternatively, with the written consent of
a Seller Contact or a Buyer Contact (whichever represents the Disclosing Party)
destroy all such Confidential Information; and (c) certify all such destruction
in writing to the Disclosing Party, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Receiving Party
may retain a list that contains general descriptions of the information it has
returned or destroyed to facilitate the resolution of any controversies after
the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information is returned.

         11.6     ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

         The Disclosing Party is not waiving, and will not be deemed to have
waived or diminished, any of its attorney work product protections,
attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of
disclosing its Confidential Information (including Confidential Information
related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party, regardless
of whether the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is or may be entitled to
assert, such privileges and protections. The parties (a) share a common legal
and commercial interest in all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential
Information that is subject to such privileges and protections; (b) are or may
become joint defendants in Proceedings to which the Disclosing Party's
Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges relates; (c)
intend that such privileges and protections remain intact should either party
become subject to any actual or threatened Proceeding to which the Disclosing
Party's Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges
relates; and (d) intend that after the Closing the Receiving Party shall have
the right to assert such protections and privileges. No Receiving Party shall
admit, claim or contend, in Proceedings involving either party or otherwise,
that any Disclosing Party waived any of its attorney work-product protections,
attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to
any information, documents or other material not disclosed to a Receiving Party
due to the Disclosing Party disclosing its Confidential


                                       55
<PAGE>

Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened
litigation) to the Receiving Party.

the Agreement or any Contemplated Transaction in any other court. The parties
agree that either or both of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any
court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement
between the parties irrevocably to waive any objections to venue or to
convenience of forum.

         12.8     EXECUTION

         The Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which
when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered
to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature page were an original
thereof.

         12.9     SEVERABILITY

         In case any one or more of the provisions of the Agreement shall be
invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and
enforceable provision which shall be a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon
so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in the Agreement.

         12.10    INTERPRETATION

         The section headings in the Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision hereof. All currency amounts herein are expressed in United States
dollars.

         12.11    EXPENSES

         Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, each party to the
Agreement will bear its respective fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of the Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expense of its
Representatives. If


                                       59

the Agreement is terminated, the obligation of each party to pay its own fees
and expenses will be subject to any rights of such party arising from a Breach
of the Agreement by another party.

         12.12    SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

         Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other parties hereto
would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any Breach of this
Agreement by a party hereto could not be adequately compensated in all cases by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to
which a party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled
to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
Breaches or threatened Breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
without posting any bond or other undertaking.

         12.13    TIME OF THE ESSENCE

         With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in
this Agreement, time is of the essence.
