as Chief Executive Officer (unless otherwise mutually agreed by Employee and USP) and shall continue to act as Chairman of the Board for an additional three year term (the "Secondary Term") as a part
time employee, estimated at approximately 75% of Employee's business time, and (c)&nbsp;at the end of the Secondary Term, Employee shall remain as Chairman of the Board (unless otherwise mutually
agreed by Employee and USP) and, for an additional two year period (the "Final Term"), Employee shall continue as a part time employee, estimated at approximately 50% of Employee's business time. </FONT></P>

such duties, responsibilities and authority as are set forth in the By-Laws of USP for the position of Chief Executive Officer and (c)&nbsp;shall have authority to hire such staff as

salary based on Employee's performance and the growth and/or profitability of USP, but it shall have no obligation to grant any such increases in compensation. Base Salary shall be payable in equal
semi-monthly installments on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> day and the last working date of the month, or at such other times and in such

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For

Frequent long illnesses, though different from the preceding illness and though separated by relatively short periods of performance, shall be deemed to be "substantially continuous." Disability shall
be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose decision shall be final and binding upon Employee. Employee hereby
consents to medical examinations by such physicians and medical consultants as USP shall, from time to time, require. </FONT></P>

other benefits furnished to Employee after termination for Cause. Termination for Cause shall be effective immediately upon notice sent or given to Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Cause" shall mean and be strictly limited to: (a)&nbsp;indictment for a crime constituting a felony under state or federal law; (b)&nbsp;conviction of a crime constituting a misdemeanor and
involving an act of moral turpitude, including without limitation fraud, embezzlement and use of illegal drugs; (c)&nbsp;commission of any material act of dishonesty against USP; or

which would be detrimental to USP's interests. Employee further understands and agrees that USP conducts its business within a specialized market segment throughout the United States and in portions

receiving a salary or severance payments from USP, unless Employee first secures the written consent of USP, Employee will not directly or indirectly invest, engage or participate in or become
employed by any entity in direct or indirect competition with USP's business, which shall include the ownership and/or operation of outpatient surgical centers in the United States and the ownership
and/or operation of hospitals in the countries in Europe in which USP owns or operates hospitals as of the date of termination. These non-competition provisions shall not be construed to
prohibit Employee from being employed in the health care industry during the applicable period, but rather to permit him to be so employed so long as such employment does not involve Employee's direct
