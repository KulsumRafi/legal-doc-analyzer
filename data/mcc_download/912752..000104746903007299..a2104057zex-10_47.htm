the Lambert Entities and Sinclair (the "License Option"); Put Agreement for Purchase of Non-License Assets, between Nashville, L.P. and Sinclair (the "Non-License Put"); Put
Agreement for Purchase of License Assets, between the Lambert Entities and Sinclair (the "License Put") and Servicing Agreement, between the Lambert Entities and Sinclair (the "Servicing Agreement");
and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Nashville, L.P. has borrowed certain amounts under that certain Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October&nbsp;19, 1998, as amended (the "Credit Agreement") with the
Lenders referred to therein (the "Lenders") and Union Bank of California, N.A. ("Union Bank"), as agent for the Lenders; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Nashville is required to repay all amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the "Pay-Off Amount") on or before
December&nbsp;2, 2002; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to make funds available to Nashville, L.P. to allow it to meet its payment obligations under the Credit Agreement and to pay taxes, Sinclair is prepared to pay certain
amounts to Lambert, L.P., as a non-refundable advance against the purchase price which would be due upon the closing of a sale of assets as a result of the exercise of the
Non-License Option or the Non-License Put; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties desire to amend the Non-License Option and the Non-License Put to memorialize the advance payment being made by Sinclair; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
to better reflect the intent of the parties and to ensure compliance of the arrangement contemplated by the Servicing Agreement with the rules and regulations of the Federal

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,

accordance with the terms thereof, Nashville, L.P. shall be permitted to retain the Deposit; <U>provided</U>, Nashville L.P. shall be required to immediately refund the Deposit
to Sinclair in the event such termination results from the default by either of the Lambert Entities of any obligation under any of the Non-License Option, the License Option, the
Non-License Put, the License Put and/or the Servicing Agreement. </FONT></P>
