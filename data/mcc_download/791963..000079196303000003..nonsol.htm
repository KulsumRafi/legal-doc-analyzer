    <p>A. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser has
    agreed to purchase the Asset Management Business; </p>
    <p>B. The obligations of the Purchaser under the Purchase
    Agreement are subject to the condition that CIBCWM execute
    and deliver this Non-Solicitation Agreement as of the date
    hereof; </p>
    <p>C. The Purchaser acknowledges that, as of the date hereof,
    in addition to the Asset Management Business, CIBCWM
    currently carries on in the U.S. (independently and in
    conjunction with other subsidiaries and affiliates of
    Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canadian Imperial Bank of
    Commerce and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including
    CIBCWM, are collectively referred to herein as &quot;<u>CIBC</u>&quot;))
    a merchant banking business, and a full service investment
    banking and securities business serving institutional and
    other non-retail market segments;</p>
    <p>D. CIBC acknowledges that pursuant to the Purchase
    Agreement, CIBC will be prohibited from soliciting clients
    (other than in connection with the conduct of the Asset
    Management Business in the ordinary course prior to the Final
    Closing) and employees of the Asset Management Business other
    than in Canada (other than in connection with the conduct of
    the Asset Management Business in the ordinary course prior to
    the Final Closing) as described more fully herein for a
    reasonable period of time following the date hereof and that
    any such solicitation during such period would diminish the
    value of the Purchaser's business, including the goodwill
    associated with the Asset Management Business; and</p>
    <p>E. This Agreement is intended to recognize the interest of
    CIBC in being able to carry on its existing businesses in the
    U.S. and elsewhere, other than the Asset Management Business
    and the Brokerage Business, and the interest of Purchaser in
    being able to carry on its business in the U.S. and
    elsewhere, including the Asset Management Business and
    Brokerage Business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing and other good
and valuable consideration given by the Purchaser to CIBC, CIBC
agrees with the Purchaser as follows:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <b><u>Non-Solicitation</u></b></p>

<p>CIBC agrees that without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, CIBC shall not, directly or indirectly or through an

Agreement, hire or employ, or solicit, induce or encourage, any
person who is, or has within the previous twelve months been, a
non-clerical employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates or any
Business Employee, to terminate such person&#146;s employment
relationship with (or, in the case of any Business Employee prior
to his or her Hire Date, to decline an offer of employment from)
Purchaser or its Affiliates; <u>provided</u> that the foregoing
shall not apply to (<u>i</u>) general solicitations through
general advertising, general internet postings or other similar
non-targeted advertising of employees by CIBC and (<u>ii</u>)
solicitations conducted by an entity that is acquired by or
merged with CIBC so long as such solicitations were conducted
prior to the date of such acquisition or merger; or </p>

<p>(B) for a period of two years from and after the date hereof,
except as expressly contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, (<u>i</u>)
attempt to establish with or seek from any Client (other than in
Canada) a business relationship in respect of any product or
program of the Asset Management Business of the types advised,
sub-advised, managed, offered, distributed or sponsored thereby
(collectively, &quot;<u>Services</u>&quot;) or (<u>ii</u>) induce
or encourage or seek to cause any Client (including for such
purpose a Client within the previous twelve months, or a

<p><b>4. </b><b><u>Invalidity of Provisions</u></b></p>

<p>Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement is distinct
and severable and a declaration of invalidity or unenforceability
of any such provision or part thereof by a court of competent
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
any other provisions hereof. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the parties waive any provision of law that
renders any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable
in any respect.</p>

<p><b>5. </b><b><u>Remedies</u></b></p>

<p>CIBCWM acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by
CIBCWM or any of its Affiliates of any provision of this
Agreement could result in the Purchaser suffering irreparable
harm which cannot be calculated or fully or adequately
compensated by recovery of damages alone. Accordingly, CIBCWM
agrees that, in addition to any other relief to which the
Purchaser may become entitled, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
seek interim and permanent injunctive relief, specific
performance and other equitable remedies.</p>

<p>CIBCWM expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is
reasonable and valid in all respects and irrevocably waives (and
irrevocably agrees not to raise) as a defense any issue of
reasonableness (including the reasonableness of the territory or
the duration and scope of this Agreement) in any proceeding to
enforce any provision of this Agreement.</p>

<p>CIBCWM shall, at its own expense, take all lawful actions,
including legal proceedings, to prevent or stop any violation,
contravention or breach of this Agreement. In the absence of such
action by CIBCWM, the Purchaser may take such action in its own
name or otherwise.</p>

<p>CIBCWM shall immediately notify the Purchaser of any
violation, contravention or breach of this Agreement as soon as
it becomes aware of any such event.</p>

<p><b>6. </b><b><u>Amendment</u></b></p>

<p>No modifications, amendment or waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be effective unless made with the prior
written consent of the parties hereto.</p>

<p><b>7. </b><b><u>Enurement</u></b></p>

<p>This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of the Purchaser,
its successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon CIBC and
its respective successors, and assigns.</p>

<p><b>8. </b><b><u>Waiver</u></b></p>

<p>No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or
not similar); nor shall waiver be binding unless executed in
writing by the party to be bound by the waiver.</p>

<p>No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such right; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude any other or further exercise of such
right or the exercise of any other right.</p>

<p><b>9. </b><b><u>Governing Law</u></b></p>

<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed therein.</p>

<p><b>10. </b><b><u>Termination</u></b></p>

<p>This Agreement shall terminate automatically and be of no
further force or effect in the event that, and at such time as,
the Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms. </p>
