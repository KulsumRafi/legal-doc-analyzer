profit or gain realized by Tenant from any such subleasing. All sums payable hereunder by Tenant shall be paid to landlord as additional rent immediately upon receipt thereof by Tenant. Any such rent,
profit, gain or other consideration, or sum equal to same, as set forth herein, not so paid to Landlord as herein required, shall be and is deemed to be held and retained by Tenant in trust for the
sole benefit of Landlord, and, whether actually held or retained by Tenant or not, shall be and is deemed to be held and retained by Tenant in trust for the sole benefit of Landlord, and whether
actually held or retained by Tenant or not, shall be chargeable to Tenant and payable to Landlord upon demand. Any failure or refusal by Tenant to pay Landlord same shall constitute a default and

consent by Landlord to a sublease or assignment shall not in any way be construed to relieve Tenant or the transferee from obtaining the express consent in writing of Landlord to any
further transfer. Any further transfer shall require the written consent of Tenant and any previous transferee except that Tenant and any transferee hereunder expressly waive their right to consent to
any further transfer of the premises on their behalf by Landlord. The consent by Landlord to a sublease or assignment shall not in any way be construed to release Tenant from any liability whether
past, present or future under this lease or to release Tenant from any liability under this lease because of Landlord's failure to give notice of default under or in respect to any of the terms,
covenants, conditions, provisions or agreements of this lease. Notwithstanding the consent of Landlord to an assignment or sublease, Tenant shall remain liable for payment of all bills rendered by
Landlord for the rent and other charges incurred by the transferee for services and materials supplied to the demised premises. If Tenant is a corporation which, under the then current guidelines
published by the Commissioner or Corporations of the State of California, is not deemed a public corporation, or if Tenant is an unincorporated association or a partnership, the transfer, assignment,
or hypothecation of any stock or interest in such corporation, association or partnership in excess of twenty-five (25%) percent shall be deemed a proposed transfer within the meaning of this Article,
including the requirement of obtaining Landlord's prior written consent. LANDLORD HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING, OR TRANSFER OF THIS LEASE BY TENANT TO ANY CORPORATION RESULTING FROM A
CONSOLIDATION, OR TO THE SURVIVING CORPORATION IN CASE OF A MERGER, TO WHICH CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER TENANT SHALL BE A PARTY, OR TO ANY BANK ACQUIRING ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF TENANT,

Tenant shall pay as rent during the extended term the fair market rental value which is deemed to be the rental rate then being offered to prospective tenants for

shall the rent for the extended term be less than the herein rental rate paid by Tenant for the premises for the last month of the initial ten (10)&nbsp;year term of this Lease. The determination of
such fair market rental value shall take into consideration all the elements which are generally and usually considered in the real estate industry to establish a fair market rental value for
comparable premises, including but not limited to the size and location of the premises, the quality and extent of the improvements existing in the premises, operating cost and tax increases, cost of
living and other rental adjustments, the location of the premises in the Building, the floor height of the premises and other economic factors generally allowed a tenant in such market for comparable
premises, such as a free rent allowance, provided that the determination of fair market rental value shall not include any imputation of monetary value to fair market rental factors not a constituent
part of the extension option, such as, for example, a reduction of rental for a brokerage commission where Landlord has no obligation to pay such commission, or a reduction for a relocation allowance,
or a tenant improvement allowance based on unimproved or raw space. In any event the fair market rental value of the premises shall be determined by employing sound business judgment and generally
accepted appraisal practices, and shall be established in accordance with Landlord's then standard leasing practices for premises based upon the rentable area. Escalations under Article&nbsp;20 for
the taxes and operating expenses, and the Metrorail and Pershing Square Benefit Assessments, and any charges under other provisions of this Lease, shall be passed through to Tenant in addition to the

shall appoint a real estate appraiser with at least five (5)&nbsp;years full-time commercial appraisal experience in the area in which the Premises are located to appraise and set the rent for the
extended term based upon the foregoing formula. If a party does not appoint an appraiser within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the other party has given notice of the name of its appraiser, the single
appraiser appointed shall be the sole appraiser and shall set the rent for the extended term. If the two (2)&nbsp;appraisers are appointed by the parties as stated in this paragraph, they shall meet
promptly and attempt to set the rent for the extended term. If they are unable to agree within 30 days after the second appraiser has been appointed, they shall elect a third appraiser meeting the
qualifications stated in this Paragraph within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the last day of the thirty (30) day period given the two appraisers to set the rent. Each of the parties shall bear one-half
(1/2) of the cost of appointing a third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee. The third appraiser, however selected, shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for
either party. Within thirty (30) days after selection of the third appraiser, a majority of the appraisers shall set the rent for the extended term. If the majority of the appraisers are unable to set
the rent within the stipulated period of time, the two (2)&nbsp;appraisals that are closest in amount shall be added together and </FONT></P>
