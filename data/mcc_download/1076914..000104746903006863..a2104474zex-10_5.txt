      From and after the execution of this Amendment, as of the Effective Date,
the Loan Agreement is amended as follows:


            A.


                                       1
<Page>

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. Upon the execution of this Amendment, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Lender either (i) a standby letter of credit in the amount of
$4,000,000.00 naming the Lender as beneficiary, issued by a commercial bank
acceptable to the Lender and otherwise in form and substance acceptable to the
Lender, in the Lender's sole discretion, or (ii) the sum of $4,000,000.00 in
cash (the "CASH COLLATERAL") to be held as additional Collateral for the
Liabilities.
                  1.
      If the Borrowers deliver:
                  a.    A standby letter of credit, it shall be a so-called
                        "CLEAN L/C" which permits the Lender to draw thereon at
                        any time upon presentation of an appropriate sight
                        draft, without certification by the Lender of any kind;
                  b.    The Cash Collateral, then the Cash Collateral shall
                        be maintained on deposit in an account in the
                        Lender's name, and may be applied, offset, and
                        otherwise liquidated by the Lender at any time,
                        without further notice to the Borrowers, and the
                        proceeds applied in reduction of the Liabilities
                        (including, without limitation, principal, interest,
                        fees, and costs and expenses) in such order as the
                        Lender, in its sole discretion, may determine.
                  2.
      In either case, the proceeds of any drawing under the standby letter of
      credit or the Cash Collateral may be applied in reduction of the
      Liabilities (including, without limitation, principal, interest, fees, and
      costs and expenses) in such order as the Lender, in its sole discretion,
      may determine.
                  3.
      In either case, the Lender shall furnish the Lead Borrower with notice
      reasonably promptly after such drawing, application, offset or liquidation
      of the manner in which the proceeds therefrom have been applied.
                  4.
      The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to the Lender, or cause to be
      executed and delivered to the Lender, whatever additional documents,
      instruments, and agreements that the Lender may require in order to
      effect, perfect, or vest the standby letter of credit or the Cash
      Collateral more securely in the Lender.

            B.
AVAILABILITY RESERVES. Through the close of business on Tuesday, April 15, 2003,
the Aggregate amount of all outstanding Availability Reserves shall be reduced
to an overriding aggregate amount of $1,000,000.00, after giving effect to the
$750,000.00 overriding reduction implemented in accordance with Part 2,
Paragraph III (H) of the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement.

            C.
MAXIMUM BALANCE OF REVOLVING CREDIT.      Upon the satisfaction of all

<Page>

Preconditions to Effectiveness, Part 3, below, and thereafter:
                  1.
      The temporary overadvance facility implemented pursuant to the Fourth
      Amendment to the Loan Agreement shall terminate. Loans, advances, and
      other financial accommodations shall only be granted in accordance with
      Availability and the other terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit as
      set forth in the Loan Agreement;
                  2.
      At no time shall the outstanding balance of the Liabilities, including
      existing cash-collateralized Standby L/C's in the aggregate amount of
      $3,350,000 and any additional L/C's, ever exceed $11,350,000.00.
            D.
TERMINATION OF REVOLVING CREDIT. The Revolving Credit and any obligation of the
Lender to make loans and advances, or to otherwise grant financial
accommodations, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers shall terminate at the
close of business on Tuesday, April 15, 2003. From and after that date and time:
                  1.
      Unless expressly extended in writing by the Lender in the Lender's sole
      discretion, all Liabilities shall be due and payable in full, without
      demand, notice or protest, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
      Borrowers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT any Early Termination Fee shall be
      waived by the Lender in the event that immediately upon such termination,
      the Borrowers repay all of the Liabilities and discharge all of their
      obligations on account of such termination (as to which, see Section
      13:13-2 of the Loan Agreement) with the proceeds of a financing from a
      third party which has provided the Borrowers with a financing commitment
      with advance rates (inclusive of all applicable reserves used to determine
      the amount available to the Borrowers under such financing commitment)
      which provide the Borrowers with greater availability on the same assets
      than are offered by the Lender either under the then existing Loan
      Agreement or under any modification thereto proposed by the Lender;
                  2.
      In the absence of such an agreement in writing, the Lender may, in its
      discretion, either:
                  a.    Forbear from making demand for, and accelerating
                        payment of the Liabilities and otherwise forbear from
                        enforcing the Lender's Rights and Remedies; or
                  b.    Make demand for, and accelerate payment of the
                        Liabilities and otherwise commence enforcing the
                        Lender's Rights and Remedies at any time, or from time
                        to time, without further notice to the Borrowers.
            E.

Amendment, the Borrowers shall comply with the following financial
performance covenants:

      PART 2.     UPDATED BUSINESS PLAN

      On or before March 1, 2003, the Borrowers shall present to the Lender (i)
an updated 13-week cash flow projection for the succeeding 13 weeks, and (ii) a
business plan with respect to the Borrowers' projected business operations for
the succeeding 12 months (collectively, the "BUSINESS PLAN"). The Borrowers
warrant and represent to the Lender that the Business Plan shall represent the
Borrowers' good faith and reasonable estimation of the projected financial
performance of the Borrowers' business for the periods set forth therein and
will be based upon estimates and assumptions stated therein, all of which the
Borrowers shall believe to be reasonable and fair in light of conditions and
facts known to management of the Borrowers as of the date of the preparation
thereof (it being understood and acknowledged by the Lender that such financial
performance as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as
representations or warranties that such events will occur, and that actual
results may differ from such projected financial performance).
            G.
Upon receipt of the Business Plan, the Lender and the Borrowers shall endeavor
to determine whether, and on what terms and conditions, the Loan Agreement may
be amended so as to facilitate continued borrowings thereunder by the Borrowers.
In this regard, the Borrowers acknowledge and agree that:
                  1.
      No terms and conditions have yet to be agreed upon by the Lender;
                  2.
      The terms and conditions of any continued loan arrangement may be
      substantially different than those contained in the Loan Agreement at this
      time;
                  3.
      There is no commitment or obligation of the Lender to agree to any
      terms and conditions for the amendment and extension of the Loan
      Agreement; and
                  4.
      If the Lender and the Borrowers do reach agreement in principle with
      respect to


                                       5
<Page>

      an amendment and extension of the Loan Agreement, no such agreement to so
      amend and extend the Loan Agreement shall take effect unless and until all
      necessary internal approvals have been obtained by the Lender and an
      agreement in writing has been executed on behalf of the Lender and the
      Borrowers.
            H.
If the Lender and the Borrower are unable to reach a mutually acceptable
agreement with respect to the amendment and extension of the Loan Agreement, or
if the Lender determines, in the Lender's sole discretion, not to undertake any
such agreement, then the Borrowers shall undertake to immediately repay all
Liabilities in full. Without limiting the ability of the Lender to exercise its
rights and remedies as provided in Part 1, Paragraph (A)(1)(b), above, in all
events and under all circumstances, unless extended in writing by the Lender, in
the Lender's sole discretion, all Liabilities shall be paid in full on or before
the close of business on Wednesday, May 15, 2003.



      PART 3.     PRECONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS:

      This Amendment shall not take effect unless and until each and all of the
following have been consummated, all on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Lender, in the Lender's sole and exclusive discretion:

            1.    The Borrowers have completed the transaction involving the (i)
                  formation of dELiA*s Brand, LLC as a single purpose,
                  bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lead

                  Borrowers' trademarks, tradenames, and other intellectual
                  property assets;
            2.    The receipt by the Borrowers of the sum of $16,500,000 as
                  the "Advance" under the Master License Agreement; and

                  the documents, instruments, and agreements that the Lender may

conditions of the Loan Documents. The Borrowers and Guarantors further
acknowledge and agree that, except as specifically modified in this Amendment,
all terms and conditions of the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and

The Borrowers represent and warrant that there is not presently pending or
threatened by or against any of the Borrowers any suit, action, proceeding, or
investigation which, if determined adversely to any of the Borrowers, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
      III..
The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that there is no basis nor set of facts on
which any amount (or any portion thereof) owed by the Borrowers or any Guarantor
under any Loan Document could be reduced, offset, waived, or forgiven, by
rescission or otherwise; nor is there any claim, counterclaim, offset, or
defense (or other right, remedy, or basis having a similar effect) available to
any of the Borrowers or to any Guarantor with regard thereto; nor is there any

The Borrowers agree that upon the filing of any Petition for Relief by or
against any one or more of the Borrowers under the United States Bankruptcy
Code, the Lender shall be

<Page>

entitled to immediate and complete relief from the automatic stay, and the
Lender shall be permitted to proceed to protect and enforce its contractual and
state law rights and remedies. The Borrowers hereby expressly assent to any
motion filed by the Lender seeking relief from the automatic stay. The Borrowers
further hereby expressly WAIVE the protections afforded under Section 362 of the

not the Lender is otherwise making loans and advances to the Borrowers at that
time.
