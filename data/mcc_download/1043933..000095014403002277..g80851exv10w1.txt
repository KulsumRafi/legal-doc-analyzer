                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of January 9,
2003, by and among PALADYNE CORP., a Delaware corporation (together with each of
its predecessor corporations, the "Company"); GLEN H. HAMMER, an individual
resident of the State of Georgia ("Hammer"); A. RANDALL BARKOWITZ, an individual
resident of the State of Georgia ("Barkowitz"); WAG HOLDINGS, LLC, a Georgia
limited liability company ("WAG Holdings" and collectively with Hammer and
Barkowitz, the "Buyers"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein are defined in Section 10 hereof.

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company wishes to sell to the Buyers, and the Buyers wish to buy
from the Company, a number of newly issued shares (the "Purchased Shares") of
the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"),
such that, immediately following the issuance of such shares, the Buyers shall
own seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, determined
on a fully-diluted basis giving effect to the issuance, if any, of shares to
Terrence J. Leifheit or the other former shareholders of e-commerce support
centers, inc. ("ecom") pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated December 21, 2000, among the Company, ecom and the former
shareholders of ecom, as amended (excluding the exercise of any outstanding
options and warrants to acquire Common Stock at a price equal to or greater than
$.55 per share) and the conversion of all other outstanding securities of the
Company convertible into Common Stock (except where such conversion requires the
payment to the Company of at least $.55 per share of Common Stock); and

         WHEREAS, in connection with the sale of the Purchased Shares, and in
order to enable WAG Holdings and Hammer to prevent dilution of their respective
ownership interests in the Company upon the potential exercise of certain
warrants issued to Gibralter Publishing, Inc. ("Gibralter") in exchange for the
cancellation of debt as more fully described in Section 3(k) hereof, the Company
and the Buyers have agreed that WAG Holdings and Hammer will each receive
warrants to purchase 1,166,666 shares of Common Stock (on a post-Reverse Split
basis), at a price per share equal to the average closing price of one share of
Common Stock on the Principal Market over the five trading days commencing on
the first trading day following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split, which
warrants shall be in the form of Exhibit A (the "Ancillary Warrants" and
collectively with the Purchased Shares, the "Acquired Securities");

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company
and the Buyers hereby agree as follows:

<PAGE>

         1.       PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK.

                  (a)      Agreement to Sell and to Purchase Common Stock. At
the Closing (as hereinafter defined), and on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall issue and sell to each
Buyer a portion of the Purchased Shares determined for such Buyer in accordance
with the allocation methodology set forth on Schedule 1(a), and such Buyer shall
purchase and accept such portion of the Purchased Shares from the Company.

                  (b)      Purchase Price and Payment. The aggregate purchase
price for the Purchased Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall be $750,000. At the
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be paid to the Company as follows:

                           (i)      Barkowitz shall pay to the Company an amount
         equal to his pro-rata share of the Purchase Price, based upon the
         number of Purchased Shares to be purchased by him as a fractional
         portion of the total number of Purchased Shares to be purchased by all
         of the Buyers ("Pro-Rata Share"), in immediately available funds by
         wire transfer to a Company bank account to be designated by the Company
         (such designation to occur no later than the third Business Day prior
         to the Closing Date) (the "Company Account"), provided, that, at his
         option, Barkowitz may pay all or a portion of such amount by
         cancellation of indebtedness (principal and/or accrued but unpaid
         interest) owed by the Company or ecom pursuant to the Loan Agreement
         (as defined below), which indebtedness may have been assigned to him
         prior to the Closing;

                           (ii)     WAG Holdings and Hammer shall pay to the
         Company the balance of the Purchase Price as follows:

                           (1)      First, by cancellation of all indebtedness
                  (principal and accrued but unpaid interest) owed by the
                  Company or ecom to WAG Holdings and Hammer, pursuant to that
                  certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 29,
                  2002 (the "Loan Agreement"), by and among the Company, ecom
                  and Market Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (f/k/a
                  Market Central, Inc, hereinafter "Market Holdings"), as
                  amended, which indebtedness has been assigned to WAG Holdings
                  and Hammer as co-lenders, and which has not been subsequently
                  assigned by them, with each of WAG Holdings and Hammer
                  receiving credit for fifty percent (50%) of such cancelled
                  indebtedness;

                           (2)      Second, by the cancellation of all or a
                  portion of any obligations of the Company or any of its
                  subsidiaries currently due to third party obligees that are
                  purchased by WAG Holdings, Hammer or their respective
                  affiliates from such third party obligees prior to, or
                  simultaneously with, the Closing (with credit toward the
                  Purchase Price being given to WAG Holdings or Hammer, as the
                  case may be, for the face value of such obligations);

                           (3)      Third, WAG Holdings shall pay to the Company
                  an amount, which when aggregated with the credits to which it
                  is entitled pursuant to clauses (1) and

<PAGE>

                  (2) above, equals its Pro-Rata Share of the Purchase Price, in
                  immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Company
                  Account; and

                           (4)      Fourth, Hammer shall pay to the Company an
                  amount, which when aggregated with the credits to which he is
                  entitled pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) above, equals his
                  Pro-Rata Share of the Purchase Price, in immediately available
                  funds by wire transfer to the Company Account.

                  (c)      Closing and Closing Date. The consummation of the

be an underwriter (as that term is defined in the 1933 Act) may require
compliance with some other exemption under the 1933 Act or the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder.

and know-how (collectively, "Intellectual Property") used in or required for its
respective business as currently conducted, and no claim is pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, threatened, to the effect that
the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary infringe upon or conflict with
the asserted rights of any other person under any Intellectual Property. No
claim is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary,
threatened, to the effect that any such Intellectual Property owned or licensed
by the Company or any Subsidiary, or which the Company or any Subsidiary
otherwise has the right to use, is invalid or unenforceable by the Company or

knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in violation of any
noncompetition or nonsolicitation obligation with any prior employer.

                  (n)      Compliance with Laws. To the knowledge of the Company
or any Subsidiary, the Company and the Subsidiaries (including each and all of

offer or sale of securities, discrimination in employment, the Americans with
Disabilities Act, occupational safety and health, trade practices, competition
and pricing, product warranties, zoning, building and sanitation, employment,
unemployment, retirement and labor relations and product advertising, except
where the failure to so comply has not had, and cannot reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director,
officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, in the
course of its actions for, or on behalf of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity; made
any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government
official or employee from corporate funds; violated any provision of the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended; or made any unlawful bribe,
rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment to any
foreign or domestic government official or employee. Since September 1, 2000,
all reports and returns required to be filed by the Company or any Subsidiary
with any governmental authority have been filed and were accurate and complete
in all material respects when filed, except where the failure to file has not
had, and cannot reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o)      Personal Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have good and marketable title to all personal property owned by them which is
material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free
and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects except such as are described in
Schedule 3(o). All personal property and assets owned or utilized by the Company
and the Subsidiaries are in normal operating condition and repair (ordinary wear
and tear excepted), free from any defects (except such minor defects as do not
interfere with the use thereof in the conduct of normal operations), have been
maintained in a

<PAGE>

manner consistent with the standards generally followed in the Company's
industry and are sufficient to carry on the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

                  (p)      Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
owns, or has ever owned, any real property. Schedule 3(p) annexed hereto
contains a complete and accurate list of any real property lease binding the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the "Leases") and all termination dates,
renewal options and dates by which notice of renewal or cancellation, as
applicable, must be given with respect to such Leases. Each such Lease is in
full force and effect, and the Company or the Subsidiary party to such Lease has
fully performed, in all respects material thereto, all of its obligations to be
performed to date under such Lease. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3(p), the
Company or the Subsidiary party to each such Lease is current with respect to
the payment of all rents and other charges due thereunder and their use and
occupancy of the premises which are the subject matter of such Lease do not

any policy of insurance held by the Company or any Subsidiary, and to the
knowledge of Terrence J. Leifheit (without special inquiry), is in conformity
with all applicable building, zoning, health, fire, safety and other laws,
ordinances, codes and regulations. To the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, all of the buildings, structures and appurtenances situated on any
premises that is subject to any of the Leases are, and as of the Closing Date,
will be, in good operating condition and state of maintenance and repair and
will be adequate and suitable for the purposes for which they are presently
being or are intended to be used, and the Company or the Subsidiary party to
such Lease has adequate rights of ingress and egress and utility services for
the operation of its business in the ordinary course. To the knowledge of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no lessor or landlord under any Lease is in
default in the performance of its obligations thereunder and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has received notice from any such lessor or landlord of its
intention to exercise any option thereunder which would adversely affect or
terminate the use or occupancy of the demised premises under such Lease by the
Company or such Subsidiary. Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 3(e),
all of the Leases permit the consummation of the Transactions contemplated
hereby without modification of the terms thereof and without the consent of the
applicable lessor or landlord.

                  (q)      Insurance. Schedule 3(q) attached hereto contains a
complete and accurate list and brief description (specifying the insurer, the
policy number or covering note number with respect to binders and the amount of
any deductible, describing each pending claim thereunder of more than
$10,000.00, setting forth the aggregate amounts paid out under each such policy
through the date hereof and the aggregate limit, if any, of the insurer's
liability thereunder) of all policies or binders of fire, liability, product
liability, worker's compensation, automobile, unemployment and other insurance

Subsidiary has paid all premiums due on such policies, and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any provision contained in any
such policy or binder. Except for claims set forth on Schedule 3(q), there are
no outstanding unpaid claims under any such policy or binder. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice of cancellation or
non-renewal of any such policy or binder. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3(q),
none of the policies listed on Schedule 3(q) provides that

<PAGE>

premiums paid in respect of the periods prior to the Closing Date may be
adjusted or recomputed based on claims-paying experience of such policies or
otherwise. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
notice from any of their insurance carriers that any insurance coverage listed
on Schedule 3(q) will not be available in the future on the same terms as now in
effect or that any premium with respect thereto will be increased in the future.
To the best knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no notice to
such effect has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
verbal or other non-written form.

                  (r)      Regulatory Permits. The Company and its Subsidiaries
possess all certificates, authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate
federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their
respective businesses, except where the failure to possess any such certificate,
authorization or permit has not had, and cannot reasonably be expected to have,
a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has
received any written notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit. To the best
knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no notice of such
proceedings has been received by the Company or any such Subsidiary in verbal or
other non-written form.

                  (s)      Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans. Except as
disclosed in the SEC Documents, as required by applicable law, as contemplated
by this Agreement, or as set forth Schedule 3(s), since May 31, 2002, there has

         former employees, officers or directors of the Company or any
         Subsidiary or with respect to which the Company or its

         of the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
         connection with which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is or would

         Benefit Plan, under the Code or any other applicable law, rule or
         regulation, domestic or foreign. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has incurred or would reasonably be expected to incur any

         business taxable income. The Company has no material liability to the
         IRS with respect to any Benefit Plan, including any liability imposed
         by Chapter 43 of the Code.

                           (iii)    Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate

                           (iv)     Except as set forth on Schedule 3(t) or as
         contemplated by this Agreement, the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not (A)
         require the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to pay greater compensation
         or make a larger contribution to, or pay greater benefits or accelerate
         payment or vesting of a benefit under, any Benefit Plan or (B) create
         or give rise to any additional vested rights or service credits under
         any Benefit Plan.

                           (v)      Except for requirements under applicable
         law, as set forth on Schedule 3(t) or as contemplated by this
         Agreement, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to or
         is bound by any severance agreement, program or policy.

                           (vi)     Except as set forth on Schedule 3(t), no
         Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without limitation, death or
         medical benefits, beyond termination of employment or retirement other
         than (A) coverage mandated by law or (B) death or retirement benefits
         under a Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
         Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is contractually obligated
         to provide any person with life, medical, dental or disability benefits
         for any period of time beyond retirement or termination of employment,
         other than as required by the provisions of Sections 601 through 608 of
         ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

                           (vii)    With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an
         employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
         (A) no such Benefit Plan is funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as
         such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, (B) each such
         Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan", as such term is defined in
         Section 5000(b)(l) of the Code, complies in all respects with the
         applicable requirements of Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA and
         Section 4980B(f) of the Code, and (iii) each such Benefit Plan
         (including any such Plan covering retirees or other former employees),
         as in effect on the date hereof, may be amended or terminated as to
         future benefit accruals without material liability to the Company or
         any ERISA Affiliate on or at any time after the Closing Date.

                           (viii)   Except as disclosed on Schedule 3(t), and
         except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there is no
         contract, agreement, Benefit

<PAGE>

         Plan or other arrangement covering any employee or former employee of
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would give rise to the
         payment of any amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G
         of the Code.

                           (ix)     To the knowledge of the Company, no event
         has occurred or circumstance exists that would result in a material
         increase in premium costs of any Benefit Plan that is insured, or a
         material increase in benefit costs of such Plan that is self-insured.

                           (x)      Other than claims for benefits submitted by
         participants or beneficiaries, no claim against, or legal proceeding
         involving, any Benefit Plan is pending or, to the knowledge of the
         Company, is threatened which, if adversely determined, would
         individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           (xi)     Each current or former employee of the
         Company who has taken a leave of absence under the Family and Medical
         Leave Act of 1994, as amended, was, upon his or her return to
         employment with the Company, placed in the same position with respect
         to all eligibility requirements and benefits of any Benefit Plan as had
         been applicable to such employee immediately before the leave
         commenced, except where the failure to so comply would not have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (u)      Tax Matters. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3(u),
the Company and each Subsidiary has filed all Tax Returns that the Company or
such Subsidiary has been required to file. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete when filed, and the Company does not know of any facts or circumstances
that would require an amendment to be filed with respect to any such Tax
Returns. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3(u), all material Taxes owed by the
Company or any Subsidiary (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3(u), no claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company
or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Except
as disclosed on Schedule 3(u), there are no liens on any of the assets of the
Company or any Subsidiary that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged
failure) to pay any Tax. The Company and each Subsidiary has withheld and paid
all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid by it in connection with

Company or any Subsidiary to compete in any line of business in any geographic
area or to hire any individual or group of individuals, (e) Contracts relating
to any outstanding commitment for capital expenditures in excess of $25,000, (f)

Agreements, (h) Contracts with respect to which a change in the ownership
(whether directly or indirectly) of the shares of Company Common Stock or the

or any of the other Transactions may result in a violation of or default under,
or give rise to a right of termination, modification, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of benefits under, such Contract, (i) any
other agreement of a type required to be filed under Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC; or (j) Contracts (including employment

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound are valid
and binding obligations of the Company or its Subsidiary (as applicable) and, to
the knowledge of the Company, the valid and binding obligation of each other
party thereto. Neither the Company or its Subsidiary (as applicable) nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto is in violation of or in
default in respect of, nor has there occurred an event or condition which with
the passage of time or giving of notice (or both) would constitute a default by
the Company or its Subsidiary (as applicable) (or to its knowledge a default by
any other party thereto) under or permit the termination of, any such Contract,
except for such instances of default thereunder or terminations thereof that
would not individually or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has, prior to the date hereof, delivered or made available true,
complete and correct copies of the Contracts to the Buyers.

                  (w)      Transactions With Affiliates. Except as set forth on

property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any officer or

officer or director has an interest or is an officer, director, trustee or
partner.

including, without limitation, the Company's issuance of the Acquired
Securities, the exercise of the Ancillary Warrants and the ownership by any
Buyer of any of the Acquired Securities or any shares of Common Stock issuable
under the Ancillary Warrants.

         4.       COVENANTS.

                  (a)      Special Meeting. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) call a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company to be held no later than February 28, 2003 (the
"Special Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the Company's
stockholders with respect to: (A) a reverse stock split of the Common Stock (the
"Reverse Split"), pursuant to which the issued and outstanding Common Stock
shall be converted into one-tenth (1/10) of the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Split, (B) the
transactions to be consummated pursuant hereto, including, without limitation,
the issuance and sale of the Purchased Shares and the issuance of the Ancillary
Warrants (collectively, the "Transactions"), and (C) a change in the name of the
Company to "Market Central, Inc." (the "Company Name Change" and collectively
with the Reverse Split and the Transactions, the "Approval Matters"); and shall
(ii) recommend that the Company's stockholders vote to approve each of the
Approval Matters, shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of approving each of the Approval
Matters, and shall take all other action necessary and appropriate to secure the
vote of stockholders approving each of the Approval Matters.

                  (b)      Proxy Statement. The Company and the Buyers shall
furnish to each other all information concerning such Person or such Person's
business that is required for the Proxy Statement. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, prepare and file (after providing the Buyers
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon) the Proxy Statement
with the SEC and shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC (after providing the Buyers with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon); provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC any later than twenty
(20) days following the date of this Agreement (unless the Buyers shall have
failed to cooperate with the preparation thereof as contemplated by this Section
4(b)). The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the
staff of the SEC. The Company shall notify the Buyers promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply the Buyers with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any
of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or any Approval Matter. The Company will cause
the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable
to the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting
(including any requirement to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement). The
Buyers shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and
the Buyers shall promptly furnish to the other such information relating to it
and its affiliates and the

<PAGE>

Approval Matters and such further and supplemental information as may be
reasonably requested by the other party and shall promptly notify the other
party of any change in such information. If at any time prior to the Special
Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail
to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement; provided, however, that no
such amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company
without providing the Buyers the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon and without the approval of the Buyers, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Company and its counsel shall use reasonable efforts
to permit the Buyers and its counsel to participate in all communications with
the SEC and its staff, including all meetings and telephone conferences,
relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or the Approval Matters;
provided, however, that in the event that such participation by the Buyers does
not take place, the Company shall promptly inform the Buyers of the content of
all such communications and the participants involved therein that specifically
relate to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or the Approval Matters. The
Company agrees to include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the
Company's Board of Directors.

                  (c)      Voting Agreement. The parties acknowledge that
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition to Buyers' willingness to enter into this Agreement, Terrence Leifheit
has (i) executed and delivered to Hammer and WAG Holdings a Voting Agreement,
pursuant to which he has agreed to vote all shares of the Company's capital
stock owned by him or otherwise within his power to vote in favor of the
approval of each of the Approval Matters and against any transaction competing
with the Transactions, and (ii) granted to Hammer and WAG Holdings a proxy (with
the power of substitution) with respect to such shares of the Company's capital
stock.

                  (d)      Satisfaction of Closing Conditions. From the date
hereof until the Closing, the Company shall use its best efforts to satisfy, or
cause the satisfaction of, each of the conditions set forth in Section 7 below
as soon as practicable following the date hereof.

                  (e)      Compliance with Regulation D and Blue Sky. The
Company shall, on or before the Closing Date, take such action, if any, as is
necessary in order to obtain an exemption for or to qualify the Acquired
Securities for sale to the Buyers pursuant to this Agreement under Regulation D
promulgated under the 1933 Act and any applicable securities or "Blue Sky" laws
of the states of the United States, and shall provide evidence of any such
action so taken to the Buyers on or prior to the Closing Date. The Company
shall, prior to the Closing Date, make all filings and reports relating to the
offer and sale of the Acquired Securities that are necessary under Regulation D
promulgated under the 1933 Act and any applicable securities or "Blue Sky" laws
of the states of the United States, as the applicable, to perfect such
exemptions or qualifications.

                  (f)      Due Diligence. Prior to the Closing Date, the Buyers
shall be entitled, through their respective employees and representatives,
including, without limitation, their legal counsel and accountants, to make such
investigation of the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company
and each Subsidiary, and such examination of the books, records and

<PAGE>

financial condition of the Company and each Subsidiary as the Buyers wish. Any
such investigation and examination shall be conducted at reasonable times and
under reasonable circumstances, and the Company shall cooperate, and cause each
Subsidiary to cooperate, fully therein. No investigation by the Buyers (or
failure to conduct such an investigation) shall diminish or obviate any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company under this
Agreement, or the Buyers' respective rights under Section 8 below. In order that
the Buyers may have full opportunity to make such business, accounting and legal
review, examination or investigation as it may wish of the business and affairs
of the Company and each Subsidiary, the Company shall furnish, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to furnish, the representatives of the Buyers during such period
with all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of
the Company and each Subsidiary as such representatives may reasonably request
and cause its officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants and
attorneys to cooperate fully with such representatives in connection with such
review and examination. If this Agreement terminates, the Buyers, and their
respective employees and representatives shall keep confidential any information
or documents obtained from the Company concerning its assets, properties,
business and operations, unless readily ascertainable from public or published
information, or trade sources, or subsequently developed by the Buyers or any of
them independent of any investigation of the Company, or received from a third
party not under an obligation to the Company to keep such information
confidential. If this Agreement terminates, any documents obtained by the Buyers
from the Company shall be returned.

                  (g)      Notice of Events; Settlement of Debts. The Company
shall promptly notify the Buyers of (i) any event, condition or circumstance
occurring from the date hereof through the Closing Date that would constitute a
violation or breach of this Agreement, (ii) any event, occurrence, transaction
or other item which would have been required to have been disclosed on any
Schedule or statement delivered hereunder, had such event, occurrence,
transaction or item existed on the date hereof, other than items arising in the
ordinary course of business which would not render any representation or
warranty of the Company inaccurate or misleading, (iii) any lawsuits, claims,
proceedings or investigations which after the date hereof are, to the knowledge
of the Company or any Subsidiary, threatened or commenced against the Company or
any of its officers, directors or employees with respect to the affairs of the
Company, and (iv) any event, occurrence, transaction or other item that could
reasonably be deemed to require a filing by the Company with the SEC of a
Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company shall not settle, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries not to settle, any debts owed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to their respective creditors and suppliers (except for cash
payments of debts that have become due in the ordinary course pursuant to their
original terms), unless the Company shall have obtained the Buyers' prior
written approval of such settlement.

                  (h)      Fees and Expenses. In addition to its own fees and
expenses, the Company shall pay the fees and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other representatives
or consultants) incurred by the Buyers in connection with the negotiation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Such fees and

<PAGE>

expenses shall be paid by the Company promptly upon submission of invoices
therefor by the Buyers and regardless of whether or not the Transactions are
consummated.

                  (i)      No Solicitation. The Company agrees that, for a
period commencing on the date hereof and ending on February 28, 2003 (the
"Exclusivity Period"), neither the Company nor any of its representatives,
directors, officers, stockholders, agents or affiliates (collectively, "Company
Representatives") will (i) entertain or discuss any Acquisition Proposal with
any other party or provide any information to any other party in connection
therewith, or (ii) disclose to any other party the contents of this Agreement or
the details of the transactions contemplated herein, except for such disclosure
required by law or contained in the Proxy Statement; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company or Company Representatives from furnishing information to or entering
into discussions or negotiations with any person or group that makes an
unsolicited written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent
that (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after consultation with a nationally reputed financial advisor
and with independent legal counsel that such proposal is, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith by a majority vote after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to negotiate, or otherwise engage in
discussions, with such third party would be inconsistent with the Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (iii) such person or group, prior to
the disclosure of any non-public information, enters into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company that is not, in any material respect, less
restrictive as to such person or group than the confidentiality restrictions
imposed on the Buyers pursuant to Section 4(f), that contains a standstill
restriction prohibiting such third party and its affiliates from acquiring more
than five percent (5%) of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, and that does
not contain exclusivity provisions which would prevent the Company from
complying with its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4(i)
by any Company Representative, whether or not such person is purporting to act
on behalf of the Company or its directors or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 4(i) by the Company. Except as expressly permitted by
this Section 4(i), the Board of Directors of the Company (or any other committee
thereof) shall not (i) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) cause the Company to accept such Acquisition
Proposal and/or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition
Agreement") related to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors of the Company may take such actions if, and only to the
extent that (A) such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (B) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of the Company
under applicable law, (C) the Company is not in breach of this Section 4(i), and
(D) in the case of clause (ii) above, (I) the Company shall, prior to or
simultaneously with the taking of such action, have paid or pay to the Buyers or
their designee the break-up fee (including payment of Buyers' transaction costs
and expenses) set forth in Section 4(j)(ii) below, (II) the Company shall, prior
to or simultaneously with the taking of such action, have repaid or repay to
Hammer and WAG Holdings the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all loans
made to

<PAGE>

the Company or ecom pursuant to the Loan Agreement, together with any accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, and (III) the Company shall have complied with its
obligations under Section 9(e). In addition, the Company agrees that it will
inform the Buyers of, and provide the Buyers with information regarding, any
Acquisition Proposal or other offers or expressions of interest for the Company.

                  (j)      Break-Up Fees.

                           (i)      Upon the first occurrence of any Adverse
         Event (as defined below), the Company shall pay the Buyers an aggregate
         amount of $100,000 in cash (allocated among the Buyers in proportion to
         the number of Purchased Shares to be purchased by each of the
         respectively hereunder unless otherwise agreed among the Buyers), plus
         all transaction costs and expenses actually incurred by the Buyers in
         connection with the negotiation and attempted consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used herein, the term
         "Adverse Event" means any of the following: (A) the occurrence of any
         breach of the provisions of Section 4(i) above; or (B) the Buyers
         elects to terminate this Agreement because the Buyers determine, in
         their reasonable judgment, that (1) the Company does not own or have
         licenses to use all of the Intellectual Property necessary to conduct
         its business as it has been conducted, (2) there has occurred any
         material adverse change in the business or assets of the Company since
         May 31, 2002 that was not disclosed to the Buyers in writing prior to
         the date hereof, or (C) any material adverse change in the business or
         assets of the Company has occurred since the date hereof.

                           (ii)     Upon the first occurrence of any Triggering
         Event (as defined below), the Company shall pay the Buyers a break-up
         fee in cash in the amount of $100,000 (allocated among the Buyers in
         proportion to the number of Purchased Shares to be purchased by each of
         the respectively hereunder unless otherwise agreed among the Buyers),
         plus all transaction costs and expenses actually incurred by the Buyers
         in connection with the negotiation and attempted consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used herein, the term
         "Triggering Event" means (i) the failure of the Company's Board of
         Directors to recommend to the stockholders of the Company, within
         fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, that the
         stockholders of the Company approve the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the withdrawal by the
         Company's Board of Directors of any such recommendation, (iii) the
         recommendation by the Company's Board of Directors that the
         stockholders of the Company approve any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) the
         execution by the Company of any Acquisition Agreement, or (v) the
         termination of this Agreement by Buyer following a material breach by
         the Company of any of the Company's representations, warranties or
         covenants set forth herein, provided such breach has not been cured
         within twenty (20) days after the Company receives written notice
         specifying such breach.

                  (k)      Lock-Up Option. The Company hereby grants the Buyers
an option (the "Option") to acquire a number of shares of the Common Stock of
the Company equal to 19.9%

<PAGE>

of the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock,
determined on a fully-diluted basis (assuming the conversion of all securities
convertible into Common Stock and the exercise of all options and warrants to
purchase Common Stock) immediately prior to the exercise of the Option, at an
exercise price of $0.07 per share, to be paid in cash (which price shall be
automatically adjusted in accordance with the Reverse Split in the event the
Reverse Split is effected). The Option shall be exercisable in the event that
the Buyers become entitled to a break-up fee or other payment pursuant Section
4(j)(i) or (ii) above, and shall expire upon the first to occur of (i) August
29, 2004, (ii) the date on which the Closing occurs, or (iii) a material breach
by the Buyers of their obligations under this Agreement, which breach shall not
have been cured by the Buyers within thirty (30) days following the Buyers
receipt from the Company of a written notice describing such material breach,
provided, that the Option shall be suspended until such breach is cured. Unless
otherwise agreed among the Buyers, the right to purchase shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Option shall be allocated among the Buyers in proportion to the
number of Purchased Shares that would have been purchased by each of the
respectively hereunder had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement been
consummated on the date the Option is first exercisable. Each Buyer may assign
its rights under the Option to any person or entity in its sole discretion.

                  (l)      Post-Closing Covenants.

                           (i)      Following the Closing, the Buyers agree to
         use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company in generating
         new outbound telemarketing and/or mail opportunities for the Company in
         an amount not less than $350,000 during the first twelve months after
         the Closing.

                           (ii)     Following the Closing, the Buyers agree to
         cause the Company to adopt a new Stock Option Plan, pursuant to which
         employees of the Company will be given new options to purchase Common
         Stock.

                           (iii)    Following the Closing, the Company shall, at
         the request of the Buyers, register the Purchased Shares and the shares
         of Common Stock issuable under the Ancillary Warrants, pursuant the
         1933 Act for resale by the Buyers or their assigns.

                  (m)      Make-Whole Covenant.

                           (i)      If at any time following the Closing it is
         determined by the Buyers that any of the representations and warranties
         of the Company set forth in Section 3(a) or (c) above were inaccurate
         as of the Closing, the Company shall thereafter, within three (3)
         Business Days following the Company's receipt of a written demand from
         the Buyers, and without requiring additional consideration to be paid
         by the Buyers, issue to the Buyers (in proportion to the number of
         Purchased Shares issued to each of them at the Closing) additional
         shares of Common Stock such that the aggregate number of shares of
         Common Stock issued to the Buyers pursuant to this Section 4(m) and
         Section 1(a) above, if all such shares had been issued to the Buyers at
         the Closing, would have been sufficient to give the Buyers a number of
         shares of Common Stock equal to at least the Adjusted Percentage (as
         defined below) of the number of shares of Common Stock

<PAGE>

         outstanding as of the Closing, determined on a fully-diluted basis
         after considering the facts and circumstances upon which the Buyers
         have determined that such representations and warranties were
         inaccurate as of the Closing, but in all cases excluding the exercise
         of any options or warrants to acquire Common Stock at a price equal to
         or greater than $.55 per share (determined prior to the Reverse Split),
         which options or warrants were outstanding as of the Closing, and the
         conversion of any securities of the Company convertible into Common
         Stock, which convertible securities were outstanding as of the Closing,
         and where such conversion would have required the payment to the
         Company of at least $.55 per share of Common Stock (determined prior to
         the Reverse Split).

                           (ii)     As used herein, the term "Adjusted
         Percentage" shall initially mean seventy percent (70%); provided, that
         such percentage shall be adjusted and readjusted, as of the date of any
         demand by Buyers for such adjustment or readjustment, as follows: (A)
         if it is discovered that the Company or ecom had, as of the Closing,
         any contractual obligation to make cash payments or other distributions
         based on the value of the Company and/or ecom (including, without
         limitation, any obligation to redeem capital stock and any obligation
         under outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights
         granted by the Company or ecom), then the Adjusted Percentage shall be
         adjusted or readjusted, as the case may be, to equal a percentage
         equivalent to a fraction, (I) the numerator of which is equal to
         seventy percent (70%) of the combined net book value of the Company and
         ecom, ignoring the effect of such payments or distributions, and (II)
         the denominator of which is equal to the combined net book value of the
         Company and ecom reduced by the amount of all such payments or
         distributions (assuming such payments or distributions are made as of
         the date of such adjustment or readjustment); and (B) if it is
         discovered that the Company does not own all of the issued and
         outstanding capital stock ecom, on a fully-diluted basis, then the
         Adjusted Percentage shall be adjusted to equal a percentage equivalent
         to a fraction, (I) the numerator of which is equal to the Adjusted
         Percentage (following any adjustment required pursuant to clause (A)
         above), and (II) the denominator of which is equal to the actual
         percentage of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ecom owned by
         the Company as of the Closing, on a fully-diluted basis.

                           (iii)    The Company acknowledges and agrees that,
         pursuant to this Section 4(m), the Buyers may demand additional shares
         or adjustment of the Adjustment Percentage at any time, and from time
         to time. The covenant set forth in this Section 4(m) is not intended to
         limit any obligation of the Company to indemnify the Buyers pursuant to
         Section 8 below for any breach of the Company's representations or
         warranties contained herein, and the limits on the Company's indemnity
         obligations set forth in Section 8 below shall not be construed to
         limit the Company's obligations under this Section 4(m). Any shares of
         Common Stock issued to the Buyers pursuant to this Section 4(m) shall
         be deemed to be "Purchased Shares" for all purposes under this
         Agreement.

<PAGE>

         5.       TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS.

         On the Closing Date, the Company shall issue irrevocable instructions
to the Transfer Agent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyers, to issue
a certificate in the name of each Buyer for the Purchased Shares being purchased
by such Buyer hereunder (the "Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions"). The
Company warrants to the Buyers that no instruction other than the Irrevocable
Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 5, will be given by the
Company to the Transfer Agent with respect to the Purchased Shares (other than
stop transfer orders enforcing the restrictions on transfer set forth in the
restrictive legend set forth below) and that the Purchased Shares shall
otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and
to the extent provided in this Agreement. The certificates issued in the names
of the Buyers representing the Purchased Shares shall not bear any restrictive
legend except for the following:

                  THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED HEREBY WERE ISSUED AND SOLD WITHOUT
         REGISTRATION UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
         "FEDERAL ACT"), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE, IN RELIANCE UPON
         CERTAIN EXEMPTIVE PROVISIONS OF SAID ACTS, PARTICULARLY INCLUDING
         SECTION 10-5-9(13) OF THE GEORGIA SECURITIES ACT OF 1973, AS AMENDED.
         SAID SECURITIES CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED UNLESS SUCH SALE OR
         TRANSFER IS MADE: (1) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
         UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH
         REGISTRATION; AND (2) IN A TRANSACTION WHICH IS EXEMPT UNDER APPLICABLE
         STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
         STATEMENT UNDER SUCH LAWS, OR IN A TRANSACTION WHICH IS OTHERWISE IN
         COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

         6.       CONDITIONS TO THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS.

         The obligation of the Company hereunder to sell the Purchased Shares is
subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions on or before the
Closing Date; provided that these conditions are for the Company's sole benefit
and may be waived by the Company at any time in its sole discretion by providing
the Buyers with prior written notice thereof:

                  (a)      The Buyers shall have executed each of the
Transaction Documents and delivered the same to the Company.

                  (b)      The representations and warranties of each Buyer
shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date when made and
as of the Closing Date as though made at that time (except for representations
and warranties that speak as of a specific date), and each Buyer shall have
performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with the covenants,
agreements and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed, satisfied
or complied with by such Buyer at or prior to the Closing Date.

<PAGE>

         7.       CONDITIONS TO THE BUYER'S OBLIGATION.

         The obligation of the Buyers to purchase Purchased Shares under this
Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions on
or before the Closing Date; provided that these conditions are for the Buyers'
benefit only and may be waived by the Buyers at any time in their absolute
discretion by providing the Company with prior written notice thereof:

                  (a)      Trading in the Common Stock shall not have been
suspended by the SEC or the Principal Market.

                  (b)      The stockholders of the Company shall have approved
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation,
the sale of the Purchased Shares pursuant to Section 1 above, the issuance of
the Ancillary Warrants, the Reverse Split and the Company Name Change.

                  (c)      The Company shall have executed each of the
Transaction Documents and delivered the same to the Buyers.

penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith

written agreement for such Alternative Transaction in the form to be entered
into (it being understood that if such form changes prior to termination of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company will notify the Buyers
thereof), (II) at least two (2) full Business Days after the Board of Directors
of the Company has provided the initial notice required by clause (I) above, the

termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9(e), and (III) upon
delivery of the termination notice referred to in clause (II) above, (A) the

Hammer and WAG Holdings the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all loans
made pursuant to the Loan Agreement, together with any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon.

         If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the foregoing, then except

pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate without further liability
of any party to the other; provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 9
shall relieve the liability or obligations hereunder of any party (the
"Defaulting Party") to the other party or parties (each, a "Non-Defaulting
Party") on account of a breach by the Defaulting Party of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty of the Defaulting Party contained herein,
including, without limitation, any liability of the Company pursuant to Section
4(j) above; (ii) the option granted by the Company to the Buyers in Section 4(k)
above shall survive any such termination; and (iii) the Buyers' obligations of
confidentiality set forth in Section 4(f) shall survive any such termination.

approved such payments. In each instance, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain such approval from such court.

                  (p)      Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay
in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or privilege.
