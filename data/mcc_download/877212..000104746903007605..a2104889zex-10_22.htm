<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Plan is to provide retirement benefits for certain selected Executives of the Adopting Employer, in combination with any other retirement
benefit plans, agreements or arrangements, whether qualified or otherwise, offered by the Adopting Employer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOPE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan is intended as a statement of agreement between certain selected Executives under which, in consideration of the continued satisfactory service of said
Executives, the Adopting Employer agrees to pay, when due, certain retirement and other benefits. This Plan shall be binding on the Adopting Employer and any successors to the business of the Adopting
Employer and shall inure to the benefit of the Participants and, if applicable, their spouses and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing
herein contained, and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind nor a fiduciary relationship between the
Adopting Employer and any Executive, Executive's surviving spouse or dependents, Executive's estate or Executive's beneficiaries or any other person. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
reserves or liabilities set up on the Adopting Employer's books of account with respect to any retirement or other benefits to be paid under the Plan shall continue for all purposes
to be a part of the general funds or assets of the Adopting Employer. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Adopting Employer under this Plan, such right shall be
no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Adopting Employer. </FONT></P>

the Participant's account pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1 of the Plan as of the date a Hardship Benefit is distributed or utilized at such times as the Adopting Employer shall determine, and the
Participant's Benefit shall be reduced by the amount so distributed and/or utilized. "Financial Hardship" shall mean dire, unforseen, financial emergency of the Participant which cannot be reasonably
relieved by (1)&nbsp;reimbursement by insurance or otherwise, or (2)&nbsp;liquidation of the Participant's assets to the extent that such liquidation would not in itself cause a financial

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise noted, the duration and form of benefits under this Plan shall be payable in accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Plan,
including those elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement such as the vesting schedule thereunder and the method in which the Benefit is to be paid. The foregoing notwithstanding, a
Participant who retires on or after the Participant's Normal Retirement Age, may request at the time of deferral that the Participant's Retirement Benefit under this Plan be annual installments over
no more than 15&nbsp;years. The Adopting Employer may grant or deny any such request in its sole discretion. Installment payments made under this Plan will fluctuate in amount as necessary to take
into account the additional crediting of earnings pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.3 of the Plan after the commencement of Benefit payments. In general, the amount of each annual installment shall be
equal to the remaining value of the Participant's Benefit divided by the number of remaining installments due the Participant, subject to any rights of offset or other adjustments provided for under
the terms of this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing

GENERAL PROVISIONS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FUNDING  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is intended as an unfunded plan of supplementary retirement Benefits. The Adopting Employer intends to establish appropriate reserves for the Plan on its
books of account in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such reserves shall be, for all purposes, part of the general funds of the Adopting Employer and no Participant, spouse,
beneficiary, or other person claiming a right under the Plan shall have any interest, right or title to such reserves. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHT TO AMEND, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adopting Employer reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan by action of its Board of Directors without the
consent of any Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or other person claiming a right under the Plan. No amendment of the Plan shall reduce the vested Benefits of any Participant as of the date of
amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EFFECT OF TERMINATION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Plan is terminated, Benefits accrued and payable to Participants, former Participants entitled to Benefits, retired Participants and spouses
or beneficiaries shall be limited to amounts vested and accrued as of the date of termination and shall not be subject to crediting of any further earnings. All such vested and accrued amounts shall
be distributed to Participants, former Participants entitled to Benefits, retired Participants and spouses or beneficiaries in a lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after the termination of
the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHTS TO BENEFITS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall have any right to a Benefit under the Plan except as such Benefit has accrued to such person in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and then
such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Adopting Employer. Neither the establishment of the Plan, the designation of any Participant, nor any provisions
of the Plan shall be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employment of the Adopting Employer or as an Executive of the Adopting Employer. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Adopting Employer, at its discretion, may acquire an insurance policy or policies insuring the life of a Participant from which it can satisfy its obligations to make payments
pursuant to this Plan. However, it is expressly understood that such contract (or contracts) if acquired, does not create any account or funds separate from the ordinary assets of the Adopting
Employer,and no Participant, Participant's spouse, or Participant's beneficiary may look to any such contract as the funds from which benefits under this Plan are to be paid. Any such contract so
acquired for the convenience of the Adopting Employer shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Adopting Employer, with the Adopting Employer named as applicant, owner, and beneficiary of any
life insurance contract payment; provided further, any such contract shall not be held in trust or as collateral security for the benefit of a Participant, a Participant's spouse, or a Participant's
beneficiary, nor is any representation made herein that such contract, if acquired, will be used to provide benefits under this Plan. No Participant, Participant's spouse, or Participant's beneficiary
shall have any beneficial ownership interest in, or preferred or other claim against, the life insurance contract, if acquired. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Plan, benefits other than distribution of the Participant's deferral contributions shall cease to be paid to any Participant who discloses
confidential information or trade secrets concerning the Adopting Employer without the Adopting Employer's consent, or engages in any activity that is materially damaging to the Adopting Employer. </FONT></P>
