         was in the best interest of the Company and (B) in the event of a
         dispute concerning the application of this provision, no claim by the
         Company that Cause exists shall be given effect unless the Company

of the Plan, the text shall control.

3.       ELIGIBILITY

         To be eligible to receive Benefits under the Plan, an individual must
(i) be an Employee on the Employment Termination Date, (ii) incur an Involuntary
Termination and (iii) execute and deliver to the Plan Administrator a Release
Agreement provided to the Participant by the Plan Administrator. An individual
who is classified by the Company as an independent contractor is not eligible to
participate in the Plan (even if he is subsequently reclassified by the Internal
Revenue Service or a court as a common law employee of the Company and the
Company acquiesces to the reclassification).

4.       BENEFITS

         The Company shall provide a Participant who has satisfied the
eligibility requirements of Section 3 the Benefits described below. No Benefits
will be deemed to have accrued prior to a Participant's Employment Termination
Date, and no rights to Benefits will be deemed to have vested until the
occurrence of an Involuntary Termination.

         Further details of the Benefits described in this Section 4 are
provided in Exhibit A. Subject to the provisions of Section 14, the Plan
Administrator may, from time to time, modify the Benefits to reflect changes in
the compensation grade system or for changes in the Benefits approved by the
Board.

                  (a)      BASE COMPENSATION. The Company will pay the
         Participant a cash severance benefit based on the Participant's Base
         Compensation at the Employment Termination Date, with the amount of the
         Base Compensation benefit determined in accordance with the relevant
         provisions of Exhibit A. Notwithstanding the measurement of Base
         Compensation on an annual basis, a Participant's Base Compensation for
         the month in which the Participant's Employment Termination Date occurs
         will be used in determining the Base Compensation benefit. A
         Participant's Base Compensation severance benefit will be paid in a
         single sum cash payment in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.

                  (b)      MEDICAL, DENTAL AND VISION INSURANCE. If a
         Participant and his spouse and dependents are participating in a group
         health plan sponsored by the Company on the Participant's Employment
         Termination Date, the Participant and his spouse and dependents have
         the right to continue medical, dental and vision coverage for the time
         periods provided by COBRA. Unless the Participant timely and properly
         elects the COBRA continuation coverage, medical, dental and vision
         coverage will automatically cease as of the Participant's Employment
         Termination Date. For the first three months of the Participant's COBRA
         continuation coverage, the Company will pay directly to the provider
         the cost of the COBRA continuation coverage, and thereafter the
         Participant will be responsible for the payment of the cost for the
         continued coverage.

                  (c)      OUTPLACEMENT. Each Participant shall be entitled to
         outplacement assistance at the expense of the Company determined in
         accordance with the relevant provisions of Exhibit A. No cash will be
         paid in lieu of outplacement fees and costs.

         will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
         plan, and all benefits, contributions or disbursements, if any, under
         these plans will be paid to the Participant in accordance with the
         provisions of the respective plan.

                  (d)      EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. The Participant's

         Participant would have been entitled to benefits under the Company's
         post-retirement health care or life insurance plans as of his

         post-retirement health care or life insurance benefits to the
         Participant and the Participant's dependents in accordance with the
         terms of such plans (including any amendment and termination provisions

         assistants, home computers and office accessories similar to the office
         accessories available to the Participant in his employment office and
         monthly Internet connection fees) and any other perquisites that may be
         provided by the Company from time to time. A Participant may, at his
         option, purchase any of his club memberships held in the Company's name
         at the fair market value and on the terms mutually agreed by the
         Participant and the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator will
         determine the fair market value of any such membership. The Plan
         Administrator reserves the right to deduct the payment for the club
         memberships from any Benefits to be paid in cash as provided in Section
         6.

                  (b)      COMPANY PROPERTY. No later than the Participant's
         Employment Termination Date (unless the Plan Administrator agrees
         otherwise in writing), the Participant shall return to the Company any
         company-owned property, including, but not limited to, credit cards,
         documents, files, computers, cellular telephones, personal digital
         assistants and any other company property of any kind or nature, in
         Participant's possession as of his Employment Termination Date.

                  (c)      EXPENSE ACCOUNT. Within thirty (30) days after the
         Participant's Employment Termination Date and in accordance with the
         Company's then current expense reimbursement policy, the Participant
         will prepare and submit a final expense account reimbursement request
         for expenses incurred prior to his Employment Termination Date. If, as
         a result of the final expense account reimbursement request, the
         Participant owes the Company, then the Company reserves the right to
         deduct any such amount from any Benefits to be paid in cash as provided
         in Section 6.

6.       TIME OF BENEFITS PAYMENTS

         The Company shall pay the Participant the cash Benefits described in
clause (a) of Section 4 and clause (a) of Section 5 in a single sum cash payment
within thirty (30) days after the Participant's Release Agreement becomes
irrevocable. If the Company subsequently determines that additional monies are
due and payable to the Participant as Benefits described in clause (a) of
Section 4 or clause (a) of Section 5, the Company will pay any such unpaid
Benefits to the Participant, together with interest on the unpaid Benefits from
the date the single sum cash payment was made at the annual rate of 120% of the
rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code within ten (10) business days
of discovering that the additional monies are due and payable. If the Benefits
paid to the Participant are subsequently determined to exceed the amount of
Benefits the Participant should have received, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the Participant, payable within ten (10) business days
after demand by the Company, together with interest from the date the single sum
cash payment was made at the annual rate of 120% of the rate provided in section
1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code, but only to the extent such amount has not been
previously paid by the Participant.

7.       WITHHOLDING

         The Company may withhold from any Benefits paid under the Plan all
federal and state income, FICA and other employment taxes, and any other amounts
required or permitted to be withheld under any agreement with the Participant,
applicable law or other employee benefit plans of the Company.

8.       RIGHT OF OFFSET

         By accepting Benefits under the Plan, a Participant agrees that the
Company, in its sole discretion, may deduct from any Benefits payable in cash to
the Participant under the Plan any amounts owed to the Company by the
Participant.

9.       REDUCTION FOR OTHER SEVERANCE BENEFITS; NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS;
         STATUTORY SEVERANCE

         9.1      REDUCTION FOR OTHER SEVERANCE BENEFITS. The amount of the
Benefits to which a Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, of any other severance payments payable to the
Participant by the Company under any other plan, program or individual
contractual arrangement.

         9.2      NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan shall prevent
or limit the Participant's continuing or future participation in any benefit,
bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the Company for which the
Participant may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or reduce such rights
as the Participant may have under any agreements with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.1. Amounts which are
vested benefits or which the Participant is otherwise entitled to receive under
any plan or program of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be payable in
accordance with such plan or program.

         9.3      STATUTORY SEVERANCE. If any benefits obligations are required
to be paid to a Participant in conjunction with severance of employment under
the laws of the country where the Participant is employed or under federal,
state or local law, the Benefits paid to the Participant will be deemed to be in
satisfaction of any statutorily required benefit obligations.

10.      DEATH OF PARTICIPANT

         If a Participant dies after his Employment Termination Date but before
the Participant receives full payment of the Benefits to which he is entitled,
any unpaid Benefits will be paid to the Participant's surviving spouse, or if
the Participant does not have a surviving spouse, to the Participant's estate.

11.      NON-COMPETE; NO SOLICITATION; CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

         In consideration for the payment of the Benefits to the Participant,
the Participant shall not engage in any of the activities described in this
Section 11.

         11.1     NON-COMPETE. During the period commencing with the
Participant's Employment Termination Date and ending on the second anniversary
of such date, the Participant shall not, without the written consent of the
Company, at any time, directly or indirectly, become employed by, serve as a
director of, or render advisory or consulting or other services in connection
with any Competitor or in any capacity engage or participate in any activity as
a Competitor.

         11.2     NO SOLICITATION. During the period commencing with the
Participant's Employment Termination Date and ending on the second anniversary
of such date, the Participant shall not, directly or indirectly,

         (a)      interfere with the relationship of the Company or any
Affiliate with, or endeavor to entice away from the Company or any Affiliate,
any individual or entity who was or is a material customer or material supplier
of, or maintained a material business relationship with the Company or its
Affiliates;

         (b)      establish (or take preliminary steps to establish) a business
with, or cause or attempt to cause others to establish (or take preliminary
steps to establish) a business with, any employee or agent of the Company or any
of its Affiliates, if such business is or will compete with the Company or any
of its Affiliates; or

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.13

         (c)      employ, engage as a consultant or adviser, or solicit the
employment, engagement as a consultant or adviser, of any employee or agent of
the Company or any of its Affiliates, or cause or attempt to cause any
individual or entity to do any of the foregoing.

         11.3     CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of the
Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant may have had access
to or received Confidential Information. Each Participant is obligated to keep
confidential all such Confidential Information, except that any Participant may
disclose the Confidential Information (i) in connection with enforcing his
rights under the Plan or if compelled by law, and in either case, the
Participant shall provide written notice to the Company prior to the disclosure
or (ii) if the Company provides written consent prior to the disclosure.

12.      UNFUNDED ARRANGEMENT

         The Plan is only a general corporate commitment of the Company, and
each Participant must rely upon the general credit of the Company for the
fulfillment of its obligations hereunder. Under all circumstances, the rights of
Participants to any asset held by the Company will be no greater than the rights
expressed in the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a
guarantee by the Company that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to
pay any Benefit under the Plan or would place the Participant in a secured
position ahead of general creditors of the Company. The Participants are only
unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to their Benefits, and the Plan
constitutes a mere promise by the Company to make Benefit payments in the
future. No specific assets of the Company have been or shall be set aside, or
shall in any way be transferred to a trust or shall be pledged in any way for
the performance of the Company's obligations under the Plan which would remove
such assets from being subject to the general creditors of the Company.

13.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         13.1     PLAN ADMINISTRATOR. Baker Hughes shall be the "Plan
Administrator" and the "named fiduciary" for purposes of ERISA and shall be
subject to service of process on behalf of the Plan.

         13.2     RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL. The members of a Committee shall
serve at the pleasure of the Board; they may be officers, directors, or
employees of the Company or any other individuals. At any time during his term
of office, any member of a Committee or any individual serving as Plan
Administrator may resign by giving written notice to the Board, such resignation
to become effective upon the appointment of a substitute or, if earlier, the
lapse of thirty days after such notice is given as herein provided. At any time
during its term of office, and for any reason, any member of a Committee or any
individual serving as Plan Administrator may be removed by the Board.

         13.3     RECORDS AND PROCEDURES. The Plan Administrator shall keep
appropriate records of its proceedings and the administration of the Plan and
shall make available for examination during business hours to any Participant,
former Participant or the beneficiary of any Participant or former Participant
such records as pertain to that individual's interest in the Plan. If a
Committee is performing duties as the Plan Administrator, the Committee shall
designate the individual or individuals who shall be authorized to sign for the
Plan Administrator and, upon such designation, the signature of such individual
or individuals shall bind the Plan Administrator.

         13.4     SELF-INTEREST OF PLAN ADMINISTRATOR. Neither the members of a
Committee nor any individual Plan Administrator shall have any right to vote or
decide upon any matter relating solely to himself under the Plan or to vote in
any case in which his individual right to claim any benefit under the Plan is
particularly involved. In any case in which the any Committee member or
individual Plan Administrator is so disqualified to act, the other members of
the Committee shall decide the matter in which the Committee member or
individual Plan Administrator is disqualified.

         13.5     COMPENSATION AND BONDING. Neither the members of a Committee
nor any individual Plan Administrator shall receive compensation with respect to
their services on the Committee or as Plan Administrator. To the extent required
by applicable law, or required by the Company, neither the members of a
Committee nor any individual Plan Administrator shall furnish bond or security
for the performance of their duties hereunder.

         13.6     PLAN ADMINISTRATOR POWERS AND DUTIES. The Plan Administrator

terms and provisions hereof and shall have all powers necessary to accomplish
these purposes, including, but not by way of limitation, the right, power, and
authority:

                  (a)      to make rules, regulations, and bylaws for the

         and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Plan Administrator;

                  (b)      to construe in its discretion all terms, provisions,
         conditions, and limitations of the Plan;

                  (c)      to correct any defect or to supply any omission or to

         for the proper and efficient administration of the Plan;

                  (e)      to determine in its discretion all questions relating
         to eligibility;

                  (f)      to determine whether and when a Participant has
         incurred a Termination of Employment, and the reason for such
         termination; and

                  (g)      to make a determination in its discretion as to the
         right of any individual to a Benefit under the Plan and to prescribe
         procedures to be followed by Participants, former Participants or
         beneficiaries in obtaining Benefits hereunder.

         13.7     RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS, ETC. The Plan
Administrator may rely on any certificate statement or other representation made
on behalf of the Company, any Employee or any Participant, which the Plan
Administrator in good faith believes to be genuine, and on any certificate,
statement, report or other representation made to it by any agent or any
attorney, accountant or other expert retained by it or the Company in connection
with the operation and administration of the Plan.

14.      AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         The Board shall have the right to amend or terminate the Plan, in whole
or in part, for any reason; provided, however, no amendment or termination of
the Plan after a Participant's Employment Termination Date shall affect the
Benefits payable to the Participant.

15.      CLAIMS REVIEW PROCEDURES; CLAIMS APPEALS PROCEDURES

         15.1     CLAIMS REVIEW PROCEDURES. When a Benefit is due, the
Participant (or the person entitled to Benefits under Section 10) should submit
a claim to the office designated by the Plan Administrator to receive claims.
Under normal circumstances, the Plan Administrator will make a final decision as
to a claim within sixty (60) days after receipt of the claim. If the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant in writing during the initial 60-day period,
it may extend the period up to 120 days after the initial receipt of the claim.
The written notice must contain the circumstances necessitating the extension
and the anticipated date for the final decision. If a claim is denied during the
claims period, the Plan Administrator must notify the claimant in writing, and
the written notice must set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the
claimant:

                  (a)      the specific reason or reasons for the denial;

                  (b)      specific reference to the Plan provisions on which
         the denial is based;

         a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA.

         If a decision is not given to the Participant within the claims review
period, the claim is treated as if it were denied on the last day of the claims
review period.

         15.2     CLAIMS APPEALS PROCEDURES. For purposes of this section the
Participant or the person entitled to Benefits under Section 10 are referred to
as the "claimant"). If the claim of the claimant made pursuant to Section 15.1
is denied and he wants a review, he must apply to the Plan Administrator in
writing. That application can include any arguments, written comments,
documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. In
addition, the claimant is entitled to receive on request and free of charge
reasonable access to and copies of all information relevant to the claim. For
this purpose, "relevant" means information that was relied on in making the
benefit determination or that was submitted, considered or generated in the
course of making the determination, without regard to whether it was relied on,
and information that demonstrates compliance with the Plan's administrative
procedures and safeguards for assuring and verifying that Plan provisions are
applied consistently in making benefit determinations. The Plan Administrator
must take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information
submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether the
information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
The claimant may either represent himself or appoint a representative, either of
whom has the right to inspect all documents pertaining to the claim and its
denial. The Plan Administrator can schedule any meeting with the claimant or his
representative that it finds necessary or appropriate to complete its review.

         The request for review must be filed within 90 days after the denial.
If it is not, the denial becomes final. If a timely request is made, the Plan
Administrator must make its decision, under normal circumstances, within 60 days
of the receipt of the request for review. However, if the Plan Administrator
notifies the claimant prior to the expiration of the initial review period, it
may extend the period of review up to 120 days following the initial receipt of
the request for a review. All decisions of the Plan Administrator must be in
writing and must include the specific reasons for its action, the Plan
provisions on which its decision is based, and a statement that the claimant is
entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and
copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the
claimant's claim for benefits, and a statement of the claimant's right to bring
an action under section 502(a) of ERISA If a decision is not given to the
claimant within the review period, the claim is treated as if it were denied on
the last day of the review period.

16.      EXTENSION OF PLAN TO EMPLOYERS

                  (a)      With the written approval of the Plan Administrator,
         any entity that is an Affiliate may adopt the Plan by appropriate
         action of its board of directors or noncorporate counterpart, as
         evidenced by a written instrument executed by an authorized officer of
         such entity or an executed adoption agreement (approved by the board of
         directors or noncorporate counterpart of the Affiliate), agreeing to be
         bound by all the terms, conditions and limitations of the Plan except
         those, if any, specifically described in the adoption instrument, and
         providing all information required by the Plan Administrator. The Plan
         Administrator and the adopting Affiliate may agree to incorporate
         specific provisions relating to the operation of the Plan that apply to
         the adopting Affiliate only and shall become, as to such adopting
         Affiliate and its employees, a part of the Plan.

                  (b)      The provisions of the Plan may be modified so as to
         increase the obligations of an adopting Affiliate only with the consent
         of such Affiliate, which consent shall be conclusively presumed to have
         been given by such Affiliate unless the Affiliate gives the Company
         written notice of its rejection of the amendment within 30 days after
         the adoption of the amendment.

                  (c)      The provisions of the Plan shall apply separately and
         equally to each adopting Affiliate and its employees in the same manner
         as is expressly provided for the Company and its employees, except

                                       12

<PAGE>

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.13

         that the power to appoint or otherwise affect the Plan Administrator
         and the power to amend or terminate the Plan shall be exercised by
         Baker Hughes. The Plan Administrator shall act as the agent for each
         Affiliate that adopts the Plan for all purposes of administration
         thereof.

                  (d)      Any adopting Affiliate may, by appropriate action of
         its board of directors or noncorporate counterpart, terminate its
         participation in the Plan. Moreover, the Plan Administrator may, in its
         discretion, terminate an Affiliate's participation in the Plan at any
         time.

                  (e)      The Plan will terminate with respect to any Affiliate
         that has adopted the Plan pursuant to this Section if the Affiliate
         ceases to be an Affiliate or revokes its adoption of the Plan by
         resolution of its board of directors or noncorporate counterpart
         evidenced by a written instrument executed by an authorized officer of
         the Affiliate. If the Plan terminates with respect to any Affiliate,
         the employees of that Affiliate will no longer be eligible to be
         Participants in the Plan.

                  (f)      For purposes of the Code and ERISA, the Plan as
         adopted by the Affiliates shall constitute a single plan rather than a
         separate plan of each Affiliate.

                  (g)      The document which evidences the adoption of the Plan
         by an Affiliate shall become a part of the Plan. However, neither the
         adoption of the Plan by an Affiliate nor any act performed by it in
         relation to the Plan shall ever create a joint venture or partnership
         relation between it and any other Affiliate.

17.      MISCELLANEOUS

         17.1     PLAN NOT AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. The adoption and maintenance
of the Plan is not a contract between the Company and its employees that gives
any employee the right to be retained in its employment. Likewise, it is not
intended to interfere with the rights of the Company to terminate an employee's
employment at any time with or without notice and with or without cause or to
interfere with an employee's right to terminate his employment at any time.

         17.2     ALIENATION PROHIBITED. No Benefits hereunder shall be subject
to anticipation or assignment by a Participant, to attachment by, interference
with, or control of any creditor of a Participant, or to being taken or reached
by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or liability of a
Participant prior to its actual receipt by the Participant. Any attempted
conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge, or encumbrance of the
Benefits hereunder prior to payment thereof shall be void.

         17.3     SEVERABILITY. Each provision of this Agreement may be severed.
If any provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that
determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision.

         17.4     BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding upon any
successor of the Company.

         17.5     ARBITRATION. Any controversy arising out of or relating to the
Plan, including without limitation, any and all disputes, claims (whether in
tort, contract, statutory or otherwise) or disagreements concerning the
interpretation or application of the provisions of the Plan, Company's
employment of Participant and the termination of that employment, shall be
resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Employee Benefit Plan Claims
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") then in
effect. No arbitration proceeding relating to the Plan may be initiated by
either the Company or the Participant unless the claims review and appeals
procedures specified in Section 15 have been exhausted. Within ten (10) business
days of the initiation of an arbitration hereunder, the Company and the
Participant will each separately designate an arbitrator, and within twenty (20)
business days of selection, the appointed arbitrators will appoint a neutral
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Employee Benefit Plan Claims
Arbitrators. The arbitrators shall issue their written decision (including a
statement of finding of facts) within thirty (30) days from the date of the
close of the arbitration hearing. The decision of the arbitrators selected
hereunder will be final and binding on both parties. This arbitration provision
is expressly made pursuant to and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-

                                       13

16 (or replacement or successor statute). Pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal
Arbitration Act, the Company and any Participant agrees that any judgment of the
United States District Court for the District in which the headquarters of Baker
Hughes is located at the time of initiation of an arbitration hereunder shall be
entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. Nothing in this Section
17.5 shall be construed to, in any way, limit the scope and effect of Section
13. In any arbitration proceeding full effect shall be given to the rights,
powers, and authorities of the Plan Administrator under Section 13.

         17.6     GOVERNING LAW. All provisions of the Plan shall be construed
in accordance with the laws of Texas, except to the extent preempted by federal
law and except to the extent that the conflicts of laws provisions of the State
of Texas would require the application of the relevant law of another
jurisdiction, in which event the relevant law of the State of Texas will
nonetheless apply, with venue for litigation being in Houston, Texas.

                            INTERNATIONAL SUPPLEMENT

1.       GENERAL. The provisions of this Supplement apply to individuals who are
         employees of non-United States Employers. The provisions of the Plan
         apply to the Non-US Employees (as defined below), except to the extent
         this Supplement modifies Plan provisions.

         The purpose of this Supplement is to provide for severance benefits for
         Non-US Employees in the event of an Involuntary Termination.

         Capitalized terms used in this Supplement which are defined in the Plan
         have the same meaning in this Supplement unless such terms are defined
         differently for purposes of this Supplement. The definition of terms
         defined in this Supplement apply only to this Supplement and not to
         other parts of the Plan.

2.       DEFINITIONS. Section 2.1 of the Plan is modified to add the following
         definitions to read as follows:

              "NON-US EMPLOYEE" means an individual (i) employed by the Company
              in an executive salary grade system (under the Company's then
              current payroll system categories) with its operations or
              principal place of business located outside of the United States
              and (ii) specified by the Plan Administrator as eligible to
              participate in the Plan.

              "NON-US PARTICIPANT" means a Non-US Employee who is eligible to
              participate in the Plan.

3.       ELIGIBILITY. Section 3 of the Plan is modified in the first sentence to
         read as follows:

              "To be eligible to receive Benefits under the Plan, an individual
              must (i) be a Non-US Employee, (ii) be a Non-US Employee on his
              Employment Termination Date, (iii) incur an Involuntary
              Termination and (iv) execute and deliver to the Company a Release
              Agreement provided to the Non-US Participant by the Company;
              provided, however, if such Release Agreement is a violation of the
              laws of the jurisdiction applicable to the Non-US Participant,
              then, at the discretion of the Company, the Release Agreement may
              be modified to comply with the laws of the jurisdiction."

4.       BENEFITS. Section 4 of the Plan is modified in the first paragraph to
         read as follows:

              "The Company shall provide a Non-US Participant who has satisfied
              the eligibility requirements of Section 3 such severance benefits
              under the Plan as the Plan Administrator determines in accordance
              with the provisions of Exhibit A, taking into consideration any
              prohibitions or restrictions and any statutorily mandated
              severance benefits applicable to the Non-US Participant, with the
              intent of providing the Non-US Participant Benefits that are
              generally comparable to the Benefits provided to Participants
              under the Plan. It is the express intent of the Company that any
              Benefits paid to a Non-US Participant under this Supplement and
              the Plan will be in lieu of any statutorily-mandated severance
              benefits (or other employment termination related benefits),
              including, but not limited to, gratuity and similar benefits. No
              Benefits will be deemed to have accrued prior to a Non-US
              Participant's Employment Termination Date, and no rights to
              Benefits will be deemed to have vested until the occurrence of an
              Involuntary Termination."

5.       TIME OF BENEFITS PAYMENTS. Section 6.1 of the Plan is modified to read
         as follows:

              "Any cash Benefits payable to the Non-US Participant will be paid
              by the Company in a single sum cash payment, payable within thirty
              (30) calendar days after the Non-US Participant's Release
              Agreement becomes irrevocable (or, if there is no Release
              Agreement, within thirty (30) calendar days after the Non-US
              Participant's Employment Termination Date). If the Company
              subsequently determines that additional monies are due and payable
              to the Non-US Participant as cash Benefits, the Company will pay
              any such unpaid Benefits to the Non-US Participant, together with
              interest on the unpaid Benefits from the date the single sum cash
              payment was made at the annual rate of 120% of the rate provided
              in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code within ten (10) business days
              of discovering that the

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.13

              additional monies are due and payable. If the Benefits paid to the
              Non-US Participant are subsequently determined to exceed the
              amount of Benefits the Non-US Participant should have received,
              such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Non-US
              Participant, payable within ten (10) business days after demand by
              the Company, together with interest from the date the single sum
              cash payment was made at the annual rate of 120% of the rate
              provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code, but only to the
              extent such amount has not been previously paid by the Non-US
              Participant."

6.       WITHHOLDING.  Section 7 of the Plan is modified to read as follows:

              "The Company shall withhold from any Benefits paid under the Plan
              and this Supplement any amounts required or permitted to be
              withheld under any agreement with the Non-US Participant,
              applicable law or other employee benefit plans of the Company."

         not extend to claims which a person does not know or suspect to exist
         in his favor at the time of executing the release which, if known by
