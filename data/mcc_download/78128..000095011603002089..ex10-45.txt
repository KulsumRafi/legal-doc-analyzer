<PAGE>

         The Company will maintain such records in connection with the
Construction Project as to permit ready identification of the Facilities and the
Cost of improvement thereof.

         SECTION 3.02. Issuance of Bonds.

                  (a) To provide funds for payment of the Cost of the
Construction Project, the Authority will issue and sell the Series A Bonds and
deliver the proceeds thereof to the Trustee. All proceeds received from said
sale shall be deposited in the Series A Project Fund. The Company hereby
approves all of the terms, provisions and other details of the Series A Bonds
and the Indenture.

                  (b) To provide funds for payment of the Cost of the Refunding
Project, the Authority will issue and sell the Series B Bonds and deliver the
proceeds thereof to the Trustee. All proceeds received from said sale shall be
deposited in the Series B Project Fund. The Company hereby approves all of the
terms, provisions and other details of the Series B Bonds and the Indenture.

         SECTION 3.03. Payments From Project Funds.

                  (a) In the Indenture, the Authority has authorized and
directed the Trustee to make payments from the Series A Project Fund to pay the
Cost of the Construction Project upon receipt of Requisitions signed by an
Authorized Company Representative, setting forth the matters required pursuant
to Exhibit "B" to the Indenture.

                  (b) In the Indenture, the Authority has authorized and
directed the Trustee to transfer from the Series B Project Fund the Escrow Agent
the amount required to effect the redemption of the 1992 Bonds pursuant to the
Refunding Project.

         SECTION 3.04. Requisitions. The Company will cause Requisitions from
the Series A Project Fund to be submitted to the Trustee as may be necessary to
effect payments out of the Series A Project Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture; provided, however, that the Company will not submit
any Requisition for payment of any item not properly included in the "cost" of
the Construction Project as defined in the Act or not properly included in the
"Cost" of the Project as defined in the Indenture or which, if paid, would
result in less than 95% of the proceeds from the Series A Bonds being used to
construct improvements to the Facilities.

         SECTION 3.05. Plans and Specifications. The Company may revise the
Plans and Specifications at any time and from time to time prior to the
Completion Date, provided that in the case of a change the amount of which, when
aggregated with the amount of all prior changes by the Company to the Plans and
Specifications, exceeds three percent (3%) of the principal amount of the Series
A Bonds (the "Threshold Amount"), (a) an Authorized Company Representative shall
certify to the Trustee that the Facilities provided for by the revised Plans and
Specifications will constitute facilities for the furnishing of water meeting
the requirements of Section 142(a)(4) of the Code; and (b) the Trustee shall be
furnished with a Favorable Opinion that the revision of the Plans and
Specifications and the expenditure of moneys from the Series A Project Fund to


                                       5
<PAGE>

pay the Cost of the Construction Project in accordance with the revised Plans
and Specifications will not adversely affect the exclusion of interest on the
Series A Bonds from gross proceeds of the holders thereof for federal income
purposes. The amount of any change to the Plans and Specifications with respect
to which the requirements of clauses (a) and (b) have been satisfied shall not
be included in determining whether the sum of changes to the Plans and
Specifications has exceeded the Threshold Amount.

         SECTION 3.06. Completion of Construction Project. When the Construction
Project has been completed, the Company shall so notify the Authority and the
Trustee by a certificate of an Authorized Company Representative. Such
certificate shall establish the Completion Date and shall state that, except for
amounts retained by the Trustee at the Company's direction for any Costs of the
Construction Project not then due and payable or the liability for payment of
which is being contested or disputed by the Company, construction of
improvements to the Facilities has been completed substantially in accordance
with the Plans and Specifications, and all labor, services, materials and
supplies used therefor have been paid for. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
certificate may state that it is given without prejudice to any rights against
third parties which exist at the date thereof or which may subsequently come
into being.

         SECTION 3.07. Company to Pay Additional Amounts If Required. The
parties acknowledge that the Construction Project is comprised of a number of
discrete components that are independent of one another. If the Company has
commenced a discrete component of the Construction Project and the moneys in the
Series A Project Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the Costs of such component
of the Construction Project undertaken by the Company, the Company will complete
such component of the Construction Project and pay all Costs of Construction in
excess of the moneys available in the Series A Project Fund. The Authority does
not make any warranty, either express or implied, that the moneys which will be
paid into the Series A Project Fund will be sufficient to pay the Costs of the
Construction Project. If the Company shall pay any portion of the Costs of the
Construction Project pursuant to the provisions of this Section, it shall not be
entitled to any reimbursement therefor from the Authority, the Trustee or the
holders of any of the Series A Bonds, nor shall it be entitled to any diminution
in or postponement of the Construction Loan Repayments required in Section 4.02
hereof to be paid by the Company.

         SECTION 3.08. Investment of Amounts in the Series A Project Fund. Any
moneys held in the Series A Project Fund shall be invested or reinvested as
provided in Article VI of the Indenture. The Company shall not request any
investment of such moneys which would be in violation of the covenant of the
Authority contained in the final paragraph of Section 6.03 of the Indenture.

established for the redemption of the Series A Bonds, as the case may be, an
amount which, together with other moneys available for the purpose in the Series
A Debt Service Fund under the Indenture, will equal the sum of (x) the interest
which will become due on such date on the Series A Bonds; plus (y) the principal
amount of the Series A Bonds, if any, maturing on such date; plus (z) the
principal amount of and premium, if any, on the Series A Bonds, if any, to be
redeemed on such date; and (ii) on any date on which the Series A Bonds shall be
declared to be and shall become due and payable prior to their stated maturity
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of the principal or redemption price of and interest so becoming due and
payable on the Series A Bonds (all of the foregoing are collectively referred to
herein as the "Construction Loan Repayments").

         Nothing herein contained shall be construed as imposing on the
Authority or on the Trustee any duty or responsibility of giving any prior
notice to the Company of the due date of any Construction Loan Repayment
hereunder, or of the amount on deposit in the Series A Debt Service Fund, or of
the amount of any credits available to the Company against any Construction Loan
Repayment, and failure by the Company to receive any such prior notice, even if
customarily given by the Authority or the Trustee, shall not relieve the Company
of its obligation to make any Construction Loan Repayment when it is due and
payable.

         All such payments shall be made in immediately available funds at the
place of payment on the payment date in question. The Company shall have the
option to make prepayment, from time to time, in whole or in part, of any amount
due with respect to the Construction Loan, together with interest accrued and to
accrue with respect to such prepayment. The Authority shall direct the Trustee
in writing to apply such prepayments to the purchase or redemption of Series A
Bonds in such manner, consistent with the provisions of the Indenture, as may be
directed by the Company.

         In the event the Company shall fail to make any of the payments
required in this Section, such payment so in default shall continue as an
obligation of the Company until the amount in default shall have been fully
paid, and the Company will pay the same with interest thereon from the due date
until paid at the highest rate per annum borne by the Series A Bonds.

         The obligation of the Company to make Construction Loan Repayments
hereunder is subject to acceleration as set forth in Section 7.02 hereof.

         It is intended that the Company shall make Construction Loan Repayments
hereunder at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient to enable the
Authority to make full and timely payment of principal or Redemption Price of,
and interest on, the Series A Bonds. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, if for any reason the amounts paid by the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.02(a) or pursuant to the other provisions of
this Agreement, together with any other amounts available therefor under the
Indenture, are at any time insufficient to make payments of the principal or
Redemption Price of and interest on the Series A Bonds when due, whether at
maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, the Company will pay to
the Trustee forthwith the amount required to make up such deficiency.

                  (b) Refunding Loan Repayments. The Company shall pay to the
Authority, as and for the repayment of the Refunding Loan, (i) on the second
Business Day prior to each Interest Payment Date, maturity date or date
established for the redemption of the Series B Bonds, as the case may be, an
amount which, together with other moneys available for the purpose in the Series
B Debt Service Fund under the Indenture, will equal the sum of (x) the interest
which will become due on such date on the Series B Bonds; plus (y) the principal
amount of the Series B Bonds, if any, maturing on such date; plus (z) the
principal amount of and premium, if any, on the Series B Bonds, if any, to be
redeemed on such date; and (ii) on any date on which the Series B Bonds shall be
declared to be and shall become due and payable prior to their stated maturity
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of the principal or redemption price of and interest so becoming due and
payable on the Series B Bonds (all of the foregoing are collectively referred to
herein as the "Refunding Loan Repayments").

         Nothing herein contained shall be construed as imposing on the
Authority or on the Trustee any duty or responsibility of giving any prior
notice to the Company of the due date of any Refunding Loan Repayment hereunder,
or of the amount on deposit in the Series B Debt Service Fund, or of the amount
of any credits available to the Company against any Refunding Loan Repayment,
and failure by the Company to receive any such prior notice, even if customarily
given by the Authority or the Trustee, shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to make any Refunding Loan Repayment when it is due and payable.



                                       8
<PAGE>

         All such payments shall be made in funds which will be immediately
available funds at the place of payment on the payment date in question. The
Company shall have the option to make prepayment, from time to time, in whole or
in part, of any amount due with respect to the Refunding Loan, together with
interest accrued and to accrue with respect to such prepayment. The Authority
shall direct the Trustee in writing to apply such prepayments to the purchase or
redemption of Series B Bonds in such manner, consistent with the provisions of
the Indenture, as may be directed by the Company.

         In the event the Company shall fail to make any of the payments
required in this Section, such payment so in default shall continue as an
obligation of the Company until the amount in default shall have been fully
paid, and the Company will pay the same with interest thereon from the due date
until paid at the highest rate per annum borne by the Series B Bonds.

         The obligation of the Company to make Refunding Loan Repayments
hereunder is subject to acceleration as set forth in Section 7.02 hereof.

         It is intended that the Company shall make Refunding Loan Repayments
hereunder at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient to enable the
Authority to make full and timely payment of principal or Redemption Price of,
and interest on, the Series B Bonds. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, if for any reason the amounts paid by the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) or pursuant to the other provisions of
this Agreement, together with any other amounts available therefor under the
Indenture, are at any time insufficient to make payments of the principal or
Redemption Price of and interest on the Series B Bonds when due, whether at
maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, the Company will pay to
the Trustee forthwith the amount required to make up such deficiency.

                  (c) Other Amounts. The Company agrees to make additional
payments as follows:

                           (i) to the Authority on the date of issuance and
delivery of the 2002 Bonds, a loan closing fee of $27,700 with respect to the
Loans (less $2,000 of such fee paid by the Company to the Authority as a deposit
upon submission of the Company's financing application for the Projects);

                           (ii) to the Authority upon its submission of an
invoice therefor to the Company from time to time, an annual fee and a
termination fee of such amount as the Authority may customarily charge from time
to time;

                           (iii) to the Authority upon its written request at
any time, an amount equal to the reasonable expenses incurred by the Authority
in enforcing the provisions of this Agreement or the Indenture, or incurred in
defending any action or proceeding with respect to the Facilities, this
Agreement, the Tax Compliance Agreement or the Indenture and not otherwise
required to be paid by the Company under this Agreement;

                           (iv) to the Trustee upon its written request, an
amount equal to the reasonable fees and charges of the Trustee for its services
and the reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with the Indenture and
this Agreement (including without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of
any attorneys retained by the Trustee), in accordance with any separate
agreement between the Company and the Trustee with respect thereto; and

                            (v) to the Trustee, for deposit to the credit of the
Series A Rebate Fund or the Series B Rebate Fund established under the
Indenture, any amount required to be deposited in such Rebate Fund pursuant to
the Indenture and the Tax Compliance Agreement at the times required under the
Indenture and the Tax Compliance Agreement.

         SECTION 4.03. Security For Payment.

                  (a) To further secure the obligation of the Company to make
Construction Loan Repayments, the Company will execute and deliver,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, its Series

with such interest rate, interest payment and maturity dates and redemption
provisions as may correspond to such provisions of the Series A Bonds issued and
sold by the Authority.

                  (b) To further secure the obligation of the Company to make
Refunding Loan Repayments, the Company will execute and deliver,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, its Series
B First Mortgage Bond under the Mortgage Indenture in such principal amount and
with such interest rate, interest payment and maturity dates and redemption
provisions as may correspond to such provisions of the Series B Bonds issued and
sold by the Authority.

         SECTION 4.04. Assignment to Trustee.

                  (a) This Agreement (except for the Authority's Reserved
Rights), the Construction Loan Repayments hereunder and all security therefor,
including the payments under the Series A First Mortgage Bond and income earned
from the investment of funds held under the Indenture, are to be assigned and
pledged by the Authority to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture as security
for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Series
A Bonds. The Company consents to such assignment and pledge and agrees that, as
to the Trustee, its obligation to make such Construction Loan Repayments and the
payments required under the Series A First Mortgage Bond shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be subject to any defense (other than full and
indefeasible payment) or to any right of set off, counterclaim or recoupment
arising out of any breach by the Authority of any obligation to the Company,
whether hereunder or otherwise, or out of any indebtedness or liability at any
time owing to the Company by the Authority.

                  (b) This Agreement (except for the Authority's Reserved
Rights), the Refunding Loan Repayments hereunder and all security therefor,

Pennsylvania or Charlotte, North Carolina, all Loan Repayments pursuant to this
Agreement and the payments required under the First Mortgage Bonds.

                  (d) Except as provided herein and in Section 6.01, the
Authority will not otherwise sell, assign, transfer, convey or dispose of the
revenues from the Facilities or the Loan Repayments or the First Mortgage Bonds
during the term of this Agreement, nor will it take any action which may
reasonably be construed as tending to cause or induce the levy of special
assessments against the Facilities or such revenues or the First Mortgage Bonds,
nor will it create or suffer to be created any lien or charge upon the
Facilities or such revenues or the First Mortgage Bonds except Permitted
Encumbrances.

         SECTION 4.05. Operation and Maintenance. The Company shall maintain,
preserve, and keep the Facilities or cause the Facilities to be maintained,
preserved and kept, with the appurtenances thereto and every part and parcel
thereof, in good repair, working order and condition and, from time to time,
will make or cause to be made all such repairs, replacements and renewals as it
deems necessary. The Authority shall not operate the Facilities or have any
obligation to maintain them.

         The Company shall have the privilege of remodeling the Facilities or
making substitutions, modifications and improvements to the Facilities from time
to time as it, in its discretion, may deem to be desirable for its uses and
purposes, the cost of which remodeling, substitutions, modifications and

the Company and be included under the terms of this Agreement as part of the
Facilities.

         SECTION 4.06. Insurance. At all times during the term of this
Agreement, the Company will keep the Facilities continuously insured in

lawful claims or demands which, if unpaid, might be or become a lien upon any
Loan Repayments hereunder or upon the First Mortgage Bonds. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Company shall first notify the Authority and Trustee of its
intention so to do, the Company may in good faith contest any such lien or
charge or claim or demand in appropriate legal proceedings, and in such event
may permit the items so contested to remain undischarged and unsatisfied during
the period of such contest and any appeal therefrom, unless the Authority or the
Trustee shall notify the Company in writing that, in the opinion of Counsel, by
nonpayment of any such items the lien of the Indenture as to the Loan Repayments
or as to the First Mortgage Bonds shall be materially endangered, in which event
the Company shall promptly pay and cause to be satisfied and discharged all such
unpaid items. The Authority will cooperate fully with the Company in any such
contest.

any of the Company's obligations hereunder, for any reason or cause whatsoever,
including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing), (i) any
destruction of or damage to, or any condemnation or taking by any public or
private entity of, all or any portion of the Facilities; (ii) any acts or
circumstances which may constitute failure of consideration or commercial

Trustee, any other Paying Agent or the Bond Insurer to perform and to observe

interest on the 2002 Bonds during any period when such Bonds are held by a
"substantial user" of the Facilities financed by the 2002 Bonds or a "related

Opinion to the effect that the proposed sale, assignment or lease, as the case

its covenants or agreements herein contained by such remedies at law or in
equity as it deems desirable, subject to the limitation of liability set forth

military authority; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning;
earthquakes; fires; hurricanes; storms; floods; washouts; droughts; arrests;

not be deemed in default during the continuance of such inability.

         The Company agrees to use its best efforts to remedy with all
reasonable dispatch the cause or causes preventing it from carrying out its
agreements; provided, however, that the settlement of strikes, lockouts and
other industrial disturbances shall be entirely within the discretion of the
Company, and the Company shall not be required to make settlement of strikes,
lockouts and other industrial disturbances by acceding to the demands of the
opposing party or parties when such course, in the judgment of the Company, is
unfavorable to the Company.

         This Section 7.01(c) shall not apply to any Event of Default described
in Section 7.01(a)(i) or 7.01(a)(ii), and any failure of the Company to perform
its obligations under Section 4.02 hereof shall constitute an Event of Default
regardless of the reason for such failure to perform.

         SECTION 7.02. Remedies. Whenever any Event of Default hereof shall have
happened and be continuing, any one or more of the following remedial steps may
be taken:

                  (a) The Authority or the Trustee, as the assignee of the
Authority, at its option, may declare the unpaid principal balance of the Loans
to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same, together with all other
amounts due from the Company then accrued and unpaid, shall become immediately
due and payable; and

<PAGE>

                  (b) The Authority or the Trustee, as the assignee of the
Authority, may take any action at law or in equity to collect the payments then
due and thereafter to become due or to enforce performance and observance of any
obligation, agreement or covenant of the Company under this Agreement and under
the First Mortgage Bonds. All amounts collected pursuant to action taken under
this Section shall be applied in accordance with the Indenture.

         SECTION 7.03. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy conferred upon or
reserved to the Authority by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this
Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No
delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall
impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but
any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may
be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Authority to exercise any remedy
reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice
other than such notice as may be herein expressly required.

         SECTION 7.04. Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses. If the Company shall
default under any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Authority shall
employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of Loan Repayments
or for the enforcement of performance or observance of any obligation or
agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement or in the First
Mortgage Bonds, the Company, on demand therefor, will reimburse the Authority
for reasonable fees and expenses of such attorneys and such other reasonable
expenses so incurred.

         SECTION 7.05. Waivers of Breaches. In the event any agreement contained
in this Agreement shall be breached by either party and such breach shall
thereafter be waived by the other party, such waiver shall be limited to the
particular breach so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other breach
hereunder. In view of the assignment of the Authority's rights under this
Agreement to the Trustee under the Indenture, the Authority shall have no power
to exercise any right hereunder or waive any default hereunder by the Company
(other than in respect of the Authority's Reserved Rights) without the written
consent of the Trustee to such exercise or waiver, or, if the maturity of the
Outstanding 2002 Bonds shall have been accelerated pursuant to the Indenture,
the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2002 Bonds
then Outstanding. In the event any default by the Company hereunder shall have
been waived as a default under the Indenture by the holders of the requisite
majority in principal amount of the 2002 Bonds, no consent of the Trustee shall
be required, and the Authority shall be obligated to waive the Company's default
hereunder.

construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid clause, provision or

                  (b) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will
indemnify and hold the Trustee and its directors, officers, agents and employees

out-of-pocket, incidental expenses, legal fees and expenses, the allocated costs

Company also covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each
of them harmless from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against the Indemnitees or any of them in connection
with or arising out of the Trustee's performance under this Agreement and the
Indenture, provided the Trustee has not acted with negligence or engaged in
willful misconduct. The provisions of this Section 8.08(b) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the Indenture, the defeasance of the 2002
Bonds and the resignation or removal of the Trustee for any reason.

                  (c) The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
Authority, the Underwriter and the Trustee and the respective officers, members,
directors, employees and agents (including, but not limited to, the Authority's,
the Underwriter's and the Trustee's legal counsel) of each of them, past,
present and future, against all loss, costs, damages, expenses, suits,
judgments, actions and liabilities of whatever nature, including, specifically,
(i) any liability under any state or federal securities laws (including but not
limited to attorneys fees, litigation and court costs, amounts paid in
settlement and amounts paid to discharge judgments) and (ii) any and all costs

out of or related to: (A) the design, construction, installation, operation,

(B) any statements or representations with respect to Company, the Project, this
Agreement, the 2002 Bonds, the Indenture or any other document or instrument
delivered in connection with the issuance of the 2002 Bonds (including any
statements or representations made in connection with the offer or sale thereof)
made or given to the Authority, the Trustee or any underwriters or purchasers of
any of the 2002 Bonds, by the Company or any of its directors, officers, agents
or employees, including but not limited to, statements or representations of
facts, financial information or corporate affairs.



                                       19

         The Company also will pay and discharge and indemnify and hold harmless
the Authority, the Underwriter and the Trustee from (i) any lien or charge upon
payments by the Company to the Authority and the Trustee under this Agreement,
and (ii) any taxes (including, without limitation, any ad valorem taxes and
sales taxes, assessments, impositions and other charges) in respect of any
portion of the Facilities.

         If any such claim is asserted, or any such lien or charge upon
payments, or any such taxes, assessments, impositions or other charges are
sought to be imposed, the Authority or the Trustee will give prompt notice to
the Company, and the Company shall have the sole right and duty to assume, and
will assume, the defense thereof, with full power to litigate, compromise or
settle the same in its sole discretion.

                  (d) The Company releases the Authority, the Underwriter and
the Trustee from, agrees that the Authority, the Underwriter and the Trustee
shall not be liable for, and agrees to indemnify and hold the Authority, the
Underwriter and the Trustee and their agents, employees and servants, harmless
from, any liability arising out of the improvement of the Facilities or the
Loans. If any such claim is asserted, the Authority or the Trustee will give
prompt notice to the Company and the Company will assume the defense thereof,
with full power to litigate, compromise or settle the claim in its sole
discretion. The Company will reimburse the Authority, the Underwriter or the
Trustee, as the case may be, for all direct costs, including reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses properly incurred in connection therewith.

                  (e) If the indemnification provided herein is for any reason
determined to be unavailable to the Authority, the Underwriter or the Trustee,

expenses in connection therewith, the Authority, the Underwriter and the
Trustee, as appropriate, shall be entitled as a matter of right to contribution
by the Company. The amount of each contribution shall be in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect relative culpability of the parties.

                  (f) The Company shall not make any claim against the
Authority, nor shall the Authority be liable for any damage or injury to any
property of the Company or any other Person on the Facilities or to any part of
the Facilities due to any cause whatsoever, nor will the Company resist the
Authority's claim to indemnification on the ground that the right to such claim
is not set forth herein with sufficient particularity.

                  (g) The obligations and liabilities of the Company under this
Section 8.08 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of
the 2002 Bonds.

         SECTION 8.09. Limitation of Rights Against Authority.

                  (a) The Company hereby expressly acknowledges that the

Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Company
hereby expressly agrees, acknowledges and covenants that to the extent
practicable it shall duly and punctually perform or cause to be performed each
and every duty and obligation of the Authority hereunder and under the
Indenture.

damages, expenses, suits, judgments, liabilities, claims, losses, demands,
actions or nonactions based upon this financing or sustained in connection with

shall be entitled to (i) bring an action of specific performance against the
Authority to compel any action required to be taken by the Authority hereunder

this instrument, but no such action shall in any way impose pecuniary liability
against the Authority or any of its members, officers, agents or employees,
past, present and future, (ii) join the Authority in any litigation if such
joinder is necessary to pursue any of the Company's rights, provided that prior
to such joinder, the Company shall post such security as the Authority may
require to further protect the Authority from loss and (iii) pecuniary
remuneration from the Authority for damage or loss suffered by Company by reason
of the willful misconduct of the Authority or any of its members, officers,
agents or employees, past, present or future.

         SECTION 8.10. Limitation of Recourse Against Authority

                  (a) In the event of any default by the Authority hereunder,
and notwithstanding any provision or obligation to the contrary herein set

agents and employees, past, present or future, shall be limited to its interest
in the Trust Estate and the lien of any judgment shall be restricted thereto.
Other than as set forth hereinabove in this Section 8.10, there shall be no

agreement contained herein or in any 2002 Bond shall be had against the

                          NONDISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS

         During the term of this Agreement, the Company agrees as to itself and
each tenant of the Project controlling, controlled by or under common control
with the Company (each of the Company and each such tenant, a "Contractor") as
follows:

                  1. In the hiring of an employee(s) for the manufacture of
supplies, performance of work, or any other activity required under the contract
or any subcontract, the Contractor, subcontractor, or any person acting on
behalf of the Contractor or subcontractor shall not, by reason of gender, race,
creed, or color, discriminate against any citizen of this Commonwealth who is
qualified and available to perform the work to which the employment relates.

                  2. Neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor nor any person
on their behalf shall in any manner discriminate against or intimidate any
employee involved in the manufacture of supplies, the performance of work, or
any other activity required under the contract on account of gender, race,
creed, or color.

                  3. Contractors and subcontractors shall establish and maintain
a written sexual harassment policy and shall inform their employees of the
policy. The policy must contain a notice that sexual harassment will not be
tolerated and employees who practice it will be disciplined.

                  4. Contractors shall not discriminate by reason of gender,
race, creed, or color against any subcontractor or supplier who is qualified to
perform the work to which the contracts relate.

                  5. The Contractor and each subcontractor shall furnish all
necessary employment documents and records to and permit access to their books,
records, and accounts by the contracting agency and the Bureau of Contract
Administration and Business Development for purposes of investigation, to
ascertain compliance with provisions of this Nondiscrimination/Sexual Harassment
Clause. If the Contractor or any subcontractor does not possess documents or
records reflecting the necessary information requested, the Contractor or
subcontractor shall furnish such information on reporting forms supplied by the
contracting agency or the Bureau of Contract Administration and Business
Development.

                  6. The Contractor shall include the provisions of this
Nondiscrimination/Sexual Harassment Clause in every subcontract so that such
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor

                  7. The Commonwealth may cancel or terminate the contract, and
all money due or to become due under the contract may be forfeited for a
violation of the terms and conditions of this Nondiscrimination/Sexual
Harassment Clause. In addition, the agency may proceed with disbarment or
suspension and may place the Contractor in the Contractor Responsibility File.
