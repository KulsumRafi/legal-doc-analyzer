of  royalties  to  companies  outside  of said  countries  shall  not  eliminate
Licensee's  overall  obligation to pay Royalties  owed,  either from  Licensee's
headquarters or elsewhere.

      6.2 Payment Due Dates.  Royalties  shown to have  accrued by each  royalty
report  provided for under Article 6 of this Agreement  shall be due and payable

Licensee to Cellegy, specifying, among other things, the number of units of each
Licensed  Product  ordered  under each Order,  and the desired date and place of
delivery (the "Delivery Date"). The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
govern  and  control  each Order  submitted  by  Licensee  to  Cellegy,  and any
different  terms or  provisions  contained in any such Order shall have no force
and affect whatsoever.

      7.3 Orders. In order to facilitate manufacturing planning requirements:

            (c) [*]

      7.4  Production  and Supply of Licensed  Product.  During the term of this
Agreement or thereafter,  Cellegy  reserves the right after Joint  Manufacturing
Committee approval, to manufacture,  produce, assemble,  warehouse or source the
Licensed Product at any worldwide  location,  including locations outside of the
United States of America and locations within or outside the Territory.  Subject
to the  remainder  of this  Agreement,  Cellegy will use  reasonable  commercial
efforts to provide an adequate  supply of raw materials to the  manufacturer  of
Licensed  Product in order to fulfill its  obligations  under this Agreement and
supply the Licensed  Product to Licensee in accordance with the Orders.  Cellegy
agrees to solicit  and to allow  Licensee's  input and  advice on  manufacturing
issues that may arise from time to time in relation to the Licensed  Product and
will not take any  intentional  action with regard to the  manufacturing  of the
Licensed Product that will materially  disadvantage  Licensee's  ability to use,
promote or sell the Licensed Product.

      7.5 Defective Product

            (a) If Licensee  notifies Cellegy within forty-five (45) days of the
receipt of any shipment of the Licensed Product and Licensee believes any of the
Licensed Product does not conform to the warranties for the Licensed Product set
out in Section 7.9 (the  "Defective  Product") the parties agree to consult with
each  other in order to  resolve  the  issue.  If a recall  is the  basis of FDA
directives,  Cellegy will cooperate  fully and expediently to assist Licensee in
meeting the objections and concerns of the FDA.

            (b) If such consultation  does not resolve the discrepancy  within a
further  forty-five  (45) days from receipt of the notice,  the parties agree to
nominate promptly an independent analyst,  reasonably acceptable to both parties
(the "Independent Analyst"), that will carry out tests on representative samples
taken from such  shipment,  and the results of such tests will be binding on the
parties.

            (c) If the Independent Analyst determines that the Defective Product
does not conform to the  warranties  set out in Section 7, Cellegy  will, at its
expense, replace any such Defective Product and reimburse Licensee for the costs
of the Independent Analyst.

            (d) If the Independent Analyst determines that the Defective Product
does conform to the  warranties  set out in Section 7, Licensee  will  reimburse
Cellegy for the costs of the Independent Analyst.


                                                                          --11--

            (e) Except with  respect to  Defective  Product  arising  from gross
negligence or willful  misconduct of Cellegy or its  suppliers,  with respect to
indemnification obligations hereunder, and except with respect to the remedy for
failure to supply the  Licensed  Product  as set forth in Section  7.10  hereof,
replacement  of Defective  Product  shall be  Licensee's  sole remedy under this
Agreement with respect to Defective  Products.  For the avoidance of doubt,  the
parties acknowledge and agree that Defective Product issues contemplated in this
Section 7.5 could trigger a Stockout  period,  subject to the terms set forth in
Section 7.10.

      7.6 Product Packaging. Licensee agrees to provide Cellegy with all artwork
desired for packaging and labeling of the Licensed  Product,  and Cellegy agrees
to pack and label the  Licensed  Product in a manner  approved by  Licensee  and
pursuant to Licensee's standard export procedure.

      7.7 Title and Risk of Loss. All Licensed Product shall be delivered F.O.B.
Licensee at a location in the Territory set forth in writing by Licensee.  Title
to Licensed Products and all risk of loss shall pass from Cellegy to Licensee at
the time and place of such  delivery by Cellegy to a location  in the  Territory
designated  by  Licensee.  Licensee  shall be solely  responsible  for  insuring
Licensed Product after such delivery.

      7.8 Export  Controls.  Cellegy's  obligation to sell and deliver  Licensed
Product  to  Licensee  shall  be  subject  in all  respects  to  such  laws  and
regulations of the United States of America and the Territory as shall from time
to time govern,  respectively,  the sale and delivery of goods abroad by persons
subject to the  jurisdiction  of the United  States of America  and the sale and
delivery  of goods in the  Territory.  Subject to the right of the  Licensee  to
export,  re-export or transship any of the Licensed  Product to another  country
within the  Territory,  excluding  the  actions of any  government  or  military
purchaser,  Licensee  shall not  directly or  indirectly  export,  re-export  or
transship any of the Licensed Product,  except as shall be permitted by the laws
and regulations of the United States of America and the Territory in effect from
time to time.  Upon Cellegy's  reasonable  request,  Licensee shall give written
assurances against such export, re-export, or transshipment.

      7.9 Supply Warranty and Disclaimer.

            (a) Cellegy  represents  and warrants to Licensee  that Cellegy will
use its best efforts to ensure that the Product  supplied  under this  Agreement
will upon  delivery  and for the  duration  of shelf  life:  (1)  conform in all
respects to the approved product  specifications;  (2) be manufactured,  tested,
and (subject to Licensee's  contributions  under Section 7.5 above)  labeled and
packaged  in  accordance  with  the  Laws  in  the  Territory  relating  to  the
manufacture,  labeling,  packaging and testing of the Licensed Product;  and (3)
will be manufactured in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practice.

            (b) Warranty Limitation;  Disclaimer. Except as set forth in Section
7.9(a) above, the sole warranty given by Cellegy  regarding any Licensed Product
shall be that written  limited  warranty,  if any,  which shall  accompany  such
Product  or which  shall  otherwise  be  designated  in  writing  by  Cellegy as
applicable to such Licensed Product,  as the same may be revised by Cellegy from
time to time. After the Launch Date of the Licensed Product,  subsequent changes
to the limited  warranty must be approved by Licensee,  which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Licensee agrees to provide to its customers within the
Territory a written  warranty  for each  Licensed  Product on terms which are at
least as favorable to such customers as that provided by the applicable  limited
warranty  provided by Cellegy,  if any,  for such  Licensed  Product.  EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY  SO  WARRANTED  AND  REPRESENTED  IN THIS  AGREEMENT,  CELLEGY  HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ALL  WARRANTIES,  EXPRESS,  STATUTORY  AND IMPLIED,  APPLICABLE TO THE

not be deemed by anything  contained in this Agreement or done pursuant to it to

                          INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER CLAIMS

      9.1  Infringement  by Third Person.  In the event Cellegy or Licensee have
reason  to  believe  that a Third  Person  may be  infringing  Patent  Rights or
Proprietary  Rights  or  misappropriating  any  of  the  Licensed  Products,  or
infringing,  misappropriating  or diluting  any Licensed  Trademark,  such party
shall promptly notify the other party. Cellegy may, in its discretion,  elect to
enforce the Licensed Products, Proprietary Rights or Cellegy Trademarks, through
legal action or  otherwise,  and Licensee  agrees to reasonably  cooperate  with
Cellegy  in such  enforcement.  At all  times  in any such  enforcement  action,
Cellegy  shall be  entitled  to retain  recovery  which may be  obtained  in any
lawsuit  brought by  Cellegy.  In the event  Cellegy  elects not to enforce  the
Patent Rights relating to the Licensed Product within one (1) month after notice
of the possible infringement is given between Cellegy and Licensee, and Licensee
can  demonstrate  that the  potential  infringement  may result in material lost
sales of the Licensed Product within the applicable  country,  then Licensee may
institute a lawsuit or other such actions at its expense to prevent continuation
of such  potential  infringement,  and then (1)  Licensee  may  discontinue  the
payment  in  such  country  by 50%  during  the  suit,  until  such  time as the
infringement of the Patent Rights relating to the Licensed  Patents ceases,  (2)
Licensee will retain all award, damages or compensation  obtained by Licensee in
such suit in full,  and (3) Cellegy will  provide  reasonable  cooperation  with
respect to any lawsuit which Licensee may bring pursuant to this Article.

      9.2 Alleged Infringement of Third Person Patents.

            (a) If a claim or  lawsuit  is  brought  against  Licensee  alleging
infringement of any patent or infringement or dilution of any trademark owned by
a Third Person arising from Licensee's  use, sale,  offer for sale, or importing
of the Licensed  Product or any improved  Product or use of Proprietary  Rights,
Licensee  shall  provide to Cellegy all  information  in  Licensee's  possession
regarding such claim or lawsuit. Within a reasonable time after receiving notice
of such claim or  lawsuit,  but in any event  within  forty five (45) days after
receiving such notice, Cellegy shall advise Licensee of Cellegy's decision as to
what action it plans to take to dispose of such claim or defend such lawsuit.

            (b) Cellegy  shall  defend,  indemnify  and hold  Licensee  harmless
against any judgment, damage, liability, loss, cost or other, expense (including
reasonable  legal fees)  resulting from any claim or lawsuit which relates to or
arises out of the alleged  infringement  by  Licensee  of any patent  owned by a
Third  Person to the extent  that the  alleged  infringement  relates to actions
covered by the Exclusive License granted to Licensee.

            (c) If Cellegy  elects  not to dispose of such claim or defend  such
lawsuit,  Licensee may defend the claim or lawsuit.  For purposes of  Licensee's
conduct of the  disposition  or defense,  Cellegy shall furnish to Licensee such
reasonable  assistance  as  Licensee  may need and from time to time  reasonable
request. If Licensee takes on the disposition of a claim or defense of a lawsuit
for which Cellegy is obligated to indemnify  Licensee  pursuant to this Article,
then the payments for such Licensed


                                                                          --14--
                                                                   REDACTED COPY

Product in such country,  which would otherwise be payable to Cellegy hereunder,
shall be reduced by 50% during the  pendency of such lawsuit or any appeal taken
from it,  provided that such reduction shall not occur in the event that, in the
opinion of Cellegy's  counsel,  the defense of such claim is  unwarranted.  Upon
final resolution of the above-described  claim, lawsuit and/or appeal,  Licensee
shall resume paying Cellegy any royalties or license payments payable hereunder,
but in no event shall  Licensee be liable for back royalties  otherwise  reduced
hereunder during the suit.

            (d) If Licensee  becomes  obligated  to pay  royalties  to any Third
Person,  in order to make,  have  made,  or sell  the  Licensed  Product  in the
Territory,  said  royalties  shall be  creditable  against  royalties  otherwise
payable to Cellegy  hereunder;  provided,  that no such credit  shall be allowed
with respect to any royalty paid for the use of any technology, method, process,
device,  or  equipment  in  connection  with  manufacturing,  packaging  or  any
container or delivery system, or the use of any trademark, that was developed by
Licensee, any Affiliate of Licensee or any sublicensee, or obtained from a Third
Person.

      9.3 By Cellegy. Cellegy shall defend, indemnify and hold Licensee harmless
against any liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including reasonable legal
fees  ("Liability")  arising out of or resulting from any Third Person claims or
lawsuits  made or  brought  against  Licensee,  any  Affiliate  of  Licensee  or
sublicensee,  or any of their respective employees,  agents, or contractors,  to
the extent such Liability arises out off or relates to (i) negligence or willful
misconduct of Cellegy,  or any of this employees,  agents or  contractors,  with
regard to clinical  trials or testing of the  Licensed  Product or any  Improved
Product,  the  preparation  and filing of FDA  Applications,  the maintenance of
NDAs, product labeling, reporting required by the FDA, or any other negligent or
wrongful act or omission of Cellegy; (ii) the manufacture,  storage,  promotion,
sale or  distribution  or use of the  Licensed  Product,  (iii) any  claim  that
Licensee's  use of the Licensed  Product  violated the patent  rights of a Third
Party in any country of the Territory in which Cellegy has a patent  application
filed or granted covering the Licensed  Product;  (iv) a Product Liability Claim
based on action or inaction of Cellegy,  (iv) Cellegy's breach of, or failure to
comply with any  representations,  warranties,  covenants or obligations or this
Agreement  and (v) any  material  failure of  Cellegy  or any of its  employees,
agents or contractors to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation.

      9.4 By  Licensee.  Licensee  shall  defend,  indemnify  and  hold  Cellegy
harmless  against  any  liability,  damage,  loss,  cost or  expense,  including
reasonable legal fees  ("Liability"),  arising out of or resulting from: (i) any
Third Person claims or lawsuits made or brought against  Cellegy,  or any of its
employees,  agents or contractors, to the extent such Liability arises out of or
relates to  negligence  or willful  misconduct  of  Licensee,  any  Affiliate of
Licensee  or  sublicensee,  or any of  their  respective  employees,  agents  or
contractors,  with regard to the promotion,  labeling,  distribution or sale of,
the  Licensed  Product,  and  Improved  Product,  or the use of the  Proprietary
Rights;  or  (ii)breach  of, or failure to  perform or comply  with,  any of its
representations,  warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, or
(iii) any  material  failure  of  Licensee  or any of its  employees,  agents or
contractors to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation.

      9.5 Conditions to Indemnification. The indemnified party shall: (i) advise
the indemnifying party of any claim or lawsuit,  in writing promptly,  after the
indemnified  party has received  notice of said claim or lawsuit and (ii) assist
the indemnifying party and its  representatives in the investigation and defense
of any claim and/or lawsuit for which indemnification is provided. The agreement
of the parties to indemnify  each other shall not be valid as to any  settlement
of a claim or lawsuit or offer of  settlement  or  compromise  without the prior
written approval of the indemnifying party.  Failure of the indemnified party to
provide  the  notice  described  in (i) shall  affect the  indemnifying  party's
obligation  to  indemnify  the   indemnified   party  only  to  the  extent  the
indemnifying party's rights are prejudiced by such failure.


                                                                          --15--

      9.6  Control of  Proceedings.  In actions in which one or both of Licensee
and Cellegy is named as a defendant,  neither party shall assert a crossclaim or
third-party  claim against the other party for either  contribution or indemnity
in that action,  but each agrees and reserves the right to fully  litigate  such
claims for indemnity and  contribution at a later time.  Further,  neither party
will  pursue a  litigation  strategy  of  affirmatively  asserting  the fault or
liability of the other party as opposed to simply  demonstrating  the absence of
their own fault.  Each party will  provide its own defense;  provided,  however,
that Cellegy has the right,  at any time,  subject to the rights and obligations
set forth below, to assume the defense of any action against Licensee.

      9.7  Indemnification  Claim.  If, at the  conclusion of an action,  either
party  believes it is  entitled to  contribution  or  indemnification  under the
provisions  above,  such party shall give the other written  notice of its claim
for contribution or indemnification (the "Indemnification Claim"). The party who
receives the Indemnification Claim shall have thirty (30) business days in which
to respond.  In the event the parties  cannot agree on the validity or amount of
the  Indemnification  Claim,  then the parties  shall  submit  their  dispute to
confidential  mediation,  in accordance  with Section  16.17.  Neither party may
assert the statute of limitations as a defense to the claim for  contribution or
indemnification unless the limitations period had already expired and would have
barred the  underlying  action  against  that  party at the time the  underlying
action was filed.

      9.8 Assumption of Defense by Cellegy.  In the event Cellegy  exercises its
right to assume the defense of an action  against  Licensee,  Cellegy shall have
the exclusive right to control the defense  (including all decisions relating to
litigation, defense and appeal) of any Claim related to Licensee as described by
Section  9.6.In such  instances the Licensee  shall have the right to retain its
own counsel at its sole cost and expense and  participate in such defense.  With
respect to settlement, Cellegy shall obtain Licensee's consent to any settlement
of a Claim, related to Licensee as described in Section 9.6, prior to settlement
of such claim,  which consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld.  If Cellegy
requests  Licensee's  cooperation,  Licensee  shall  reasonably  cooperate  with
Cellegy in its defense of the Claim, related to Licensee as described in Section
9.6 (including,  without limitation,  making documents and records available for
review  and  copying  and  making  persons  within  its  control  available  for
interview,  trial  preparation  assistance  and  testimony) and Cellegy shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses associated with Licensee's cooperation.

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

      10.1 Treatment of Confidential  Information.  Except as otherwise provided
in this Article 10, during the term of this  Agreement and for a period of three
(3) years thereafter,  Licensee and its Affiliates will retain in confidence and
use only for purposes of this  Agreement any  information,  data,  and materials
supplied by Cellegy or on behalf of Cellegy to Licensee and its Affiliates under
this Agreement,  and Cellegy will retain in confidence and use only for purposes
of this Agreement any information,  data, and materials  supplied by Licensee or
on behalf of  Licensee to Cellegy  under this  Agreement.  For  purposes of this
Agreement, all such information and data which a party is obligated to retain in
confidence  shall be called  "Confidential  Information."  For the  avoidance of
doubt, Cellegy Information shall constitute Confidential Information of Cellegy.

      10.2  Right to  Disclose.  To the  extent it is  reasonably  necessary  or
appropriate  to fulfill  its  obligations  or  exercise  its  rights  under this
Agreement or any rights which survive termination or expiration hereof, Licensee
may  disclose   Confidential   Information  to  its  Affiliates,   Sublicensees,
consultants, outside contractors,  clinical investigators or other Third Parties
on  condition  that such  entities  or persons  agree in writing (a) to keep the
Confidential  Information confidential for the same time periods and to the same
extent as Licensee is required to keep the Confidential Information confidential
and (b) to


                                                                          --16--

to  use  the  Confidential   Information.   Each  party  or  its  Affiliates  or
Sublicensees may disclose such  Confidential  Information to government or other
regulatory  authorities  to the extent that such  disclosure  (i) is  reasonably
necessary to obtain Approvals; or (ii) is otherwise legally required.

      10.3 Release From  Restrictions.  The foregoing  obligations in respect of
disclosure and use of  Confidential  Information  shall not apply to any part of
such Confidential  Information that the non-disclosing  party, or its Affiliates
(all  collectively  referred to as the  "Receiving  Party") can  demonstrate  by
contemporaneously prepared written evidence:

            (a) is or becomes  part of the public  domain  other than by acts of
the Receiving Party in contravention of this Agreement;

            (b) is  disclosed  to the  Receiving  Party  or  its  Affiliates  or
Sublicensees by a Third Party,  provided such  Confidential  Information was not
obtained by such Third Party  directly or indirectly  from the other party under
this Agreement;

            (c) prior to  disclosure  under this  Agreement,  was already in the
possession of the Receiving  Party or its Affiliates or  Sublicensees,  provided
such Confidential Information was not obtained, directly or indirectly, from the
other party under this Agreement; or

            (d) results from  research and  development  by persons who have not

shall  further  have the  right to use a  different  trademark  on the  Licensed
Product, provided, that Licensee shall not use the Trademark in conjunction with
a different  trademark in accordance with Section 11.8 hereof. In no event shall
Licensee  use any of the  Trademark  or any similar  mark or term as part of its
business  name. In the event that Licensee does not desire to use the Trademark,
Licensee will notify Cellegy within twelve (12) months after the Effective Date,
and Cellegy  shall have the right to terminate  the license to the  Trademark in
its entirety. A termination of the Licensee to the Trademark shall not be deemed
to terminate the License to the Licensed Product granted in Section 3 hereof.

            (a) Cellegy owns the Trademark and all goodwill  associated  with or

and

            (c) Licensee shall acquire no ownership interest in or to any of the
Trademark by virtue of this  Agreement.  Licensee shall do nothing  inconsistent
with Cellegy's  ownership of the Trademark and related  goodwill and agrees that
all use of the  Trademark  by  Licensee  shall  inure to the benefit of Cellegy.
Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall be  deemed  to  constitute  or  result  in an
assignment  of any of the Trademark to Licensee or the creation of any equitable
or other interests  therein.  Licensee shall not use any of the Trademark in any
manner as a part of its business, corporate or trade name.

      11.4 Marking.  Licensee shall mark all  advertising,  promotional or other
materials  created  by it  and  bearing  any  of the  Trademark  (the  "Licensee
Material") with such notices as Cellegy may require,  including, but not limited
to, notices that the Trademark are trademarks of Cellegy and are being used with
the permission of Cellegy.

      11.5  Registration.  Cellegy shall have the sole right to take such action
as it deems  appropriate to obtain  trademark  registration in the Territory for
the  Trademark.  If it shall be necessary  for  Licensee to be the  applicant to
effect any such  registrations,  Licensee shall cooperate with Cellegy to effect
any such  registrations,  and hereby  does  assign  all of its right,  title and
interest in and to each such  application,  and any resulting  registration,  to
Cellegy,  and shall execute all papers and documents  necessary to effectuate or
confirm any such assignment. Licensee shall perform all reasonable and necessary
acts and execute  all  necessary  documents  to affect the  registration  of the
Trademark as Cellegy may request, all at Cellegy's sole expense.  Licensee shall
not obtain or attempt to obtain in the Territory, or elsewhere, any right, title
or interest, registration, or otherwise, in or to the Trademark, or any of them.
In the event  that any such  right,  title or  interest  should be  obtained  by
Licensee  in  contravention  hereof,  Licensee  shall hold the same on behalf of
Cellegy and shall transfer the same to Cellegy upon request and without  expense
to Cellegy.

      11.6. Infringement Information.  Licensee shall notify Cellegy promptly of
any  unauthorized  use of the  Trademark  or of any  mark  confusingly  similar,
thereto  which  comes to its  attention.  Cellegy  shall  have the sole right to
determine   whether  or  not  any  action  shall  be  taken   against  any  such
infringement,  and Licensee  shall not  institute any suit or take any action on
account of any such  infringement  or  imitation  without  first  obtaining  the
written consent of Cellegy to do so.

      11.7  Termination of Use. Upon  expiration or earlier  termination of this
Agreement,  Licensee  shall cease  using the  Trademark  in any  manner,  either
similar or dissimilar to the use enumerated above.

      11.8  Trademarks.  Licensee  covenants and warrants that Licensee's use of
the  Trademark or other  trademarks,  trade  names,  logos and  designations  of
Cellegy on any and all Licensed  Product,

additional  trademarks,  trade  names,  logos or  designations  to any  Licensed
Product  except in  compliance  with such policies or otherwise  with  Cellegy's
prior  written  consent  which will not be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed..
Licensee  further agrees not to use any Cellegy  trademark,  trade name, logo or
designation  in connection  with any products  other than the Licensed  Product.
Licensee will include on each Licensed  Product that it distributes,  and on all
containers  and storage  media  therefor,  all  trademark,  copyright  and other
notices of  proprietary  rights  included by Cellegy on such  Licensed  Product.
Licensee  agrees not to alter,  erase,  deface or  overprint  any such notice on
anything  provided  by  Cellegy.  Licensee  also will  include  the  appropriate
trademark  notices when  referring to any Licensed  Product in  advertising  and
promotional  materials.  Licensee  shall submit to Cellegy for its prior written
approval  and  before  any use is made  thereof,  representative  samples of the
initial Licensed Product, stationery,  invoices, catalogs, brochures,  packages,
containers,  and  advertising  or  promotional  materials  bearing  any  of  the
Trademark which Licensee or its  Sublicensees  prepare,  but need not seek prior
approval for  subsequent  uses of such  materials  that are in  compliance  with
Cellegy's policies.  Licensee shall also submit to Cellegy for its prior written
approval  any  such  materials  that  may  not  be  consistent   with  Cellegy's
intellectual  property  policies in effect from time to time,  and Cellegy shall
use all reasonable  efforts to respond promptly to give its approval or indicate
the respects in which changes are required in light of Cellegy's policies.

            (a) use its commercially  reasonable efforts to expeditiously obtain
FDA Approval  necessary for the sale of the Licensed  Product  within the United
States, including without limitation, any additional clinical trials, studies or
data in  addition to the  Cellegy  Information  that may be required in order to
obtain  Approvals for Licensed  Product in the United  States at Cellegy's  sole
expense;  Cellegy shall  provide  Licensee  with all  information  regarding the
obtainment of such Approval and shall seek Licensee's  input prior to taking any
actions for seeking the Approval with the Relevant Regulatory Authorities;

            (b)  provide  to  Licensee  within  one (1)  month  from the date of
execution of this  Agreement a  then-current  and  complete  copy of the Cellegy

regarding the Licensed Product;

            (d) at its cost,  promptly  provide  a  sufficient  quantity  of the

recall pursuant to subparagraph  (c) below,  Licensee will notify Cellegy of any
product  recalls on any quantity of Licensed  Product at any time,  and Licensee
will administer any such recall in the Territory.

            (c) If the  Relevant  Regulatory  Authority  requires  or  otherwise
initiates a recall of the Licensed Product for any reason  whatsoever,  Licensee
will immediately administer the recall.

            (d) The  parties may submit a sample of the  Licensed  Product to an
Independent  Analyst  for a report.  The cost of the  report of the  Independent
Analyst will be paid by the party against which the report is unfavorable.

If an  Independent  Analyst  finds  that the sole  reason  for the recall of the
Licensed  Product is the action or  inaction of Cellegy,  then  Cellegy  will be
liable for the cost of the recall and will reimburse Licensee for all reasonable
costs and expenses of such recall and will  provide  replacement  quantities  of
Licensed Product,  free of charge. If an Independent Analyst finds that the sole
reason for the recall of the  Licensed  Product  is the  action or  inaction  of
Licensee,  then Licensee will be liable for all such costs and expenses and will
reimburse  Cellegy for all  reasonable  costs and expenses  (and the cost of any
replacement  quantities of Licensed  Product)  incurred by Cellegy in connection
with such recall. If an Independent Analyst finds that the action or inaction of
both Cellegy and Licensee were reasons for the recall, then Cellegy and Licensee
will each be  responsible  for  one-half of such costs of the recall  unless the
report  of the  Independent  Analyst  allocates  responsibility  in a  different
proportion.

      13.4 Approvals

which are necessary to sell the Licensed  Product within the Territory  shall be

provided, however, that all such Approvals shall constitute the sole property of
Cellegy.

            (b) Cellegy  shall  promptly  provide to Licensee,  upon  Licensee's
request,  such  evidence  that  Licensee  shall  require,  confirming  that  all
Approvals  necessary  to import and sell the Licensed  Product in the  Territory
have been obtained.  If such evidence is not received by Licensee  within thirty
(30) days of the request, Licensee shall be entitled to not take shipment of the
Licensed Product until such evidence is received.

            (c) Cellegy  hereby  acknowledges  that,  except as may otherwise be
required by law, Licensee has no obligation to verify the Cellegy Information.

      13.5. Cellegy Information  Warranties.  Cellegy represents and warrants to
Licensee that:

            (a) to its knowledge,  the Cellegy Information  supplied to Licensee
under this  Agreement in relation to the Licensed  Product will be true and that
it will be legally entitled to supply this information to Licensee;

Product without the prior written notification to and approval of Licensee; and

            (c) it will use all reasonable  commercial efforts to ensure that in
no event will Cellegy implement any alteration to the Cellegy Information or the

of the Licensed Product supplied to Licensee under this

(5) years thereafter  product liability  insurance and property damage insurance
on its operations  naming the other party as an additional  insured,  with terms
reasonably satisfactory to the other party, and shall make a copy of such policy

      14.1 Licensee may, at its expense,  register the exclusive license granted
under this  Agreement in any country of the  Territory  where the  government of
such country  would require one for use,  sale or  distribution  of the Licensed
Product  in  such  country  and  Cellegy  shall  reasonably  cooperate  in  such
registration  at Licensee's  expense.  Upon request by Licensee,  Cellegy agrees
promptly to execute any "short form"  licenses  developed  in a form  reasonably
acceptable to Cellegy and submitted to it by Licensee from time to time in order
to affect the foregoing registration in such country.

      14.2 NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,  WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT,  WARRANTY,  TORT
(INCLUDING  NEGLIGENCE)  OR  OTHERWISE,  AND  WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

      16.1 Force  Majeure.  Neither party shall be held liable or responsible to
the other party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement
for failure or delay in  fulfilling or  performing  any term of this  Agreement,
other than an obligation to make payments hereunder,  when such failure or delay
is caused by or results from fire, floods,  embargoes,  government  regulations,
prohibitions  or  interventions,  war,  acts of war  (whether war be declared or
not),  insurrections,  riots,  terrorism,  civil commotions,  acts of God or any
other cause beyond the  reasonable  control of the affected party to anticipate,
prevent,  avoid or mitigate (a "Force Majeure Event");  provided,  however, that
any  failure  or delay  in  fulfilling  a term of this  Agreement  shall  not be
considered  a result of a Force  Majeure  Event if it arises  from a failure  of
Licensee or Cellegy to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

      16.2 Further  Assurances.  Each party hereto  agrees to perform such acts,
execute such further  instruments,  documents or certificates,  and provide such
cooperation  in  proceedings  and actions as may be reasonably  requested by the
other  party in order to carry out the  intent and  purpose  of this  Agreement,

press,  stockholders  or otherwise,  relating to this  Agreement,  any amendment

      16.17 Dispute Resolution; Venue

            (a) Mediation.  If a controversy or claim arising out of or relating
to  this  Agreement  (hereinafter  "Controversy")  cannot  be  resolved  through
negotiations,  Cellegy  and  Licensee  agree to try in good  faith to settle the
Controversy through mediation before resorting to litigations.

                  (1)  Either  Party may  invoke  mediation  at any time  during
negotiations  by notifying the other party in writing (the  "Mediation  Notice")
that it wishes to appoint a mediator.  If the Parties cannot agree on a mediator
within 30 days of the  receipt of the  Mediation  Notice (or such longer time as
may be mutually  agreed),  the Parties  agree to submit the  Controversy  to the
American  Arbitration  Association  (hereinafter  "AAA") for mediation under its
Commercial  Mediation Rules, to the extent that those rules are not inconsistent
with this Section.

                  (2)  Mediation  shall  be  conducted  within  30  days  of the
agreement of the mediator to conduct the  mediation,  or such longer time as may
be agreed by the parties.  It shall be  conducted  in Chicago,  Illinois at such
location as may be mutually  agreeable to the Parties and shall  continue for no
longer than two consecutive business days, ending by 5 pm of the second day.

                  (3) The parties  agree that each will be  represented  at each
mediation session by a person with full authority to settle the Controversy.

                  (4) All fees and expenses of the  mediation  shall be borne by
the  parties  equally.  However,  each party  shall bear the  expense of its own
counsel, representatives, preparation and attendance.

                  (5) Neither  party may commence  litigation  until the parties
have  conducted and ended  mediation.  In the event that the  provisions of this
subsection  (b) would  result in an  otherwise  timely  claim being barred by an
applicable statue of limitations, then the parties agree to toll the application
of the  statute of  limitations  for a period  equal to the delay  caused by the
mediation.

                  (6) In the event that a controversy cannot be resolved through
mediation,  each  Party  shall  thereafter  have the right to pursue any and all
remedies available at law or in equity.

      (b) Venue. Any court proceeding  instituted my one party against the other
with respect to this Agreement may be commenced in the federal  courts  residing
in the Southern District of New York or in the Northern District of California.
