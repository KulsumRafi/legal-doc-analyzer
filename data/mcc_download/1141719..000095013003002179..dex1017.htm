As compensation for MCM&#146;s services to be rendered to the Customer pursuant to the Agreement, commencing on January 1, 2003, the Customer shall pay to MCM fees in accordance with the following fee arrangements: </FONT></P><P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">(i) <U>Management Fee</U>. A management fee, calculated at
each month- end and billed quarterly in arrears, without regard to whether the Customer&#146;s account (the &#147;<U>Account</U>&#148;) is profitable, equal to 5.8333 basis points times the total month-end Non-Moore Net Assets (defined in
<U>paragraph 2(B)</U> below) (adjusting Non-Moore Net Assets for the purpose of calculating such management fee by (a) adding back the management fees and incentive fees of MCM accrued or payable and any withdrawals (by redemption, distribution or
otherwise), to the extent such amounts withdrawn were invested in Non-Moore Investments (defined in <U>paragraph 2(B)</U> below), from the Account since the last month-end, and (b) deducting any additional funds deposited in the Account, to the
extent such deposit is invested in Non-Moore Investments, since the last month-end), which management fee equals an aggregate of 70 basis points (0.70%) per annum, and </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">(ii) <U>Incentive Fee</U>. An annual incentive fee, calculated at each month-end and billed annually in
arrears, equal to 7.5% of the increase, if any, in the Non-Moore Net Assets, as adjusted, <I>in excess </I>of the &#147;Hurdle Level&#148; (as defined below) at each Determination Date (as defined below) <U>over</U> the higher of (x) the amount of
Non-Moore Net Assets, as adjusted, at the immediately preceding Determination Date, or (y) any prior Determination Date (or as of January 1, 2003 with respect to the first year). For the purpose of calculating such incentive fee, Non-Moore Assets on
the current Determination Date shall be adjusted by (a) adding back (i) any incentive fees of MCM accrued pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a portion of any decline in Non-Moore Assets since the prior Determination Date used to calculate the
incentive fee (the &#147;<U>High Water Mark Date</U>&#148;) calculated by multiplying such decline by a percentage equal to net withdrawals from the Account (to the extent such amounts withdrawn were invested in Non-Moore Investments) during the
period divided by Non-Moore Net Assets on the dates of the withdrawals, and (iii) any withdrawals from the Account (to the extent such amounts withdrawn were invested in Non-Moore Investments) since the High Water Mark Date (or since January 1, 2003
with respect to the first year), and (b) deducting any additional funds deposited in the Account since the High Water Mark Date (or since January 1, 2003 with respect to the first year) to the extent such deposit is invested in Non-Moore
Investments. For the purpose of calculating such incentive fee, Non-Moore Assets on any prior Determination Date shall be adjusted by adding back all incentive fees paid pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any incentive fee is paid to MCM
and the Account thereafter incurs a net loss for any subsequent period, MCM will retain the incentive fee previously paid. The &#147;<U>Hurdle Level</U>&#148; means an increase of 10.0% in Non-Moore Net Assets over the amount of Non-Moore Net Assets
at the higher of (A) the previous Determination Date, or (B) any prior Determination Date (or at January 1, 2003 with respect to the first year). A &#147;<U>Determination Date</U>&#148; means the close of business on the last business day of each
December. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

&#147;<U>Non-Moore Investments</U>&#148; means all assets in the Account, except for those assets that are invested in any fund (or comparable entity) in respect of which MCM (or its affiliates) either earns a fee or is an equity owner of the
manager of the fund (or comparable entity). The term <U>Non-Moore Net Assets</U>&#148; means the total assets in the Account attributable to Non-Moore Investments <U>less</U> all liabilities of the Account attributable to Non-Moore Investments
(including but not limited to accrued legal, accounting, and auditing fees, and any management or incentive fees accrued or payable), determined in accordance with the principles specified herein or, where no principle is specified, in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied under the accrual basis of accounting. In valuing the Non-Moore Net Assets, the parties agree that the valuation of portfolio funds in which the Account is invested shall be as
provided by the respective portfolio funds from time to time. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"
COLOR="#000000">(C) If the Agreement is terminated or the appointment in paragraph 1 of the Agreement is terminated, in either case on a date other than at a Determination Date, incentive fees shall be calculated as if such termination date were a
Determination Date by annualizing the Hurdle Level for such year. By way of example, if the Agreement or such appointment were terminated as of July 1 in a year and at that point the Non-Moore Net Assets had increased by 7% from the prior
Determination Date, the Account would be billed for incentive fees by annualizing the Hurdle Level for such year (six months, or &#189; of one year, would result in an adjusted Hurdle Level of 5% (<I>i.e.</I>, &#189; of 10%)), so that MCM would be
entitled to an incentive fee based on the increase in the Non-Moore Net Assets above the 5% adjusted Hurdle Level (<I>i.e.</I>, MCM would receive incentive fees on the 2% increase in the Non-Moore Net Assets). In addition, if this Agreement is
terminated or the appointment in paragraph 1 of the Agreement is terminated, in either case on a date other than at a Determination Date, management fees shall be calculated as if such termination date were a Determination Date. Thereafter, the
Customer&#146;s obligation to pay future fees shall terminate. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"
COLOR="#000000">(D) (i) Within 15 days following each quarter and each Determination Date, MCM shall send to the Customer a calculation of management and/or incentive fees, as applicable, that shall be due to MCM hereunder based on the estimated
Non-Moore Net Assets in the Account. Such calculation shall be deemed sent to the Customer upon MCM&#146;s electronic transmission of such calculation to the Customer. Assuming no objection to the calculation, 30 days following each quarter and each
Determination Date, as applicable, the parties agree that MCM may collect from the Account 100% of the management fee and 90% of the incentive fee so calculated by MCM. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
