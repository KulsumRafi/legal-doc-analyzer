collectively, the "Parties").



                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS, Duke and the Company are parties to that certain Services
Agreement dated March 14, 2000, as amended by that certain First Amendment to
Services Agreement dated December 15, 2000, (the Services Agreement and First
Amendment to Services Agreement together are referred to as the "Services

given thereto in the Services Agreement); and

         WHEREAS, Duke and the Company desire to amend the Services Agreement as
discussed in this Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

1.       The rate sheet found in Exhibit A, Article I of the Services Agreement
         shall be replaced in its entity with the Rate Sheet attached hereto as
         Exhibit A, Article I.

2.       The Services listed in Exhibit A, Article II of the Services Agreement
         shall be replaced in their entirety with the Services attached hereto
         as Exhibit A, Article II.

3.       Section 3.1 of the Services Agreement shall be terminated in its entity
         and replaced with the following new Section 3.1:

         Term. The term of this Agreement shall begin on January 1, 2002 and
         remain in effect until December 31, 2002. If both Duke and the Company
         desire to renew this Agreement for an additional 12-month term to begin
         on January 1 of a particular year, then beginning on August 1 of the
         existing year, the Parties shall renegotiate the terms and conditions
         of this Agreement (including without limitation the Services to be
         provided and their associated expense) which shall be applicable solely
         for the extended 12-month term.

4.       Except as amended hereby, the Services Agreement shall remain in full
         force and effect as previously executed and the Parties ratify the
