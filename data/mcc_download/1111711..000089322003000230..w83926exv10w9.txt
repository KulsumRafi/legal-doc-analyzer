         NOW THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended, effective March 1, 2003 as

         1.       The first three sentences of Section 7(c) of the Plan are

                  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, or in any stock
                  option agreement, the optionee shall pay the purchase price of
                  the Common Shares upon the exercise of any option (i) in cash,
                  (ii) in cash received from a broker-dealer to whom the
                  optionee has submitted an exercise notice consisting of a
                  fully endorsed option (however in the case of an optionee
                  subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act, this payment option
                  shall only be available to the extent such payment procedures
                  comply with Regulation T issued by the Federal Reserve Board),
                  (iii) by delivering Common Shares owned by the optionee for at
                  least six months prior to the date of exercise having an
                  aggregate fair market value on the date of exercise equal to
                  the option exercise price, (iv) by such other medium of
                  payment as the Committee in its discretion shall authorize at
                  the time of grant, or (v) by any combination of (i), (ii),
                  (iii) and (iv). In the case of an election pursuant to (i) or
                  (ii) above, cash shall mean cash or check issued by a
                  federally insured bank or savings and loan association and
                  made payable to NiSource Inc. In the case of payment pursuant
                  to (ii) or (iii) above, the optionee's election must be made
                  on or prior to the date of exercise and shall be irrevocable.

         2.       The first three sentences of Section 8(c) are amended to read
as follows:

                  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in any stock
                  option agreement, the optionee shall pay the purchase price of
                  the Common Shares upon the exercise of any option, (i) in
                  cash, (ii) in cash received from a broker-dealer to whom the
                  optionee has submitted an exercise notice consisting of a
                  fully-endorsed option (however, in the case of an optionee
                  subject to Section 16 of the
<PAGE>
                  1934 Act, this payment option shall only be available to the
                  extent such payment procedures comply with Regulation T issued
                  by the Federal Reserve Bank), (iii) by delivering Common
                  Shares owned by the optionee for at least six months prior to
                  the date of exercise having an aggregate fair market value on
                  the date of exercise equal to the option exercise price, (iv)
                  by such other medium of payment as the Committee in its
                  discretion shall authorize at the time of grant, or (v) by any
                  combination of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). In the case of an
                  election pursuant to (i) or (ii), cash shall mean cash or
                  check issued by a federally insured bank or savings and loan
                  association made payable to NiSource Inc. In the case of a
                  payment pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above, the optionee's
                  election must be made on or prior to the date of exercise and
                  shall be irrevocable.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Fourth Amendment to be
executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officer on this 27th day of
February, 2003.
