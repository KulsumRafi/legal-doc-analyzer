but in no event later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the date hereof (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Filing Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), a Registration Statement on
Form&nbsp;S-3 (or, if Form&nbsp;S-3 is not then available for use by the Company, on such form of Registration Statement as is then available for use by the Company to
effect a registration of all of the Registrable Securities) covering the resale of the Registrable Securities (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Mandatory Registration Statement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>").
The Mandatory Registration Statement filed hereunder, to the extent allowable under the Securities Act and the Rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule&nbsp;416), shall state that such Mandatory
Registration Statement also covers such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock as may become issuable upon exercise of the Warrants to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits,
stock dividends or similar transactions. The Mandatory Registration Statement required by this Section&nbsp;1.2 (and each amendment or supplement thereto, and each request for acceleration of
effectiveness thereof) shall be provided to (and subject to the reasonable approval of) the Purchasers' legal counsel (such counsel being one law firm designated by Purchasers holding a majority of

effective as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 120&nbsp;days following the date hereof (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Effectiveness Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). At the time of
effectiveness, the Company shall ensure that such Mandatory Registration Statement covers all of the Registrable Securities issuable pursuant to the Warrants. If (a)&nbsp;on or prior to the Filing
Date, the Mandatory Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC; or (b)&nbsp;on or prior to the Effectiveness Date, the Mandatory Registration Statement has not been declared effective by
the SEC; or (c)&nbsp;after the Mandatory Registration Statement has been declared effective, such Mandatory Registration Statement ceases to be effective or usable at any time after the expiration
of a Black Out Period in connection with resales of the Registrable Securities in accordance with and during the periods specified herein (each such event in clauses (a)&nbsp;through (c), a
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Registration Default</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), then the Company shall be liable to pay damages to the Holders of Registrable Securities as follows (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Partial Damages</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"): (i)&nbsp;an aggregate of $1,250 per day for so long as the Registration Default continues during the 90-day period
immediately following such Registration Default (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>First Default Period</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); (ii)&nbsp;an aggregate of $2,500 per day for so long as the Registration
Default continues during the period that is 91 to 120&nbsp;days following such Registration Default; (iii)&nbsp;an aggregate of $3,750 per day for so long as the Registration Default continues
during the period that is 121 to 150&nbsp;days following such Registration Default; and (iv)&nbsp;an aggregate of $5,000 per day for so long as the Registration Default continues during the period
that is 151 or more days following such Registration Default. The Partial Damages shall be paid to the Holders of Registrable Securities pro rata based
upon the number of Warrant Shares held by each such Holder of Registrable Securities. The Partial Damages provided to the Holders of Registrable Securities herein shall not be deemed the exclusive
remedies or damages of the Holders of Registrable Securities; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that any Holder </FONT></P>

First Default Period, the right to receive its pro rata portion of Partial Damages for such Registration Default which might otherwise be payable on and after the date of such written notice, in which
case the Company shall thereafter be permanently relieved of its obligations to pay future Partial Damages to such Holder of Registrable Securities for such Registration Default and such Holder shall

the date on which more than 90% of the unsold Registrable Securities (excluding those held by "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>affiliates</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" of the Company (as such term is defined under
Rule&nbsp;144 of the Securities Act)) covered by the Mandatory Registration Statement are eligible for resale under Rule&nbsp;144(k) of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company shall be permanently relieved of its obligations to pay Partial Damages to the extent a Registration Default is caused, or, if already
pending, is extended, by reason of the SEC not being open for business because there shall have occurred, among other things, any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism
involving the United States, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency. </FONT></P>

which will be used to fund a single or series of related acquisitions), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration. Upon the written request of each
Holder given within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after mailing of such notice by the Company in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.5, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1,
cause to be registered under the Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be registered. The number of Registrable Securities and other securities proposed to be
