herein by this reference (the "Synergy Schedule"), Synergy each hereby
represents and warrants to Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy
Merger Sub that:

         2.1 Organization of Synergy. (a) Synergy is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware; has
the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
property and to carry on its business as now being conducted; and is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Synergy
Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Subsidiary"
means the subsidiaries of Synergy set forth in Schedule 2.1 of the Synergy
Schedule and (ii) "Synergy Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse
effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or results of

Synergy to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being
understood, however, that Synergy's continuing to incur losses, as long as such
losses are in the ordinary course of business and are comparable to those
incurred by Synergy prior to the date hereof, shall not, alone, be deemed to be
a Synergy Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Synergy has delivered to Callisto a true and complete list

contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Synergy, subject only to the adoption of this Agreement by
Synergy's stockholders and the filing and recordation of the Certificates of
Merger pursuant to Delaware Law. A vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Synergy Common Stock is required for Synergy's
stockholders to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Mergers. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Synergy and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub
and Synergy Merger Sub, constitute the valid and binding obligations of Synergy,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws and general principles of equity. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Synergy does not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Synergy will not, (i) conflict with or violate
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Synergy (the "Synergy Charter
Documents") or the equivalent organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in
Section 2.4(b) below, conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, or (iii) except
as set forth in Schedule 2.4, result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or impair Synergy's rights or alter the rights or obligations of any
third party under, or to Synergy's knowledge, give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of Synergy
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties
are bound or affected, except to the extent such conflict, violation, breach,
default, impairment or other effect would not, in the case of clause (ii) or
(iii), individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Synergy Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with any court, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental
Entity") is required by or with respect to Synergy in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificates
of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware, (ii) such consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable federal and state securities laws and (iii)
such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which,

reasonably likely to have a Synergy Material Adverse Effect.

Synergy Schedule are (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of Synergy and
its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 together with the related consolidated

<PAGE>


15, 2003 (the "Synergy Balance Sheet"), together with the related statements of
income and cash flows for the 10.5 month period then ended February 15, 2003
(collectively, the "Synergy Financial Statements"). Each of the Synergy
Financial Statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) was
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, and each fairly
presents the consolidated financial position of Synergy and its Subsidiaries as
of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations
and cash flows and stockholder equity for the periods indicated. Except as
disclosed in the Synergy Financial Statements, Synergy does not have any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required to
be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which are, individually or
in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of Synergy, except liabilities incurred since the date of the Synergy
Financial Statements in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices and which would not reasonably be expected to have a Synergy Material
Adverse Effect.

         2.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since the date of the Synergy Balance Sheet, Synergy and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and
usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Synergy Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other
casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or
otherwise used by Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by
insurance; (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of
Synergy, except for dividends or other distributions on its capital stock
publicly announced prior to the date hereof and except as expressly permitted
hereby; (iv) any event that would constitute a violation of Section 4.1 hereof
if such event occurred after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time; or (v) any change by Synergy in accounting principles, practices
or methods. Since the date of the Synergy Balance Sheet, except as set forth in
Schedule 2.6, there has not been any increase in the compensation payable or
that could become payable by Synergy to officers or key employees or any
amendment of the Synergy Option Plans other than increases or amendments in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (y) as required by
any relevant employment agreement, option agreement or (z) which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Synergy Material
Adverse Effect.

         2.7 Taxes. (a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" shall mean
all Federal, state, local, foreign, provincial, territorial or other taxes,
imports, tariffs, fees, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities and
other charges of any kind, including income taxes, profits taxes, franchise
taxes, ad valorem taxes, excise taxes, withholding taxes, stamp taxes or other
taxes of or with respect to gross receipts, premiums, real property, personal
property, windfall profits, sales, use, transfers, licensing, employment, social
security, workers' compensation, unemployment, payroll and franchises imposed by
or under any law (meaning all laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations of any
governmental authority including all decisions of any court having the effect of
law); and any other taxes, duties or assessments, together with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts; (ii) "Tax Returns"
shall mean any declaration, return, report, schedule, certificate, statement or
other similar document (including relating or supporting information) required
to be filed with any Taxing Authority (as defined below), or where none is
required to be filed with a Taxing Authority, the statement or other document
issued by the applicable Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax, including,
without limitation, any information return, claim for refund, amended return or
declaration of estimated Tax; and (iii) "Taxing Authority" shall mean any
domestic, foreign, Federal, national, provincial, state, county or municipal or
other local government or court, any subdivision, agency, commission or
authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental body exercising tax regulatory
authority.

<PAGE>

                   (b) Synergy and each of its Subsidiaries, (i) have timely
filed all Tax Returns that are required to have been filed by it with all
appropriate Taxing Authorities (and all such returns are true and correct and
fairly reflect in all material respects its operations for tax purposes); and
(ii) have timely paid all Taxes shown as owing on such Tax Returns or assessed
by any Taxing Authority (other than Taxes the validity of which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings). Between December 31, 2002
and the Closing Date, neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
(or will incur) a Tax liability other than a Tax liability in the ordinary
course of business and in accordance with past custom and practice. The
assessment of any additional Taxes for periods for which Tax Returns have been
filed is not expected to exceed reserves made in accordance with GAAP and
reflected in the Synergy Financial Statements and the Synergy Balance Sheet and,
to Synergy's knowledge, there are no material unresolved questions or claims
concerning Synergy's or any Subsidiaries' tax liability. Neither Synergy's nor
any Subsidiaries' Tax Returns have been reviewed or audited by any Taxing
Authority and no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed either orally or in writing against Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries
that are not adequately reserved for in accordance with GAAP. No liens exist for
Taxes (other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) with respect to any
of the assets or properties of Synergy or any Subsidiary.

                  (c) Neither Synergy nor any Subsidiary has outstanding any
agreements or waivers extending, or having the effect of extending, the statute
of limitations with respect to the assessment or collection of any Tax or the
filing of any Tax Return.

                  (d) Neither Synergy nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound
by any tax-sharing agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
Taxing Authority).

                  (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.7, Synergy shall not be
required to include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date any
taxable income attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable period but
was not recognized in any prior taxable period as a result of the installment
method of accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash
method of accounting or Section 481 of the Code or any comparable provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, or for any other reason.

                  (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.7, neither Synergy, nor
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, has made with respect to Synergy any
consent under Section 341 of the Code, no property of Synergy is "tax exempt use
property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code, and none of the
assets of Synergy is subject to a lease under Section 7701(h) of the Code or
under any predecessor section thereof.

                  (g) Synergy has complied in all material respects with all
applicable laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including,
without limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121,
3402 and 3406 of the Code or any comparable provision of any state, local or
foreign laws) and has, within the time and in the manner prescribed by
applicable law, withheld from and paid over to the proper Taxing Authorities all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws.

                  (h) The net operating losses ("NOL") of Synergy or any of its
Subsidiaries are not, as of the date hereof, subject to Section 382 or 269 of
the Code, Regulation Section 1.1502-21(c), or any similar provisions or
Regulations otherwise limiting the use of the NOLs of Synergy or its
Subsidiaries.

                  (i) Synergy is not, and has not been for the five years
preceding the Closing, a "United States real property holding company" (as such
term is defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code).

                  (j) As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Synergy,
neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates has taken or agreed to
take any action or failed to take any action that would prevent the Mergers from
constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  (k) Any deficiency resulting from any audit or examination
relating to Taxes of Synergy by any Taxing Authority has been timely paid.

                  (l) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.7, no power of attorney
with respect to any Taxes has been executed or filed with any Taxing Authority
by or on behalf of Synergy.

         2.8 Patents and Trademarks. As used in this Agreement, "Intellectual
Property" means (i) all inventions (whether patentable or unpatentable and
whether or not reduced to practice), all improvements thereto, and all patents,
patent applications and patent disclosures, together with all reissuances,
continuations, divisionals, substitutions, continuations-in-part, provisionals,

Schedule



                                       14
<PAGE>

2.8 contains a complete list of all Intellectual Property registered in
Synergy's name and material to Synergy's business as conducted as of the date
hereof (collectively, the "Synergy Registered Intellectual Property"), which
registrations are valid. Synergy's use of Intellectual Property does not
constitute an infringement of any third party's rights that could reasonably be
expected to result in a Synergy Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.8, Synergy owns, free and clear of any Liens, all right, title and
interest to the Synergy Registered Intellectual Property. With respect to
Intellectual Property, other than the Synergy Registered Intellectual Property,
used or held for use by Synergy in its business as conducted as of the date
hereof (the "Other Intellectual Property"), Synergy owns, controls or has a
right to use, to the extent necessary to conduct its business in a manner
generally consistent with its past practice, such Other Intellectual Property
which is material to Synergy's business. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8,
Synergy is not a party to any outstanding options, licenses or agreements of any
kind relating to (i) any Other Intellectual Property owned by any other person
or entity or (ii) the Synergy Registered Intellectual Property. Synergy has not
during the preceding three years received any communications or claims nor, to
Synergy's knowledge, is there any threatened claim, alleging that Synergy has
infringed upon, or, by conducting its business as proposed, would infringe upon
the intellectual property rights of any other person which such infringement
would have a Synergy Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.8, to the knowledge of Synergy, no third party has interfered with, infringed
upon or misappropriated any of Synergy's rights to the Synergy Registered
Intellectual Property or Other Intellectual Property which such interference,
infringement or misappropriation would constitute a Synergy Material Adverse
Effect.

         2.9 Compliance; Permits; Restrictions. (a) Except as disclosed on
Schedule 2.9 neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree applicable to Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any
of their respective properties is bound or affected, or (ii) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties is bound or affected except for those conflicts, defaults
or violations which would not be reasonably expected to have a Synergy Material
Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.9 to the knowledge of Synergy,
no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or threatened
against Synergy or its Subsidiaries, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated
in writing an intention to conduct the same other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Synergy Material Adverse Effect. There is no
agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Synergy or any of
its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of Synergy or any of
its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of material property by Synergy or any of its
Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by Synergy as currently conducted.

              (b) Synergy and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from Governmental Entities which
would necessary to the conduct of the business of Synergy except those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Synergy Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "Synergy
Permits"). Synergy and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Synergy Permits.


                                       15

investigation pending, including derivative suits brought by or on behalf of
Synergy or as to which Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of assertion nor, to Synergy's knowledge, is there a threatened action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation against Synergy or any of
its Subsidiaries seeking to delay, limit or enjoin the transactions contemplated

Material Adverse Effect.

or subject to) any written or oral, express or implied, contract, commitment or
arrangement with any labor union, and no labor union has requested or, to the
knowledge of Synergy, has sought to represent any of the employees,
representatives, or agents of Synergy. There is no strike or other labor dispute

employees or any current or former director or consultant of Synergy, and/or
(ii) any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with
Synergy would be deemed a "single employer" that includes Synergy within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Synergy Benefit Plans"); provided that
each informal or unwritten Synergy Benefit Plan is described in summary form in
Schedule 2.12(b). Schedule 2.12(b) identifies each Synergy Benefit Plan that is
a "pension benefit plan" under Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Synergy Pension Plan").
Schedule 2.12(b) discloses whether each Synergy Benefit Plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" under Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Synergy Welfare
Plan") is (i) unfunded, (ii) insured, or (iii) funded through a "welfare benefit
fund" within the meaning of Section 419(e) of the Code or another funding
mechanism.

                  (d) All "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA, covering Synergy Employees (the "Synergy Plans"), to the extent
subject to ERISA, are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code, and all
other applicable law. Each Synergy Pension Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to TRA or a
timely application for such determination is now pending or a request for such
determination filed within the remedial amendment period of Section 401(b) of
the Code is pending, and the Synergy is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. As of the date
hereof, other than claims for benefits submitted in the ordinary course by
participants or beneficiaries under the Synergy Benefit Plans, no material claim
against any Synergy Benefit Plan, and no legal or regulatory proceeding
(including any audit or voluntary compliance resolution or closing agreement
program proceeding) involving, any Synergy Benefit Plan, is pending, or to the
knowledge of Synergy, threatened.

                  (e) Neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction with respect to any Synergy Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject Synergy or any
Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

                  (f) No current or former Synergy Pension Plan or pension plan
of any of its Subsidiaries, or any entity which is considered one employer with
Synergy under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate"), is or has ever been subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code. No Synergy Benefit Plan constitutes a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of ss.3(37) of ERISA.

                  (g) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Synergy Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the audited
financial statements of the Synergy.

                  (h) Neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Synergy Plan or has
ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to
any employee(s) that such employee(s) would be provided with retiree health or
life benefits which would have a material impact on Synergy, except as required
under ss.601 of ERISA.

                  (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.12, the consummation of

Liens and Encumbrances except (i) as reflected in the Synergy Financial

of any of the agreements, contracts or commitments to which Synergy or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound that are required to be
disclosed in Schedules 3.15(a) or 3.15(b) (any such agreement, contract or
commitment, a "Synergy Contract") in such a manner as would permit any other
party to cancel or terminate any such Synergy Contract, or would permit any
other party to seek material damages or other remedies (for any or all of such
breaches, violations or defaults, in the aggregate).

                  (d) Each of the Synergy Contracts are legal, valid, binding
and enforceable and in full force and effect with respect to the Synergy and any

equity; and the Synergy Contracts will continue to be legal, valid, binding and
enforceable and in full force and effect immediately following the Closing in
accordance with the terms thereof as in effect prior to the Closing subject to
the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by general principles of equity.

                  (e) Neither Synergy nor any of its Subsidiaries have been
notified that any party to any of the Synergy Contracts intends to cancel,
terminate, proposes to amend, not renew or exercise an option under any of

hereby or otherwise nor is Synergy or any Subsidiary aware of any intention by
any party to any Synergy Contract to effect any of the foregoing.

         2.17 Disclosure. No representation or warranty of the parties to this

                                  ARTICLE III
          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CALLISTO, PARENT, CALLISTO
                       MERGER SUB AND SYNERGY MERGER SUB

         Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Synergy by Callisto on or prior to entering into
this Agreement a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated
herein by this reference (the "Callisto Schedule"), each of Callisto, Parent,
Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to
Synergy that:

         3.1 Organization of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy
Merger Sub. (a) Each of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy Merger
Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; has the corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and property and to carry on its
business as now being conducted; and is duly qualified to do business and in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure
to be so qualified would have a Callisto Material Adverse Effect. As used in
this Agreement, the term (i) "Subsidiary" means the subsidiaries of Callisto set
forth in Schedule 3.1 of the Callisto Schedule and (ii) "Callisto Material
Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, assets or results of operations of Callisto and its
Subsidiaries as a whole or on the ability of Callisto to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood, however, that
Callisto's continuing to incur losses, as long as such losses are in the
ordinary course of business and are comparable to those incurred by Callisto
prior to the date hereof, shall not, alone, be deemed to be a Callisto Material
Adverse Effect.

              (b) Callisto has delivered to Synergy a true and complete list of
all of Callisto's Subsidiaries, indicating the jurisdiction of each Subsidiary
and Callisto's equity interest therein.

              (c) Callisto has delivered or made available to Synergy a true and
correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of each of Callisto,
Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy Merger Sub and similar governing
instruments of each of Callisto's Subsidiaries, each as amended to date, and
each such instrument is in full force and effect. Neither Callisto, Parent,
Callisto Merger Sub, Synergy Merger Sub or any of Callisto's Subsidiaries is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
or equivalent governing instruments.

         3.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Callisto
consists of 60,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of

Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy Merger Sub or any agreement or

under which 6,796,000 shares are available for grant as of March 10, 2003. As of
March 10, 2003, Callisto had reserved an aggregate of 947,505 shares of Callisto
Common Stock for outstanding non-Callisto Stock Option Plan options. All shares
of Callisto Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the

the number of shares as to which such option will have vested at such date, the
vesting schedule for such option and whether the exercisability of such option

Agreement or for any other reason and indicates the extent of acceleration, if
any.

         3.3 Obligations With Respect to Capital Stock. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2 and Schedule 3.3, there are no equity securities, partnership
interests or similar ownership interests of any class of Callisto, Parent,
Callisto Merger Sub or Synergy Merger Sub, or any securities exchangeable or

interests or similar ownership interests, calls, rights (including preemptive
rights), commitments or agreements of any character to which Callisto or any of

         3.4 Authority. (a) Each of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and
Synergy Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into

binding obligations of each of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy
Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws and general principles of
equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Callisto,
Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy Merger Sub, do not, and the performance
of this Agreement by each of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub and Synergy

subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 3.4(b) below,
conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree
applicable to Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub, Synergy Merger Sub or any
of Callisto's Subsidiaries, respectively, or by which its or any of their
respective properties is bound or affected, or (iii) except as set forth in
Schedule 3.4, result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair
any of Callisto's, Parent's, Callisto Merger Sub's or Synergy Merger Sub's
rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or to
Callisto's knowledge, give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or
encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of Callisto, Parent, Callisto
Merger Sub, Synergy Merger Sub or any of Callisto's Subsidiaries, respectively,
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which any of
Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub, Synergy Merger Sub or any of Callisto's
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Callisto, Parent, Callisto Merger Sub,
Synergy Merger Sub or any of Callisto's Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
properties are bound or affected, except to the extent such conflict, violation,
breach, default, impairment or other effect would not, in the case of clause
(ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Callisto Material Adverse Effect.


                                       23
<PAGE>

              (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with any Governmental Entity is required by
or with respect to any of Callisto, Parent, Callisto Sub or Synergy Merger Sub
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing
of the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware, (ii) such
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable federal and state securities laws
and (iii) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and
registrations which, if not obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Callisto Material Adverse Effect.

         3.5 Parent SEC Filings; Callisto Financial Statements. (a) The Parent
has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with the SEC
since the initial filing date of the registration statement for the Parent's
initial public offering. All such required forms, reports and documents
(including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto and those
documents that the Parent may file subsequent to the date hereof) are
collectively referred to herein as the "Parent SEC Reports." As of their
respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Reports, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

             (b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports (the "Parent
Financials"), including any Parent SEC Reports filed after the date hereof
until the Closing, as of their respective dates, (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as
may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) and (iii)
fairly presented the financial position of the Parent at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were
or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or
are not expected to be, material in amount. The balance sheet of the Parent as
of September 30, 2002 is hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Balance Sheet."
Except as disclosed in the Parent Financials, the Parent does not have any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required
to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which are, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or
financial condition of the Parent, except liabilities (i) provided for in the
Parent Balance Sheet, or (ii) incurred since the date of the Parent Balance
Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Callisto Material Adverse
Effect.



                                       24
<PAGE>

              (c) Parent has heretofore furnished to Synergy a complete and
correct copy of any amendments or modifications to the Parent SEC Reports, if
any, which have not yet been filed with the SEC but which will be required to
be filed, to agreements, documents or other instruments which previously had
been filed by the Parent with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act.

             (d) Attached to Schedule 3.5 of the Callisto Schedule are the
audited consolidated balance sheets of Callisto and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2002 together with the related consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for the fiscal years of Callisto then ended December 31, 2002,
all certified by Arthur Yorkes & Co., Callisto's independent public accountants
whose audit reports thereon are included therewith (the "Callisto Financial
Statements"). Each of the Callisto Statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved, and each fairly presents the
consolidated financial position of Callisto and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows and stockholder equity for the periods indicated. Except as
disclosed in the Callisto Financial Statements, Callisto does not have any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required
to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which are, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or
financial condition of Callisto, except liabilities incurred since the date of
the Callisto Financial Statements in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices and which would not reasonably be expected to have a
Callisto Material Adverse Effect.

         3.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as contemplated by this
Agreement, since the date of the Callisto Balance Sheet, Callisto and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and
usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change that
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Callisto Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other
casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or
otherwise used by Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by
insurance; (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of
Callisto or Parent, except for dividends or other distributions on its capital
stock publicly announced prior to the date hereof and except as expressly
permitted hereby; (iv) any event that would constitute a violation of Section
4.2 hereof if such event occurred after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time; or (v) any change by Callisto or Parent in accounting
principles, practices or methods.

         3.7 Tax Matters. (a) Callisto and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have
timely filed all Tax Returns that are required to have been filed by it with all
appropriate Taxing Authorities (and all such returns are true and correct and
fairly reflect in all material respects its operations for tax purposes); and
(ii) have timely paid all Taxes shown as owing on such Tax Returns or assessed
by any Taxing Authority (other than Taxes the validity of which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings). Between December 31, 2002
and the Closing Date, neither Callisto nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
(or will incur) a Tax liability other than a Tax liability in the ordinary
course of business and in accordance with past custom and practice. The
assessment of any additional Taxes for periods for which Tax Returns have been
filed is not expected to exceed reserves made in accordance with GAAP and
reflected in the Callisto Financial Statements and the Callisto Balance Sheet
and, to Callisto's knowledge, there are no material unresolved questions or
claims concerning Callisto's tax liability. Neither Callisto's nor any
Subsidiaries' Tax Returns have been reviewed or audited by any Taxing Authority
and no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed
either orally or in writing against Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries that are
not adequately reserved for in accordance with GAAP. No liens exist for Taxes
(other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) with respect to any of the
assets or properties of Callisto or any Subsidiary.


                                       25
<PAGE>

         (b) Neither Callisto nor any Subsidiary has outstanding any agreements
or waivers extending, or having the effect of extending, the statute of
limitations with respect to the assessment or collection of any Tax or the
filing of any Tax Return.

         (c) Neither Callisto nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
tax-sharing agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
Taxing Authority).

         (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, Callisto shall not be required
to include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date any taxable income
attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable period but was not
recognized in any prior taxable period as a result of the installment method of
accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method of
accounting or Section 481 of the Code or any comparable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, or for any other reason.

         (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, neither Callisto, nor any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, has made with respect to Callisto, any consent
under Section 341 of the Code, no property of Callisto is "tax exempt use
property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code, and none of the
assets of Callisto is subject to a lease under Section 7701(h) of the Code or
under any predecessor section thereof.

         (f) Callisto has complied in all material respects with all applicable
laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without
limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121, 3402 and
3406 of the Code or any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign
laws) and has, within the time and in the manner prescribed by applicable law,
withheld from and paid over to the proper Taxing Authorities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws.

         (g) The net operating losses ("NOL") of Callisto or any of its
Subsidiaries are not, as of the date hereof, subject to Section 382 or 269 of
the Code, Regulation Section 1.1502-21(c), or any similar provisions or
Regulations otherwise limiting the use of the NOLs of Callisto or its
Subsidiaries.


                                       26
<PAGE>

         (h) Callisto is not, and has not been for the five years preceding the
Closing, a "United States real property holding company" (as such term is
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code).

         (i) As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Callisto, neither
Callisto nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action or
failed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from constituting a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (j) Any deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to
Taxes of Callisto by any Taxing Authority has been timely paid.

         (k) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, no power of attorney with
respect to any Taxes has been executed or filed with any Taxing Authority by or
on behalf of Callisto.

         (l) The total adjusted tax basis of the assets of Callisto equal or
exceed the sum of any liabilities of Callisto.

         3.8 Patents and Trademarks. Schedule 3.8 contains a complete list of
all Intellectual Property registered in Callisto's name and material to
Callisto's business as conducted as of the date hereof (collectively, the
"Registered Intellectual Property"), which registrations are valid. Callisto's
use of Intellectual Property does not constitute an infringement of any third
party's rights that could reasonably be expected to result in a Callisto
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, Callisto owns,
free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances, security interests and rights
of redemption (collectively, the "Liens"), all right, title and interest to the
Registered Intellectual Property. With respect to Intellectual Property, other
than the Registered Intellectual Property, used or held for use by Callisto in
its business as conducted as of the date hereof (the "Other Intellectual
Property"), Callisto owns, controls or has a right to use, to the extent
necessary to conduct its business in a manner generally consistent with its past
practice, such Other Intellectual Property which is material to Callisto's
business. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, Callisto is not a party to any
outstanding options, licenses or agreements of any kind relating to (i) any
Other Intellectual Property owned by any other person or entity, or (ii) the
Registered Intellectual Property. Callisto has not during the preceding three
years received any communications or claims nor, to Callisto's knowledge, is
there any threatened claim, alleging that Callisto has infringed upon, or, by
conducting its business as proposed, would infringe upon the intellectual
property rights of any other person which such infringement would have a
Callisto Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, to the
knowledge of Callisto, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon or
misappropriated any of Callisto's rights to the Registered Intellectual Property
or Other Intellectual Property which such interference, infringement or
misappropriation would constitute a Callisto Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries is a party or by which Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries or its

conflicts, defaults or violations which would not be reasonably expected to have
a Callisto Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.9 to the
knowledge of Callisto, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is
pending or threatened against Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same; other
than those which would not reasonably be expected to have a Callisto Material
Adverse Effect. There is no agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
business practice of Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of
material property by Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of
business by Callisto as currently conducted.

              (b) Callisto and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from Governmental Entities which are
necessary to the conduct of the business of Callisto except those the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have

Callisto and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with
the terms of the Callisto Permits.

         3.10 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, as of the date

meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, "Callisto Benefit Plans"); provided that each informal
or unwritten Callisto Benefit Plan is described in summary form in Schedule
3.12(b). Schedule 3.12(b) identifies each Callisto Benefit Plan that is a
"pension benefit plan" under Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Callisto Pension Plan").

"employee welfare benefit plan" under Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Callisto Welfare
Plan") is (i) unfunded, (ii) insured, or (iii) funded through a "welfare benefit
fund" within the meaning of Section 419(e) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code")
or another funding mechanism.

         (c) True and complete copies of all (i) Callisto Benefit Plans,

Code; (v) the most recent summary plan description together with the most recent
summary of material modifications, if any, required under ERISA with respect to
each Callisto Benefit Plan; and (vi) all material communications to any
Employees relating to each Callisto Benefit Plan have been provided or made

         (d) All "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, covering Callisto Employees (the "Callisto ERISA Plans"), to the extent
subject to ERISA, are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code, and all
other applicable law. Each Callisto Pension Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to "TRA" (as
defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39) or a timely application for such
determination is now pending or a request for such determination filed within

under the Callisto Benefit Plans, no material claim against any Callisto Benefit
Plan, and no legal or regulatory proceeding (including any audit or voluntary
compliance resolution or closing agreement program proceeding) involving any
Callisto Benefit Plan, is pending, or to the knowledge of Callisto, threatened.

Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

         (f) No current or former Callisto Pension Plan of Callisto or any of

Agreement by any officer, director, employee or independent contractor of
Callisto or any of its Subsidiaries, who is a "disqualified individual" (as
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1), under any employment
arrangement or Callisto Benefit Plan would not be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code).

         (k) All Callisto Benefit Plans covering current or former non-U.S.
Employees complies in all material respects with applicable law. No unfunded
liabilities exist with respect to any Callisto Benefit Plan that covers such
non-U.S. Employees.

Liens and Encumbrances except (i) as reflected in the Callisto Financial

the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Callisto Material
Adverse Effect.

                  shareholder litigation filed or made after the date hereof
                  resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
                  herein;

                  to be caused primarily by conditions generally affecting the
                  United States economy; and

                  (3) any adverse change, event or effect that is demonstrated
                  to be caused primarily by conditions generally affecting the

have been, prior to execution, supplied to and reviewed by Callisto
(collectively, the "Unither Agreements"). Pursuant to the Unither Agreements
Synergy will buy back all of Unither's Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants to
purchase Synergy Common Stock, thus terminating all of Unither's rights and
interest as a stockholder of Synergy, and all of its rights and obligations
under any other agreement with Synergy, in consideration for Synergy's agreement
to assign to Unither all of Synergy's rights, title and interest in Synergy's
patents, licenses, grant and other intellectual property rights relating to
iminosugar compounds. As additional consideration, Unither will pay Synergy, the
amount of Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000).
