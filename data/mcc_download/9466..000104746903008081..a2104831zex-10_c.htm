Plan, notwithstanding the creation of the Rabbi Trust, is intended to be unfunded for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Constellation Energy
Group shall make contributions to the Rabbi Trust in accordance with the terms of the Rabbi Trust. Any funds which may be invested and any assets which may be held to provide benefits under this Plan
shall continue for all purposes to be a part of the general funds and assets of Constellation Energy Group and no person other than Constellation Energy Group shall by virtue of the provisions of this
Plan have any interest in such funds and assets. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from Constellation Energy Group under this Plan, such rights shall be no greater
than the right of any unsecured general creditor of Constellation Energy Group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event Constellation Energy Group becomes a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of its assets or any other corporate reorganization in which Constellation
Energy Group will not be the surviving corporation or in which the holders of the common stock of Constellation Energy Group will receive securities of another corporation (in any such case, the "New
Company"), then the New Company shall assume the rights and obligations of Constellation Energy Group under this Plan. </FONT></P>

Plan shall be governed in all respects by Maryland law. </FONT></P>
