shall not affect or limit the Company&#146;s obligations with respect to the matters described in the notice of such Claim, except to the extent that the Company is prejudiced thereby. Indemnitee agrees further not to make any admission or effect
any settlement with respect to such Claim without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except any Claim with respect to which the Indemnitee has undertaken the defense in accordance with the second to last
sentence of Section 4(d). </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"

which it is advancing Expenses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election so to do. After delivery of such notice, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this
Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such defense other than reasonable Expenses of investigation; <U>provided</U> <U>that</U> Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its counsel in such

Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense, or (iii) the Company shall not,
in fact, have promptly employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

consent, unless such consent shall have been unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not settle any Claim in which it takes the position that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification in connection with such settlement without the consent of
Indemnitee, nor shall the Company settle any Claim in any manner which would impose any fine or any obligation on Indemnitee, without Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold its or his
consent to any proposed settlement. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">6. <U>No
Presumption</U>. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolocontendere, or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law. </FONT></P>

<U>Non-exclusivity, Etc</U>. The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company&#146;s By-laws, the Delaware General Corporation Law, any
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee&#146;s capacity as a member of the Stockholders Committee and as to action in any other capacity, and shall continue after Indemnitee ceases to serve as a
member of the Stockholders Committee, for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any Claim by reason of (or arising in whole or in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event. To the extent that a change in the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether
by statute or judicial decision) or any other applicable body of law permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

efforts to cause Indemnitee, as a member of the Stockholders Committee, to be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director or officer of the Company. The
Company will notify the Indemnitee with respect to the placement or cancellation of any such insurance policy. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall use his reasonable best efforts to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring
suit to enforce such rights. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">10. <U>Partial
Indemnity, Etc</U>. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Losses and Expenses of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company
shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to any Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.

or reimbursement provided for hereunder is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to Indemnitee in respect of any Losses or Expenses of a Claim (other than for any reason specified in Section 3 hereof),
then the Company agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, to contribute to the amount paid or payable by Indemnitee as a result of such Losses or Expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits accruing to the Company and Indemnitee with respect to the events giving rise to such Losses or Expenses. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then the
Company agrees to contribute to the amount paid or payable by Indemnitee as a result of such Losses or Expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of
Indemnitee with respect to the events giving rise to such Losses or Expenses. For purposes of this Section 11, (i) the relative benefits accruing to the Company shall be deemed to be the benefits accruing to it and to all of its directors, officers,
employees and agents as a group and treated as one person (the &#147;Company Group&#148;), and the relative benefits accruing to Indemnitee shall be deemed to be an amount not greater than Indemnitee&#146;s compensation as a member of the
Stockholders Committee during the first year in which the events giving rise to such Losses or Expenses are alleged to have occurred, and (ii) the relative fault of the Company shall be deemed to be the fault of the Company Group, and the relative
fault of the Company and Indemnitee shall be determined by reference to the relative intent, knowledge and access to information of the Company Group and Indemnitee and their relative opportunity to have altered or prevented the events giving rise
to such Losses or Expenses. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">12. <U>Liability of
