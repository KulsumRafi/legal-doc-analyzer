        2.1.  Workers' Compensation.  (a)  The following provisions shall be
added to the end of Section 8.3(i) of the Purchase Agreement:

     Sellers will remain responsible for all workers' compensation
     claims made by Affected Employees based on an injury occurring
     prior to the Closing Date, provided that (i) a written record
     of such injury existed in the employee's files prior to May 14,
     2001 or the employee filed a claim regarding such injury with
     an appropriate Governmental Body prior to May 14, 2001, (ii) no
     aggravation of the injury has occurred on or after the Closing
     Date and (iii) the claim is approved on or prior to December 31,

     responsible for all workers' compensation claims made by Affected
     Employees.  It is understood that Sellers will remain responsible for
     all workers' compensation claims made by employees of the Business
     (other than Affected Employees) based on an injury occurring prior to
     the Closing Date.

              (b)  The parties agree that, as a result of Section 2.1(a) of
this Amendment, (i) the original accrual of $179,599 by Parent in its letter
dated November 9, 2000, (ii) the revised accrual of $259,000 by Buyer in its
letter dated January 5, 2001 and (iii) the additional accrual of $364,000 by
Buyer in its letter dated January 5, 2001 are not necessary and will be
eliminated in determining the definitive Valuation Date Statement pursuant to
Section 3.2 of the Purchase Agreement.  The parties hereby further agree that
the definitive Valuation Date Statement will not include any liability,
reserve or accrual for workers' compensation claims.

        2.2.  Employee Claims in Brazil.  (a) Schedule 2.3(d) to the Purchase
Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by Schedule 2.3(d) to
this Amendment.

              (b)  Schedule 2.4 to the Purchase Agreement shall be amended by
adding the claims and proceedings listed in Schedule 2.4 to this Amendment.

              (c)  The parties agree that, as a result of Sections 2.2(a) and
(b) of this Amendment, the accrual of $757,000 by Buyer in its letter dated

definitive Valuation Date Statement pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Purchase
Agreement.  Buyer further agrees that the definitive Valuation Date Statement

                              MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        3.1.  Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.



<PAGE>
        3.2.  Entire Agreement.  With respect to the subject matter hereof,
this Amendment shall supersede anything to the contrary contained in the
Purchase Agreement.

        3.3.  Partial Invalidity.  Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained
herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only
to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a
construction would be unreasonable.

        3.4.  Governing Law.  This Amendment shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts
of law provisions) of the State of Illinois (without regard to the conflicts
of law provisions thereof), except to the extent that the application of
substantive laws of the United States or another jurisdiction is mandatory.

        3.5.  Waiver.  Any term or provision of this Amendment may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof.  Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Amendment if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party.  The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision
of this Amendment shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision,
nor in any way to affect the validity of this Amendment or any part hereof or
the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.
No waiver of any breach of this Amendment shall be held to constitute a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

date first above written.
