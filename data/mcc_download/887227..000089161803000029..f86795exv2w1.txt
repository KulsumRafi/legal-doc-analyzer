                                   ARTICLE II

                       PURCHASE AND SALE OF COMPANY SHARES

         2.1      Basic Transaction. Effective immediately and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer hereby purchases from the

<PAGE>
conveys, transfers, assigns and delivers to the Buyer all of the Company Shares
for the consideration specified below in this Article II (the "Transaction").

         2.2      Purchase Price. As consideration for the Seller's sale,
conveyance, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Company Shares to the
Buyer, the Buyer agrees to pay to the Seller at the Closing Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "Purchase Price") by delivery of a secured
promissory note (the "Buyer Note") in the form of Exhibit 2.2 attached hereto in
the aggregate principal amount of $250,000. In addition, the Buyer shall, at the
Closing, grant the Seller the contingent right to receive an additional $200,000
(the "Earnout Purchase Price") as provided and subject to the conditions in
Section 2.4.

         2.3      Additional Consideration. From and after the Closing Date
until the third anniversary thereof, for each test on a participant conducted
with TEAMS, the Purchase Price shall be increased by $1.00 for each such test in
year one, $0.75 for each such test in year two and $0.50 for each such test in
year three; provided, however that if multiple tests shall be conducted on a
single participant during a single testing event, the Purchase Price shall be
increased only once for such multiple tests. From and after the Closing Date
until the third anniversary thereof, the Buyer shall afford the Seller and its
representatives on an annual basis, during normal business hours, reasonable
access to the books, records and other data relating to the Buyer's or the
Company's testing with TEAMS to allow the Seller to conduct one audit or review
of the number of tests conducted by the Buyer or the Company during each annual
period. The Buyer or the Company shall pay any such additional consideration to
the Seller thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter during such
three year period (with respect to tests conducted during the quarter then
ending).

         2.4      Earnout Payment.

                  (a)      Earnout Performance and Earnout Certificate. On or
before January 31, 2005, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a
certificate (the "Earnout Certificate") stating the aggregate revenues (in
accordance with GAAP) during the period beginning on the first day following the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2004 (the "Earnout Period") of the
Buyer, the Company and any Affiliate thereof under (i) the contracts listed in
Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article IV below) and
(ii) any agreements resulting from the Company's current negotiations with each
of Keystone Marketing and Rite Aid (the "Earnout Performance").

                  (b)      Review and Audit. The Seller shall have sixty (60)
calendar days following the delivery of the Earnout Certificate to conduct an
audit of the records of the Company and Buyer that are relevant to the Earnout
Performance to verify the calculation of the Earnout Performance as set forth in
the Earnout Certificate, and to deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute
regarding the calculation of the Earnout Performance (an "Earnout Dispute
Notice"), with such audit to be conducted during reasonable hours and without
material interference with the Buyer's or the Company's normal conduct of
business. The Earnout Dispute Notice shall state with specificity the
deficiencies asserted by the Seller with respect to the Buyer's asserted Earnout
Performance (including the amount asserted by the Seller to be correct). Unless
the Seller delivers to the Buyer an Earnout Dispute Notice during such sixty
(60) calendar day period, the Earnout Performance shall become binding on the
Buyer and Seller

                                       6
<PAGE>
at the end of such sixty (60) calendar day period. If the Seller delivers an
Earnout Dispute Notice during such sixty (60) calendar day period, Seller and
Buyer shall then use their reasonable efforts for fifteen (15) calendar days
after the receipt by Buyer of such Earnout Dispute Notice to resolve, settle and
agree upon the amount of the Earnout Performance. Upon such settlement and
agreement, if any, the Earnout Performance as agreed upon shall become binding
on Buyer and Seller. If the Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon all the proposed
adjustments to the Earnout Performance during such fifteen (15) calendar period,
each unresolved proposed adjustment shall thereafter be promptly be submitted
for resolution to a mutually agreeable independent accounting firm (excluding
all accounting firms engaged by the Seller, Buyer or any of their affiliates
during the three preceding years). The Seller and Buyer will each furnish to
such accounting firm such work papers, schedules and other documentation
relating to the unresolved adjustments as the accounting firm may reasonably
request. The decision of the accounting firm shall be based solely upon
presentations by the Seller and Buyer, and not on any independent investigation
or research, and shall be binding upon the Seller and the Buyer. The parties
will instruct the accounting firm to deliver its written determination of the
disputed issues with respect to the Earnout Performance within thirty (30)
calendar days from the date of such presentations. The fees and expenses of the
accounting firm shall be borne by the party whose asserted Earnout Performance
most deviates from that determined by the dispute resolution process. The
binding Earnout Performance is referred to herein as the "Final Earnout
Performance."

                  (c)      Earnout Payment. In the event that the Final Earnout
Performance is equal to or greater than $2,000,000, the Seller shall be entitled
to receive from the Buyer a payment in an amount equal to $200,000 (the "Earnout
Payment"), with the Earnout Payment to be paid within 30 calendar days of the
date the Earnout Payment becomes binding on the Buyer and Seller.

                  (d)      Buyer Obligations. It is the present intent of the
Parties to develop and actively promote the business of the Company to be
operated by the Buyer (the "New Business") to the mutual advantage of the Buyer
and the Seller. The Buyer agrees to operate the New Business in the ordinary
course of the Buyer's other businesses and to provide reasonable support to the
development, sale and customer support of the services provided by the Buyer in
such areas as development, sales, marketing, quality assurance, contract
administration, public relations, staffing and other direct business activities,
all in accordance with the Buyer's standard practices and procedures for the
allocation of such resources; provided, however, that except as provided in this
Section 2.4(d), the operations of the New Business shall at all times be subject
to the management and control of the Buyer, in its sole discretion.

         2.5      The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place contemporaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement at the offices of Wilson Sonsini

                  Employee Pension Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
                  requirements of a "qualified plan" under Code Section 401(a),

                  determination letter, or the IRS's refusal to issue such a
                  letter.

                           (v)      No Employee Pension Benefit Plan is subject

                  for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller
                  and the Company, threatened. None of the Seller and the

                  has incurred, and none of the Seller and the Company has any
                  reason to expect that the Company or any ERISA Affiliate will

                  contributes to, ever has contributed to, or ever has been
                  required to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or has any
                  Liability (including withdrawal liability as defined in ERISA
                  Section 4201) under any Multiemployer Plan.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

         The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing:

         6.1      General. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
each of the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article VIII below). The Seller acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing the Buyer will be entitled to possession of all documents, books,
records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial data of any sort
relating to the Company.

         6.2     Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party
actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with
(a) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior
to the Closing Date involving the Company, each of the other Parties will
cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available
their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their books and
records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article VIII below).

         6.3      Transition. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Seller
will not take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of
discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, or other business
associate of the Company from maintaining the same business relationships with
the Company after the Closing as it maintained with the Company prior to the
Closing. The Seller will refer all customer inquiries relating to the businesses
of the Company to the Buyer from and after the Closing.

         6.4      Confidentiality. The Parties agree that the information that
the Seller and the Buyer have obtained in any investigation pursuant to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be governed by the terms of
the Nondisclosure Agreement between the Buyer and the Seller dated May 28, 2002.

         6.5      Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue
any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the Buyer and the
Seller; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other Party prior to
making the disclosure).

                                       21
<PAGE>
         6.6      Covenant Not to Compete. For a period of three (3) years from
and after the Closing Date, (a) the Seller will not engage directly or
indirectly in the business of providing testing services for human beings for
the presence of the amount of blood cholesterol, liver damage or blood glucose
that the Company conducts as of the Closing Date or for diabetes, blood
pressure, asthma, allergy or bone mineral density screening (BMO) (collectively
the "Restricted Business") and (b) the Buyer will not engage directly or
indirectly in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing diagnostic
testing products that the Seller conducts as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that, nothing in this Section 6.6 shall (i) prevent the Seller from
manufacturing, marketing and selling diagnostic products and cassettes for the
testing of human beings or (ii) be binding upon any Person that acquires the
Seller by merger or consolidation at any time immediately after the Closing,
provided that such Person engages in the Restricted Business prior to the time
of such acquisition. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.6 is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment may be appealed.

         6.7      Buyer Note. The Buyer Note will be imprinted with a legend
substantially in the following form:

                  The payment of principal and interest on this Note is
                  subject to certain offset provisions set forth in a Stock
                  Purchase Agreement dated as of December __, 2002 (the
                  "Purchase Agreement") between the Maker of this Note, the
                  original Payee of this Note and the original Payee's
                  Subsidiary. This Note was originally issued on
                  December __, 2002, and has not been registered under the
                  Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This Note is subject
                  to certain restrictions set forth in the Purchase Agreement
                  and is not transferable, except as provided herein. The
                  Maker of this Note will furnish a copy of these provisions
                  to the holder hereof without charge upon written request.

         6.8      Agreements Relating to Employees and Employee Plans.

                  (a)      Termination of Employees/Employee Offers. All
employees of the Company are set forth in Schedule 6.8, and the Company shall
terminate the employment of all such employees on or prior to the Closing Date.
The Buyer or the Company shall offer employment (the "Employment Offer") to any
employees of the Company on or after the Closing Date in the sole discretion of
the Buyer or the Company. Such Employment Offers shall provide similar benefits
in the aggregate (including, without limitation, health, dental, pension,
incentive and equity-based benefits) as are offered to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer or the Company. Former employees of the Company who
accept such Employment Offers shall become employees of the Buyer or the Company
effective on the effective date of such Employment Offers (the "Transferred
Employees"). All employees of the Company other than

                                       22
<PAGE>
the Transferred Employees shall be referred to in this Agreement as the
"Terminated Employees."

                  (b)      Benefits. The Seller shall cause such action to be
taken so that effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall
cease all participation in the Seller Employee Benefit Plans, and the Company
shall cease to be a participating employer with respect to such Seller Employee
Benefit Plans. The Seller will cause all required notifications concerning the
termination of participation in such plans to be given to the Transferred
Employees and, if applicable, the Terminated Employees. The Seller is, and shall
remain, solely responsible for any and all liabilities and obligations, whether
contractual or statutory, with respect to the Terminated Employees, including,
without limitation, any liabilities or obligations with respect to severance pay
or Seller Employee Benefit Plans. The Buyer agrees that the service of each
Employee with the Company who becomes a Transferred Employee shall be counted
for purposes of determining such employee's eligibility to participate in and
vesting under the Buyer's Employee Pension Benefit Plan if allowable under the
terms of such plans. The Buyer shall have no liability under the Seller Employee
Benefit Plans for any claims incurred before or after the Closing (whether or
not paid or presented before Closing), or for any liabilities arising from any
failure of such plans before or after the Closing to comply with the
requirements of ERISA, the Code or regulations thereunder.

                  (c)      COBRA. The Seller shall provide the Terminated
Employees and the Transferred Employees with any notices and continuation of
health benefits coverage which are required to be provided by the Company or the
Seller under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or, if applicable,
Section 4980B of the Code as a result of their termination of employment by the
Company on or before the Closing Date.

                  (d)      Liability for Certain Matters. The Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer and the Company and hold the Buyer and the Company harmless
against any Liability, cost and expense resulting from the failure of the Seller
or the Company to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act (the "WARN Act") or any similar statute of any state, and any termination or
severance pay to Terminated Employees in each of the jurisdictions in which such
Terminated Employees are located.

         6.9      Buyer as Seller's Preferred Provider. From and after the
Closing Date and until the third anniversary thereof and provided that the Buyer
has not failed to cure a default within the time period provided in Section 13.2
of the Supply Agreement, the Seller shall cause the Buyer to be the "preferred
provider" to the Seller for testing services. The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its employees, agents and sales
representatives to refer to the Buyer as the Seller's preferred provider for
testing services in communications, written or oral, with the Seller's
customers. Such employees, agents and sales representatives shall notify the
Buyer regarding opportunities to provide testing services.

         6.10     Trademarks. If within six (6) months after the Closing the
Buyer desires to enter into an agreement with Johnson & Johnson that, among
other things, secures the Buyer's right to hold and use the trademarks set forth
in Section 4.12(c) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Trademarks"), the Seller
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the Buyer may reasonably request, all at
the sole cost

                                       23
<PAGE>
and expense of the Buyer (unless the Buyer is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Article VIII below). The Buyer, during the six (6) month period
described in the preceding sentence or until the execution of the agreement with
Johnson & Johnson described above, if earlier, shall reimburse Seller for the
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in validly maintaining the
Trademarks unless Buyer or the Company requests Seller to permit such Trademarks
to lapse.

         6.11     Release. For and in consideration of the Closing, the Seller
hereby releases and forever discharges, for itself, its successors and assigns
(collectively the "Releasing Parties") the Company and its officers, directors,
shareholders and assignees (collectively the "Released Parties") of and from any
and all manner of actions, proceedings, causes of action, suits, debts, sums of
money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants,
controversies, contracts, leases, agreements, promises, damages, judgments,
executions, claims and demands, of any nature whatsoever, and of every kind and
description, choate and inchoate, at law or in equity (collectively the
"Claims"), which the Releasing Parties or any of them now have or ever had, or
hereafter can, shall or may have, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever, against the Company, arising or existing during the period of
time from the Company's inception to the date of this Agreement, provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be construed as a release of any of the
Releasing Parties' rights under the Agreement or the Released Parties'
obligations under the Agreement. The Seller, acting in its capacity as a
Releasing Party, agrees that if the Releasing Parties, or one of them,
commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief through any suit arising out
of, based upon, or relating to any of the Claims released hereunder, then the
Seller shall pay to the Released Party, in addition to any other damages, direct
or indirect, all attorney' fees incurred in defending or otherwise responding to
such suit or Claims.

                     REMEDIES FOR BREACHES OF THIS AGREEMENT

         8.1      Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the

         8.2      Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Buyer.

                  (a)      In the event that the Seller breaches any of its
representations and warranties set forth in Articles III or IV, and, if there is
an applicable survival period pursuant to Section 8.1 above, provided that the
Buyer makes a written claim for indemnification against the Seller pursuant to
Section 8.4 below within such survival period, then the Seller agrees to
indemnify the Buyer and the Company from and against any Adverse Consequences
(subject to Section 8.6 below) the Buyer or the Company may suffer through and
after the date of the claim for indemnification resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach.

                  (b)      Provided that the Buyer makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Seller pursuant to Section 8.4 below within the
applicable survival period, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer and the
Company from and against any Adverse Consequences (subject to Section 8.6 below)
the Buyer or the Company may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to,
in the nature of, or caused by any Liability of the Company (i) for any Taxes of
the Company with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the

Section 9.2) to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on the
Closing Date), other than Taxes attributable to actions taken by the Buyer on
the Closing Date and (ii) for the unpaid Taxes of any Person under Reg. Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

                  (c)      Provided that the Buyer makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Seller pursuant to Section 8.4 below within the
applicable survival period, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer and the
Company from and against any Adverse Consequences (subject to Section 8.6 below)
the Buyer or the Company may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to,

Seller of any covenant or agreement of the Seller under this Agreement.

         8.3      Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller. In the
event the Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties, and covenants
contained herein, and, if there is an applicable survival period pursuant to
Section 8.1 above, provided that the Seller makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.4 below within such
survival period, then the Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller from and against
any Adverse Consequences (subject to 8.6) the Seller may suffer through and
after the date of the claim for indemnification resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach.

         8.4      Indemnification Procedures. If the Buyer, Company or Seller
seeks indemnification under this Article VIII, such party (the "Claimant") shall
promptly give notice thereof by delivering an Officer's Certificate to the party
the Claimant claims it is entitled to indemnification from under this Article
VIII (the "Payor"). The Payor may object to such claim by delivering written
notice to the Claimant specifying the basis for the Payor's objection (an
"Objection Notice"), within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the
Payor of notice from the Claimant regarding such claim. For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Officer's Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any
officer of the Payor: (a) stating that the

                                       26
<PAGE>
Claimant has paid, sustained, incurred or properly accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it shall have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue Adverse
Consequences, and (b) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Adverse Consequences included in the amount so stated, the date each such item
was paid, sustained, incurred or properly accrued, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or Liability to which such item is related.

         8.5      Matters Involving Third Parties.

                  (a)      If any third party shall notify any Party (the
"Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which
may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the
"Indemnifying Party") under this Article VIII, then the Indemnified Party shall
notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing in accordance with Section
8.4; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying
Party thereby is prejudiced.

                  (b)      Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend
the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within 15 days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third
Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim
and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third Party
Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to,
the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified
Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse
to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, and (v) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently.

                  (c)      So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the
defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.5(b) above, (i)
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party.

                  (d)      In the event any of the conditions in Section 8.5(b)
above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend
against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate
(and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from,
any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnifying Party
will

                                       27
<PAGE>
reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs of
defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any
Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising
out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the
fullest extent provided in this Article VIII.

         8.6      Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VIII, the Seller shall have no liability under Section
8.2 for any Adverse Consequences incurred by Buyer or the Company unless and
until the aggregate amount of such Adverse Consequences exceeds $10,000 (the
"Minimum Claim Amount"), provided that upon incurring Adverse Consequences in an
amount that exceeds the Minimum Claim Amount, Buyer or the Company shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII for the full amount of such
Adverse Consequences, subject to the following sentence. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article VIII, the aggregate liability of the
Seller under Section 8.2 shall not exceed $450,000 (the "Maximum Liability"),
except for (i) the indemnification obligations of Seller under this Article VIII
with respect to the representations and warranties of Seller in Section 3.1(f),
for which Seller shall indemnify the Buyer and the Company from and against any
and all reasonable attorneys' fees and/or litigation preparation expenses and
costs, including without limitation investigation, research and preparation
expenses and costs, the Buyer and the Company may suffer in connection with the
Right of First Refusal Agreement, with such indemnification obligation of Seller
not to exceed $100,000 and not to be counted or applied against the Maximum
Liability and for which the right of offset set forth in Section 8.7 shall not
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer and the Company and (ii) the
indemnification obligations of Seller under this Article VIII with respect to
the covenant of Seller in Section 6.6, for which Seller shall indemnify the
Buyer and the Company from and against any Adverse Consequences the Buyer and
the Company may suffer in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000, which amount shall
include, and not be in addition to, the Maximum Liability, and for which the
right of offset set forth in Section 8.7 shall not be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer and the Company. Third party expenses such as attorneys'
fees and costs shall be included in the amount that comprises Adverse
Consequences and shall count toward the Minimum Claim Amount and the Maximum
Liability, and Adverse Consequences incurred by the Buyer and the Company shall
be aggregated together for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Claim
Amount or the Maximum Liability has been attained.

         8.7      Indemnity Offset Against Buyer Note and Earnout Payment. Upon
compliance with Section 8.4, Section 8.5 and Section 8.8, as applicable, the
Buyer shall have the right to offset, on a dollar for dollar basis, all or any
part of any Adverse Consequences it or the Company may suffer against any
amounts payable and not yet paid or any amounts paid to the Seller under the
Buyer Note or pursuant to Section 2.4 by notifying the Seller in writing that
the Buyer is reducing the principal amount outstanding under the Buyer Note or
the amount due under Section 2.4 or is requesting Seller to repay to Buyer
amounts paid by Buyer to Seller under the Buyer Note or Section 2.4; provided,
however, that such right of offset shall terminate upon the lapse of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.1. The right of offset against
the Buyer Note shall affect the timing and amount of payments required under the
Buyer Note in the same manner as if the Buyer had made a permitted prepayment
(without premium or penalty) thereunder. Any amounts that the Buyer has
previously paid to the Seller under the Buyer Note or Section 2.4 hereunder are
subject to the right of

                                       28
<PAGE>
offset, which shall be effected by Seller repaying such amounts to Buyer within
thirty (30) business days of such amount becoming binding upon Seller hereunder.

         The right of offset described in this Section 8.7 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer for any Adverse Consequences arising under this
Agreement, except as provided Section 8.6.

         8.8      Resolution of Conflicts: Arbitration.

                  (a)      If the Seller shall object in writing to any claim or
claims made in any Officer's Certificate to recover the losses sustained as a
result of any Adverse Consequences within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such Officer's Certificate, the Seller and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Seller and the Buyer so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties, and the Buyer Note shall
promptly be adjusted by the amount of the claim agreed upon as described in
Section 8.6.

                  (b)      If no such resolution can be reached within sixty
(60) days after delivery of the Officer's Certificate, the dispute shall be
resolved by final and binding arbitration before a three arbitrator panel
conducted under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association. In order
to invoke arbitration of the dispute, a party to the dispute may demand
arbitration of the matter by delivering a letter to the other party stating such
demand ("Demand Letter"), unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is ascertained (provided that the rights of any
person entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII shall not be
prejudiced by any delay in determining the amount of such claim) or all parties
to the dispute agree to arbitration. Within ten (10) days after Demand Letter is
delivered, the parties on each of the two sides to the dispute shall each select
one arbitrator, and thereafter the two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. The decision of the majority of the arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any claim pursuant to this Agreement shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.

                  (c)      Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be
held in Wayne, Pennsylvania under the commercial rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the
party incurring such costs unless otherwise specified in certain other
provisions of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TAX MATTERS

         The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility
as between the Buyer and the Seller for certain Tax matters following the
Closing Date:

         9.1      Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared with any and all assistance required from
the Seller and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date which are required to be filed
after the Closing Date other than income Tax Returns with respect

                                       29
<PAGE>
to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or combined income Tax Return of
the Seller will include the operations of the Company and other than separate
company income Tax Returns of the Company for periods on or before the Closing
Date. Section 9.1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company during its fiscal year, along with the required due date
therefor. The Buyer shall permit the Seller to review and comment on each such
Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing. The Seller shall
advance to the Buyer the Buyer's reasonable estimate of the Taxes of the Company
with respect to the pre-Closing Tax period (based on such Tax Returns) within
fifteen (15) days after the Buyer's delivery of written notice thereof. To the
extent that the actual amount of such Taxes attributable to the Seller hereunder
is less than the amount advanced, the Buyer shall refund the difference to the
Seller. To the extent that the actual amount of such Taxes attributable to the
Seller hereunder is more than the amount advanced, the Seller shall reimburse
the Buyer for such difference within fifteen (15) days after payment thereof by
the Buyer.

         9.2      Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. The Seller shall pay to the Buyer
within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to
such periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are
payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date,
such Tax shall be apportioned to each day in the relevant Tax period on a pro
rata basis, and in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or
receipts, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. The
portion of any Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date shall (a) be payable by the Seller, and (b) shall not include any
Taxes attributable to actions taken by the Buyer on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Company.

         9.3      Cooperation on Tax Matters.

                  (a)      The Buyer, the Company and the Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Company and the Seller agree (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer or the
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to

                                       30
<PAGE>
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, the Company or the Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

                  (b)      The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request,
to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

                  (c)      The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request,
to provide the other party with all information that either party may be
required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury
Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.

         9.4      Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound
thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

         9.5      Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be paid by the
Seller when due, and the Seller will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, the Buyer will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         9.6      Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Buyer shall, at the request
of the Seller, join with the Seller in making a timely election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding elections under state and local tax
laws (collectively, the "Election") with respect to the purchase of all of the
capital stock of the Company. The Buyer and the Seller shall, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date, cooperate with each other to take all
actions necessary and appropriate (including agreeing upon an allocation of the
purchase price (including any assumed liabilities) among the assets of the
Company in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 338 and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and filing such forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a
timely Election in accordance with Section 338 of the Code or any successor
provisions (and all corresponding state and local tax laws). The Buyer and the
Seller shall report the purchase of the Company Shares pursuant to this
Agreement consistent with the Election (including the allocation of the purchase
price agreed upon by the parties in connection therewith).

                                   ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

approval of the other Party; provided, however, that the Buyer may (a) assign
any or all of their rights and interests hereunder to one or more of their
wholly owned subsidiaries and (b) designate one or more of their wholly owned
subsidiaries to perform their obligations hereunder (in any or all of which
cases the Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all
of their obligations hereunder).

         10.7     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the Commonwealth of

rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the

         10.8     Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the

by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

         10.9     Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The Parties intend
that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.

         10.12    Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules. The
Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof.

agrees that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that
the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement including without limitation
Section 6.2 and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States or
any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject
to the provisions set forth in Section 10.14 below), in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.

         10.14    Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety,
or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect
thereto. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law or at equity.
