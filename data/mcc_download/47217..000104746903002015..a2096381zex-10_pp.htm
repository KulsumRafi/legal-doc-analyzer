<p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><font size="2" face="Times" style="font-size:10.0pt;">GENERAL WAIVER AND RELEASE
AGREEMENT</font></p>

<h1 style="font-weight:normal;margin:12.0pt 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times" style="font-size:10.0pt;">I understand that my
employment with Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) will end on December 1, 2002 and
that I will be paid severance and other benefits as set forth in the attached
Benefits Summary Upon Termination dated November 4, 2002 (&#147;Summary&#148;) only if I
sign and do not revoke this General Waiver and Release Agreement
(&#147;Agreement&#148;).&#160; I understand and agree
that the terms of the Summary are incorporated by reference in this Agreement
and, except as specified in the Summary and this Agreement, are intended to
supercede and extinguish any other obligation HP may have to pay me severance
or other employee benefits upon termination, including but not limited to the
separation payment, prorated annual incentive, stock options, restricted stock,
loan continuation, supplemental payment and health benefit continuation
provided for on a &#147;Qualifying Termination&#148; under the Employment Agreement dated
October 20, 2000, as amended and restated December 13, 2000, and as amended
December 2001 (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;), and any similar payments or
benefits under other agreements or understandings, whether oral or written,
made at any time prior to the date of this Agreement.</font></h1>

for HP&#146;s payment of these severance and other benefits, I completely release
and forever discharge HP, its past, present and future successors, officers,
directors, agents, and employees, from all claims, damages (including but not
limited to general, special, punitive, liquidated and compensatory damages) and
causes of action of every kind, nature and character, known or unknown, in law
or equity, fixed or contingent, which I may now have, or I ever had arising
from or in any way connected with my employment relationship or the termination
of my employment with HP.&#160; This release
includes, but is not limited to, all &#147;wrongful discharge&#148; claims, all claims
relating to any contracts of employment express or implied, any covenant of
good faith and fair dealing express or implied, any tort of any nature, any
federal, state, or municipal institution statute or ordinance, any claims for
employment discrimination, including sexual harassment, any claims under the

and Housing Act, the California Labor Code, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (&#147;ADEA&#148;) the
Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) and any other laws and regulations relating to employment,
and any and all claims for attorney&#146;s fees and costs.&#160; I understand that this release does not apply to any claims
arising under the ADEA after the effective date of this Agreement.</font></h1>

severance and other benefits, I will not disclose to others, or take or use for

condition to the receipt of any severance payments, I agree that for a period
of twelve months immediately following the termination of my employment with
HP, I will not render advice or services or otherwise assist as an employee,
independent contractor, or otherwise to or for IBM, Sun Microsystems, Dell
Computer Corporation or EMC, which organizations, in the opinion of HP, compete
with or are in conflict with the interests of HP.&#160; The foregoing covenant shall cover my activities in every part of
any geographic territory in which HP may conduct business during the term of
such covenant as set forth above.&#160; I
agree that the covenants are reasonable, especially in light of the Company&#146;s
desire to protect its confidential information and trade secrets, and that I
will not be precluded from gainful employment if I am obligated not to compete
with the Company during the period and within the geographic scope described
above.&#160; I further acknowledge that my
fulfillment of the obligations contained in this Agreement is necessary to
preserve the value and goodwill of the Company.&#160; I further acknowledge the time, geographic and scope limitations
of my obligations under the covenants in this section shall be construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each city, county and state of any
geographic area in which HP does business.&#160;
If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of such
separate covenants (or any part thereof), then such unenforceable covenant (or
such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be
enforced.&#160; In the event the provisions
of this section are deemed to exceed the time, geographic or scope limitations
permitted by Texas law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum
time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, then permitted by
such law.&#160; I agree that HP would suffer
an irreparable injury if I were to breach the covenants contained in this paragraph
and that HP would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to
injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and I hereby stipulate
to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting me from engaging in such
conduct.</font></h1>
