9.2   CALCULATION OF FLOATING RATE INTEREST UNDER THE COMMERCIAL FACILITY

      The rate of interest on each Commercial Facility Loan for each Interest
      Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the
      applicable:

      (a)   EURIBOR;

      (b)   a margin (the "COMMERCIAL FACILITY APPLICABLE MARGIN") in an amount
            of, initially, 3.25% per annum and thereafter the rate per annum set
            out in the column headed "Margin (% p.a.)" opposite the relevant
            Population Coverage (set out in the same line in the column headed
            "Population Coverage") and subject to the achievement of the
            relevant financial performance tests (set out in the same line in
            the column headed "Financial Performance") in the table below, in
            each case as at the end of the most recently ended Quarter:

9.5   DEFAULT INTEREST

9.5.1 If the Borrower fails to pay any amount (other than interest) payable by

      cent. per annum above:

      (a)   in relation to an amount becoming due and payable before expiration

10.   INTEREST PERIODS

10.1  INTEREST PERIODS FOR THE EURO FACILITY LOANS

      (a)   The first Interest Period for the first Euro Facility Loan shall
            begin on the Utilisation Date therefor and shall end on the last day
            of the calendar month in which such Utilisation is made. The first
            Interest Period for any subsequent Euro Facility Loan shall begin on
            the Utilisation Date therefor and shall end on the last day of the
            then applicable Interest Period relating to the first Euro Facility
            Loan.

      (b)   The Borrower may select an Interest Period for a Loan under the Euro
            Facility in a Selection Notice.

      (c)   Each Selection Notice for a Loan under the Euro Facility is
            irrevocable and must be delivered to the Off Shore Facility Agent by
            the Borrower no later than 11.00 a.m. (Dusseldorf time) five (5)
            Business Days prior to the first day of the relevant Interest
            Period. Upon receipt of a Selection Notice from the Borrower the Off
            Shore Facility Agent shall notify each Euro Facility Bank no later
            than 11.00 a.m. (Dusseldorf time) three (3) Business Days prior to
            the first day of the relevant Interest Period.

      (d)   If the Borrower fails to deliver a Selection Notice to the Off Shore
            Facility Agent in accordance with paragraph (c) above, the relevant
            Interest Period will be three (3) Months and the Off Shore Facility
            Agent shall notify each Euro Facility Bank accordingly.

      (e)   Subject to this Clause 10, the Borrower may select an Interest
            Period of 3, 6 or 12 Months or any other period agreed between the
            Borrower and the Off Shore Facility Agent (acting on the
            instructions of all Euro Facility Banks) PROVIDED THAT the Borrower
            shall select Interest Periods to ensure that the Interest Period
            immediately preceding a Repayment Date under the Euro Facility ends
            on such Repayment Date.

10.2  INTEREST PERIODS FOR THE SIT FACILITY LOANS

      (a)   Each Interest Period under the SIT Facility, other than the first
            Interest Period for each SIT Facility Loan, shall begin on the first
            day and end on the last day of each calendar month.

      (b)   The first Interest Period for each Loan under the SIT Facility shall
            begin on the Utilisation Date of a SIT Facility Loan and end on the
            last day of the calendar month during which the drawdown occurred.

10.3  DURATION OF INTEREST PERIODS An Interest Period for a Loan shall not
      extend beyond the Termination Date.

10.4  NON-BUSINESS DAYS Except as provided in Clause 10.2 (Interest Periods for
      the SIT Facility Loans), if an Interest Period would otherwise end on a
      day which is not a Business Day, that Interest


                                     - 41 -
<PAGE>

      Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month
      (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

10.5  CONSOLIDATION

      If two or more Interest Periods relate to a Loan in the same currency and
      end on the same date those Loans will, unless the Borrower specifies to
      the contrary, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Loan on the
      last day of the Interest Period.

11.   CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST

11.1  ABSENCE OF QUOTATIONS

      Subject to Clause 11.2 (Market disruption), if EURIBOR is to be determined
      by reference to the Reference Banks but a Reference Bank does not supply a
      quotation by 11:00 a.m. (Brussels Time) on the Quotation Day, the
      applicable EURIBOR shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of
      the remaining Reference Banks.

11.2  MARKET DISRUPTION

      (a)   If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Euro Facility
            Loan for any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Euro
            Facility Bank's share of that Euro Facility Loan for the Interest
            Period shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

            (i)   the Applicable Margin; and

            (ii)  the rate notified to the Off Shore Facility Agent by that Bank
                  as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due
                  to be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that
                  which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to
                  that Euro Facility Bank of funding its participation in that
                  Euro Facility Loan from whatever source it may reasonably
                  select.

      (b)   The Off Shore Facility Agent shall, upon becoming aware of a Market
            Disruption Event, notify the Borrower thereof.

      (c)   In this Agreement "MARKET DISRUPTION EVENT" means:

            (i)   at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant
                  Interest Period the Screen Rate is not available and none or
                  only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Off
                  Shore Facility Agent to determine EURIBOR for the relevant
                  currency and Interest Period; or

            (ii)  before close of business in Dusseldorf on the Quotation Day
                  for the relevant Interest Period, the Off Shore Facility Agent
                  receives notifications from a Euro Facility Bank or Euro
                  Facility Banks (whose participations in a Euro Facility Loan
                  in aggregate exceed 66 2/3 per cent. of that Euro Facility
                  Loan) that the cost to it of obtaining matching deposits in
                  the European Interbank Market would be in excess of EURIBOR.

       Facility Agent has requested reduction of the SIT Facility Commitments or
       prepayment of SIT Facility Loans, under the SIT Facility pro rata across
       the relevant Facilities. If the On Shore Facility Agent elects such
       reduction in the SIT Facility Commitments, the Available Commitment in
       respect of the SIT Facility shall be cancelled by the amount which is
       applied in reduction thereof.

14.6   RIGHT OF REPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION IN RELATION TO A SINGLE BANK

14.6.1 If:

      (a)   any sum payable to any Bank by the Borrower is required to be
            increased under Clause 15.2(c) (Tax gross-up); or

      (b)   any Bank claims indemnification from the Borrower under Clause 15.3
            (Tax indemnity) or Clause 16.1 (Increased Costs);

       and the steps, if any, taken by the relevant Finance Party in accordance
       with Clause 18 (Mitigation by the Banks) have not successfully mitigated
       the circumstance giving rise to the requirement or indemnification, the
       Borrower may, whilst the circumstance giving rise to the requirement or
       indemnification continues, give the Agent notice of cancellation of the
       Commitment of that Bank and its intention to procure the repayment of
       that Bank's participation in the Loans.

            any declaration, claim, exemption or other form reasonably requested
            by the Borrower which it is able to complete or provide unless the
            Finance Party determines in good faith to do so would prejudice its
            legal or commercial position.

15.3  TAX INDEMNITY

      (a)   The Borrower shall (within five (5) Business Days of demand by the

            account of Tax by that Protected Party in connection with the
            transactions contemplated under the Finance Documents. Such demand

            income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received
            or receivable) by that Finance Party.

      (c)   A Protected Party making, or intending to make, a claim pursuant to
            paragraph (a) above shall promptly notify the Agent of the event

      (a)   a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment; and

            Credit,

      the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Borrower which that Finance
      Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax
      position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been made by the
      Borrower. The Finance Party will provide to the Borrower reasonable
      details of the calculation of the amounts it has determined to be payable

            invoice.

                  the Borrower;

            (ii)  compensated for by Clause 15.3 (Tax indemnity) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 15.3 (Tax indemnity) but was

                  15.3(b) (Tax indemnity) applied); or

            (iii) attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance

              Independent Technical Consultant any facts or circumstances the

              any material aspects.

              against therein nor any unrealised or anticipated losses arising
              from commitments entered into by it which were not


                                     - 58 -
<PAGE>

              so disclosed or reserved against and which in each such case would
              reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
              Borrower's ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

       (d)    There has been no material adverse change in the Borrower's

              Intellectual Property which is not necessary to the carrying on of

      (a)   assign any of its claims against the Borrower in a minimum amount
            of, in the case of a Euro Facility Bank, Euro 5,000,000, or in the
            case of a SIT Facility Bank, SIT 600,000,000 provided that if a Bank
            has as its only remaining claim against the Borrower a claim in an
            amount which is less than the relevant amounts set out herein, it
            may assign such lesser amount; or

      (b)   transfer any of its rights and obligations,

      to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other
      entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of
      making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial
      assets (the "NEW BANK").

26.2  CONDITIONS OF ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER

      (a)   The consent of the Borrower, the Off Shore Facility Agent and, in
            the case of an assignment or transfer by a SIT Facility Bank, the On
            Shore Facility Agent is required for an assignment or transfer by a
            Bank, unless the assignment or transfer is to another Bank or an
            Affiliate of a Bank or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
            continuing on the Transfer Date.

      (b)   The consent of the Borrower to an assignment or transfer must not be
            unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Borrower will be deemed to
            have given its consent five (5) Business Days after the Borrower has
            received the Bank's written request for such consent unless consent
            is expressly refused by the Borrower within that time.

      (c)   An assignment will only be effective on receipt by the Agent of
            written confirmation from the New Bank (in form and substance
            satisfactory to the Agent) that the New Bank will assume the same
            obligations to the other Finance Parties as it would be under if it
            were an Existing Bank.

      (d)   A transfer will only be effective if the procedure set out in Clause
            26.5 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

      (e)   If:

            (i)   a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Material Contracts or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

            (ii)  as a result of circumstances existing at the date the
                  assignment, transfer or change occurs, the Borrower would be
                  obliged to make a payment to the New Bank or Bank acting
                  through its new Facility Office under Clause 15 (Tax gross-up
                  and indemnities) or Clause 16 (Increased Costs),

            then the New Bank or Bank acting through its new Facility Office is
            only entitled to receive payment under those Clauses to the same
            extent as the Existing Bank or Bank acting through its previous
            Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or
            change had not occurred.

26.4  LIMITATION OF RESPONSIBILITY OF EXISTING BANKS

      (a)   Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Bank makes no
            representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New
            Bank for:

            (i)   the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Transaction Documents or any other
                  documents;

            (ii)  the financial condition of the Borrower;

            (iii) the performance and observance by the Borrower of its
                  obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other
                  documents; or

            (iv)  the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made
                  in or in connection with any Transaction Document or any other
                  document,

            and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded to
            the broadest extent legally permissible.

      (b)   Each New Bank confirms to the Existing Bank and the other Finance
            Parties that it:

            (i)   has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent
                  investigation and assessment of the financial condition and
                  affairs of the Borrower and its related entities in connection
                  with its participation in this Agreement and has not relied
                  exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing
                  Bank in connection with any Transaction Document; and

            (ii)  will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the
                  creditworthiness of the Borrower and its related entities
                  whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the
                  Transaction Documents or any Commitment is in force.

      (c)   Nothing in any Transaction Document obliges an Existing Bank to:

            (i)   accept a re-transfer from a New Bank of any of the rights and
                  obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 26; or

            (ii)  support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New
                  Bank by reason of the non-performance by the Borrower of its
                  obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

26.5  PROCEDURE FOR TRANSFER

      (a)   Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 26.2 (Conditions of
            assignment or transfer) a transfer is effected in accordance with
            paragraph (b) below when the Agent executes an otherwise duly
            completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Bank
            and the New Bank. The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
            after receipt by it of a duly completed Transfer Certificate as set
            out in Schedule 10 (Form of Transfer Certificates) appearing on its
            face to comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in
            accordance with the terms of this Agreement, execute that Transfer
            Certificate.

<PAGE>

      (b)   On the Transfer Date:

            (i)   to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing
                  Bank seeks to transfer its rights and obligations under the
                  Finance Documents the Borrower and the Existing Bank shall be
                  released from further obligations towards one another under
                  the Finance Documents and their respective rights against one
                  another shall be cancelled (being the "DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND
                  OBLIGATIONS");

            (ii)  the Borrower and the New Bank shall assume obligations towards
                  one another and/or acquire rights against one another which
                  differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar
                  as the Borrower and the New Bank have assumed and/or acquired
                  the same in place of the Borrower and the Existing Bank;

            (iii) the Off Shore Facility Agent, the On Shore Facility Agent, the
                  Off Shore Security Agent, the On Shore Security Agent, the
                  Issuing Bank, each Arranger, the New Bank and other Banks
                  shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations
                  between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had
                  the New Bank been an Original Bank with the rights and/or
                  obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the
                  transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arranger and the
                  Existing Bank shall each be released from further obligations
                  to each other under this Agreement; and

            (iv)  the New Bank shall become a Party as a "Bank".

      For the avoidance of doubt, a transfer shall not constitute a novation.
      The identity of the transferred obligations and rights shall not be
      affected by the transfer.

26.6  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

26.6.1 Any Bank may disclose to any of its Affiliates and any other person:

      (a)   to (or through) whom that Bank assigns or transfers (or may

      Clause 26.6.2 shall not apply to disclosure of information:

            duty of confidentiality.

27.6  MAJORITY BANKS' INSTRUCTIONS

      (a)   Unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, an Agent

            or wilful misconduct.

      (b)   No Finance Party may take any proceedings against any officer,

      Agent, within three (3) Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or
      liability incurred by such Agent (otherwise than by reason of such Agent's
      gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in acting as Agent under the

      pursuant to a Finance Document).

27.10 RESIGNATION OF THE AGENT

      (a)   Each Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates acting
            through an office as successor by giving notice to the other Finance
            Parties and the Borrower.

      (b)   Alternatively each Agent may resign by giving notice to the other
            Finance Parties and the Borrower, in which case the Majority Banks
            (after consultation with the Borrower) may appoint a successor
            Agent.

      (c)   If the Majority Banks have not appointed a successor Agent in
            accordance with paragraph (b) above within thirty (30) days after
            notice of resignation was


                                     - 96 -

            given, a retiring Agent (after consultation with the Borrower) may
            appoint a successor Agent.

      (d)   The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the
            successor Agent such documents and records and provide such
            assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the

            Documents.

      (e)   An Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the
            appointment of a successor.

      (f)   Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be

            Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of this Clause
            27. Its successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same
            rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if
            such successor had been an original Party.

27.11 CONFIDENTIALITY

      (a)   In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, an Agent shall be
            regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be
            treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or
            departments.

      (b)   If information is received by another division or department of an
            Agent, it may be treated as confidential to that division or
            department and such Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of it.

27.12 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANKS

      Each Agent may treat each Bank as a Bank, entitled to payments under this

      not less than five (5) Business Days prior notice from that Bank to the
      contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

27.13 CREDIT APPRAISAL BY THE BANKS

      Without affecting the responsibility of the Borrower for information
      supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document,
      each Bank confirms to an Agent and an Arranger that it has been, and will
      continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent
      appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection

            in connection with any Transaction Document;

      (c)   whether that Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of that
            recourse, against any Finance Party or any of its respective assets

            transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or any other
            agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
            anticipation of, under or in connection with any Transaction
            Document; and

      (d)   the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Initial Business
            Plan, the Information Memorandum, Legal Due Diligence Report and any
            other

            person under or in connection with any Transaction Document, the
            transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or any other

            Document.

27.14 REFERENCE BANKS

      If a Reference Bank (or, if a Reference Bank is not a Bank, the Bank of
      which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a Bank, the Off Shore Facility
      Agent shall (in consultation with the Borrower) appoint another Bank or an
      Affiliate of a Bank to replace that Reference Bank.

27.15 DUTIES OF THE ON SHORE FACILITY AGENT TO THE OFF SHORE FACILITY AGENT

            party to any of the Transaction Documents; and

27.16 DEDUCTION FROM AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY THE AGENTS

      If any Party owes an amount to an Agent under the Finance Documents such
      Agent may, after giving notice to that Party, deduct an amount not
      exceeding that amount from any payment to that Party which such Agent
      would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents and apply
      the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the
      purposes of the Finance Documents that Party shall be regarded as having
      received any amount so deducted.

      (b)   oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit, relief,
            remission or repayment available to it or the extent, order and

            (Mitigation by the Banks); or

29.   SHARING AMONG THE FINANCE PARTIES

29.1  PAYMENTS TO FINANCE PARTIES

      If a Finance Party (a "RECOVERING FINANCE PARTY") receives or recovers any
      amount from the Borrower other than in accordance with Clause 30 (Payment
      mechanics) and applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance
      Documents then:

      (a)   the Recovering Finance Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days,
            notify details of the receipt or recovery to the relevant Agent;

      (b)   the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in
            excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been
            paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent
            and distributed in accordance with Clause 30 (Payment mechanics),
            without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the
            Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

      (c)   the Recovering Finance Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of
            demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the "SHARING
            PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which
            the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party
            as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause
            30.5 (Partial payments).

29.2  REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

      The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
      relevant Finance Party and distribute it between the Finance Parties
      (other than the Recovering Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 30.5
      (Partial payments).

29.3  RECOVERING FINANCE PARTY'S RIGHTS

      (a)   On a distribution by the Agent under Clause 29.2 (Redistribution of
            payments), the Recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the
            rights of the Finance Parties which have shared in the
            redistribution.

      (b)   If and to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party is not able
            to rely on its rights under paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall
            be liable to the Recovering Finance Party for a debt equal to the
            Sharing Payment which is immediately due and payable.

29.4  REVERSAL OF REDISTRIBUTION

      If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering
      Finance Party becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance
      Party, then:

      (a)   each Finance Party which has received a share of the relevant
            Sharing Payment pursuant to Clause 29.2 (Redistribution of payments)
            shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of
            that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate
            part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as
            is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its
            proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that
            Recovering Finance Party is required to pay); and

      (b)   that Recovering Finance Party's rights of subrogation in respect of
            any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the Borrower will be liable
            to the reimbursing Finance Party for the amount so reimbursed.

29.5  EXCEPTIONS

      (a)   This Clause 29 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering
            Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this
            Clause, have a valid and enforceable claim against the Borrower.

      (b)   A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other
            Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Finance Party has
            received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration
            proceedings, if

            (i)   it notified that other Finance Party of the legal or
                  arbitration proceedings; and

            (ii)  that other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in
                  those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as
                  soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did
                  not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

      (c)   This Clause 29 shall not apply to any Excluded Proceeds (as defined
            in the Intercreditor Agreement) which shall be applied in accordance
            with the Intercreditor Agreement.

29.6  PERFECTION OF TRANSFERS

      Each Finance Party hereby undertakes vis-a-vis each of the other Finance
      Parties to enter into all additional agreements and to execute all
      additional documents, which might be required under the laws of each
      relevant jurisdiction for the perfection of the transfers and subrogations
      contemplated by this Clause 29. The Borrower hereby agrees to consent to
      all relevant transfers and it hereby undertakes vis-a-vis each of the
      Finance Parties to enter into all additional agreements and to execute all
      additional documents, which are required under the laws of each relevant
      jurisdiction for the perfection of the transfers and subrogations
      contemplated by this Clause 29.

30.   PAYMENT MECHANICS

30.1  PAYMENTS TO THE AGENT

      (a)   On each date on which the Borrower or a Bank is required to make a
            payment under a Finance Document, the Borrower or Bank shall make
            the same available to the Off Shore Facility Agent in respect of a
            payment in Euro or the On Shore Facility Agent in respect of a
            payment in SIT (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance
            Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds
            specified by the relevant Agent as being customary at the time for
            settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of
            payment.

      (b)   Payment shall be made to such account in Ljubljana if payment is to
            be made in SIT or in Dusseldorf if payment is to be made in Euro
            with such bank as the relevant Agent specifies.

      Each Bank shall promptly indemnify the relevant Agent against any cost,
      loss or liability incurred by such Agent as a result of late or
      non-performance by such Bank of any of its payment obligations under this
      Agreement.

30.2  DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE AGENT

      Each payment received by an Agent under the Finance Documents for another
      Party shall, subject to Clause 30.3 (Distributions to the Borrower) and
      Clause 30.4 (Clawback) be made available by such Agent as soon as
      practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in
      accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Bank, for the account of
      its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to such
      Agent by not less than five (5) Business Days' notice.

30.3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE BORROWER

      The Agent may (with the consent of the Borrower or in accordance with
      Clause 31 (Set-off)) apply any amount received by it for the account of
      the Borrower in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and
      funds of receipt) of any amount due from the Borrower under the Finance
      Documents, or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be
      so applied.

30.4  CLAWBACK

      (a)   Where a sum is to be paid to an Agent under the Finance Documents
            for another Party, such Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that
            other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange
            contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction
            that it has actually received that sum.

      (b)   If an Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the
            case that such Agent had not actually received that amount, then the
            Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange
            contract) was paid by such Agent shall on demand refund the same to
            such Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of
            payment to the date of receipt by such Agent, calculated by such
            Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

30.5  PARTIAL PAYMENTS

      (a)   If an Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all
            the amounts then due and payable by the Borrower under the Finance
            Documents, such


                                    - 101 -
<PAGE>

            Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of the
            Borrower under the Finance Documents in the following order:

            (i)   first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees,
                  costs and expenses of the Agents under the Finance Documents;

            (ii)  secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued
                  default interest, interest, fee or commission due but unpaid
                  under this Agreement;

            (iii) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due
                  but unpaid under this Agreement; and

            (iv)  fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due
                  but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

      (b)   Such Agent shall, if so directed by the Majority Banks, vary the
            order set out in paragraphs (a)(ii) to (iv) above and such direction
            shall also apply in respect of payments received by the other Agent.

      (c)   Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by
            the Borrower.

      (d)   This Clause 30.5 shall not apply to any Excluded Proceeds (as
            defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

30.6  NO SET-OFF BY THE BORROWER

      All payments to be made by the Borrower under the Finance Documents shall
      be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction
      for) set-off or counterclaim.

30.7  BUSINESS DAYS

      (a)   Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business
            Day shall be made on the next Business Day and in the case of the
            Euro Facility such Business Day shall be in the same calendar month
            (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

      (b)   During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or
            Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is payable on the principal
            or Unpaid Sum at the rate payable on the original due date.

30.8  CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT

      (a)   A repayment of a Loan or Unpaid Sum or a part of a Loan or Unpaid
            Sum shall be made in the currency in which that Loan or Unpaid Sum
            is denominated on its due date.

      (b)   Each payment of interest shall be made in the currency in which the
            sum in respect of which the interest is payable was denominated when
            that interest accrued.

      (c)   Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in
            the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

30.9  CHANGE OF CURRENCY

      (a)   Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or
            currency unit are at the same time recognised by the central bank of
            any country as the lawful currency of that country, then:

            (i)   any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations
                  arising under the Finance Documents in, the currency of that
                  country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or
                  currency unit of that country designated by the relevant Agent
                  (after consultation with the Borrower); and

            (ii)  any translation from one currency or currency unit to another
                  shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the
                  central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency
                  unit into the other, rounded up or down by the relevant Agent
                  (acting reasonably) or in the case of any translation from or
                  to SIT at the relevant exchange rate from the list of Nova
                  Ljubljanska banka d.d., Ljubljana for the foreign exchange
                  transactions with legal entities (Tecajna lista Nove
                  Ljubljanske banka d.d., Ljubljana, za obracundeviznih prilivov
                  in odlivov podjetij) or any other applicable document of Nova
                  Ljubljanska banka d.d., Ljubljana with essentially similar
                  substance.

      (b)   If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement
            will, to the extent that the relevant Agent (acting reasonably and
            after consultation with the Borrower) specifies to be necessary, be
            amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market
            practice in the European Interbank Market and otherwise to reflect
            the change in currency.

31.   SET OFF

      A Finance Party may set off any matured obligation due from the Borrower
      under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that
      Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party
      to the Borrower, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or
      currency of either obligation. If the obligations are in different
      currencies, the Finance Party may for the purpose of the set off convert
      either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of
      business or, in the case of a SIT Facility Bank, at the relevant exchange
      rate from the list of Nova Ljubljanska banka d.d., Ljubljana for the
      foreign exchange transactions with legal entities (Tecajna lista Nove
      Ljubljanske banka d.d., Ljubljana, za obracundeviznih prilivov in odlivov

                        POPULATION COVERAGE VERIFICATION

1.    DEFINITIONS

      "POPULATION COVERAGE" means coverage of the Slovenian population with the
      Borrower's own Network, unless otherwise indicated measured at a receive
      signal level of -100 dBm, as described below excluding any coverage
      derived from roaming agreements with other operators or the assistance of
      any other telecommunications system other than the Network. The total
      population number shall be calculated using recent substantive population
      density data issued or based on Slovenian national statistics bureau.

2.    POPULATION COVERAGE MEASUREMENT

2.1   The Borrower shall present soft and hard copies of maps showing the
      Population Coverage based on detailed maps of Slovenia, area coverage
      based on a receive signal strength of -85 dBm, -95 dBm and -100 dBm and
      recent substantive Slovenian population density data imported into a
      Geographic Information System (GIS) software tool to display coverage maps
      and calculate the Population Coverage as defined in paragraph 3.4 below.

2.2   The coverage areas shall be based on the receive signal strength of -100
      dBm and shall include the predicted Population Coverage for this area. The
      Borrower shall use the most recent substantive Slovenian population
      density data available on the market and the density of population
      distribution data shall be per one kilometre square grid (or denser)
      across the whole of the territory of Slovenia with a coordinate for each
      respective grid located in the most populated area within the one
      kilometre. Any further assumptions for this coverage shall be clearly
      stated.

2.3   EVIDENCE OF POPULATION COVERAGE

      The Borrower shall present to the Off Shore Facility Agent as soon as the
      same becomes available but in any event not later than 45 days after the
      respective date for the achievement of the Population Coverage covenant as
      indicated in Clause 22.2(b) (Population Coverage) or Clause 22.4
      (Confirmation by Independent Technical Consultant) together with the
      respective Covenant Compliance Certificate the following evidences for the
      achievement of the respective Population Coverage as stipulated in Clause
      22.2(b) (Population Coverage) or Clause 22.4 (Confirmation by Independent
      Technical Consultant), which shall be verified by the Independent
      Technical Consultant:

2.3.1 Detailed coverage maps showing the receive signal strength of -100 dBm and
      -95 dBm (best server) for its own GSM Network as well as the site
      locations, site references and central coordinates of population
      settlements.

2.3.2 Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) reports per site showing site names
      and cell status (on air, TRX (TRX - Transceiver or Transmitter Receiver)
      power levels, BCCH channels (Broadcast Control Channel)).

2.3.3 Drive tests' reports verifications of the Population Coverage as defined
      in paragraph 3.5 below.

2.4   By the measurement of the Population Coverage the Borrower shall not
      include coverage areas provided:

2.4.1 by any other network (such as for national roaming);


                                    - 150 -
<PAGE>

2.4.2 temporary sites that have been established less than four weeks or any
      temporary site which are intended to be removed within 12 weeks after the
      milestone date without establishing a permanent site that gives equivalent
      coverage; and

2.4.3 by use of any temporary signal booster such as high power amplifier used
      to distort coverage.

3.    VERIFICATION OF POPULATION COVERAGE

3.1   DRIVE TEST ROUTES AND TIMESCALES

      The Borrower shall present detailed data as defined in paragraph 2.3 above
      on the proposed coverage area maps of regions in Slovenia at the latest
      six weeks prior to any of the dates for achievement of a certain level of
      Population Coverage as indicated in Clause 22.2(b) (Population Coverage)
      or Clause 22.4 (Confirmation by Independent Technical Consultant). This
      shall be based on the Borrower's BTS (Base Transceiver Station) sites that
      are projected to be 'on air' on the respective date for achievement of the
      respective level of Population Coverage as indicated in Clause 22.2(b)
      (Population Coverage) or Clause 22.4 (Confirmation by Independent
      Technical Consultant).

      In order to verify the coverage areas, drive test routes shall be mutually
      agreed between the Borrower and the Independent Technical Consultant at
      the latest three weeks prior to the respective date for achievement of a
      certain level of Population Coverage as indicated in Clause 22.2(b)
      (Population Coverage) or Clause 22.4 (Confirmation by Independent
      Technical Consultant) in order to substantiate coverage areas. Sample
      routes shall focus on areas with minimal coverage (below -95dBm best
      server) shown on the coverage maps and just within the borders of
      contiguous areas of Population Coverage. The Independent Technical
      Consultant may accompany the Borrower whilst performing some of the tests.

3.2   DURATION OF DRIVE TESTING

3.2.1 Drive routes shall be limited to no more than 10 days duration in total
      per Population Coverage covenant as indicated in Clause 22.2(b)
      (Population Coverage) unless prolonged by repeat tests as described in
      paragraph 3.2.2 below.

3.2.2 However should EITHER

      a)    the drive test reports (the format of which is as described in
            paragraph 3.5 below) show; OR

      b)    during the performance of the drive test it is observed that

      one or more routes whereby there occurs several dropped calls or that the
      receive signal strength is indicated below -100 dBm for a distance of 400
      metres or more (or for more than a total of five percent of the total
      distance of any drive route), THEN the associated drive route test shall
      be repeated with a nearby route in an area with higher receive signal
      strength until these criteria have been fulfilled.

3.3   FINALISATION OF THE POPULATION COVERAGE CALCULATION

      The final coverage maps, if amended by the drive tests reports according
      to measured coverage, shall be mutually agreed between the Independent
      Technical Consultant and the Borrower for the relevant Population Coverage
      covenant. Should the receive signal strength be -100 dBm or better for the
      majority of the land area within the grid (as defined in paragraph 2.2
      above) and should the coordinate for the respective grid be also covered
      then the population number for this grid shall be considered to be
      covered.

<PAGE>

3.4   TOOLS AND TEST EQUIPMENT REQUIRED BY THE BORROWER

      The Borrower shall use commercially available proven tools and test
      equipment to establish evidence of Population Coverage. The Borrower shall
      notify the Independent Technical Consultant prior to revising the proposed
      tools (as mentioned herein). Any replacement tool shall conform to the
      requirements as set out herein. The following Clauses describe these
      tools.

3.4.1 The Geographic Information System (GIS) software tool is an information
      system that is designed to work with data referenced by spatial or
      geographic coordinates. GIS is both a database system with specific
      capabilities for spatially referenced data, as well as a set of operations
      for analysis of the data. The GIS tool shall import detailed maps of
      Slovenia; statistical population density data and radio coverage plots in
      order to calculate the Population Coverage for all Slovenia. The
      calculation shall be made according to the methodology presented in
      paragraph 3.3. The proposed tools which will be used to perform this
      function are called Logica Odyssey and Arc View.

3.4.2 The drive test equipment and software is used in a suitable vehicle to
      analyse parameters of the uplink and downlink radio path between the
      mobile terminal and the BTS during idle mode, during call set-up and
      whilst in call mode. This should work with a laptop personal computer, a
      GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver with external antenna and a
      compatible Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) (1800 band) mobile
      terminal equipped with the manufacturer's test software. The handset shall
      preferably use an externally mounted GSM antenna on the vehicle along with
      suitable in line loss pad between the GSM antenna and the unit to
      compensate for external antenna gain. The proposed tool which will be used
      to perform this function is called Agilent E7475A with a Sagem mobile
      handset equipped with test software.(5)

3.4.3 A post processing software tool should be used to perform detailed
      analysis of the data produced by the drive testing. This shall be
      presented in the form of statistics and detailed drive test maps showing
      the routes and drive test reports for each route as defined in paragraph
      3.5. The proposed tool which will be used to perform this function is
      called Actix Analyzer software version 4.1.

3.5   DRIVE TEST REPORTS

      For each route the Borrower shall prepare a report containing all relevant
      measured data. The report shall be made available in softcopy to the
      Independent Technical Consultant and the Off Shore Facility Agent.

      This report shall include a statistical summary of the field measurements
      (RXQUAL (Receive quality according to indicators reflecting the Bit Error
      Rate), RXLEV (Receive Signal level stated in dBm) distribution) and the
      plot of measured RXLEV and RXQUAL, as well as the location of call set-up
      failures and call drops on a map that shall also show the defined drive
      routes. RXQUAL and RXLEV shall be measured only whilst the mobile terminal
      is on a permanent call and not whilst in idle mode. The cell BCCH channel
      number shall also be detailed on the map.

      Actix                     UK company providing quality measurement and
                                analysis software to the mobile industry.

(5)   Outside antenna gives more accurate and consistent results. Up to 10 dB
      variations can be introduced due to exact location of handset (such as on
      passenger seat or clipped to dashboard) which is affected by losses from
      surrounding such as body-loss.
