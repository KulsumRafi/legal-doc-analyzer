     3.   EARLY TERMINATION RIGHT. Provided that at the time Tenant exercises
any right under this section no Event of Default exists, nor any condition
exists that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute an Event of Default under the Lease, Tenant shall have right to
terminate this Lease prior to its expiration effective any time on or after
January 1, 2006, by giving Landlord at least twelve (12) months' prior written
notice of such termination (which notice may be given prior to January 1, 2006
and must be given no later than January 1, 2005 in order to effect a termination
on January 1, 2006). If Tenant exercises its right under this Section to
terminate the Lease early, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to six
(6) months of Minimum Monthly Rent at the rate in effect for the six (6) months
immediately following the effective date of termination. Such early termination
right shall not be considered a default remedy.

     4.   BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. Irving Hughes Group has represented Tenant as
real estate broker in connection with this Amendment, and Landlord shall pay a
commission to such broker on the terms and conditions of a separate agreement
between such broker and Landlord. Tenant warrants that it has had no dealings
with any other real estate broker or agent in connection with the negotiation of
this transaction, and it knows of no other real estate broker or agent who is
entitled to a commission in connection with this transaction. Tenant agrees to
indemnify, protect, hold harmless and defend Landlord from and against any
obligation or liability to pay any commission or compensation to any other party
arising from the act or agreement of Tenant.

     5.   NO OTHER CHANGE. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Lease remain unchanged and in
full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the First Amendment to Standard Industrial Net Lease
is executed as of the date first above written.
