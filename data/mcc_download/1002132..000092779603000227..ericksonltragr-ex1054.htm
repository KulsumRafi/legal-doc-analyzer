Letter contemplated the issuance to you of options to purchase
                    275,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. In lieu of providing the
                    options to you pursuant to an Employment Agreement, we have issued the options
                    to you on February 7, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Company&#146;s 1995
                    Stock Plan and accompanying Stock Option Agreement. The options will have the
                    same terms and vesting schedule as set forth in the March 15 Letter. The
                    exercise price of the options will be in accordance with the Company&#146;s 1995
                    Stock Plan based on the closing price on February 7, 2003. The options will not
                    be &#147;incentive stock options.&#148; In the event that a mutually acceptable
                    Employment Agreement as referred to in the March 15 Letter has not been executed
                    by you and the Company on or before June 30, 2003 (or such later date to which
                    your engagement has been extended pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof), or your
                    engagement as a consultant has terminated for any reason other than the reasons
                    specified in paragraph 7 below, 100% of the aforementioned 275,000 options will
                    vest and all such options, including 100% of the 25,000 stock options which we
                    previously provided to you in 2002 pursuant to the March 15 Letter, will be
                    exercisable thereafter for one year, except as set forth in paragraph 7 hereof.
                    In the event your engagement has not been terminated at the time of a Change in
                    Control of the Company (as hereinafter defined in this paragraph) 100% of the
                    aforementioned 275,000 options will vest and all such options, including 100% of
                    the 25,000 stock options which we previously provided to you in 2002 pursuant to
                    the March 15 Letter, will be exercisable thereafter for one year. For purposes
                    of the accelerated vesting and extension of the exercise period of such stock
                    options upon a change of control, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have
                    occurred when: (a) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the Company; (b)
                    there is a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving
                    corporation (other than a merger or consolidation with a direct or indirect
                    wholly-owned subsidiary, a reincorporation of the Company in a different
                    jurisdiction, or other transaction in which there is no substantial change in
                    the shareholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings); (c) there is
                    a merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but after which the
                    shareholders of the Company prior to such merger (other than any shareholder
                    which merges (or which owns or controls another corporation which merges) with
                    the Company in such merger) own less than 50% of the voting shares or other
                    equity interests in the Company after such merger; (d) there is a sale of
                    substantially all of the assets of the Company; (e) there is an acquisition,
                    sale or transfer of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company by
                    tender offer or similar transaction; (f) a new or existing shareholder who may
                    be a member of management (other than you) or an affiliate obtains unilateral
                    control, directly or indirectly, of the Company or its Board of Directors,
                    whether alone or in concert with others; (g) a new shareholder or group of
                    shareholders that may include current management (other than you) or affiliates
                    obtains unilateral control, directly or indirectly, of the Company or its Board
                    of Directors; (h) there is an involuntary change in the composition, as of the
                    Effective Time, of more than 33% of the Board of Directors of the Company; or
                    (i) any person, entity or combination thereof controls, individually or
                    collectively, through ownership, assignment, voting proxy or the like, 50% or
                    more of the outstanding voting shares ordinarily having the right to vote for

Company and you do not believe that any remuneration hereunder
          will not be deductible by the Company by reason of the applicability of Section

          agree that the amounts to be paid hereunder are subject to the following and
          that in the event any payment or benefit received or to be received by you in
          connection with a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or a
          change in ownership of substantial assets of the Company within the meaning of
          Section 280G, or the termination of your engagement (collectively, &#147;Total
          Payments&#148;) would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company as
          the result of Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall pay to you an amount
          equal to the payments and benefits due under this Agreement reduced until no
          portion of the Total Payments is not deductible as the result of Section 280G of
          the Code (the &#147;Reduced Amount&#148;), by the Company reducing or delaying,
          to the extent necessary, the payments due hereunder; provided, however, that the
          Company shall first reduce the termination fee before reducing or delaying other
          amounts or benefits due so long as, after such reduction and such delay, the
          aggregate present value of the Total Payments is no more than the Reduced
          Amount. However, in the event that the Parachute Payments are greater than four
          and eleven one-hundredths (4.11) times the Base Amount, as those terms are
          defined in Section 280G of the Code, then the Total Payments will not be so
          reduced or delayed, but instead the Total Payments will be paid by the Company
          to you in full pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and you will be
          responsible to pay the amount of any federal, state and local income taxes and
          any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code on such payments due
          hereunder (the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), and the Company shall have no obligation
          to pay to you any additional payment for such Excise Tax, if any, and you shall
          have no liability or responsibility to reimburse the Company for any losses
          incurred by the Company as a result of the Company&#146;s inability to deduct
          such payment, in whole or in part, as the result of Section 280G of the Code.
          For purposes of the above limitations, (A) no portion of the Total Payments
          which shall have been reduced as described herein prior to the date of payment,
          shall be taken into account, (B) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken
          into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel selected by you and acceptable
          to the Company&#146;s independent auditors, which opinion shall be addressed to
          the Company, and which opinion shall be acceptable to the Company&#146;s
          independent auditors, is not likely to constitute a &#147;parachute
          payment&#148; within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and (C) the
          value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the
          Total Payments, the applicability of Section 280G of the Code (and the Treasury
          Regulations promulgated thereunder), and all computations thereunder, shall be
          determined by the Company&#146;s independent auditors in accordance with the
          principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code (and the Treasury
          Regulations promulgated thereunder). The Company and you shall each reasonably
          cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial
          proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for any Excise Tax
          with respect to the payments and benefits due under this Agreement. As promptly
          as practicable following such determination and the elections hereunder, the
          Company shall pay or distribute to you or for your benefit such payments and
          benefits as are then due to you under this Agreement and shall promptly pay or
          distribute to you or for your benefit in the future such payments and benefits
          as become due to you under this Agreement. In the event that an underpayment of
          payments and benefits due to you under this Agreement occurs as a result of a
          miscalculation of the Total Payments as a &#147;parachute payment&#148; within
          the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, such underpayment shall be paid
          promptly by the Company to you or for your benefit, together with interest at
          the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code. </FONT></TD>
