initially capitalized terms used in this Amendment without definition
shall have the meanings assigned to those terms in the Credit Agreement.

     2.  This Amendment is deemed incorporated into each of the Loan
Documents. To the extent that any term or provision of this Amendment is
or may be deemed expressly inconsistent with any term or provision in any
Loan Document, the terms and provisions hereof shall control.

     3.  The Borrower and the Guarantors hereby represent and warrant
that (a) all of their respective representations and warranties in the
Loan Documents are true and correct, (b) no default or Event of Default
exists under any Loan Document, and (c) this Amendment has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and constitutes their legal, valid and
binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

     4.  The Borrower and the Guarantors hereby confirm that any
collateral for the Obligations, including but not limited to liens,
security interests, mortgages, and pledges granted by the Borrower, the
Guarantors or third parties (if applicable), shall continue unimpaired

comprehensiveness of the foregoing, the Guarantors specifically ratify
and affirm the continuing validity, enforceability and binding effect of
their respective guaranty agreements executed and delivered to the Agent
on behalf of the Banks with respect to Borrower's Obligations under the
Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

     5.  To induce the Agent and the Banks to enter into this Amendment,
the Borrower and each of the Guarantors waives and releases and forever
discharges the Agent and the Banks and their respective officers,

claim, loss or expense of any kind that it may have against the Agent or
the Banks, or any of them, arising out of or relating to the Obligations.
The Borrower and each of the Guarantors further agrees to indemnify and
hold the Agent and the Banks and their respective officers, directors,
attorneys, agents and employees harmless from any loss, damage, judgment,
liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) suffered by or rendered
against the Agent or the Banks, or any of them, on account of any claims
arising out of or relating to the Obligations.  The Borrower and each of
the Guarantors further states that it has carefully read the foregoing
release and indemnity, knows the contents thereof and grants the same as
its own free act and deed.

     6.  This Amendment may be signed in any number of counterpart copies
and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, but all such copies
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     7.  This Amendment will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Banks and the Agent and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

     8.  The following are conditions precedent to the Banks' agreement

amount of $10,000.00.

        (b)  The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent for its out of pocket
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Amendment, including,
without limitation, its attorney fees and expenses.

        (c)  The Borrower and the Guarantors shall execute such
reaffirmation documents and other documents, instruments and agreements
that the Agent may request from time to time in order to evidence, ratify
and affirm its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the security interests, liens and pledges effected thereby.

     9.  Except as amended hereby, the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents remain unchanged and in full force and effect, and are hereby
ratified and affirmed.  Except as expressly provided herein, this
Amendment shall not constitute an amendment, waiver, consent or release
with respect to any provision of any Loan Document, a waiver of any
default or Event of Default thereunder, or a waiver or release of any of
the Banks' rights and remedies (all of which are hereby reserved).  The
Borrower and each of the Guarantors expressly ratifies and confirms the
confession of judgment and waiver of jury trial provisions (if
