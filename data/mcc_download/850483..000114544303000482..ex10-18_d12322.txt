          Prior to September 30, 2001, Agent and Borrower shall renegotiate the
          above financial covenants for application to any subsequent periods of
          this Agreement. If on or prior to September 30, 2001, the parties fail
          to execute a written amendment to this Agreement providing for such
          revised financial covenants for any subsequent periods of this
          Agreement, then the above financial covenants in effect for the
          calendar quarter ending June 30, 2001, shall be and remain in effect,
          until such amendment is executed and in full force and effect.

For purposes of this paragraph: (i) "Tangible Net Worth" means the book value of
Borrower's assets less liabilities (including as liabilities all recorded
reserves for contingencies and other potential liabilities), excluding from such
assets all Intangibles; (ii) "Intangibles" means and includes general
intangibles (as that term is defined in the UCC); accounts receivable and
advances due from officers, directors, member, owner, employees, stockholders
and affiliates; leasehold improvements net of depreciation; licenses; good will;
prepaid expenses (except for those determined by Agent, in its sole discretion,
not to be Intangible); escrow deposits (except for those determined by Agent, in
its sole discretion, not to be Intangible); covenants not to compete; the excess
of cost over book value of acquired assets; franchise fees; organizational
costs; finance reserves held for recourse obligations; capitalized research and
development costs; and such other similar items as DFS may from time to time
determine in DFS' sole discretion; (iii) "Debt" means all of Borrower's
liabilities and indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind and nature
whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and including
obligations under capitalized leases, guaranties or with respect to which
Borrower has pledged assets to secure performance, whether or not direct
recourse liability has been assumed by Borrower; (iv) "Subordinated Debt" means
all of Borrower's Debt which is subordinated to the payment of Borrower's
liabilities to the Lenders by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
Agent; and (v) "Current Assets" means Borrower's current assets. The foregoing
terms will be determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and, if
applicable, on a consolidated basis ("Financial Covenants")."

4.   Each and every reference in the Agreement to the "Credit Agreement" shall
     be deemed to refer to that certain Second Amended and Restated Business
     Credit and Security Agreement among Dealer, DFS, DFS as agent, and certain
     lenders named therein, dated on July 28, 1997, as amended from time to
     time.

5.   Paragraph number 9 of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and
     replaced with the following:

"9.  Payment Terms/Paydown. Dealer will immediately pay DFS the principal
     indebtedness owed DFS on each item of Collateral financed by DFS (as shown
     on the Statement of Transaction identifying such Collateral) on the
     earliest occurrence of any of the following events: (a) when such
     Collateral is lost, stolen or damaged; (b) for Collateral financed under
     Pay-As-Sold ("PAS") terms (as shown on the Statement of Transaction
     identifying such Collateral), when such


                                       35
<PAGE>

     Collateral is sold, transferred, rented, leased, otherwise disposed of or
     matured; (c) in strict accordance with any curtailment schedule for such
     Collateral (as shown on the Statement of Transaction identifying such
     Collateral); (d) for Collateral financed under Scheduled Payment Program
     ("SPP") terms (as shown on the Statement of Transaction identifying such
     Collateral), in strict accordance with the installment payment schedule;
     and (e) when otherwise required under the terms of any financing program
     agreed to in writing by the parties.

     Dealer will forward to DFS by the 10th day of each month a Collateral
     Summary Report (as defined below) dated as of the last day of the prior
     month. Regardless of the SPP terms pertaining to any Collateral financed by
     DFS, and notwithstanding any scheduled payments made by Dealer after the
     Determination Date (as defined below), if DFS determines, after reviewing
     the Collateral Summary Report, after conducting an inspection of the
     Collateral or otherwise, that (i) Collateral Liquidation Value as of the
     Determination Date is less than (ii) One Hundred and Twenty-Five Percent
     (125%) of the total current outstanding indebtedness owed by Dealer to DFS
     as of the date of the Collateral Summary Report, inspection or any other
     date on which a paydown is otherwise required hereunder, as applicable (the
     'Determination Date'), Dealer will immediately upon demand pay to DFS the
     amount necessary so that the Collateral Liquidation Value as of the
     Determination Date equals or exceeds One Hundred and Twenty-Five Percent
     (125%) of the total current outstanding indebtedness owed by Dealer as of
     the Determination Date.

     The term 'Collateral Summary Report' is defined herein to mean a report
     compiled by Dealer specifying: (a) the total aggregate wholesale invoice
     price of all of Dealer's inventory financed by DFS that is unsold and in
     Dealer's possession and control as of the date of such Report; and (b) the
     total aggregate wholesale invoice price of all of Dealer's inventory not
     financed by DFS that is unsold and in Dealer's possession and control as of
     the date of such Report: in each case to the extent DFS has a first
     priority, fully perfected security interest therein.

     The term 'Collateral Liquidation Value' is defined herein to mean: (a) one
     hundred percent (100%) of the total aggregate wholesale invoice price of
     all of Dealer's inventory financed by DFS that is unsold, in unopened boxes
     or other containers, as applicable, and in Dealer's possession and control
     as of the date of the Collateral Summary Report and not aged more than six
     (6) months from the date of invoice, and (b) fifty percent (50%) of the
     total aggregate wholesale invoice price of all Dealer's inventory not
     financed by DFS that is unsold, in unopened boxes or other containers, as
     applicable, and in Dealer's possession and control as of the date of the
     Collateral Summary Report and not aged more than six (6) months from the


                                       36
<PAGE>

     date of invoice; in each case to the extent DFS has a first priority, fully
     perfected security interest therein subject to the terms of that certain
     Subordination Agreement dated as of July 28, 1997 among DFS, in its
     individual capacity, DFS, as agent, and certain lenders named therein;.

     If Dealer from time to time is required to make immediate payment to DFS of
     any past due obligation discovered during any Collateral audit, upon review
     of a Collateral Summary Report or at any other time, Dealer agrees that
     acceptance of such payment by DFS shall not be construed to have waived or
     amended the terms of its financing program. The proceeds of any Collateral
     received by Dealer will be held by Dealer in trust for DFS' benefit, for
     application as provided in this Agreement. Dealer will send all payments to
     DFS' branch office(s) responsible for Dealer's account. DFS may apply: (i)
     payments to reduce finance charges first and then principal, regardless of
     Dealer's instructions; and (ii) principal payments to the oldest (earliest)
     invoice for Collateral financed by DFS, but, in any event, all principal
     payments will first be applied to such Collateral which is sold, lost,
     stolen, damaged, rented, leased, or otherwise disposed of or unaccounted
     for. Any third party discount, rebate, bonus or credit granted to Dealer
     for any Collateral will not reduce the debt Dealer owes DFS until DFS has
     received payment therefor in cash. Dealer will: (1) pay DFS even if any
     Collateral is defective or fails to conform to any warranties extended by
     any third party; (2) not assert against DFS any claim or defense Dealer has
     against any third party; and (3) indemnify and hold DFS harmless against
     all claims and defenses asserted by any buyer of the Collateral relating to
     the condition of, or any representations regarding, any of the Collateral.
     Dealer waives all rights of offset and counterclaims Dealer may have
     against DFS."

     All other terms as they appear in the Agreement, to the extent consistent
with the foregoing, are ratified and remain unchanged and in full force and
effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Dealer and DFS have executed this Amendment to
Agreement for Wholesale Financing this 13th day of March, 2001.

                                        GTSI Corp.
