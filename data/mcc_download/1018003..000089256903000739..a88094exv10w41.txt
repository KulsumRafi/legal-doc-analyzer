Termination Date:

                (a) make loans in Available Currencies ("Revolving Loans") to
        any Borrower equal to such Lender's Percentage of the aggregate amount
        of the Borrowing to be made on such Business Day, all in accordance with
        Section 3.1; provided that no Lender shall be required to make any
        Revolving Loan if, after giving effect thereto:

                        (i) such Lender's Outstanding Credit Extensions would
                exceed its Credit Commitment Amount; or

                        (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Credit Extensions of all
                the Lenders would exceed the then Total Credit Commitment

        equal to its Percentage in each Letter of Credit issued upon the
        application of any Borrower pursuant to Section 3.2; provided that no
        Issuer shall issue a Letter of Credit if, after giving effect thereto:



                                      -26-
<PAGE>

                        (i) the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings would
                exceed the then Letter of Credit Limit; or

                        (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Credit Extensions of all
                the Lenders would exceed the then Total Credit Commitment
                Amount.

On and subject to the conditions hereof, the Borrowers may from time to time
borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans and may apply for, extinguish or
reimburse drawings made under and re-apply for Letters of Credit. For purposes
of this Section 2.1, the Dollar Amount on any date of any Credit Extension
denominated in an Available Currency (other than Dollars) shall be calculated
based upon the spot rate at which Dollars are offered on such day for such
Available Currency which appears on Telerate Page 261 at approximately 11:00
a.m., London time, (and if such spot rate is not available on Telerate Page 261
as of such time, such spot rate as quoted by Scotia Capital, in London at
approximately 11:00 a.m., London time).

        SECTION 2.2 REDUCTIONS OF THE COMMITMENT AMOUNTS. Micro may, from time
to time on any Business Day, voluntarily reduce the Total Credit Commitment
Amount; provided that:

                (a) All such reductions shall require at least three and not
        more than five Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent
        and shall be permanent, and any partial reduction thereof shall be in a
        minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000
        (or, if less, in an amount equal to the Total Credit Commitment Amount
        at such time);

                (b) Micro shall not voluntarily reduce the Total Credit
        Commitment Amount pursuant to this section to an amount which, on the
        date of proposed reduction, is less than the aggregate Outstanding
        Credit Extensions of all the Lenders; and

                (c) Once so reduced, the Total Commitment Amount may not be
        increased.

        SECTION 2.3 INELIGIBLE CURRENCIES. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, if, at any time before the Commitment Termination Date, the
Administrative Agent determines that an Available Currency is an Ineligible
Currency, then (a) the Administrative Agent may (in its sole discretion) at any
time so notify the relevant Borrower of any Borrowing denominated in that
Ineligible Currency, and (b) the Commitments of the Lenders to make Revolving
Loans in that Available Currency shall be suspended unless and until the
Administrative Agent determines that such Available Currency is no longer an
Ineligible Currency. Promptly after receiving that notice and, in any event,
within five Business Days of receiving the same, that Borrower will notify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders as to what Available Currency it desires
that Borrowing to be converted into and promptly thereafter the relevant Lenders
shall so convert that Borrowing on the last day of its Interest Period. If the
relevant Borrower fails to select another Available Currency as provided in the
preceding sentence, then that other Available Currency shall be selected by the
Administrative Agent. The conversion shall be effected at the relevant spot rate
at which the Ineligible Currency is offered on that last day for the selected
Available Currency that appears on Telerate Page 261 at approximately 11:00
a.m., London time, (and if such spot rate is not available on Telerate



                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Page 261 as of that time, the spot rate as quoted by Scotia Capital in London at
approximately 11:00 a.m., London time) or, if that spot rate shall not exist,
such other rate of exchange as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
determine.

                        PROCEDURES FOR CREDIT EXTENSIONS

        SECTION 3.1 BORROWING PROCEDURE FOR REVOLVING LOANS.

                (a) On any Business Day occurring on or prior to the Commitment
        Termination Date, any Borrower may from time to time irrevocably
        request, by delivering on or prior to 1:00 p.m., Applicable Time, on
        such Business Day a Borrowing Request to the Administrative Agent not
        less than three nor more than five Business Days before the date of the
        proposed Borrowing, that a Borrowing be made in a minimum amount of
        $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000, or if less, in the
        unused amount of the Total Credit Commitment Amount. Upon the receipt of
        each Borrowing Request, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt
        notice thereof to each Lender on the same day such Borrowing Request is
        received. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
        each Borrowing shall be made on the Business Day specified in such
        Borrowing Request. On or before 2:30 p.m., Applicable Time, on such
        Business Day, each Lender shall deposit with the Administrative Agent
        (to an account specified by the Administrative Agent to each Lender from
        time to time) same day funds in an amount equal to such Lender's
        Percentage of the requested Borrowing.

                (b) To the extent funds are received from the Lenders (except as
        otherwise provided in Section 10.2), the Administrative Agent shall make
        such funds available to the relevant Borrower by wire transfer of same
        day funds to the accounts such Borrower shall have specified in its
        Borrowing Request. No Lender's obligation to make any Revolving Loan
        shall be affected by any other Lender's failure to make any Revolving
        Loan.

        SECTION 3.2 LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUANCE PROCEDURES. By delivering to the
Administrative Agent an Issuance Request on or before 1:00 p.m., Applicable
Time, on any Business Day occurring prior to the Commitment Termination Date,
any Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuer issue a Letter of
Credit. Each such request shall be made on not less than two Business Days'
notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent),
and not less than 30 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date. Upon receipt
of an Issuance Request, the Administrative Agent shall promptly on the same day
notify the applicable Issuer (if other than Scotia Capital) and each Lender
thereof. Each Letter of Credit shall by its terms be denominated in an Available
Currency and be stated to expire (whether originally or after giving effect to
any extension) on the earlier of (its "Stated Expiry Date") (i) (unless
otherwise agreed to by the Issuer) one year from the date of issuance thereof or
(ii) the Commitment Termination Date. The relevant Borrower and the relevant
Issuer may amend or modify any issued Letter of Credit upon written notice to
the Administrative Agent only; provided that (A) any amendment constituting an
extension of such Letter of Credit's Stated Expiry Date shall comply with the
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence and



                                      -28-
<PAGE>

may be made only if the Commitment Termination Date has not occurred and (B) any
amendment constituting an increase in the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit
shall be deemed a request for the issuance of a new Letter of Credit and shall
comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. Upon satisfaction of the
terms and conditions hereunder, the relevant Issuer will issue each Letter of
Credit to be issued by it and will make available to the beneficiary thereof the
original of such Letter of Credit.

        SECTION 3.2.1 OTHER LENDERS' PARTICIPATION. Automatically, and without
further action, upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender (other
than the Issuer of such Letter of Credit) shall be deemed to have irrevocably
purchased from the relevant Issuer, to the extent of such Lender's Percentage, a
participation interest in such Letter of Credit (including any Reimbursement
Obligation and any other Contingent Liability with respect thereto), and such
Lender shall, to the extent of its Percentage, be responsible for reimbursing
promptly (and in any event within one Business Day after receipt of demand for
payment from the Issuer, together with accrued interest from the day of such
demand) the relevant Issuer for any Reimbursement Obligation which has not been
reimbursed in accordance with Section 3.2.3. In addition, such Lender shall, to
the extent of its Percentage, be entitled to receive a ratable portion of the
Letter of Credit participation fee payable pursuant to clause (a) of Section
4.3.3 with respect to each Letter of Credit and a ratable portion of any
interest payable pursuant to Sections 3.2.2 and 4.2.

        SECTION 3.2.2 DISBURSEMENTS. Subject to the terms and provisions of each
Letter of Credit and this Agreement, upon presentment under any Letter of Credit
to the Issuer thereof for payment, such Issuer shall make such payment to the
beneficiary (or its designee) of such Letter of Credit on the date designated
for such payment (the "Disbursement Date"). Such Issuer will promptly notify the
relevant Borrower and each of the Lenders of the presentment for payment of any
such Letter of Credit, together with notice of the Disbursement Date thereof.
Prior to 12:00 noon, Applicable Time, on the next Business Day following the
Disbursement Date, the relevant Borrower will reimburse the Administrative
Agent, for the account of such Issuer, for all amounts disbursed under such
Letter of Credit, together with all interest accrued thereon since the
Disbursement Date. To the extent the Administrative Agent does not receive
payment in full, on behalf of the relevant Issuer on the Disbursement Date, the
relevant Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation shall accrue interest, payable on
demand, at an annual rate equal to the Reference Rate through the first Business
Day following the Disbursement Date and equal to the sum of the Reference Rate
plus 0.50% thereafter. In the event the relevant Borrower fails to notify the
Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuer prior to 1:00 p.m., Applicable
Time, on the Disbursement Date that the relevant Borrower intends to pay the
Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuer, for the amount of such
drawing with funds other than proceeds of Revolving Loans, or the Administrative
Agent does not receive such reimbursement payment from the relevant Borrower
prior to 1:00 p.m., Applicable Time, on the Disbursement Date (or if the
relevant Issuer must for any reason return or disgorge such reimbursement), the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders, and the relevant
Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely Borrowing Request as of the
Disbursement Date for Revolving Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to
such Reimbursement Obligation and the Lenders (other than the relevant Issuer)
shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Sections 6.1 and 6.2), make Revolving Loans in the amount of
such Reimbursement Obligation as provided in Section 3.1; provided that for the



                                      -29-
<PAGE>

purpose of determining the availability of any unused Total Credit Commitment
Amount immediately prior to giving effect to the application of the proceeds of
such Revolving Loans, such Reimbursement Obligation shall be deemed not to be
outstanding at such time. In the event that the conditions precedent to any
Revolving Loans deemed requested by the relevant Borrower as provided in the
preceding sentence shall not be satisfied at the time of such deemed request,
each Lender (including the relevant Issuer) shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, as funding of its participation interest pursuant to Section 3.2.1 in the
related Letter of Credit, its Percentage of the related Reimbursement
Obligation, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant
Issuer the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. If a Lender makes a
payment pursuant to this subsection to reimburse an Issuer in respect of any
Reimbursement Obligation (other than by funding Revolving Loans as contemplated
above), (i) such payment will not constitute a Revolving Loan and will not
relieve the relevant Borrower of its Reimbursement Obligation and (ii) such
Lender will be subrogated to its pro rata share of the relevant Issuer's claim
against such Borrower for payment of such Reimbursement Obligation.

        SECTION 3.2.3 REIMBURSEMENT. The obligation (the "Reimbursement
Obligation") of the relevant Borrower under Section 3.2.2 to reimburse the
relevant Issuer with respect to each disbursement under a Letter of Credit
(including interest thereon), and, upon the failure of the relevant Borrower to
reimburse such Issuer, the obligation of each Lender to reimburse such Issuer,
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the
relevant Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, may have or have had
against the relevant Issuer or any Lender, including any defense based upon the
failure of any disbursement under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of
the applicable Letter of Credit (if, in the relevant Issuer's good faith
opinion, such disbursement is determined to be appropriate) or any
non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such
Letter of Credit; provided that nothing herein shall require the relevant
Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, to reimburse an Issuer for any
wrongful disbursement made by such Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result
of acts or omissions finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuer.

        SECTION 3.2.4 DEEMED DISBURSEMENTS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default of the type described in Section 9.1.9 or,
with notice from the Administrative Agent given at the direction of the Required
Lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of
Default, an amount equal to the then aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit
which are undrawn and available under all issued and outstanding Letters of
Credit shall, without demand upon or notice to any Borrower, be deemed to have
been paid or disbursed by the Issuer under such Letters of Credit
(notwithstanding that such amount may not in fact have been so paid or
disbursed) and the Borrowers shall be immediately obligated to pay to the Issuer
of each Letter of Credit an amount equal to such amount. Any amounts so payable
by the relevant Borrower pursuant to Section 3.2.4 shall be deposited in cash
with the Administrative Agent and held in trust (for the sole benefit of the
relevant Issuer and the Lenders) for payment of the Obligations arising in
connection with such Letters of Credit. If such Event of Default shall have been
cured or waived (provided that no other Default has occurred and is continuing
and the Obligations have not been accelerated pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3),
the Administrative Agent shall promptly return to the relevant Borrower all
amounts deposited by it with the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section
3.2.4 (together with



                                      -30-
<PAGE>

accrued interest thereon at the Administrative Agent's Cost of Funds or such
other interest rate based upon a cash equivalent investment (in the form of
obligations issued by or guaranteed by the U.S. government, commercial paper of
a domestic corporation rated A-1 by S&P or a comparable rating from another
nationally recognized rating agency or certificates of deposit of a U.S. or
Canadian bank with (x) a credit rating of Aa or better by S&P or a comparable
rating from another nationally recognized rating agency and (y) a combined
capital and surplus greater than $250,000,000) which is agreed to between the
relevant Issuer and the relevant Borrower), net of any amount (which may include
accrued interest) applied to the payment of any Obligations with respect to the
Letters of Credit.

        SECTION 3.2.5 NATURE OF REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Borrower and, to
the extent set forth in Section 3.2.1, each Lender shall assume all risks of the
acts, omission or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. No
Issuer or any Lender (except to the extent of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction)
shall be responsible for:

                (a) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
        legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with
        the application for an issuance of a Letter of Credit, even if it should
        in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
        inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;

                (b) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
        legal effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting
        to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
        thereunder or the proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove
        to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;

                (c) failure of the beneficiary to comply fully with conditions
        required in order to demand payment under a Letter of Credit; provided
        that if a payment is made pursuant to such Letter of Credit when a
        beneficiary has failed to comply with the conditions therefor and such
        failure to comply is manifest on the face of such Letter of Credit or
        the documents submitted by the beneficiary in connection therewith, the
        relevant Borrower shall be required to indemnify the Issuer in
        connection therewith only if, and to the extent, the relevant Borrower
        or any of its Subsidiaries has received the benefit of such payment on
        such Letter of Credit by one or more of their obligations being
        satisfied, either in whole or in part;

                (d) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission
        or delivery of any messages, by mail, telecopy or otherwise; or

                (e) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
        document or draft required in order to make a disbursement under a
        Letter of Credit.

None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the
rights or powers granted to any Issuer or any Lender hereunder. In furtherance
and extension and not in limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing (but
subject to the limitations set forth in clause (c) above), any action taken or
omitted to be taken by an Issuer in good faith (and not constituting gross
negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent



                                      -31-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction) shall be binding upon the relevant Borrower and each Lender, and
shall not put such Issuer under any resulting liability to any Borrower or any
Lender.

        SECTION 3.2.6 INELIGIBLE CURRENCIES. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, if, at any time prior to the Commitment Termination
Date, the Administrative Agent determines that the Available Currency in which a
Letter of Credit has been issued is an Ineligible Currency, then the
Administrative Agent may (in its sole discretion) at any time notify the
relevant Borrower of the same, and the Administrative Agent shall then promptly
notify each other Lender. Such relevant Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit to accept a substitution for such
Letter of Credit with another Letter of Credit in an Available Currency
acceptable to such Borrower and the relevant Issuer.

        SECTION 3.2.7 EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT. On the Effective Date, the
letters of credit disclosed in Item 3.2.7 (Existing Letters of Credit) of the
Disclosure Schedule and outstanding under the $50,000,000 uncommitted standby
letter of credit line dated as of October 19, 2001, and as amended as of July
30, 2002 between Micro, certain of its Subsidiaries and Scotia Capital shall
automatically and without any action on the part of any Person, become Letters
of Credit hereunder issued for the account of Micro as the relevant Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                      PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEE PAYMENTS

        SECTION 4.1 LOAN ACCOUNTS, NOTES, PAYMENTS, AND PREPAYMENTS. The
Outstanding Credit Extensions shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts or
records maintained by the Administrative Agent which loan accounts or records
shall be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, of the amount of those
Outstanding Credit Extensions and the interest and principal payments thereon.
Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or
otherwise affect the Obligations of the relevant Borrower under the Loan
Documents to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. Upon the
request of any Lender made at any time through the Administrative Agent, the
relevant Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to that Lender a Revolving
Note to evidence Revolving Loans made by that Lender to the relevant Borrower.

        SECTION 4.1.1 REPAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING LOANS. The
relevant Borrower shall make all payments and prepayments of each Revolving Loan
made to it in the Available Currency in which it was originally denominated and
shall repay in full the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
outstanding to it at the Maturity thereof. Before that Maturity:

                (a) the relevant Borrower may, from time to time on any Business
        Day, make a voluntary prepayment, in whole or in part, of the
        outstanding principal amount of any Revolving Loan; provided that:

                        (i) any such prepayment of any Revolving Loan shall be
                allocated to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's
                Percentage of the Revolving Loans so prepaid;



                                       32

<PAGE>

                        (ii) any such prepayment of any Revolving Loan made on
                any day other than the last day of the Interest Period then
                applicable to such Revolving Loan shall be subject to Section
                5.4;

                        (iii) all such voluntary prepayments shall require prior
                notice to the Administrative Agent of at least three but no more
                than five Business Days; and

                        (iv) all such voluntary prepayments shall, if other than
                a prepayment in whole, be in an aggregate minimum amount of
                $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000;

                (b) The Administrative Agent shall determine if the aggregate
        Outstanding Credit Extensions of all the Lenders exceed the Total Credit
        Commitment Amount (i) at the end of each Fiscal Period and (ii) on the
        date of each request for a Credit Extension (excluding any request
        submitted in respect of any continuation of any Borrowing previously
        made hereunder), and promptly thereafter -- and in any event, in respect
        of any determination made pursuant to clause (ii) above, prior to the
        proposed date of such requested Credit Extension -- Micro shall (or
        shall cause the other Borrowers to) make a mandatory prepayment of the
        outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans as Micro may select
        in an amount equal to such excess, such prepayment to be allocated to
        the Lenders in the manner set forth in clause (a)(i) above); and

                (c) Micro shall (and shall cause the other relevant Borrowers
        to), on each date when any reduction or termination in the Total Credit
        Commitment Amount shall become effective, including pursuant to Section
        2.2, make a mandatory prepayment of all Revolving Loans equal to the
        excess, if any, of the then aggregate Outstanding Credit Extensions of
        all the Lenders over the Total Credit Commitment Amount as so reduced,
        such prepayment to be allocated to the Lenders in the manner set forth
        in clause (a)(i) above.

        SECTION 4.2 INTEREST PROVISIONS. Each Revolving Loan shall bear interest
from and including the day when made until (but not including) the day such
Revolving Loan shall be paid in full, and such interest shall accrue and be
payable in accordance with this Section 4.2.

        SECTION 4.2.1 RATES. Subject to Sections 4.2.2 and 5.1, each Revolving
Loan shall bear an annual rate of interest, during each Interest Period
applicable thereto, equal to the sum of (i) the LIBO Rate for such Interest
Period, (ii) the Applicable Margin, plus (iii) Mandatory Costs (if any).

        SECTION 4.2.2 POST-MATURITY RATES. After the date any principal amount
of any Revolving Loan is due and payable (whether at Maturity, upon acceleration
or otherwise), or after any other monetary Obligation of Micro or any other
Borrower shall have become due and payable, Micro or each such other Borrower
shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by law, interest (after as well as
before judgment) on such amounts at an annual rate equal to the Reference Rate
plus 2%.

        SECTION 4.2.3 CONTINUATION ELECTIONS. The relevant Borrower may from
time to time by delivering a Continuation Notice to the Administrative Agent on
or before 1:00 p.m.,



                                      -33-
<PAGE>

Applicable Time, on a Business Day, irrevocably elect, on not less than three
nor more than five Business Days' notice, that all, or any portion in an
aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 of
the Revolving Loans, be continued for one or more new Interest Periods; provided
that:

                (a) in the absence of delivery of a Continuation Notice with
        respect to any Revolving Loan, at least three Business Days (but not
        more than five Business Days) before the last day of the then current
        Interest Period with respect thereto, that Revolving Loan shall, on such
        last day, automatically continue for a new Interest Period having a
        duration equal to the original duration of the then expiring Interest
        Period; and

                (b) no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any
        Revolving Loans may be continued with an Interest Period longer than one
        month while any Default has occurred and is continuing.

        SECTION 4.2.4 PAYMENT DATES. Interest accrued on each Revolving Loan
shall be payable, without duplication, in the Available Currency in which it is
denominated:

                (a) on the Commitment Termination Date;

                (b) on the date of any payment or prepayment, in whole or in
        part, of principal outstanding on such Revolving Loan (but only on the
        principal amount so paid or prepaid);

                (c) on the last day of each applicable Interest Period (and, if
        such Interest Period shall exceed three months, on each three month
        anniversary of the date of the commencement of such Interest Period);
        and

                (d) on that portion of any Revolving Loans which is accelerated
        pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, immediately upon such acceleration.

        on the Commitment Termination Date, upon acceleration or otherwise)
        shall be payable upon demand.

        SECTION 4.2.5 INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION. The Administrative Agent and,
if and when applicable, the Reference Lenders shall, in accordance with each of
their customary practices, attempt to determine the relevant interest rates
applicable to each Revolving Loan requested to be made pursuant to each
Borrowing Request duly completed and delivered by a Borrower, and, if and when
applicable, each Reference Lender agrees to furnish the Administrative Agent
timely information for the purpose of determining the LIBO Rate. If any
Reference Lender fails, if and when applicable, to timely furnish such
information to the Administrative Agent for any such interest rate, the
Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of the
information shared by the other Reference Lender.

        SECTION 4.2.6 ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON REVOLVING LOANS. For so long as the
cost to a Lender of making or maintaining its Revolving Loans is increased as a
result of any imposition



                                      -34-
<PAGE>

or modification after the date of this Agreement of any reserve required to be
maintained by such Lender against Eurocurrency Liabilities (or any other
category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Revolving Loans is determined or any category of extensions of
credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of
such Lender to United States residents but not duplicating any requirement
included in the calculation of Mandatory Costs), then such Lender may require
the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on
the Revolving Loans, additional interest on the related Revolving Loan of such
Lender at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the
applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage over
(ii) the applicable LIBO Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such
additional interest shall so notify Micro and the Administrative Agent (which
notice shall set forth the amount (as determined by such Lender) to which such
Lender is then entitled under this Section 4.2.6 (which amount shall be
consistent with such Lender's good faith estimate of the level at which the
related reserves are maintained by it and which determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent demonstrable error) and shall be
accompanied by such information as to the computation set forth therein as Micro
may reasonably request), in which case such additional interest on the Revolving
Loans of such Lender shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period
thereafter (commencing with the Interest Period beginning at least three
Business Days after the giving of such notice) to such Lender at the place
indicated in such notice. Each Lender that receives any payment in respect of
increased costs pursuant to this Section 4.2.6 shall promptly notify Micro of
any change with respect to such costs which affects the amount of additional
interest payable pursuant to this section in respect thereof.

        SECTION 4.3 FEES. Each Borrower agrees to pay the fees applicable to it
set forth in this Section 4.3. All such fees shall be nonrefundable and shall be
paid in Dollars to the Administrative Agent, each Lender or the relevant Issuer,
as the case may be, at its office specified for such purpose on the signature
pages hereof.

        SECTION 4.3.1 ADMINISTRATION FEES. Coordination Center and Micro,
jointly and severally, agree to pay directly to the Administrative Agent, for
its own account, an annual administration fee in the amounts and on the dates
set forth in the Fee Letter.

        SECTION 4.3.2 COMMITMENT FEES. Coordination Center and Micro, jointly
and severally, agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender (including, any portion thereof when the Lenders may not extend any
Credit Extensions by reason of the inability of the Borrowers to satisfy any
condition of Section 6.1 or 6.2) (a) for each day during the period commencing
on the Effective Date and continuing through and including the last day of the
Fiscal Period ending on the Saturday nearest June 30, 2003, a commitment fee to
each Lender on the unused portion of its Credit Commitment Amount on such day at
a rate of 0.75% per annum and (b) for each day thereafter, until but excluding
the Commitment Termination Date, a commitment fee to each Lender on the unused
portion of its Credit Commitment Amount on each day at the rate per annum
determined in accordance with the following procedure:

                (1) If the Pricing Level set forth opposite the Leverage Ratio
        is the same as the Pricing Level set forth opposite the applicable
        Credit Rating, then the commitment fee for that Pricing Level shall be
        the commitment fee.



                                      -35-
<PAGE>

                (2) If the Pricing Level set forth opposite the Leverage Ratio
        differs by one Pricing Level from the Pricing Level set forth opposite
        the applicable Credit Rating, then the commitment fee for the lower
        numbered Pricing Level of the two shall be the commitment fee.

                (3) If the Pricing Level set forth opposite the Leverage Ratio
        differs by more than one Pricing Level from the Pricing Level set forth
        opposite the applicable Credit Rating, then the commitment fee shall be
        the average of the commitment fees for such two Pricing Levels.

Such commitment fee shall be determined from time to time by the Administrative
Agent and shall be payable by Coordination Center in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date and on the Commitment Termination Date. If the Credit Ratings
assigned by S&P and Moody's fall into different Pricing Levels, then the
applicable Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the lower of the
two Credit Ratings.

The applicable Leverage Ratio shall be the Leverage Ratio for the Fiscal Period
most recently ended prior to such day for which financial statements and reports
have been received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.1.1(a) or
(b), as set forth in (and effective upon delivery by Micro to the Administrative
Agent of) the related new Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 8.1.1(d).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) for so long as an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing the applicable Pricing Level shall be Level V and (b)
if Micro shall fail to deliver a Compliance Certificate required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 8.1.1(d) within 60 days after the end of any of its fiscal
quarters (or within 90 days, in the case of the last fiscal quarter of its
Fiscal Year), the applicable Pricing Level from and including the 61st (or 91st,
as the case may be) day after the end of such fiscal quarter (or Fiscal Year, as
the case may be) to but not including the date Micro delivers to the
Administrative Agent a quarterly Compliance Certificate shall be Level V.

        SECTION 4.3.3 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                (a) The applicable Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
        Agent for the account of each Lender (including the relevant Issuer) a
        Letter of Credit participation fee equal to each Lender's Percentage of
        the average daily Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit during the
        applicable period multiplied by the Applicable Margin then in effect for
        any Revolving Loan. Such participation fee shall accrue from the date of
        issuance of any Letter of Credit until the date such Letter of Credit is
        drawn in full or terminated, and shall be payable in arrears on each
        Quarterly Payment Date and on the date that the Commitments terminate in
        their entirety.

                (b) The applicable Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
        Agent for the account of the Issuer of each Letter of Credit a Letter of
        Credit fronting fee at the rate set forth in the Fee Letter (or, in the
        case of an Issuer other than Scotia Capital, as separately agreed
        between Micro and such Issuer) during the applicable period, such fee to
        be payable for the account of the relevant Issuer in quarterly
        installments in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the date
        that the Commitments terminate in their entirety. Micro agrees to
        reimburse each Issuer, on demand, for all usual out-of-pocket costs and
        expenses incurred in connection with the issuance or maintenance of any
        Letter of Credit issued by such Issuer.

                (c) The Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender and each
        Issuer fees paid for its account under clause (a) or (b) above promptly
        after receipt by the Administrative Agent.

        SECTION 4.4 RATE AND FEE DETERMINATIONS. Interest on each Revolving Loan
shall be computed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days (or 365 or 366,
as the case may be, for Revolving Loans denominated in Sterling) and fees shall
be computed on the basis of a year consisting of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be, in each case paid for the actual number of days elapsed, calculated as
to each period from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the
last day thereof. All determinations by the Administrative Agent of the rate of
interest payable with respect to any Revolving Loan shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of demonstrable error.

                           CERTAIN PAYMENT PROVISIONS

        SECTION 5.1 ILLEGALITY; CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS.

                (a) If, as the result of any Regulatory Change, any Lender shall
        determine (which determination shall, in the absence of demonstrable
        error, be conclusive and binding on each Borrower), that it is unlawful
        for such Lender to make any Revolving Loan, issue any Letter of Credit,
        or continue any Revolving Loan previously made by it hereunder in
        respect of the LIBO Rate, as the case may be, the obligations of such
        Lender to make any such Loan, issue any such Letter of Credit, or
        continue any such Revolving Loan in respect of the LIBO Rate, as the
        case may be, shall, upon the giving of notice



                                      -37-

        thereof to the Administrative Agent, Micro, and any other applicable
        Borrower, forthwith be suspended and each applicable Borrower shall, if
        requested by such Lender and if required by such Regulatory Change, on
        such date as shall be specified in such notice, prepay to such Lender in
        full all of such Revolving Loans or convert all of such Revolving Loans
        into a Cost of Funds Rate Loan that is not unlawful, in each case on the
        last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless otherwise
        required by applicable law) and without any penalty whatsoever (but
        subject to Section 5.4); provided that such Lender shall make as Cost of
        Funds Loans all Revolving Loans that such Lender would otherwise be
        obligated to make Revolving Loans at the LIBO Rate and convert into or
        continue as Cost of Funds Loans all Revolving Loans that such Lender
        would otherwise be required to convert into or continue as Revolving
        Loans at the LIBO Rate, in each case during the period any such
        suspension is effective. Such suspension shall continue to be effective
        until such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and Micro that
        the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, at which time
        the obligations of such Lender to make any such Loan, issue any Letter
        of Credit, or continue any Revolving Loan, as the case may be, shall be
        reinstated.

                (b) If any central bank or other governmental authorization in
        the country of the proposed Available Currency of any proposed Revolving
        Loan is required to permit the use of such Available Currency by a
        Lender (through its Lending Office) for such Revolving Loan and such
        authorization has not been obtained (provided that such Lender has used
        reasonable endeavors to obtain such authorization) or is not in full
        force and effect, the obligation of such Lender to provide such
        Revolving Loans shall be suspended so long as such authorization is
        required and has not been obtained by such Lender.

        SECTION 5.2 DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE.

                (a) If, before the date on which all or any portion of any
        Revolving Loan bearing interest in respect of the LIBO Rate is to be
        made, maintained, or continued the Administrative Agent shall have
        determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding), with
        respect to that Revolving Loan that:

                        (i) deposits in the relevant amount and the relevant
                Available Currency and for the relevant Interest Period are
                available, if and when applicable, to none of the Reference
                Lenders in the relevant market, or

                        (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting the London
                interbank market adequate means do not exist for ascertaining
                the interest rate applicable under this Agreement in respect of
                the relevant LIBO Rate,

        then, upon notice from the Administrative Agent to Micro and the
        Lenders, the obligations of the Lenders to make or continue any
        Revolving Loan bearing interest in respect of the LIBO Rate in such
        Available Currency under Sections 3.1 and 4.2.3 shall forthwith be
        suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify Micro and the
        Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.



                                      -38-
<PAGE>

                (b) If a notification under this Section 5.2 applies to a
        Revolving Loan which is outstanding and that is not going to be
        converted at the end of its Interest Period to another Available
        Currency for which the LIBO Rate is available, then, notwithstanding any
        other provision of this Agreement:

                        (i) within five Business Days of receipt of the
                notification, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall
                enter into negotiations for a period of not more than 30 days
                with a view to agreeing an alternative basis for determining the
                rate of interest and/or funding applicable to that Revolving
                Loan at the end of its applicable Interest Period;

                        (ii) any alternative basis agreed under clause (i) above
                shall be, with the prior consent of all the Lenders, binding on
                all of the Obligors and Lender Parties;

                        (iii) if no alternative basis is agreed, each Lender
                shall (through the Administrative Agent) certify on or before
                the last day of the Interest Period to which the notification
                relates an alternative basis for maintaining its participation
                in that Revolving Loan;

                        (iv) any such alternative basis may include an
                alternative method of fixing the interest rate, alternative
                Interest Periods or alternative currencies but it must reflect
                the cost to the Lender of funding its participation in the
                Revolving Loan from whatever sources it may select plus the
                Applicable Margin; and

                        (v) each alternative basis so certified shall be binding
                on the Obligors and the certifying Lender and treated as part of
                this Agreement.

        SECTION 5.3 INCREASED CREDIT EXTENSION COSTS, ETC. Each Borrower agrees
to reimburse each Lender within 30 days after any demand for any increase in the
cost to such Lender of, or any reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by
such Lender in respect of, making, maintaining, participating, issuing or
extending (or of its obligation to make, maintain, participate, issue or extend)
any Credit Extension to the extent such increased cost or reduced amount is due
to a Regulatory Change. Such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent
and the relevant Borrower a certificate stating, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such increased cost or reduced amount and the additional amount
required fully to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced
amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable by the relevant Borrower
directly to such Lender upon its receipt of such notice, and such notice shall
be rebuttable, presumptive evidence of the additional amounts so owing. In
determining such amount, such Lender shall act reasonably and in good faith and
may use any method of averaging and attribution that it customarily uses for its
other borrowers with a similar credit rating as Micro. Such Lender may demand
reimbursement for such increased cost or reduced amount only for the 360-day
period immediately preceding the date of such written notice, and such Borrower
shall have liability only for such period.

        SECTION 5.4 FUNDING LOSSES. If any Lender shall incur any loss or
expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits



                                      -39-
<PAGE>

or other funds acquired by such Lender to make, continue, or extend any portion
of the principal amount of any Revolving Loan) as a result of:

                (a) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of any
        Revolving Loan on a date other than the scheduled last day of the
        Interest Period whether pursuant to Section 4.1.1 or otherwise;

                (b) any conversion of the currency of any Revolving Loan on a
        date other than the scheduled last day of the Interest Period; or

                (c) any Revolving Loan not being made, continued, or converted
        in accordance with the Credit Extension Request therefor in the case of
        any Credit Extension Request as a consequence of any action taken, or
        failed to be taken, by any Obligor,

then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), such Borrower shall, within five days of its
receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as will (in the
reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse such Lender for such loss or
expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in reasonable
detail) shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount of any such loss
or expense that has been so incurred.

        SECTION 5.5 INCREASED CAPITAL COSTS. If any Regulatory Change affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any
Lender or any Person controlling such Lender, and such Lender determines (in its
sole and absolute discretion) that the rate of return on its or such controlling
Person's capital as a consequence of its participation in this Agreement or the
making, continuing, participating in or extending of any Credit Extension is
reduced to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could
have achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such
case, upon the relevant Borrower's receipt of written notice thereof from such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), such Borrower shall pay
directly to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender
or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return. A statement of
such Lender as to any such additional amounts (including calculations thereof in
reasonable detail) shall be rebuttable, presumptive evidence of the additional
amounts so owing. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any method of
averaging and attribution that it shall deem applicable. Such Lender may demand
payment for such additional amounts that have accrued only during the 360-day
period immediately preceding the date of such written notice and such Borrower
shall have liability only for such period.

        SECTION 5.6 DISCRETION OF LENDERS AS TO MANNER OF FUNDING.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Lenders
shall be entitled to fund and maintain their funding of all or any part of their
Revolving Loans and other Credit Extensions in any manner they elect, it being
understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations
hereunder with respect to a Revolving Loan shall be made as if each Lender had
actually funded and maintained each Revolving Loan through its Lending Office
and through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to the
maturity of such Revolving Loan. Any Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill any
commitment or obligation to make or maintain



                                      -40-
<PAGE>

Revolving Loans or other Credit Extensions by causing a branch or affiliate to
make or maintain such Revolving Loans or other Credit Extensions; provided that,
in such event, such Revolving Loans or other Credit Extensions shall be deemed
for the purposes of this Agreement to have been made by such Lender through its
applicable Lending Office, and the obligation of a Borrower to repay such
Revolving Loans shall nevertheless be to such Lender at its Lending Office and
shall be deemed held by such Lender through its applicable Lending Office, to
the extent of such Revolving Loan, for the account of such branch or affiliate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the fact that different Affiliates for a Lender
under this Agreement may have executed this Agreement or the Lender Assignment
Agreement by which it has become a Lender under this Agreement, all of those
Lending Offices and signatories shall be treated under the Loan Documents as but
one Lender for purposes of calculations of Percentage, Commitment, Required
Lenders, and modifications, amendments, waivers, consents, and approvals under
Section 11.1 and other provisions of the Loan Documents.

        SECTION 5.7 TAXES.

                (a) All payments by any Obligor of principal of, and interest
        and fees on, any Credit Extension and all other amounts payable
        hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear
        of and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp
        or franchise taxes, and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings, or
        other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority
        with respect to such payments, but excluding franchise taxes and taxes
        imposed on or measured by any Lender Party's gross or net income,
        profits, or receipts, in each case imposed (i) by any taxing authority
        under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or in which it
        maintains its applicable Lending Office or (ii) by reason of a present
        or former connection between the jurisdiction imposing such tax and such
        Lender Party or one of its applicable lending offices other than a
        connection arising solely from such Lender Party having executed,
        delivered or performed its obligations under, or received payment under
        or enforced, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (such
        non-excluded items being called "Taxes") except to the extent required
        by law. In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment
        to be made by any Obligor hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes
        pursuant to any applicable law, rule, or regulation, then such Obligor
        will:

                        (i) pay directly to the relevant authority the full
                amount required to be so withheld or deducted;

                        (ii) promptly forward to the relevant Lender Party an
                official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to such
                Lender Party evidencing such payment to such authority; and

                        (iii) pay directly to the relevant Lender Party for its
                own account such additional amount or amounts as is or are
                necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by
                such Lender Party will equal the full amount such Lender Party
                would have received had no such withholding or deduction been
                required.



                                      -41-
<PAGE>

                (b) Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against any
        Lender Party with respect to any payment received by such Lender Party
        hereunder, such Lender Party may pay such Taxes and the relevant Obligor
        will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties,
        interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount
        received by such Lender Party after the payment of such Taxes (including
        any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such Lender
        Party would have received had not such Taxes been asserted.

                (c) If the relevant Obligor fails to pay any Taxes when due to
        the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the relevant
        Lender Parties entitled thereto the required receipt or other required
        documentary evidence, such Obligor shall indemnify such Lender Parties
        for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable
        by any Lender Party as a result of any such failure.

                (d) The following provisions govern exceptions to the tax
        indemnification provisions of this Section 5.7 and related matters.

                        (i) In respect of its Credit Extensions to Micro, (A)
                each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
                outside the United States -- on or before the date of its
                execution and delivery of this Agreement (if an original
                signatory to this Agreement) or the date on which it otherwise
                becomes a Lender Party, on or before the date of any change in
                its Lending Office, and from time to time thereafter if
                requested in writing by Micro (but only so long as and to the
                extent that Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so) --
                shall provide Micro and the Administrative Agent with either (I)
                two duly completed copies of either (1) Internal Revenue Service
                Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility of such Lender Party for the
                benefit of an exemption from United States withholding tax under
                an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party or
                (2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or in either case an
                applicable successor form, or (II) in the case of a Lender Party
                who is not legally entitled to deliver either form listed in
                clause (i)(A), (1) a certificate to the effect that such Lender
                Party is not (x) a "bank" within the meaning of Section
                881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a "10 percent shareholder" of the
                Obligor within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code
                or (z) a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from
                a related person within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
                the Code (such certificate an "Exemption Certificate") and (2)
                two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
                W-8BEN or applicable successor form and (B) each Lender Party
                who is a Non-Exempt U.S. Person, on or before the date of its
                execution and delivery of this Agreement (if an original
                signatory to this Agreement) or the date on which it becomes a
                Lender Party, on or before the date of any change in its Lending
                Office, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing
                by Micro (but only so long as that Lender Party remains lawfully
                able to do so), shall provide Micro and the Administrative Agent
                with two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
                W-9.

                        (ii) A Lender Party is not entitled to indemnification
                under this Section 5.7 with respect to the applicable Taxes for
                any period during which the Lender



                                      -42-
<PAGE>

                Party has failed to provide Micro and the Administrative Agent
                with the applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service form if
                required under clause (i) above (unless that failure is due to a
                change in treaty, law, or regulation occurring after the date on
                which the applicable form originally was required to be provided
                or a redesignation of the Lender Party's Lending Office at the
                request of the relevant Obligor) in respect of U.S. withholding
                taxes.

                        (iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii) above to the contrary,
                if a Lender Party that is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
                reduced rate of withholding tax becomes subject to United States
                withholding tax because of its failure to deliver an Internal
                Revenue Service form required hereunder, then Micro shall take
                such steps as that Lender Party shall reasonably request to
                assist that Lender Party to recover the applicable withholding
                tax.

                (e) If any Obligor pays any additional amount under this Section
        5.7 (a "Tax Payment") and any Lender Party or Affiliate thereof
        effectively obtains a refund of Tax by reason of the Tax Payment (a "Tax
        Refund") and such Tax Refund is, in the reasonable judgment of such
        Lender Party or Affiliate, attributable to the Tax Payment, then such
        Lender Party, after receipt of such Tax Refund, shall promptly reimburse
        such Obligor for such amount as such Lender Party shall reasonably
        determine to be the proportion of the Tax Refund as will leave such
        Lender Party (after that reimbursement) in no better or worse position
        than it would have been in if the Tax Payment had not been required;
        provided that no Lender Party shall be required to make any such
        reimbursement if it reasonably believes the making of such reimbursement
        would cause it to lose the benefit of the Tax Refund or would adversely
        affect in any other respect its tax position. Subject to the other terms
        hereof, any claim by a Lender Party for a Tax Refund shall be made in a
        manner, order and amount as such Lender Party determines in its sole and
        absolute discretion. No Lender Party shall be obligated to disclose
        information regarding its tax affairs or computations to any Obligor, it
        being understood and agreed that in no event shall any Lender Party be
        required to disclose information regarding its tax position that it
        deems to be confidential (other than with respect to the Tax Refund).

        SECTION 5.8 PAYMENTS. All payments by an Obligor pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether in respect of principal, interest,
fees or otherwise, shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8.

        SECTION 5.8.1 CREDIT EXTENSIONS.

                (a) All payments by an Obligor (whether in respect of principal,
        interest, fees or otherwise) pursuant to this Agreement or any other
        Loan Document with respect to Credit Extensions or any other amount
        payable hereunder shall be made by the relevant Borrower in the
        Available Currency in which the Obligation was denominated (the
        "Required Currency"). All such payments (other than fees payable
        pursuant to Section 4.3, which fees shall be paid by Micro or
        Coordination Center or the relevant Borrower to the Administrative Agent
        for the account of the relevant payee, Article V, Section 11.3 or 11.4)
        shall be made by the relevant Borrower to the Administrative Agent for
        the account of each Lender based upon its Percentage. All such payments
        required to



                                      -43-
<PAGE>

        be made to the Administrative Agent shall be made, without set-off,
        deduction or counterclaim, not later than 1:00 p.m., Applicable Time, on
        the date when due, in same day or immediately available funds, to such
        account as the Administrative Agent shall specify from time to time by
        notice to the relevant Borrower. Funds received after that time shall be
        deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next
        succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit
        in same day funds to each Lender its share, if any, of such payments
        received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender.
        Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other
        than a Business Day, such payment shall, except as otherwise required
        pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of Interest Period, be made on
        the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
        such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees,
        as the case may be.

                (b) In the case of any payment made pursuant to the preceding
        clause (a) by a Borrower to the Administrative Agent, unless the
        Administrative Agent will have received notice from that Borrower prior
        to the date on which any such payment is due hereunder that such
        Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent
        may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the
        Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
        reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
        such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If
        that Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
        Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative
        Agent forthwith on demand any such amount distributed to the Lender to
        the extent that such amount was not paid by that Borrower to the
        Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from
        the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such
        Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at an annual rate
        equal to the Administrative Agent's Cost of Funds.

        SECTION 5.9 SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

                (a) If any Lender Party shall obtain any payment or other
        recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or
        otherwise) on account of any Credit Extension or Reimbursement
        Obligation (other than pursuant to the terms of Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
        or 5.7) in excess of its pro rata share of payments obtained by all
        Lender Parties, such Lender Party shall purchase from the other Lender
        Parties such participations in Credit Extensions made by them as shall
        be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess
        payment or other recovery ratably (to the extent such other Lender
        Parties were entitled to receive a portion of such payment or recovery)
        with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the
        excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such
        purchasing Lender Party, the purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender
        Party which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender Party
        shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the
        ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such
        selling Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a)
        the amount of such selling Lender Party's required repayment to the
        purchasing Lender Party to (b) total amount so recovered from the
        purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable
        by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
        recovered.

                (b) The Borrowers agree that any Lender Party purchasing a
        participation from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 5.9
        may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
        payment (including pursuant to Section 5.10) with respect to such
        participation as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor
        of the relevant Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under
        any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law any Lender
        Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section
        5.9 applies, such Lender Party shall, to the extent practicable,
        exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
        consistent with the rights of the Lender Parties entitled under this
        Section 5.9 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured
        claim.

        SECTION 5.10 RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender Party is hereby authorized at
any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all balances, credits, accounts, moneys or deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any payment received pursuant to this Agreement by the
Administrative Agent in its capacity qua Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time due and owing by
such Lender Party (in any currency and at any branch or office) to or for the
credit or the account of any Obligor against any and all of the Obligations of
such Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document that are at such time due and owing, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other
Loan Document (other than any notice expressly required hereby). The rights of
each Lender Party under this Section 5.10 are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such Lender Party may have.

        SECTION 5.11 JUDGMENTS, CURRENCIES, ETC. The obligation of each Obligor
to make payment of all Obligations in the Required Currency shall not be
discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment,
which is expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Required
Currency, except to the extent such tender or recovery shall result in the
actual receipt by the recipient at the office required hereunder of the full
amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Obligor authorizes the Administrative Agent on any tender or recovery in a
currency other than the Required Currency to purchase in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Required Currency with the amount of such other currency
so tendered or recovered. The obligation of each Obligor to make payments in the
Required Currency shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of
action for the purpose of recovery in the Required Currency of the amount (if
any) by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the
Required Currency expressed to be payable under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other
sums due under this Agreement or such other Loan Document.

        SECTION 5.12 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Each Lender hereby severally agrees
that if such Lender (a "Subject Lender") makes demand upon any Borrower for (or
if any Borrower is otherwise required to pay) amounts pursuant to Section 4.2.6,
5.3, 5.5, or 5.7, or if the obligation of such Lender to make Loans is suspended
pursuant to Section 5.1(a), such Borrower may, so



                                      -45-
<PAGE>

long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, replace such
Subject Lender with an Eligible Assignee pursuant to an assignment in accordance
with Section 11.11.1; provided that (i) such Eligible Assignee shall be subject
to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Issuer as required by the
definition of "Eligible Assignee", and (ii) the purchase price paid by such
designated financial institution shall be in the amount of such Subject Lender's
Loans and its applicable Percentage of outstanding Reimbursement Obligations,
together with all accrued and unpaid interest and fees in respect thereof, plus
all other amounts (including the amounts demanded and unreimbursed under
Sections 4.2.6, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.7), owing to such Subject Lender hereunder. Upon
the effective date of such assignment, such designated financial institution
shall become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

        SECTION 5.13 CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. If Micro or any other Obligor is
required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender Party
pursuant to Section 4.2.6, 5.3, 5.5, or 5.7, or if the obligation of any Lender
to make or continue Loans is suspended pursuant to Section 5.1(a), then such
Lender Party will change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if, in the
judgment of such Lender Party, such change (a) will eliminate or reduce any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue or will avoid such suspension and
(b) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

        SECTION 5.14 EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION. If and to the extent that any
provision of this Section 5.14 relates to any state (or the currency of such
state) that is not a Participating Member State on the Effective Date, such
provision shall become effective in relation to such state (and the currency of
such state) at and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating
Member State.

                (a) An amount denominated in the National Currency Unit of a
        Participating Member State shall be redenominated into Euro in
        accordance with EMU Legislation and paid by the debtor either in the
        Euro Unit or in that National Currency Unit and an amount denominated in
        the Euro Unit shall be paid by the debtor in the Euro Unit unless EMU
        Legislation provides otherwise; provided, that if and to the extent that
        any EMU Legislation provides that an amount denominated either in the
        Euro or in the National Currency Unit of a Participating Member State
        and payable within the Participating Member State by crediting an
        account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in the Euro
        Unit or in that National Currency Unit, any party to this Agreement
        shall be entitled to pay or repay any such amount either in the Euro
        Unit or in such National Currency Unit.

                (b) If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in
        this Agreement with respect to the currency of any state that is or
        becomes a Participating Member State shall be inconsistent with any
        convention or practice in the London, England interbank market for the
        basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such
        convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as
        of and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member
        State.

                (c) Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of each
        Borrower to the Lenders, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent under
        or pursuant to this Agreement,



                                      -46-
<PAGE>

        except as expressly provided in this clause (c), each provision of this
        Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as
        the Administrative Agent in consultation with Micro may from time to
        time specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction
        of or changeover to the Euro in Participating Member States.

and after giving effect to such Credit Extension other than any continuation or
conversion (except as otherwise set forth in the initial proviso to this
section) of a Borrowing (but, if any Default of the nature referred to in

without giving effect to the application, directly or indirectly, of the
proceeds of such Credit Extension to such other Indebtedness), the following
statements shall be true and correct:

                (a) the representations and warranties of each Obligor set forth
        in Article VII (excluding, however, those contained in Section 7.8) and
        in any other Loan Document shall be true and correct with the same
        effect as if then made (unless stated to relate solely to an earlier
        date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
        and correct as of such earlier date); provided that if any of the
        financial statements delivered pursuant to clause (b) of Section 8.1.1
        do not present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the
        Persons covered thereby as of the dates thereof and the results of their
        operations for the periods then ended and Micro subsequently delivers
        one or more financial statements pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of
        Section 8.1.1 which, in the opinion of the Required Lenders, effectively
        cures any omission or misstatement contained in such prior delivered
        financial statement, then the representation and warranty contained in
        Section 7.6 as it relates to such prior delivered financial statement
        shall be deemed satisfied for purposes hereof (it being understood and
        agreed that such subsequent delivered financial statements shall be
        deemed to have cured such earlier delivered inaccurate financial
        statements unless the Required Lenders raise an objection with respect
        thereto);

                (b) except as disclosed in Item 7.8 (Litigation) of the
        Disclosure Schedule:

                        (i) no labor controversy, litigation, arbitration or
                governmental investigation or proceeding shall be pending or, to
                the knowledge of any Obligor, threatened against any Obligor, or
                any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of
                which there exists a reasonable possibility of an outcome that
                would result in a Material Adverse Effect or that would affect
                the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
                any other Loan Document; and

                        (ii) no development shall have occurred in any labor
                controversy, litigation, arbitration or governmental
                investigation or proceeding so disclosed in



                                      -49-
<PAGE>

                respect of which there exists a reasonable possibility of an
                outcome that would result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                (c) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no
        Obligor, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be in violation
        of any law or governmental regulation or court order or decree which,
        singly or in the aggregate, results in, or would reasonably be expected
        to result in, a Material Adverse Effect; and

                (d) the Outstanding Credit Extensions of all the Lenders do not
        exceed the Total Credit Commitment Amount (as such amount may be reduced
        from time to time pursuant to Section 2.2);

provided that in the case of any continuation or conversion of a Borrowing, no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

        SECTION 6.2.2 CREDIT EXTENSION REQUEST. In the case of any Credit
Extension the Administrative Agent shall have received the relevant Credit
Extension Request in a timely manner as herein provided for such Credit
Extension. Delivery of a Credit Extension Request and the acceptance by Micro or
any other Borrower of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall constitute a
representation and warranty by each Obligor that, on the date of making such
Credit Extension (both immediately before and after giving effect to the making
of such Credit Extension and the application of the proceeds thereof), the
statements made in Section 6.2.1 are true and correct.

        SECTION 6.3 ACCEDING BORROWERS. Subject to the prior or concurrent
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in this Section 6.3, any
Subsidiary of Micro may become a party hereto and a Borrower and an Obligor
hereunder subsequent to the Effective Date (each such Subsidiary of Micro, an
"Acceding Borrower"), entitled to all the rights and subject to all the
obligations incident thereto.

        SECTION 6.3.1 RESOLUTIONS, ETC. The Administrative Agent shall have
received from such Acceding Borrower a certificate, dated the date such Acceding
Borrower is accepted by the Administrative Agent as a Borrower hereunder and
with counterparts for each Lender, duly executed and delivered by the Secretary,
Assistant Secretary or other authorized representative of such Acceding Borrower
as to:

                (a) resolutions of its Board of Directors or its Executive
        Committee, as the case may be, then in full force and effect authorizing
        the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
        Additional Guaranty (if any) and each other Loan Document to be executed
        by it and, in respect of an Aceeding Borrower incorporated under the
        laws of Belgium, a resolution of its General Shareholders Meeting
        specifically approving, for the purposes of article 556 of the Belgian
        Company Code, Section 8.1.12, Sections 9.1.4 and 9.3 (to the extent they
        apply to Section 8.1.12) and, insofar as required, Section 9.1.8 and
        (ii) evidence of the filing of such resolution with the clerk office at
        the commercial court where its registered office is located;

<PAGE>

                (b) the incumbency and signatures of those of its officers
        authorized to act with respect to this Agreement and the Additional
        Guaranty (if any) and each other Loan Document to be executed by it; and

                (c) the Organic Documents of such Acceding Borrower,

upon which certificate each Lender may conclusively rely until the
Administrative Agent shall have received a further certificate of the Secretary
of such Acceding Borrower canceling or amending such prior certificate. In
addition, each Acceding Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative
Agent a good standing certificate from the relevant governmental regulatory
institution of its jurisdiction of organization, each such certificate to be
dated a date reasonably near (but prior to) the date such Acceding Borrower
becomes a Borrower hereunder.

        SECTION 6.3.2 DELIVERY OF ACCESSION REQUEST AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT. The
Administrative Agent shall have received (a) an original Accession Request and
Acknowledgment duly completed and executed and delivered by such Acceding
Borrower and (b) originals of any other instruments evidencing accession of such
Acceding Borrower hereunder as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request,
in each case effective as of the date such Acceding Borrower becomes a Borrower
hereunder.

        SECTION 6.3.3 GUARANTIES, ETC. If such Acceding Borrower has not
previously delivered an Additional Guaranty pursuant to Section 8.1.10(a), and
such Acceding Borrower is a Material Subsidiary, then the Administrative Agent
shall have received, with counterparts for each Lender (a) an Additional
Guaranty executed by such Acceding Borrower, in effect as of the date such
Acceding Borrower becomes a Borrower hereunder, duly executed and delivered by
an Authorized Person of such Acceding Borrower; provided that if such Acceding
Borrower is a Foreign Subsidiary, such Acceding Borrower shall not be required
to deliver such Additional Guaranty if and to the extent Micro, in consultation
with the Administrative Agent, reasonably determines that adverse tax
consequences would result therefrom, and (b) such documents as are required by
Section 8.1.11, in each case effective with respect to such Acceding Borrower as
of the date such Acceding Borrower becomes a Borrower hereunder.

        SECTION 6.3.4 COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE. The Administrative Agent shall
have received with counterparts for each Lender, a Compliance Certificate from
Micro, dated the date such Acceding Borrower becomes a Borrower hereunder.

        SECTION 6.3.5 CONSENTS, ETC. The Administrative Agent shall have
received evidence satisfactory to it as to the receipt by such Acceding Borrower
of any necessary consents or waivers under any agreement applicable to such
Acceding Borrower in order to enable such Acceding Borrower to enter into this
Agreement and any other Loan Document, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to obtain Credit Extensions hereunder.

        SECTION 6.3.6 OPINIONS OF COUNSEL. The Administrative Agent shall have
received an opinion of counsel, dated the date such Acceding Borrower becomes a
Borrower hereunder and addressed to the Agents and all the Lenders, from the
Senior Corporate Counsel of Micro, or such other counsel as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, covering the matters set forth in
Exhibit K attached hereto as to such Acceding Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        In order to induce the Lender Parties to enter into this Agreement and
to make Credit Extensions hereunder, each Borrower represents and warrants unto
the Administrative Agent and each Lender with respect to itself and the other
Obligors as set forth in this Article VII.

        SECTION 7.1 ORGANIZATION, ETC. Each of the Obligors and each of the
respective Subsidiaries is a company or corporation, as the case may be, validly
organized and existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization, is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business requires such qualification and where the failure to so qualify and
to maintain such good standing, singularly or in the aggregate, has resulted in,
or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect, and has
full power and authority and holds all requisite governmental licenses, permits,
authorizations and other approvals to enter into and perform its Obligations
under this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party and to
own and hold under lease its property and to conduct its business substantially
as currently conducted by it, excluding any such governmental licenses, permits
or other approvals in respect of which the failure to so obtain, hold or
maintain has not caused, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect.

        SECTION 7.2 DUE AUTHORIZATION, NON-CONTRAVENTION, ETC. The execution,
delivery and performance by each Obligor of this Agreement and each other Loan
Document executed or to be executed by it are within such Obligor's corporate
powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not:

                (a) contravene such Obligor's Organic Documents;

                (b) contravene any law or governmental regulation or court
        decree or order binding or affecting such Obligor; or

                (c) result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any

        proceeding which it, in its sole discretion, deems advisable or
        necessary); and

                (c) provide such information and certifications which the
        Administrative Agent may reasonably request from time to time to
        evidence compliance with this Section 8.1.6.

        SECTION 8.1.7 USE OF PROCEEDS. Each Borrower shall apply the proceeds of
each Credit Extension in accordance with the last recital of this Agreement and
shall not use directly any such proceeds to repay the 9.875% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2008 issued by Micro or any other issuance of Indebtedness issued by
Micro or any of its Subsidiaries which, by its terms, is subordinate in right of
payment to the Obligations.

        SECTION 8.1.8 PARI PASSU. Each Borrower shall ensure that such
Borrower's Obligations rank at least pari passu with all other senior unsecured
Indebtedness of such Borrower.

        SECTION 8.1.9 GUARANTEE OR SURETYSHIP. If any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries becomes a party to any contract of guarantee or suretyship which
would constitute Indebtedness, or if any of its assets becomes subject to such a
contract, that contract will be disclosed in the next financial information to
be provided by Micro pursuant to clause (c) of Section 8.1.1; provided that any
failure to comply with the disclosure obligations of this Section 8.1.9 shall
not constitute a Default unless the existence of the contract or contracts of
guarantee or suretyship which Micro fails to disclose would result in a Default
under clause (b) of Section 8.2.3.

        SECTION 8.1.10 ADDITIONAL GUARANTY.

                (a) Micro may cause any of its Subsidiaries to execute and

        Guaranty for the repayment of the Obligations.

                (b) Concurrently when or promptly after any of its Subsidiaries
        (other than any Foreign Subsidiary if and to the extent Micro, in
        consultation with the Administrative Agent, reasonably determines that
        adverse tax consequences would result therefrom)

        either guarantees any Indebtedness of Micro or any other Obligor or
        satisfies (at any time) the requirements hereunder which describe a
        Material Subsidiary, Micro shall cause that Subsidiary (other than
        Coordination Center) to (i) execute and deliver in favor of the Lender
        Parties an Additional Guaranty for the repayment of the Obligations
        which Additional Guaranty (including, without limitation, any Additional
        Guaranty executed and delivered by an Acceding Borrower pursuant to
        Section 6.3.3) shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit I attached
        hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and
        shall contain such other terms and provisions as the Administrative
        Agent determines to be necessary or appropriate (after consulting with
        legal counsel) in order that such Additional Guaranty complies with
        local laws, rules, and regulations and is fully enforceable (at least to
        the extent of the form of Additional Guaranty attached as Exhibit I)
        against such Additional Guarantor.

        SECTION 8.1.11 INTRA-GROUP AGREEMENT, ETC. In the event any Subsidiary
of Micro enters into an Additional Guaranty pursuant to Section 6.3.3 or 8.1.10,
an Authorized Person of such Subsidiary shall (a) in the event such Subsidiary
is the first Subsidiary of Micro to enter into an Additional Guaranty, together
with an Authorized Person of Micro, execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent (with counterparts for each Lender) the Intra-Group Agreement or (b) in
the event the Intra-Group Agreement has previously been so executed and
delivered and is then in effect, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
(with counterparts for each Lender) such instruments and documents evidencing
accession of such Subsidiary under the Intra-Group Agreement then in effect as
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Except to add additional
Subsidiaries of Micro as parties thereto, the terms of the Intra-Group Agreement
shall not be amended or otherwise modified without the prior consent of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of and as directed by the Required Lenders, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In addition, no Person a party to the
Intra-Group Agreement shall assign any of its rights or obligations thereunder
without the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

        SECTION 8.1.12 OWNERSHIP OF BORROWERS. Micro shall at all times,
directly or indirectly, hold 100% of the equity (or similar) interests of each
Borrower (other than itself).

        SECTION 8.2 NEGATIVE COVENANTS. Each Borrower agrees with the Agents and

have been paid and performed in full, each Borrower will perform its respective
obligations set forth in this Section 8.2.

        SECTION 8.2.1 RESTRICTION ON INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

                (a) No Borrower will (and no Borrower will permit any of its

<PAGE>

                any renewal or replacement thereof, so long as such renewals or
                replacements do not increase the amount of such Indebtedness or
                such commitments or lines of credit), in any case identified in
                Item 8.2.1(a)(ii) (Ongoing Indebtedness) of the Disclosure

                        (iii) additional Indebtedness if after giving effect to
                the incurrence thereof the Borrowers are in compliance with
                Section 8.2.3, calculated as of the date of the incurrence of
                such additional Indebtedness, on a pro forma basis;

        provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Coordination Center shall
        not, at any time, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist or otherwise

        payment to its Obligations hereunder.

                                      -64-
<PAGE>

        such redemption, purchase or acquisition shall be excluded in
        determining Micro's ability to make Restricted Payments pursuant to
        clause (i) above), so long as, in respect of any Restricted Payment
        pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, no Default shall have occurred and
        be continuing or would occur after giving effect thereto, as of the date
        the Restricted Payment is declared, in the case of a dividend, or is
        made, in any other case, it being understood that any dividend declared
        in compliance with this Section 8.2.4(b) may be paid without

        liquidation, dissolution, merger, or consolidation or the transferee of
        such assets, and (ii) Micro is the surviving entity if involved in such
        a merger or consolidation.

                (b) Coordination Center may merge or consolidate with another
        Person if either (i) Coordination Center is the surviving entity or (ii)
        the surviving Person (A) is organized and in good standing under the
        laws of The Kingdom of Belgium and (B) expressly assumes Coordination
        Center's Obligations in a written agreement satisfactory in form and
        substance to the Required Lenders.

                (c) Micro may merge or consolidate with another Person if:

                        (i) either Micro is the surviving entity or the

                consolidation that does not constitute a Material Asset
                Acquisition, Micro delivers to the Administrative Agent, before
                the merger or consolidation becomes effective, a certificate of
                Micro's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or
                Treasurer stating and demonstrating in reasonable detail that
                (assuming such proposed transaction had been consummated on the
                first day of the most recently ended period of four Fiscal
                Periods for which financial statements have been or are required
                to have been delivered pursuant to Section 8.1.1) Micro (or the
                other surviving Person) would have been, on a pro forma basis,
                in compliance with each of the covenants set forth in Section
                8.2.3 as of the last day of such period.

        SECTION 8.2.6 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. Except in the ordinary
course of business, no Borrower will (and no Borrower will permit any of its
Subsidiaries to), directly or indirectly, pay any funds to or for the account
of, make any investment (whether by acquisition of stock or Indebtedness, by
loan, advance, transfer of property, guarantee or other agreement to pay,
purchase or service, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness, or otherwise) in,
lease, sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any assets, tangible or
intangible, to, or participate in, or effect, any transaction with, any
Affiliate (any such payment, investment, lease, sale, transfer, other
disposition or transaction, an "Affiliate Transaction") except on an arms-length
basis on terms at least as favorable to such Borrower (or such Subsidiary) as
terms that could have been obtained from a third party who was not an Affiliate;
provided that:

                (a) the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2.6 do not
        prohibit (i) agreements with or for the benefit of employees of such
        Borrower or any Subsidiaries regarding bridge home loans and other loans
        necessitated by the relocation of such Borrower's or such Subsidiary's
        business or employees, or regarding short-term hardship advances, (ii)
        loans to officers or employees of such Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries in connection with the exercise of rights under such
        Borrower's stock option or stock purchase plan, (iii) any such Person
        from declaring or paying any lawful dividend or other payment ratably in
        respect of all of its capital stock of the relevant class so long as, in
        the case of Micro, after giving effect thereto, no Default shall have
        occurred and be continuing, (iv) any Affiliate Transaction between Micro
        and any of its Subsidiaries or between any Subsidiaries of Micro, or (v)
        any Affiliate Transaction (other than any Affiliate Transaction
        described in clauses (i) through (iv) above) in which the amount
        involved does not exceed $50,000; and

                (b) the Borrowers shall not, nor shall they permit any of their
        respective Subsidiaries to, participate in effect any Affiliate
        Transactions otherwise permitted pursuant to this Section 8.2.6 which
        either individually or in the aggregate may involve obligations that are
        reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The approval by the
        independent directors of the Board of Directors of the relevant Borrower
        (or the relevant Subsidiary thereof) of any Affiliate Transaction to
        which such Borrower (or the relevant Subsidiary thereof) is a party
        shall create a rebuttable presumption that such Affiliate Transaction is
        on an arms-length basis on terms at least as favorable to such Borrower
        (or the relevant Subsidiary thereof) as terms that could have been
        obtained from a third party who was not an Affiliate.

        SECTION 8.2.7 LIMITATIONS ON ACQUISITIONS.

                (a) No Borrower may make any Material Asset Acquisition unless
        no Event of Default exists or would exist after giving effect to the
        proposed Material Asset Acquisition.

                (b) Without first providing the notice to the Administrative
        Agent and the Lenders required by this Section 8.2.7(b), the Borrowers
        shall not (and shall not permit their respective Subsidiaries to)
        acquire any outstanding stock of any U.S. or non-U.S. corporation,
        limited company or similar entity of which the shares constitute Margin
        Stock if after giving effect to such acquisition, Micro and its
        Affiliates shall hold, in the



                                      -66-
<PAGE>

        aggregate, more than 5% of the total outstanding stock of the issuer of
        such Margin Stock, which notice shall include the name and jurisdiction
        of organization of such relevant issuer, the market on which such stock
        is traded, the total percentage of such relevant issuer's stock
        currently held, and the purpose for which the acquisition is being made.

                (c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Section
        8.2.7, the Borrowers shall not (and shall not permit their respective
        Subsidiaries to) (i) directly or indirectly use the proceeds of any
        Credit Extension to make any Acquisition unless, if the board of
        directors of the Person to be acquired has notified Micro or any of its
        Subsidiaries that it opposes the offer by the proposed purchaser to
        acquire that Person, then that opposition has been withdrawn, or (ii)
        make any Acquisition unless, if the proposed Acquisition is structured
        as a merger or consolidation, it will be consummated in compliance with
        Section 8.2.5.

                (d) Execution and delivery of each Continuation Notice shall
        constitute the relevant Borrower's representation and warranty that the
        Borrowers are not then in violation of Section 8.2.7(c)(i).

        SECTION 8.2.8 LIMITATION ON SALE OF TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Borrower will
(and no Borrower will permit any of its Subsidiaries to) sell, assign, grant a
Lien in, or otherwise transfer any interest in its Trade Accounts Receivable to
any Person if, after giving effect thereto, the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) of (i) Consolidated Transferred Receivables to (ii) the sum of
Consolidated Retained Receivables plus Consolidated Transferred Receivables
shall exceed 55%. Micro will not permit the ratio as at the end of any Fiscal

Credit Extensions of all Lenders to be less than 4.00 to 1.0.

        SECTION 8.2.9 SALE OF ASSETS. Except as provided in Section 8.2.5, no
Obligor will (and no Obligor will permit any of its Subsidiaries to) Dispose of
any property or assets other than in the ordinary course of business, except
that:

                (a) Micro or any Subsidiary of Micro may Dispose of any of its
        assets so long as the proceeds thereof are either (i) utilized to repay
        or prepay (in accordance with the provisions of Article IV) Revolving
        Loans (provided that in the event the amount of such proceeds shall
        exceed the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding
        hereunder at such time, such excess proceeds may be utilized to repay or
        prepay (in accordance with the provisions hereof) other loans
        outstanding at such time) or (ii) so long as no Event of Default has
        occurred and is continuing or would occur after giving effect thereto,
        reinvested in one or more of the businesses in which Micro or any of its
        Subsidiaries is principally engaged in accordance with Section 8.2.10;

                (b) Micro or any Subsidiary of Micro may Dispose of assets which

<PAGE>

                (c) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing or would occur after giving effect thereto, Micro and any
        Subsidiary of Micro may Dispose of assets in transactions exclusively
        among Micro and any of its Subsidiaries or among Subsidiaries of Micro
        that satisfy the requirements of Section 8.2.6; and

                (d) subject to Section 8.2.8, any Borrower may (and may permit
        any of its Subsidiaries to) sell, assign, grant a Lien in, or otherwise
        transfer any interest in its Trade Accounts Receivable and related
        property such as proceeds and records.

For purposes of this Section 8.2.9 "Dispose" means sell, lease, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of property but shall not include any public taking or
condemnation, and "Disposition" has a corresponding meaning to Dispose. Such
terms shall not include an exchange of assets if the assets involved in such
exchange are similar in function and after giving effect to such exchange there
has not been (i) a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material deterioration of
cash flow generation from or in connection with such assets, or (iii) any
material deterioration in the overall quality of plant, property, and equipment
of any Obligor. An "exchange" shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes
hereof if each of the transactions involved shall have been consummated within a
six month period.

        SECTION 8.2.10 LIMITATION ON BUSINESSES. Micro and its Subsidiaries,
considered as a whole, will not engage principally in businesses other than
those conducted by Micro and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof, as described
in the preamble of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

        consented to or acquiesced in by such Obligor or Material Subsidiary, as

Agent, upon the direction of the Required Lenders, shall by notice to Micro
declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving
Loans and all other Obligations to be due and payable and/or the Commitments to
be terminated, whereupon the full unpaid amount of the Revolving Loans and all
other Obligations which shall be so declared due and payable shall be and become
immediately due and payable, without further notice, demand or presentment,
and/or, as the case may be, the Commitments shall terminate.

        SECTION 9.4 CASH COLLATERAL. If any Event of Default shall occur for any

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

continuing and the Obligations are or have been declared due and payable under
Section 9.2 or 9.3, the Administrative Agent may apply any cash collateral held
by the Administrative Agent pursuant of Section 3.2.4 to the payment of the
Obligations in any order in which the Required Lenders may elect.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                     AGENTS

        SECTION 10.1 AUTHORIZATION AND ACTIONS. Each Lender hereby appoints
Scotia Capital as the Administrative Agent and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. as the
Syndication Agent under, and for the purposes set forth in, this Agreement and
each other Loan Document. Each Lender authorizes each Agent to act on behalf of
such Lender under this Agreement and each other Loan Document and in the absence
of other written instructions from the Required Lenders received from time to
time by the Agents (with respect to which each Agent agrees that it will comply,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.1 or as otherwise advised by
counsel), to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Agents by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby
indemnifies (which indemnity shall survive any termination of this Agreement)
each Agent pro rata according to such Lender's Percentage, from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses of
any kind or nature whatsoever which at any time may be imposed on, incurred by,
or asserted against, each Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and
as to which either Agent is not reimbursed by Micro or the other Obligors;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses which are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final proceeding to have
resulted solely from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. No
Agent shall be required to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, unless it is indemnified hereunder to its satisfaction. If
any indemnity in favor of either Agent shall be or become, in such Agent's
determination, inadequate, the Administrative Agent may call additional
indemnification from the Lenders and cease to do the acts indemnified against
hereunder until such additional indemnity is given.

        SECTION 10.2 FUNDING RELIANCE, ETC. Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender by
5:00 p.m., Applicable Time, on the Business Day prior to the making of a
Revolving Loan that such Lender will not make available an amount which would
constitute its Percentage of such requested Revolving Loan on the date specified
therefor, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent and, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If
and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such amount available to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree,
to pay the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date the



                                      -72-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent made such amount available to the relevant Borrower to the
date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at an annual interest
rate equal to the Administrative Agent's Cost of Funds for the first day that
the Administrative Agent made such amounts available and thereafter at a rate of
interest equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the requested
Revolving Loan.

        SECTION 10.3 EXCULPATION. Neither Agent nor any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own willful
misconduct or gross negligence, nor be responsible for any recitals or
warranties herein or therein, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability,
validity or due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor to
make any inquiry respecting the performance by any Obligor of its obligations
hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Any such inquiry which may be made
by either Agent shall not obligate it to make any further inquiry to take any
action. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning
legal matters and upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or writing
which each such Agent believes to be genuine and to have been presented by a
proper Person.

        SECTION 10.4 SUCCESSOR. Either Agent may resign as such at any time upon
at least 30 days' prior notice to Micro and all the Lenders. If either Agent
shall at any time resign, the Required Lenders, after consultations with Micro,
may appoint another Lender as a successor Administrative Agent or Syndication
Agent, as the case may be, whereupon such Lender shall become the Administrative
Agent or the Syndication Agent hereunder, as the case may be. If no successor
Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Administrative Agent's or Syndication Agent's giving notice of
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, after consultations with Micro, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent, as the case may be, which shall be
one of the Lenders or a commercial banking institution that is organized under
the laws of the United States or any State thereof (or a branch or agency of
either) and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.
Upon acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent
hereunder, as the case may be, by a successor Administrative Agent or
Syndication Agent, as the case may be, such successor Administrative Agent or
Syndication Agent shall be entitled to receive from the retiring Administrative
Agent or Syndication Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such
successor Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent, as the case may be, may
reasonably request, and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or
Syndication Agent, as the case may be, and the retiring Administrative Agent or
Syndication Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's or Syndication Agent's
resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent, as the
case may be, the provisions of:

                (a) this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
        taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent
        or Syndication Agent under this Agreement; and



                                      -73-
<PAGE>

                (b) Sections 11.3 and 11.4 shall continue to inure to its
        benefit.

        SECTION 10.5 CREDIT EXTENSIONS BY AN AGENT. Each Agent shall have the
same rights and powers with respect to the Credit Extensions made by it or any
of its Affiliates in its capacity as a Lender and may exercise the same as if it
were not an Agent hereunder. Each Agent and its respective Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with
any Obligor or Subsidiary of any thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.

        SECTION 10.6 CREDIT DECISIONS. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently of the Agents and each other Lender, and based on such Lender's
review of the financial information of each Obligor, this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents (the terms and provisions which being satisfactory to such
Lender) and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to make available its
Commitment. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of the
Agents and each other Lender, and based on such other documents, information and
investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its
own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any
rights and privileges available to it under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

        SECTION 10.7 COPIES, ETC. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice to each Lender of each notice or request required or permitted to be
given to the Administrative Agent by any Obligor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (unless concurrently delivered to the
Lenders by such Obligor). The Administrative Agent will distribute to each
Lender each document or instrument received for its account, and copies of all
other communications received by the Administrative Agent from any Obligor, for
distribution to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

        SECTION 10.8 JOINT LEAD ARRANGERS AND OTHER AGENTS. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners,
the Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents listed on the cover page
hereof shall not have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement,
except in their capacity, if any, as Administrative Agent or Lender.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        SECTION 11.1 WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS, ETC. The provisions of this Agreement
and of each other Loan Document may from time to time be amended, modified or
waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented to
by each Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided that no such amendment,
modification or waiver which would:

                (a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular action
        be taken by all the Lenders or by the Required Lenders shall be
        effective unless consented to by each Lender;



                                      -74-
<PAGE>

                (b) modify this Section 11.1, change the definitions of
        "Percentage," or "Required Lenders," increase the Total Credit
        Commitment Amount or the Credit Commitment Amount or Percentage of any
        Lender, extend the Commitment Termination Date, or, subject to Section
        8.2.5, release any Guarantor from any of its payment obligations under
        the Guaranty entered into by it, shall be made without the consent of
        each Lender;

                (c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, any
        scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any
        Credit Extension or the amount of any fee payable under Section 4.3
        shall be made without the consent of each Lender; or

                (d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of the
        Administrative Agent or the Issuer shall be made without the consent of
        the Administrative Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be.

No failure or delay on the part of any Lender Party in exercising any power or
right under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
power or right. No notice to or demand on any Obligor in any case shall entitle
it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or
approval by any Lender Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document

obligations, provided that Coordination Center and Micro, jointly and severally,
shall reimburse each Lender Party for the fees and legal expenses of only one
counsel for such Lender Party.

delivery of this Agreement and each other Loan Document by each Lender Party and

reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, which shall include the actual
cost to such Indemnified Party of its in-house counsel but shall not include the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel to such Indemnified Party

or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to:

                (a) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in
        part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Credit Extension;

                (b) the entering into and performance of this Agreement and any
        other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties (excluding,
        however, any action successfully brought by or on behalf of Micro or any
        other Borrower with respect to any determination by any Lender not to
        fund any Credit Extension or not to comply with Section 11.15 or any
        action by the Required Lenders to terminate or reduce the Commitments or
        accelerate the Revolving Loans in violation of the terms of this
        Agreement);

                (c) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to any
        acquisition or proposed acquisition by any Obligor, or any of their

        the protection of the environment or the Release by any Obligor (or any
        of their respective Subsidiaries) of any Hazardous Material; or



                                      -76-
<PAGE>

                (e) the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage,
        spillage, discharge, emission, discharging, or releases from, any real
        property owned or operated by any Obligor (or any of their respective
        Subsidiaries) of any Hazardous Material (including any losses,
        liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses, or claims asserted or
        arising under any Environmental Law), regardless of whether caused by,
        or within the control of, such Person;

except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the account of a
particular Indemnified Party by reason of the relevant Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be
unenforceable for any reason, the Obligors hereby jointly and severally agree to
make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the

under Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 11.3, and 11.4, and the obligations of the

termination of this Agreement, the payment in full of Obligations, and the

and each other Obligor in this Agreement and in each other Loan Document shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and each such other Loan
Document.

        SECTION 11.6 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such provision and such Jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Agreement or such Loan Document or affecting the validity or enforceability
of such provision in any other jurisdictions.

        SECTION 11.7 HEADINGS. The various headings of this Agreement and of
each other Loan Document are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or
any provisions hereof or thereof.

        SECTION 11.8 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS, EFFECTIVENESS; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in several counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall
constitute together but one and the same Agreement. This Agreement shall become

counterparts hereof executed on behalf of Micro, Coordination Center, the
Agents, and each Lender or (ii) facsimile, telegraphic, or other written
confirmation (in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
who may rely upon the advice of its special counsel in making that
determination) of such execution and (b) so notified the Borrowers and the
Lenders; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to make the initial
Credit Extension until the date (the "Effective Date") that the applicable
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied as provided
herein. The Effective Date must occur on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on December 30, 2002. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents

        Assignment Agreement) shall be released from its obligations under this
        Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                      -80-
<PAGE>

        with any Participant that such Lender will not, without such

                (e) no Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under this

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each Participant, for purposes of
Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, 11.3, and 11.4, shall be considered a
Lender.

        SECTION 11.12 OTHER TRANSACTIONS. Nothing contained herein shall
preclude any Lender Party from engaging in any transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with any Obligor or
any of its Affiliates in which such Obligor or such Affiliate is not restricted

        SECTION 11.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Obligor agrees to do such further
acts and things and to execute and deliver to each Lender Party such additional
assignments, agreements, powers, and instruments, as such Lender Party may

RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF
THE LENDER PARTIES, THE AGENTS OR MICRO OR ANY OTHER OBLIGOR. MICRO AND EACH
OTHER OBLIGOR AGREES THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FULL AND SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR
THIS PROVISION (AND EACH OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) AND THAT THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT FOR THE LENDER PARTIES ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT TO WHICH IS A PARTY.

        SECTION 11.15 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Lender Parties hereby
severally agrees with each Borrower that it will keep confidential all
information delivered to such Lender Party or on behalf of each Borrower or any
of their respective Subsidiaries which information is known by such Lender Party
to be proprietary in nature, concerns the terms and conditions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or is clearly marked or labeled or otherwise
adequately identified when received by such Lender Party as being confidential
information (all such information, collectively for purposes of this section,
"confidential information"); provided that each Lender Party shall be permitted
to deliver or disclose "confidential information": (a) to directors, officers,
employees and affiliates; (b) to authorized agents, attorneys, auditors and
other professional advisors retained by such Lender Party that have been
apprised of such Lender Party's obligation under this Section 11.15 and have
agreed to hold confidential the foregoing




                                      -81-
<PAGE>

information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.15;
(c) in connection with the prospective assignment or transfer of all or any part
of, or the sale of a participating interest in, such Lender Party's Credit
Extensions and Commitment, to any prospective Transferee Lender or Participant
that has been apprised of such Lender Party's obligation under this Section
11.15 has agreed to hold confidential the foregoing information in accordance
with the terms of this Section 11.15; (d) to any federal or state regulatory
authority having jurisdiction over such Lender Party; or (e) to any other Person
to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (i) to
effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such
Lender Party, (ii) in response to any subpoena or other legal process (provided
that the relevant Borrower shall be given notice of any such subpoena or other
legal process as soon as possible in any event prior to production (unless
provision of any such notice would result in a violation of any such subpoena or
other legal process), and the Lender Party receiving such subpoena or other
legal process shall cooperate with such Borrower, at such Borrower's expense,
seeking a protective order to prevent or limit such disclosure), or (iii) in
connection with any litigation to which such Lender Party is a party.

        For purposes hereof, the term "confidential information" does not
include any information that: (A) was publicly known or otherwise known by any
Lender Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the relevant
Borrower prior to the time such information is delivered or disclosed to such
Lender Party by the relevant Borrower; (B) subsequently becomes publicly known
through no act or omission by any Lender Party or any Person acting on behalf of
any Lender Party; (C) otherwise becomes known to a Lender Party other than
through disclosure by the relevant Borrower (or any Subsidiary thereof) or
through someone subject, to such Lender Party's knowledge, to a duty of
confidentiality to the relevant Borrower; or (D) constitutes financial
statements that are otherwise publicly available.

        SECTION 11.16 RELEASE OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS AND ACCEDING BORROWERS.

                (a) If (i) the Agents receive a certificate from the chief
        executive officer, the chief financial officer, or Treasurer of Micro
        certifying as of the date of that certificate that, after the
        consummation of the transaction or series of transactions described in
        such certificate (which certification shall also state that such
        transactions, individually and in the aggregate, will be in compliance
        with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, to the
        extent applicable, the covenants contained in Sections 8.2.5, 8.2.6, and
        8.2.9, and that no Default existed, exists, or will exist, as the case
        may be, immediately before, as a result of, or after giving effect to
        such transaction or transactions and the release or termination, as the
        case may be, described below), the Guarantor or Acceding Borrower, as
        the case may be, identified in such certificate will no longer be a
        Subsidiary of Micro, and (ii) in the case of a Acceding Borrower, the
        appropriate Lender Parties have received payment in full of all
        principal of, interest on, reimbursement obligation in respect of, and
        fees related to any Outstanding Credit Extensions made by any of them in
        favor of such Acceding Borrower, then such Guarantor's Guaranty shall
        automatically terminate or such Acceding Borrower shall automatically
        cease to be a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                (b) No such termination or cessation shall release, reduce, or
        otherwise adversely affect the obligations of any other Obligor under
        this Agreement, any other



                                      -82-
<PAGE>

        Guaranty, or any other Loan Document, all of which obligations continue
        to remain in full force and effect.

                (c) Each Lender Party shall, at Micro's expense, execute such
        documents as Micro may reasonably request to evidence such termination
        or cessation, as the case may be.

        SECTION 11.17 COLLATERAL. Each of the Lenders represents to the
Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders that it in good faith is not
relying upon any Margin Stock as collateral in the extension or maintenance of
the credit provided for in this Agreement.
