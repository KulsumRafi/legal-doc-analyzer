<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>EMPLOYEE SCHOLAR PROGRAM</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;United Technologies Corporation (&quot;UTC&quot;), through its
Employee Scholar Program (the &quot;Program&quot;), encourages eligible employees to
develop additional skills and engage in studies at accredited colleges and universities.
Under the Program, UTC pays for covered tuition and textbook expenses for participating
employees and provides certain awards of UTC Common Stock, options and stock units upon
completion of associate&#146;s, bachelor&#146;s, master&#146;s and doctorate degrees.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Active employees of UTC and its participating affiliated companies in
the United States and other countries are eligible to participate. Extended benefits are
provided to certain employees whose positions are eliminated due to restructuring or
layoff. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of the accomplishments of eligible employees who are
awarded degrees from accredited educational institutions while participating in the
program, shares of UTC Common Stock, stock options or stock units are awarded. U.S.-based
employees who satisfy Program requirements will be awarded a number of shares of UTC
Common Stock valued at $5,000 for those completing an associate&#146;s degree and $10,000
for those completing a bachelor&#146;s, master&#146;s or doctorate degree. Alternatively,
participants may elect to receive 250 UTC Common Stock options for those completing an
associate&#146;s degree, or 500 UTC Common Stock options for those completing a
bachelor&#146;s, master&#146;s or doctorate degree. Employees based outside the U.S. who
satisfy Program requirements will be awarded a number of shares of UTC Common Stock valued
at 9% of the average UTC salary in that country for participants completing the equivalent
of an associate&#146;s degree and 18% of the average salary in that country for
participants completing the equivalent of a bachelor&#146;s, master&#146;s, or doctorate
degree. The number of shares awarded in each case is determined using the closing price of
UTC Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) on the first trading
day of the month following submission of a qualifying award request. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A maximum of 400,000 shares of UTC Common Stock may be awarded annually
under the Program. UTC reserves the right to suspend, terminate or modify the terms of the
Program at any time. This summary of the Program is qualified in its entirety by reference
to UTC&#146;s detailed policies and procedures implementing the Program, as amended from
time to time. The sole purpose of the Program is to facilitate and encourage educational
development and achievement and it is not intended to and shall not be construed to
constitute an employee benefit plan or compensatory arrangement.</font></p>
