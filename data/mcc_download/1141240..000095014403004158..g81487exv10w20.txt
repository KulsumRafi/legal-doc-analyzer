                 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT RELATING TO DELAY PENALTY


To: KOOKMIN BANK                   (Month)    (Date), 20xx (Year)
                                               Liquidmetal Korea Co., Ltd.
                                               Representative Director
                                               Hong, Sung Taek

                             [Borrower] Name:                             (seal)
                             ---------------------------------------------------
                             Address:

In addition to the Credit Service Agreement, I ascertain and definitively agree
to the following:

SECTION 1 DELAY PENALTY

The interest rate on any delinquent payment (hereinafter "delay penalty") shall
be the rate [interest rate on the loan (interest rate agreed upon) + the
additional interest rate on the delinquent payment] set by the bank. However, if
the interest rate agreed upon in Section 2.1 exceeds the maximum rate, the rate
on the delay penalty shall be the rate of the interest rate agreed upon plus
2.0%.

SECTION 2  MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RATES OF THE DELAY PENALTY

     1.   Minimum and maximum rates of the delay penalty under this Agreement
          shall be 14.0% and 21.0% per annum respectively.
     2.   The minimum rate shall be applicable in case the rate of the delay
          penalty calculated in accordance with the Section 1 of this additional
          agreement is lower than the minimum rate under the preceding
          paragraph, and, in case the rate exceeds the maximum rate, the rate in
          excess of the maximum rate shall not be applicable. However, provision
          in Paragraph 1 shall be used in the event that the interest rate
          agreed upon is 21.0% or higher per annum.

SECTION 3 DIFFERENTIAL APPLICATION OF THE ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE ON DELINQUENT
PAYMENTS AND THE START DATE OF DELINQUENT PAYMENTS

     1.   The interest rate on any delinquent payment of Section 1 shall be 8.0%
          per annum in case the principal and associated interests of the
          delinquent payment is settled within three (3) months from the start
          date of delinquency, 9.0% if settled within six (6) months, and 10% if
          settled after six (6) months.
     2.   In case partial repayment on the delay penalty has been made, the
          start date (the start date of delinquency) for differential
          application of the additional interest rate under the provisions of
          Section 1 shall be the payment due date initially agreed upon (or
          [illegible]), and shall be based on the changed due date in case the
          date (or [illegible]) agreed upon has been changed.
     3.   As for the application of the differentiated additional interest rates
          depending on the length of delinquent period under Paragraph 1, a
          uniform rate shall be applicable for the entire duration of the
          delinquent payment as of the settlement date of the delinquent
          payment, not differential rates for each period.
          e.g. In case the principal and associated interests are fully paid for
               a loan delinquent for five (5) months, a single and uniform
               interest rate of 9.0% per annum shall be applicable on the
               delinquent payment for the entire period of five (5) months, in
               addition to the interest rate agreed upon, as opposed to
               application of additional interest rate of 8.0% per annum on the
               delinquent period of the first three (3) months and 9.0% per
               annum for the last two (2) months.
     4.   In case the principal of the delinquent payment has been partially
          settled and a balance remains on the day of payment, the additional
          interest rate for the entire delinquent period shall be continuously
          applicable from the date of delinquency, before the partial payment of
          the delinquent amount, and the delinquent date shall not change.

SECTION 4 CHANGE OF DELAY PENALTY RATES

     The bank may change the additional interest rates in the provisions of
     Section 1, the delay penalty set forth in Section 2 Paragraph 1, and the
     differential additional interest rates set forth in Section 3 Paragraph 1
     to the rate set by the bank in case the initial agreement cannot be
     maintained due to changes in the financial service environment or changes
     in the national economy.

               ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT RELATING TO EARLY PAY-OFF FEES


To: KOOKMIN BANK Co., Ltd.                        (Month)    (Date), 20xx (Year)
                                    [Borrower] Name:                      (seal)
                                    --------------------------------------------
                                    Address:

In addition to the Credit Service Agreement of MM DD YY, I ascertain and
definitively agree to the following:

SECTION 1 PAYMENT OF EARLY PAY-OFF FEES
     In case Obligor repays the loan obtained from Bank (this means extension of
credit financing set forth in Section 2 Paragraph 1 Sub-Paragraph 7 of the Bank
Law) before the date of initially stipulated due date, Obligor shall pay Bank
early pay-off fees in accordance with the calculating method set forth in
Section 2.

SECTION 2 CALCULATION OF EARLY PAY-OFF FEES

(1)  Early pay-off fees relate to "basic fees" and "reference interest rate
     difference," and shall be applicable as indicated below. However, for loans
     linked to the Prime Rate, only the "basic fees" will be collected.

     A.   Basic fees = Early pay-off fees x basic fee rate (0.5%) x number of
          residual days/365
          However, in case the number of residual days exceeds 365, it shall be
          deemed to be 365 days.
     B.   Reference interest rate difference = early pay-off principal x
          difference in interest rates (currently applied MOR - the MOR at the
          time of repayment/365
          However, in the event that the rate difference is in the negative (-),
          this will not be applied. "Residual days" means the number of days
          from the date of early pay-off to the due date. As to re-priced loans,
          this means the number of days from the early pay-off date to the time
          of re-pricing.

(2)  Definition of Related Terminology

     A.   Reference rate (MOR): Of the financial instruments under circulation
          in the market, Bank looks at the market circulation margins of the
          representative instruments which have the same date of rate expiration
          [as the concerned loan], and then determine the MOR based on that.
     B.   Fixed interest rate loan: This is the rate determined at
          implementation of credit, which will be applied unchanged during the
          stipulated term barring any special circumstances.
     C.   Re-priced loan: Pursuant to predetermined stipulation between client
          and Bank, the rate will be recalculated and applied for specific cycle
          of time period (such as every 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months). Hence
          the reference interest rate will be changed as of the date of
          stipulated cycle.

SECTION 3 WAIVER OF EARLY PAY-OFF FEES

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1, early pay-off fees may be
waived under any one of the following cases:

          1.   in case the residual loan period is less than one (1) month

          2.   in case the loan is collected before the due date to meet the
               needs of Bank, for reasons such as disappearance of benefit of
               time

          3.   in case the loan is collected before the due date through
               consultation with Bank as a result of agreement on corporate
               financial structure improvement

          4.   otherwise separately decided by Bank
