to the extent that the Employee Participant was entitled to do so on the date
of termination of his employment, for a period which ends not later than the
earlier of (i) three months after such termination, and (ii) the Expiration
Date.&#160; &#147;Disability&#148; shall mean a
determination by the Administrator that the Employee Participant is physically
or mentally incapacitated and has been unable for a period of six consecutive
months to perform the duties for which he was responsible immediately before
the onset of his incapacity.&#160; In order
to assist the Administrator in making a determination as to the Disability of
the Employee Participant for purposes of this paragraph (a), the Employee
Participant shall, as reasonably requested by the Administrator, (A) make
himself available for medical examinations by one or more physicians chosen by
the Administrator and approved by the Employee Participant, whose approval
shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (B) grant the Administrator and any
such physicians access to all relevant medical information concerning him,

mental illness), (B) gross negligence or malfeasance in the performance of the
Employee Participant&#146;s duties, (C) a finding by a court or other governmental
