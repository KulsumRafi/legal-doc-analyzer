accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Alabama.

     SECTION 6.05. Non-Waiver; Modification; etc. Neither any failure nor any
delay on the part of the Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. No modification, amendment or waiver of
any provision of this agreement, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Lender, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on

invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or thereof or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 6.07. Termination of Security Interest. The Lender's security
interest under this agreement in the Collateral will not be terminated until one
of the Lender's officers signs a written termination agreement. Even if the
Borrower should pay all of the Liabilities owing to the Lender at any one time,
the Lender's security interest will continue to secure any sum the Borrower
should later owe the Lender until the written termination agreement referred to
above has been executed by the Lender.
