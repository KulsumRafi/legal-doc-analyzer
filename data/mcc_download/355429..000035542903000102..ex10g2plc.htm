                                                      DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN<br>
                                                             FOR OFFICERS<br>
                                                           NOVEMBER 4, 2002</h3>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective
Life Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) hereby amends the Protective Life
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Officers (the &#147;Plan&#148;). </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.       Section 4(c) of the Plan is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>



                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)(1)   If a stock  allotment is elected in whole or in part, the Account shall be credited with a stock  equivalent
         that shall be equal to the number of full and  fractional  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock,  par value $0.50 per share
         (the "Common  Stock"),  that could be purchased with the dollar amount of the allotment using the average of the Closing Price
         (as defined  below) of the Common Stock for the twenty (20) trading days ending on the day  preceding  the date the Account is
         so credited.  The  "Closing  Price" of the Common  Stock on any trading day means the daily  closing  price for a share of the
         Common Stock on the  Composite  Tape for the New York Stock  Exchange or, if the Common Stock is not listed on such  Exchange,
         on the principal  United States  securities  exchange  registered  under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
         "Exchange  Act"), on which the Common Stock is listed or, if the Common Stock is not listed on any such exchange,  the average
         of the daily  closing bid  quotations  with respect to a share of the Common Stock on the National  Association  of Securities
         Dealers,  Inc.,  Automated  Quotations  System or any system then in use or, if no such  quotations  are  available,  the fair
         market value of a share of the Common Stock as determined by a majority of the Board;  provided,  however, that if a Change in
         Control (as  defined  below)  shall have  occurred,  then such  determination  shall be made by a majority  of the  Continuing
         Directors (as defined in Protective Life Corporation's Rights Agreement, as in effect from time to time).</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)(A)    Except as otherwise  provided in Section  4(c)(2)(B),  the Account also shall be credited as of the payment
         date for each dividend on the Common Stock with additional  stock  equivalents  computed by (i) multiplying the dividend paid,
         either in cash or property  (other than Common  Stock),  upon a share of Common Stock to a shareholder of record by the number
         of stock  equivalents  in the Account,  and (ii) dividing the product  thereof by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the
         trading day  preceding  the dividend  payment  date.  In the case of dividends  payable in property,  the amount paid shall be
         based on the fair market value of the property at the time of  distribution  of the  dividend,  as determined by a majority of
         the Board;  provided,  however,  that if a Change in Control shall have occurred,  then such determination  shall be made by a
         majority of the Continuing Directors.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)      An Officer may elect to receive, in lieu of the credit to his Account as provided in Section 4(c)(2)(A),  an
         amount in cash or property  equal to the amount of any dividend  paid,  either in cash or property  (other than Common  Stock)
         upon a share of Common Stock to a shareholder of record,  multiplied by the number of stock  equivalents  in the Account.  The
         Officer may make such election by executing a form  prescribed by or  acceptable to the Company and  delivering  such election
         form to the Company;  provided that any such  election  shall be  applicable  only with respect to dividend  record dates that
         occur after the date of such  election.  The Company  shall make payments to the Officer  pursuant to this Section  4(c)(2)(B)
         as soon as practicable after the applicable dividend payment date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.       Section 5(a) of the Plan is amended to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      Except as otherwise  provided in the Plan,  at an Officer's  election,  the balance in his Account  shall be
         paid to the Officer commencing on the date which the Officer has specified on the Officer's election form.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Except as otherwise  provided in the Plan,  the balance in the Account shall be paid either in a lump sum or, at the Officer's
         election, in monthly, quarterly,  semiannual or annual installments,  but such installments shall be payable over a period not
         to exceed ten (10) years (the "Payout  Period").  In order to be effective,  an election to change the method and/or timing of
         distribution  with respect to the Account must be made on a form  prescribed  by or  acceptable to the Company and received by
         the Company  before the first day of the calendar year in which  payments (i) are to begin  pursuant to such election and (ii)
         would have begun absent such election.  The amount of each  installment  shall be determined as of the first day of the period
         in which  payment is to be made by dividing the then balance in the Account by the then  remaining  number of payment dates in
         the Payout  Period.  The lump sum or first  periodic  installment  shall be paid by the Company as promptly as is  convenient,
         but not more than sixty (60) days following the date specified by the Officer.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.       A new Section 7(i) is added to the Plan after Section 7(h), such new Section 7(i) to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)      Compliance  with Legal and Exchange  Requirements.  The Plan,  and the  obligations of the Company under the
         Plan,  shall be subject to all  applicable  federal  and state  laws,  rules and  regulations,  and to such  approvals  by any
         regulatory  or  governmental  agency as may be required.  The  Company,  in its  discretion,  may (1) postpone the issuance or
         delivery of Common Stock or any other action  permitted under the Plan to permit the Company,  with reasonable  diligence,  to
         complete such stock exchange  listing or  registration  or  qualification  of such Common Stock or other required action under
         any  federal or state law,  rule or  regulation,  (2)  require  any  Officer to make such  representations  and  furnish  such
         information  as it may consider  appropriate  in connection  with the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in compliance  with
         applicable laws, rules and regulations,  and (3) pay the Officer,  in lieu of shares of Common Stock,  cash in an amount equal
         to the  product of (A) the  Closing  Price of the  Common  Stock as of the most  recent  practicable  date  before the date of
         payment,  multiplied  by (B) the number of stock  equivalents  in the Account.  The Company  shall not be obligated to sell or
         issue Common Stock in violation of any such laws,  rules or regulations,  and neither the Company nor its directors,  officers
         or employees  shall have any  obligation  or liability  to an Officer with respect to the  Officer's  Account (or Common Stock
         issuable thereunder) because of any actions taken pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(i).</FONT></P>


         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this document as of November 4, 2002.</FONT></P>
