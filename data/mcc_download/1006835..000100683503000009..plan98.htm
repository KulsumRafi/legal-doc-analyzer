<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI></B>To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how each Stock Award shall be granted; whether a Stock Award will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option, a stock bonus, a right to purchase restricted stock, or a combination of the foregoing; the provisions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and the number of shares with respect to which a Stock Award shall be granted to each such person.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Shares Subject to the Plan.</P></B>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI></B>Subject to the provisions of Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the number of shares of stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards shall not exceed in the aggregate two hundred forty million (240,000,000) shares of the Company's common stock.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock Awards may be granted only to Employees or Consultants who are not (i) Officers (other than vice presidents of the Company), (ii) Directors, or (iii) then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Provided however, that the aggregate number of shares made subject to Stock Awards granted to eligible Officers cannot exceed the number necessary to preserve the treatment of the Plan as a &quot;broadly based&quot; plan within the meaning of Rule 4460(i)(1)(A) of the Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Option Provisions.</LI></P></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate.  The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Term</B>.  No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Price</B>.  The exercise price of each Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Consideration</B>.  The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised, or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of the grant of the Option, (A) by delivery to the Company of other common stock of the Company, (B) according to a deferred payment arrangement, except that payment of the common stock's &quot;par value&quot; (as defined in the Delaware General Corporation Law) shall not be made by deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other common stock of the Company) with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to subsection 6(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Transferability</B>.  An Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Option is granted only by such person) unless the applicable Option Agreement expressly provides for other transferability.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the person to whom the Option is granted may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionee, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Vesting</B>.  The total number of shares of stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal).  The Option Agreement may provide that from time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable (&quot;vest&quot;) with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option became vested but was not fully exercised.  The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate.  The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary.  The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship</B>.  In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability), the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it as of the date of termination, unless the Option Agreement expressly provides that the Option may become exercisable for additional shares after the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.  If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the Option Agreement, or (ii) the tenth (10th) day after the last date on which such exercise would result in such liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, an Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares would violate the registration requirements under the Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 6(f), or (ii) the expiration of a period of three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Disability of Optionee</B>.  In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it as of the date of termination, unless the Option Agreement expressly provides that the Option may become exercisable for additional shares after the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date six (6) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.  If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Death of Optionee</B>.  In the event of the death of an Optionee during, or within a period specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of, the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant, the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of death) by the Optionee's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.  If, at the time of death, the Optionee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.  If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Terms of Stock Bonuses and Purchases of Restricted Stock.</LI></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate.  The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Purchase Price</B>.  The purchase price under each restricted stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such agreement, but in no event shall the purchase price be less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the stock's Fair Market Value on the date such award is made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Transferability</B>.  No rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless the applicable Stock Award Agreement expressly provides for other transferability.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Consideration.</B>  The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either:  (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement, except that payment of the common stock's &quot;par value&quot; (as defined in the Delaware General Corporation Law) shall not be made by deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other common stock of the Company) with the person to whom the stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in its discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Vesting.</B>  Shares of stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship.</B>  In the event a participant's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire, subject to the limitations described in subsection 7(d), any or all of the shares of stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Covenants of the Company.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI></B>During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI></B>The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of stock upon exercise of the Stock Award; provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;) either the Plan, any Stock Award or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award.  If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI></B>Neither an Employee or Consultant, nor any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred under subsection 6(d) or 7(b) shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI></B>Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Employee, Consultant or other holder of Stock Awards any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate (or to continue acting as a Consultant) or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any Employee with or without cause, or to terminate the relationship of any Consultant in accordance with the terms of that Consultant's agreement with the Company or Affiliate to which such Consultant is providing services.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Securities Law Compliance.</B>  The Company may require any person to whom a Stock Award is granted, or any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred pursuant to subsection 6(d) or 7(b), as a condition of exercising or acquiring stock under any Stock Award, (1) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters, and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (2) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the stock subject to the Stock Award for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock.

The Company may require the holder of the Stock Award to provide such other representations, written assurances or information which the Company shall determine is necessary, desirable or appropriate to comply with applicable securities and other laws as a condition of granting a Stock Award to such person or permitting the holder of the Stock Award to exercise the Stock Award.  The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><LI>Withholding</B>.  To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the person to whom a Stock Award is granted may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of stock under a Stock Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means:  (1) tendering a cash payment; (2) authorizing the Company to withhold shares from the shares of the common stock otherwise issuable to the participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award; or (3) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the common stock of the Company.</LI></P></OL>

In the event any surviving corporation and its Affiliates refuse to assume or continue such Stock Awards, or to substitute similar Stock Awards for those outstanding under the Plan, then, with respect to Stock Awards held by persons then performing services as Employees or Consultants, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised shall be accelerated and the Stock Awards terminated if not exercised prior to such event.</LI></P></OL>
