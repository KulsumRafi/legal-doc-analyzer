                              RELEASE OF INDEMNITY

         This Release Agreement (the "Agreement") is made by and between Shell
Oil Company ("Shell") and Resolution Performance Products LLC ("RPPLLC"),
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Parties" and individually
referred to as a "Party."

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, Shell and RPPLLC (formerly known as Shell Epoxy Resins LLC)
entered into an Environmental Agreement dated as of November 1, 2000 (the "US
Environmental Agreement");

         WHEREAS, Shell and RPPLLC have been in discussions to provide a release
with respect to certain indemnity provisions and obligations of Shell as set
forth in the US Environmental Agreement for the particular parcels of property
located in Lakeland, Florida which RPPLLC is seeking to sell to a third party,
as more specifically described in Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Released
Property");

         WHEREAS, Shell and RPPLLC have also been in discussions to provide a
conveyance of Shell's mineral rights reservation and access easement with
respect to the Released Property in the form of a quitclaim deed substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Quitclaim Deed");

         WHEREAS, RPPLLC in exchange for Shell's execution and delivery of the
Quitclaim Deed now desires to release Shell from past and future indemnity
obligations of Shell and/or any Shell Affiliate to RPPLLC pursuant to Section
2.1 of the US Environmental Agreement relating solely to the Released Property;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.       Unless the context otherwise requires, terms used and not defined
         herein shall have the meanings set forth either in Schedule A to the
         Master Sale Agreement dated as of September 10, 2000 between Shell and
         RPPLLC (as amended by a certain Amendment No. 1 to Sale Agreement,
         Human Resources Agreement and Seller Disclosure Letter between the
         Parties dated as of November 14, 2000) or in the Environmental
         Agreement, as the case may be.

2.       For and in consideration of Shell's execution and delivery of the
         Quitclaim Deed and an effective conveyance of the mineral rights
         reservation and access easement from the Released Property, RPPLLC for
         itself, its Affiliates, its parent and/or subsidiary companies, its
         representatives, including without limitation agents, employees,
         servants,

<PAGE>

         directors, officers, attorneys, successors and assigns (hereinafter
         together with RPPLLC referred to collectively as "Releasors"), jointly
         and severally, shall fully, irrevocably and forever release and
         discharge Shell, its Affiliates, its parent and/or subsidiary
         companies, its representatives, including without limitation, agents,
         employees, servants, directors, officers, attorneys, successors and
         assigns (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Releasees"), and each
         of them, from and against any and all claims, demands, sums of money,
         actions, rights, causes of action, obligations and liabilities which
         any of the Releasors may have or assert to have solely with respect to
         the Released Property pursuant to the Section 2.1 of US Environmental
         Agreement; provided, however, that nothing set forth herein shall
         release Shell from its liability and obligations pursuant to the US
         Environmental Agreement with respect to the Known Lakeland Site
         Contamination Issues to the extent, if any, there are any impacts on
         the Released Property.

3.       Shell agrees to cooperate and provide any and all additional documents
         or assistance as may be required to fully effectuate the conveyance of
         the mineral rights reservation and access easement from the Released
         Property, this Agreement being contingent upon such full cooperation.

4.       Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, all other terms and
         provisions of the US Environmental Agreement, and any other agreement
         between the Parties, shall remain unchanged and in full force and
         effect, including with regard to RPPLLC's other property in Lakeland,
         Florida, which is separate and distinct from the Released Property and
         for which the release set forth in this Agreement shall not apply.

5.       No party to this Agreement may transfer or assign, directly or
         indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights or
         obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
         the other Parties.

6.       This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,
         and any dispute arising out of this Agreement will be settled by
         arbitration as provided in the US Environmental Agreement.

                            [Signature Page Follows]
