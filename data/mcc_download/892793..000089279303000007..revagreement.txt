     SUPPLIER hereby agrees, represents and warrants to COORS
that:

     4.1  In addition to meeting the required Specifications set
forth in this Agreement, SUPPLIER is aware of the uses to which
COORS intends to put the Products and accordingly the Products
are sufficient and fit for those intended uses.  Such warranty
regarding fitness for the intended use shall be binding on
SUPPLIER for 180 calendar days from the date of manufacture of
the Product.  In the event SUPPLIER determines that the Specifi-
cations prevent SUPPLIER from providing a warranty that the
product is sufficient and fit for its intended uses, SUPPLIER
shall provide written notification to COORS, which notification
shall identify the portion of the Specifications that prevents
SUPPLIER from providing the warranty.  If SUPPLIER provides such
notification to COORS, COORS may modify its Specifications so
that SUPPLIER may make the warranty required by this Section 4.1;

     4.2  SUPPLIER shall convey good title to the Products and
the Products shall be delivered free of any lien or encumbrance,
and free from defects;

     4.3  SUPPLIER shall produce and deliver the quality and
quantity of Products required hereunder and as specified in
Exhibits A and B attached hereto;

     4.4  SUPPLIER warrants that all Products shall conform to a
pre-production or production sample that is approved in writing
by COORS, including without limitation the color, artwork,
texture and quality; that the Products shall conform to the
Specifications; that the Products shall be fit for the ordinary
purposes for which such Products are used, be of even kind and
quality, and be adequately packaged and labeled as the
Specifications may require;

     4.5  The Products delivered hereunder shall comply with all
applicable laws, statutes, rules, orders, regulations, and
ordinances of any local, state or federal governmental body
having jurisdiction over packaging materials for foods and
beverages for human consumption;

     4.6  The Contract Price, the terms, representations,
warranties and benefits granted to COORS herein are comparable
to or better than the equivalent prices, volumes, terms,
warranties and benefits offered by SUPPLIER to its other
customers; and

     4.7  SUPPLIER hereby assigns, to the extent assignable, for
the benefit of COORS warranties associated with the Products
provided by any manufacturer, subcontractor or third party and
SUPPLIER shall enforce such warranties on COORS' behalf upon
COORS' written request.  The warranties made or assigned by
SUPPLIER pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise shall survive the
acceptance of and payment for the Products by COORS.  The
warranties made or assigned to COORS by SUPPLIER pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise shall benefit COORS and its subsidiaries
and affiliated companies and their respective employees, agents,
representatives, assigns, subcontractors and customers.

performance requirements as specified on Exhibit F attached
hereto ("Service Requirements") for Supplier Performance Ratings.
COORS may apply the Service Requirements for each of SUPPLIER'S
facilities furnishing Products to each COORS location.  Failure
to meet or exceed the Service Requirements for at least a bronze-
level supplier at all COORS facilities, based on a simple average
will result in a "Supplier In Development" rating.  If SUPPLIER
rates as a Supplier in Development or if in COORS' judgment
SUPPLIER's performance as a Supplier in Development is not
showing substantial and steady improvement over any period of
time, SUPPLIER may be terminated.  If SUPPLIER rates as a
Supplier in Development in any quarter, SUPPLIER shall not be
eligible to receive the * * * implemented the following quarter.
However, if SUPPLIER achieves a gold-level rating, * * *.

     5.2  If SUPPLIER identifies Products that do not meet or
exceed COORS' Specifications during their manufacturing process,
SUPPLIER shall not ship such Products to COORS until the
manufacturing process has been corrected and the Products conform
to the Specifications, agreements, representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement.

     5.3  In order to ensure quality and service goals are achieved,
the Parties shall conduct quarterly meetings to review the
progress toward the standards established in Exhibit F as well as
other issues related to this Agreement.  A Steering Committee
shall be established that shall meet twice a year to specifically
review the Supplier Performance Ratings and other performance
measures.  The Parties' CEOs shall also meet once a year to
evaluate and discuss the status of the relationship.

outlined in this Section 6.2, or such claims shall be deemed
waived by SUPPLIER, including but not limited to all claims for
any interest accrued.  All invoices for costs to be paid by
COORS, including without limitation freight costs, must be
accompanied with a copy of the invoice or bill for such costs,
but no backup documentation.  In addition to invoices, monthly

Exhibit B in accordance with any recommendation that COORS elects
to implement pursuant to this Section 7.

     Each Party agrees that no Confidential Information of the
other Party will be used or disclosed to any third-party
individual or organization during the Term of this Agreement or
after its expiration or earlier termination.  Further, each Party
agrees and promises to control the other Party's Confidential
Information within its organization and to only disclose the

Party's Confidential Information, advertise or publicize any
information that relates to this Agreement or that mentions or
implies the name of COORS or any trade or brand names of COORS,
without prior written approval from COORS. The obligations and
duties of the Parties under this Article 10 shall survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.

     10.9 Exclusions to the Parties' "Confidential Information"

(i) information that is in the public domain through no act,
omission or fault of SUPPLIER, (ii) Confidential Information that
SUPPLIER is required to disclose pursuant to a court order,
provided that SUPPLIER informs COORS of the court order and
assists COORS in taking reasonable steps to seek a protective
order or other appropriate action, and (iii) Confidential

is required by law to disclose; provided, SUPPLIER shall first
notify COORS of such good faith belief in writing and shall not

     Each Party acknowledges and agrees that its breach, or
alleged breach, of this Article 10 relating to either Party's
Confidential Information may result in irreparable harm to the
other Party.  Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that
such damages are not readily ascertainable and that remedies at
law may be inadequate to compensate for a breach.  Therefore, in

this Article 10, in addition to any remedy at law, the injured
party shall be entitled to pursue any and all remedies that may
be available in equity or by temporary or permanent injunction.

     Prior to commencing any work in connection with the supply

during the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
and throughout the Term, at least the following types of
insurance and minimum coverage:  (a) Commercial General Liability
Insurance, including Contractual Liability and Products/Completed
Operations coverage with a combined single limit for bodily
injury, death, personal injury and property damage of $2,000,000
per occurrence and $5,000,000 general aggregate, and $5,000,000
Products/Completed Operations aggregate; (b) Automobile Liability
Insurance with combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage of $2,000,000 per accident; (c) Statutory Workmen's

Liability insurance policies.  All Certificates of Insurance shall
provide that COORS shall be provided thirty (30) calendar days
written notice prior to any change, substitution or cancellation of
such policies of insurance.  All such insurance policies shall be
"occurrence" policies rather than "claims made" policies and shall

going requirements as to the types and limits of insurance coverage
to be maintained by SUPPLIER, and any approval or waiver of said
insurance by COORS is not intended to and shall not in any way or
manner limit or qualify the liabilities and obligations of
SUPPLIER pursuant to this Agreement.

delivery of disability and medical benefits to injured employees.

Act of Colorado, COORS shall be a "statutory employer" of (i) all
employees of SUPPLIER, and (ii) of SUPPLIER's contractors and sub-
contractors while they are providing the Products and/or services
related to this Agreement.

          (b)  Failure by COORS to make any payment due as
required by this Agreement and such breach continues for a period
of * * * after ritten notice thereof from SUPPLIER; or

     Each Party shall be excused from performance under this
Agreement while and to the extent that it is unable to perform,

the Party giving notice shall be suspended only during the
continuance of the events giving rise to the force majeure
provided that the affected Party is acting with due diligence to
remedy the events giving rise to the force majeure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if SUPPLIER is unable to
perform for a period of more than * * * due to any delay, COORS
may terminate this Agreement.

     12.3 Remedies.

          (a)  * * *

          (b)  The Parties agree that the damages that COORS may
suffer are difficult to ascertain and are not capable of a
reasonable estimation at the time of contracting.  In the event

ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.4, and
any other remedies specified herein or available at law or equity,
the following remedies:

               (i)  The right to withhold all or part of any
remaining payments until such breach is cured to COORS'
reasonable satisfaction (provided, however, if SUPPLIER has not

     15.1 Authority.

     Each Party warrants that it has the full authority and power
to enter into and perform under this Agreement and to make all
representations, warranties and grants as set forth herein.  Each
Party represents that it is not subject to any restrictive
obligations imposed by former clients or any other person that

other suppliers.

warranties by SUPPLIER and any undischarged obligations of COORS
arising prior to the termination of this Agreement (whether by
expiration or earlier termination) shall survive such expiration.

     15.3 Enforceability.

     Either Party's failure in any one or more instances to
insist upon strict performance of any of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement or to exercise any right herein conferred shall
not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of that right or
of that Party's right to assert or rely upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  Any express waiver of a term of
this Agreement shall not be binding and effective unless made in
writing and properly executed by the waiving Party.

     15.4 Amendments.

     This Agreement, including Exhibits, may not be amended
except in writing properly executed by both Parties.  Except as
specifically amended, this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect as written.

     15.5 Assignment.

     SUPPLIER shall not have the right or power to assign its
rights or delegate its obligations hereunder without the express
written consent of COORS, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  Any attempt to do so without such consent shall be
null and void and SUPPLIER will be in breach of this Agreement

properly assigned, the provisions of this Agreement shall bind
and benefit the Parties hereto and their representatives,
successors and assigns.

     15.6 Severability.

remain in full force and effect.

     15.7 Complete Agreement.

     This Agreement, and all exhibits thereto, constitute the
complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties.  It

the operations of SUPPLIER during the course of any such
inspections or tests.  All Products shall be received subject to
final inspection by COORS within a commercially reasonable time.
The inspection, testing, approval or acceptance by COORS of any
Products provided hereunder shall not relieve SUPPLIER of its
obligations or warranties with respect thereto.

original and constitute one and the same document.  The signature

obligations hereunder.

                            EXHIBIT G
                       (FORECAST ACCURACY)

Volume forecast by SKU will be provided to SUPPLIER per Section
3.4 of this Agreement.  Forecast accuracy will be measured by
calculating the per cent accuracy of SUPPLIER'S actual shipments
from all of its facilities versus COORS' most current forecast
* * * out from the ship date.  * * *

Measurement Methodology:

  1. Each Week SUPPLIER will update a spreadsheet with the latest
     COORS 12 week forecast data.  This spreadsheet is reviewed
     in the weekly meeting per Section 3.4 of this Agreement.

  2. After each week's shipments SUPPLIER will present what was
     shipped to what was required by COORS based on the forecast
     supplied in Section 3.4.  This will be done in four time
     horizons - one week out, two weeks out, three weeks out, and
     four week out.  The forecast will be shifted appropriately
     to adjust for the transit time from SUPPLIER'S facilities to
     COORS.

  3. The total volume by high and low quantity for each item
     (absolute value) will be added together and divided by the
     total quantity shipped.  This output will be the weighted
     per cent error in the overall forecast.

  4. Forecast Accuracy will be the difference between 100%
     accuracy and the per cent error calculated in Step 3.

  5. Each of these weekly measurements will be weighted by weekly
     volume to calculate the overall accuracy for longer periods,
     ie monthly, quarterly, and annually.

EXAMPLE:

Item      Forecast Two Weeks Out   Actual Shipped      Difference

One            80                          90             10
Two            50                          0              50
Three          100                         100
_________________________________________________________________
Total          230                         190            60

Forecast Error % = 60/190 = 31.6%
Forecast Accuracy % =  1-31.6% = 68.4%

                      (GUIDING PRINCIPLES)

PARTNERSHIP REVIEWS

Review meetings are a critical part of maintaining and improving
the partnership.  Senior executives should meet at least two
times each year to review the state of the partnership and
provide guidance and feedback to the business teams.  The
business teams should meet at least once every quarter to review
the state of the partnership.  Minutes from each meeting of the
business teams are to be distributed to the executives.

PRINCIPLES

Three categories of partnership principles have been identified
as a result of cross-functional, cross-company discussions:
Shared priorities, COORS priorities, and SUPPLIER priorities.
Four opportunities have been identified in each category.  These
opportunities are intended to help support the visions of the
Parties, which for SUPPLIER is to be the undisputed leader in
paperboard packaging and to enable their customer's success in
consumer goods market differentiation through innovative
packaging.  COORS' vision is to win in the beer business and
delight each new generation of beer drinkers.  Projects should be
established by the Parties to resolve key issues within each
category during the term of this Agreement.  Ideal projects will
include a quick, mutually-beneficial business win, and not just
outline a process for that area.

Shared Priorities
       Communication -foster an open/sharing and accountable
     relationship.  Examples include understanding objectives and
     motivations of each Party, avoiding surprises and issues,
     and more formalized methods of communication.
       Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities - each Party should
     be aware of key contacts, responsibilities as they relate to
     this Agreement, and approval authority.
       Gain Sharing/Cost Savings - each Party is committed to the
     gain sharing program as described in this Agreement.  The
     goalof the program is * * * in projects implemented each year.
       Relationship - each Party brings to the relationship certain
     unique capabilities and talents.  The Parties endeavor to take
     advantage of these unique traits in a positive manner to
     increase value and lower costs.

Coors Priorities
       Quality - Coors is entrusting SUPPLIER with a "Primary"
     supply position.  Therefore, it is critical that materials
     meet and exceed the quality expectations of internal and
     external customers.  SUPPLIER must consistently deliver
     Silver or Gold performance.
       Continuity of Supply - Another requirement of a "Primary"
     supply position is reliability of supply.  COORS and SUPPLIER
     will work together to ensure reliability of on-time
     deliveries, and put effective contingency and growth plans
     in place.

       Minority Spend - COORS believes that success depends on
     growing our share of the minority market and spending on
     minority suppliers will help enable that goal.  SUPPLIER is
     committed to achieving the minority spend goals outlined in
     this Agreement.  COORS believes these goals can be achieved
     without adversely affecting cost or quality.
       Value - In order to win in the beer business, COORS
     constantly needs to evaluate the value of and increase the
     impact of its packaging materials.  SUPPLIER and COORS need
     to continue to work toward solutions that provide a competi-
     tive advantage in the marketplace.

SUPPLIER Priorities
       Innovation - SUPPLIER's beverage strategy relies on being an
     innovator in the marketplace.  SUPPLIER and COORS need to work
     together to efficiently foster an innovative environment.
     COORS can help by setting more clear expectations and
     providing more timely feedback.  One major forum per year
     dedicated to innovation will be held.
       Data-based Decisions - SUPPLIER believes the partnership can
     be improved with more data-based decision making.  One example
     is Six Sigma.   COORS can help by supporting and participating
     in SUPPLIER's data gathering and analysis activities.  Another
     example is performance-based specifications.  If the Parties
     better understood the parameters required, the result would be
     better designs and faster qualifications.
       Forecast Accuracy - COORS is committed to working with
     SUPPLIER to improve forecast accuracy.
       Speed to Market - SUPPLIER is interested in increasing the
     speed at which new projects are developed and implemented.
     COORS needs to work to improve speed to market with SUPPLIER.
