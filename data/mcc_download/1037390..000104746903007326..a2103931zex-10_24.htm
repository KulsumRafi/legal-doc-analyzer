to be coupled with an interest. Each insurance company issuing any such policy is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed to make payment for any such loss (whether or not Mortgagee exercises its

Mortgagor's name on any instrument in payment of such proceeds, which appointment shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest. Such insurance proceeds received by Mortgagee shall not be commingled

adjustment or compromise of such loss or in the collection or handling of such funds (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees), Mortgagee may apply the net proceeds, in such manner as Mortgagee
may determine, either toward restoring the Mortgaged Property or to the reduction of the Indebtedness, whether then matured or to mature in the future. Alternatively, at the option of Mortgagee,
Mortgagee may pay over to Mortgagor all or any part of such net proceeds for the purpose of repairing the Improvements, building new Improvements in their place, or for any other purpose or object
satisfactory to Mortgagee, without affecting the lien of this Mortgage as security for the full Indebtedness secured hereby before such payment to Mortgagor took place. Notwithstanding any such loss,
Mortgagor shall continue to pay interest, at the applicable rate and at the times provided in the Note, on the entire outstanding principal amount of the Indebtedness. Although Mortgagee intends to
use reasonable efforts to collect such proceeds in a timely fashion, Mortgagee shall not be responsible for any failure to collect any proceeds due under the terms of any policy, regardless of the
cause of such failure. </FONT></P>

re-leased in accordance with an Approved Lease (the "LTP Reserve Account"), both as more particularly defined in that certain Reserve Account Agreement entered into by Mortgagor and
Mortgagee and dated of even date herewith (the "Reserve Account Agreement"). On or before January&nbsp;1, 2003, and on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, Mortgagor shall deposit into
the TI Reserve Account an amount equal to $16,666.67 (the "Monthly Deposit"), until such time as the balance of the Reserve Account reaches $500,000.00 (the "Aggregate Maximum Balance"), after which

Balance has been funded hereunder, if at any time thereafter during the term of the Loan the balance of the TI Reserve Account falls below the Aggregate Maximum Balance, Mortgagor shall be required to
resume making Monthly Deposits until the TI Reserve Account balance is restored to the Aggregate Maximum Balance. Any lease termination payment received by or on behalf of Mortgagor shall be deposited
into the LTP Reserve Account. No deposit into either the TI Reserve Account nor the LTP Reserve Account pursuant to this section shall be deemed or construed to be a payment on account of the
Indebtedness. All funds deposited into the TI Reserve Account and the LTP Reserve Account from time to time, together with all interest earned on such funds as provided herein, are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "Reserve Account Funds". All Reserve Account Funds are hereby pledged to Mortgagee as additional collateral for the Loan and shall be released by Mortgagee upon
Mortgagor's request in connection with tenant improvements and commission expenses associated with leases approved by Mortgagee, as defined below. Any Event of Default under the terms of the Reserve
Account Agreement shall be considered </FONT></P>
