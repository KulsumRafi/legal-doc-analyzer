other date as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation. The
Corporation shall collect any required withholding from &#147;other earnings&#148; of the

Further, the Corporation may adopt other compensation programs, plans or
arrangements as it deems appropriate or necessary. The Committee may permit a
Participant to defer such Participant&#146;s receipt of the payment of cash or the
delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of
the exercise of an Option or SAR, or the satisfaction of conditions, lapse or
