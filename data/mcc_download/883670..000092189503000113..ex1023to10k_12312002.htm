            SECTION 3.1  ELIGIBILITY.  The Plan is unfunded and is maintained by
the Company for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. In
order to be eligible to participate in the Plan, an employee must be selected by
the Compensation Committee. In determining the employees who will participate in
the Plan,  the  Compensation  Committee  may take into account the nature of the
services  rendered by the  respective  employees,  their  present and  potential
contributions  to the  success  of the  Company  and such  other  factors as the
Compensation  Committee,  in  its  sole  and  absolute  discretion,  shall  deem
relevant. Employees of subsidiaries or affiliated corporations shall be eligible
to  participate  in  the  Plan  provided  that  such  subsidiary  or  affiliated
corporation,  by action of its Board of  Directors  and with the approval of the
Compensation  Committee,  agrees  to adopt  the  provisions  of the Plan for the
benefit of its eligible Employees.

            SECTION  3.2   PARTICIPATION.   The  Compensation   Committee  shall
determine the employees who will participate in the Plan, the amount of Deferred
Compensation,  the time or times when the employees will defer Compensation, the

deferrals  are intended to be made,  and all other terms and  conditions of each
deferral.

            SECTION 3.3 DEFERRED COMPENSATION  AGREEMENT.  Any employee selected
for  participation  by the  Compensation  Committee  shall,  as a  condition  of

longer traded,  the fair market value of any Company stock deferred  pursuant to
the Plan will be determined as of the last Valuation Day the stock was traded.

            The  Administrator  shall  provide  the  Participant  with  periodic

            SECTION  4.1  VESTING.  A  Participant's  interest  in the  Deferred
Compensation  shall be  non-forfeitable.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  even
though a Participant's interests in this Plan shall be non-forfeitable, he shall
still remain a general creditor of the Corporation with respect to such deferral
and  shall  not have  any  security  or other  interests  in any  assets  of the
Corporation,  or any other  Employer,  due to or arising  from the fact that the
Deferred Compensation is non-forfeitable.

            SECTION 4.2 DISTRIBUTION. Each Deferred Compensation Agreement shall
include  provisions  governing the  distribution  of the Deferred  Compensation.
Distributions of  non-forfeitable  amounts  reserved for a Participant  shall be
made no later than 30 days after the  Participant's  termination of service with
Company (or any Affiliate of the Company) for any reason.

            The value of the  Participant's  non-forfeitable  account under this
Plan shall be determined as set forth in the Deferred Compensation Agreement.

            SECTION 4.3 FORM OF DISTRIBUTION. Distributions shall be made in the
form of cash or Company stock.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
contrary,  the Company  shall have no  obligation  or  liability  to deliver any
Shares under the Plan unless such delivery would comply with all applicable laws
and all applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.

            SECTION  4.4  METHOD  OF  PAYMENT.   At  the  time  a  Participant's
non-forfeitable account is to be distributed in accordance with Section 4.2, the
Administrator  shall  determine the value of the  Participant's  non-forfeitable
account balance. The Administrator shall direct distribution of the value of the
Participant's   non-forfeitable   balance  in   accordance   with  the  Deferred
Compensation Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V.

            SECTION 5.1 DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. A Participant, by filing the
prescribed form with the Administrator  may designate one or more  Beneficiaries
and  successor  Beneficiaries  to whom shall be  distributed  the  Participant's
Deferred  Compensation  in accordance with the terms of the Plan in the event of
the  Participant's  death.  In the  event the  Participant  does not file a form
designating one or more Beneficiaries, or no designated Beneficiary survives the
Participant, the Deferred Compensation shall be distributed to the individual to
whom such right passes by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

the federal  income tax  withholding  provisions  of the Code,  by an applicable
state's  income tax act, or by an applicable  city,  county,  or  municipality's
earnings or income tax act, the interests of Participants  and their  designated
Beneficiaries  under this Plan are not subject to claims of their  creditors and
may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold, transferred,  alienated, assigned,
pledged, hypothecated,  anticipated or encumbered. Any attempt by a Participant,
his  beneficiary,  or any other  person or entity to sell,  transfer,  alienate,
assign, pledge,  anticipate,  encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right
to benefits  payable  hereunder shall be void. The Company may cancel and refuse
to pay any portion of a benefit that is sold, transferred,  alienated, assigned,
pledged, anticipated or encumbered.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

            SECTION 7.1  AMENDMENTS TO AND  TERMINATION  OF PLAN.  Except to the
extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise  expressly  provided in
the Plan or a Deferred Compensation  Agreement,  the Administrator,  in its sole
discretion,  may amend,  alter,  suspend,  discontinue  or  terminate  the Plan;
provided,  however,  that notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any
Deferred  Compensation  Agreement,  no such amendment,  alteration,  suspension,
discontinuation or termination shall impair the rights of any Participant.

            SECTION 7.2  CORRECTION OF DEFECTS,  OMISSIONS AND  INCONSISTENCIES.
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly
provided in the Plan or a Deferred Compensation Agreement, the Administrator may

Plan or any Deferred  Compensation  Agreement in the manner and to the extent it

to terminate,  with or without  cause,  the  Participant's  employment  with the
Company or any Affiliate at any time. Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor
the entering into the Deferred Compensation Agreement hereunder,  shall give any
Participant  (a) any rights to remain  employed by the Company or any Affiliate;
(b) any  benefits  not  specifically  provided  for  herein  or in any  Deferred

                                       6

Deferred  Compensation  Agreement  is or  becomes  or is deemed  to be  invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any

Administrator, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to
applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended  without,  in
the  determination  of the  Administrator,  materially  altering  the purpose or
intent of the Plan or the Deferred Compensation Agreement,  such provision shall
be stricken as to such jurisdiction,  and the remainder of the Plan and any such
Deferred Compensation Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

            SECTION  8.9  INTENT.  The  Plan  is  intended  to be  unfunded  and
maintained  by the  Company  solely  to  provide  choices  to a select  group of

Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") as  interpreted by the U.S.  Department of Labor.
The Plan is not intended to be a plan described in Sections 401(a) or 457 of the
Code.  The  obligation of the Company under this Plan  constitutes  nothing more
than an  unsecured  promise of the Company to fulfill such  obligations  and any
property  of the  Company  that may be set aside to permit  it to  fulfill  such
obligations  under the Plan shall,  in the event of the Company's  bankruptcy or

regulations of any governmental  authority which may be applicable thereto; and,
notwithstanding  any  provision  of  the  Plan  or  any  Deferred   Compensation
Agreement,  Participants  shall not be  entitled  to receive  the benefit of any
Deferred Compensation Agreement,  and the Company and any Affiliate shall not be
obligated to pay any such benefits to a Participant,  if such receipt or payment
of benefits  would  constitute a violation by the  Participant or the Company or
any Affiliate of any provision of any such law or regulation.

            SECTION  8.11  HEADINGS.  Headings  are  given to the  Articles  and
Sections of the Plan  solely as a  convenience  to  facilitate  reference.  Such
headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction
or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
