June 20, 2002, made by and among Manufacturers' Services Limited, a Delaware
corporation (the "PARENT"), Manufacturers' Services Salt Lake City Operations,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MSSLCO"), Manufacturers' Services Western U.S.

Inc. (or one or more of its affiliates), for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $600,000 (the "LEXMARK LEASE BUYOUT").
