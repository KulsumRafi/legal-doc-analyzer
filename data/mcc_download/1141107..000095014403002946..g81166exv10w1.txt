correct and complete:


                  A.       CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. Holdings and each

                  C.       NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by Holdings
and Borrowers of this Amendment and the performance by Holdings and Borrowers of
the Amended Agreement do not and will not (i) violate any provision of any law

governmental authority or regulatory body.

                  E.       BINDING OBLIGATION. This Amendment and the Amended
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by Holdings and each Borrower

the Credit Agreement are and will be true, correct and complete in all material
respects on and as of the Eighth Amendment Effective Date to the same extent as

and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they were
true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of such earlier
date.


                  G.       ABSENCE OF DEFAULT. No event has occurred and is
continuing or will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated

                  A.       REFERENCE TO AND EFFECT ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND

                  (iii)    The execution, delivery and performance of this
