any of the following events occurs at any time hereafter prior to the full exercise of this Warrant, then the Exercise Price and/or the number of Warrant Shares remaining to be
purchased hereunder immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted as described below: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

Class&nbsp;T Common Stock to be redeemed or repurchased) redemption or repurchase of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class&nbsp;T Common Stock and if either (i)&nbsp;the Federal
Communications Commission (or other governmental entity that replaces it) issues a ruling, the effect of which permits the Holder to receive on a current basis a payment as if the Warrant Shares
remaining to be purchased hereunder were outstanding or (ii)&nbsp;the Company obtains an unqualified opinion from counsel specializing in federal communications law, reasonably acceptable to the
Holder, that the Holder may
receive on a current basis a payment as if the Warrant Shares remaining to be purchased hereunder were outstanding, then the Holder can elect that the number of Warrant Shares remaining to be
purchased hereunder shall be decreased by a percentage equal to the percentage of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class&nbsp;T Common Stock so redeemed or repurchased and upon the date of such
redemption or repurchase, the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount equal to the number of shares by which the Warrant has been decreased multiplied by the difference, if any, between the
redemption or repurchase price and the Exercise Price for such shares (adjusted proportionately in accordance with Section&nbsp;4.2). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Stock Subdivisions, Stock Dividends or Stock Consolidations</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. If at any time the outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock, Class&nbsp;P Common Stock, Class&nbsp;T Common Stock, and Class&nbsp;V Common Stock are subdivided into a greater number of shares, whether by stock split, stock dividend or
otherwise, then the Exercise Price will be reduced proportionately and the number of Warrant Shares remaining to be purchased hereunder will be increased proportionately. Conversely, if at any time
the outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, Class&nbsp;P Common Stock, Class&nbsp;T Common Stock, and Class&nbsp;V Common Stock are consolidated into a smaller number of shares, then
the Exercise Price will be increased proportionately and the number of Warrant Shares remaining to be purchased hereunder will be reduced proportionately. Each adjustment to the Exercise Price and the
number of Warrant Shares shall be effective on the record date, or if there is no record date, the effective date for such subdivision or consolidation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

another corporation or other entity or (ii)&nbsp;merge with another corporation or other entity and be the surviving corporation in such merger, and in connection therewith all or part of the
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for securities of any other entity or cash or other property, the Holder of this Warrant will thereafter receive, upon the exercise
hereof in accordance with the terms hereof, the securities, cash or other property to which the holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant would
have received upon such consolidation or merger, and the Company shall take such steps in connection with such consolidation or merger as may be necessary to assure that the provisions thereof shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant. The Company or the successor corporation,
as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Holder a supplemental Warrant so providing. A sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company for a consideration (apart from the
assumption of obligations) consisting primarily of securities shall be deemed a consolidation or merger for the foregoing purposes. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;4.3 similarly shall apply to
successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other transfers. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Company and the Holder each irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
California State or United States Federal court sitting in Los Angeles County in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
irrevocably agrees that any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in such California State or Federal court. Each of the parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Each of the parties irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System (the "Process Agent"), with
an office on the date hereof at 818 West 7th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017 as its agent to receive on behalf of it and its property service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process
which may be served in any such action or proceeding. Such service may be made by delivering a copy of such process to any of the parties in care of the Process Agent at the Process Agent's above
address, and each of the parties irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf. As an alternate method of service, each of the parties consents to the
service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding by the mailing or delivering of a copy of such process to such party at its
address specified in or pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.3. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. </FONT></P>
