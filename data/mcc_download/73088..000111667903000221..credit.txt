shall  be  secured  by the  issuance  of  certain  first  mortgage  bonds to and
registered in the name of the  Collateral  Agent for the ratable  benefit of the
Lenders (it being understood that payments on the Loans shall be deemed payments
on such first  mortgage bonds and payments on such first mortgage bonds shall be
applied  to the  payment  of the  Loans).  Prior to the  issuance  of such first
mortgage bonds, the Loans shall be secured by the proceeds of the Loans.

        2.1  Commitments  and Loans Subject to the terms and  conditions  hereof
(including,  without limitation,  the conditions precedent set forth in Sections
4.1 and 4.2  hereof),  each Lender  severally  agrees to make a term loan to the
Borrower in a principal  amount not to exceed such  Lender's  Commitment  on the
Funding Date which shall be a Business Day during the Availability  Period.  The
Loans (i) at the option of the Borrower may be incurred  and  maintained  as, or
converted into, Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans in accordance with
the provisions hereof and (ii) shall be repaid in accordance with the provisions
hereof, but once repaid, may not be reborrowed.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative  Agent may  designate  any Business  Day during the  Availability
Period (but in any event on or prior to the Cash Collateral Release Date) as the
Funding Date. In connection with such designation,  the Required Lenders may, in
their sole discretion,  waive  conditions  precedent set forth in Section 4.2 to
the extent not then satisfied.

        2.2  Evidence of  Indebtedness(a)  . (a) Each Lender  shall  maintain in
accordance   with  its  usual   practice  an  account  or  accounts   evidencing
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from the Loan made by such
Lender,  including,  without  limitation,  the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.  (b) The
Administrative  Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 9.6(d) and
a subaccount  therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount
of the Loan made by each Lender through the Administrative Agent hereunder,  the
type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and  (iii)  both the  amount of any sum  received  by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

        (c) The entries  made in the  Register  and the  accounts of each Lender
maintained  pursuant  to  Section  9.6(d)  shall,  to the  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law, be prima  facie  evidence  of the  existence  and amount of the
obligations  of the  Borrower  therein  recorded;  provided,  however,  that the
failure of any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent to maintain  the Register or
any such  account,  or any error  therein,  shall not in any  manner  affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans



                                       22
<PAGE>



actually  made to the  Borrower by such Lender in  accordance  with the terms of
this Agreement.

        2.3  Procedure  for  Borrowing.  As a condition  precedent  to borrowing
hereunder,  the  Borrower  shall give the  Administrative  Agent an  irrevocable
notice  substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 on or prior to the Funding Date
(which notice must be received by the Administrative  Agent prior to 10:00 a.m.,
New  York  City  time  on the  Funding  Date),  specifying  (1)  that a Loan  is
requested,  (2) the aggregate amount to be borrowed,  (3) the requested  Funding
Date,  (4) whether the borrowing is to be of Eurodollar  Loans,  Alternate  Base
Rate Loans or a combination  thereof,  (5) if the borrowing is to be entirely or
partly of Eurodollar Loans, the amounts of such Eurodollar Loans and the lengths
of the initial  Interest Periods therefor and (6) the number and the location of
the  account to which the  proceeds  are to be  disbursed  (consistent  with the
provisions of hereof).  Upon receipt of any such notice from the  Borrower,  the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each Lender will
make  the  amount  of its pro  rata  share of each  borrowing  available  to the
Administrative  Agent  for the  account  of the  Borrower  at the  office of the
Administrative Agent specified in Section 9.2 prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the date  requested by the Borrower in funds  immediately  available to
the  Administrative  Agent.  Such  borrowing  will then be made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative  Agent in the manner specified by the Borrower in
such Notice of Borrowing in the  aggregate of the amounts made  available to the
Administrative  Agent  by the  Lenders  and in like  funds  as  received  by the
Administrative  Agent.  If the Borrower  fails to indicate the initial  Interest
Periods in such notice, the Interest Period shall be one month.

account of CSFB or the Administrative Agent, as applicable as set forth therein,

be paid on the dates due, in immediately  available funds, to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the parties  entitled  thereto.  Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

        2.5 Repayment of Loans(a).  Commencing on March 31, 2003 and on the last
Business Day of March,  June,  September  and December  thereafter  prior to the
Maturity  Date,  the Borrower  shall make  quarterly  principal  payments on the
Loans,  each quarterly  payment in an amount equal to one quarter of one percent
(0.25%) of the original  aggregate  principal  amount of the Loans. The Borrower
shall repay the then outstanding  aggregate principal amount of the Loans on the
Maturity  Date,  together with accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon as provided
herein. Any prepayments of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.6 shall be applied in
inverse  chronological  order to the  principal  amounts  due  pursuant  to this
Section.

        2.6  Optional  and  Mandatory   Prepayments.   (a)  Optional   Offer  of
Prepayment.   The  Borrower   may,   upon  written   notice   delivered  to  the
Administrative  Agent at least 10 days (but not more than 30 days)  prior to the

prepayment,  the aggregate  principal  amount of the Loans to be prepaid and the
proposed prepayment price thereof),



                                       23
<PAGE>



offer to  prepay  the  outstanding  principal  amounts  of the Loans in whole or
ratably in part,  together with accrued  interest to the date of such prepayment
on the principal  amount  prepaid;  provided,  however,  that no Lender shall be
obligated to accept such offer; and provided further that the Borrower shall not
be permitted to make an offer to purchase  more than once during any three month
period.  Any Lender may in its discretion accept such offer by written notice to
the  Administrative  Agent (which notice shall also state the maximum  principal
amount of  prepayment  such Lender is willing to  accept).  To the extent one or
more Lenders  accepts any such offer and one or more Lenders rejects such offer,
the amounts that would have been allocable to the rejecting  Lenders may (if and
to the extent accepted by the accepting Lenders) be paid to accepting Lenders in
accordance with their Commitment Percentages.  Any Lender that shall have failed
to respond to an offer  described in this Section 2.6(a) shall be deemed to have
rejected  such offer.  If any Lender shall have rejected (or been deemed to have
rejected) any offer to prepay  described above and the Borrower shall thereafter
vary the offer,  the  Borrower  shall make the modified  offer  available to all
Lenders  for a  period  of at  least  three  Business  Days  before  making  the
contemplated prepayment. Except as provided in this Section 2.6(a), the Borrower
shall not have the right to prepay the Loans.

        (b) [Intentionally Omitted]

        (c)  Mandatory  Offer  of  Prepayment.  If  the  Borrower  or any of its
Subsidiaries  shall at any  time,  or from time to time,  after the date  hereof
receive Net Cash Proceeds in respect of any Reduction Event which,  individually
or in the  aggregate  for  all  prior  Reduction  Events  not the  subject  of a
mandatory offer of prepayment,  exceeds $10,000,000, then, on the first Business
Day  immediately  succeeding  the date of such  receipt,  such Net Cash Proceeds
shall be applied to the  prepayment of any Loans then  outstanding to the extent
and in the manner as provided  below in this  Section  2.6(c).  At least 10 days
(but not more than 30 days) prior to any proposed  Reduction Event, the Borrower
shall give written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent stating the date of the
proposed  Reduction  Event  together with a certificate  signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower  setting forth in reasonable  detail the  calculation of
the Net Cash  Proceeds  therefrom  and  shall  offer to prepay  the  outstanding
principal  amounts  of the Loans  comprising  part of the same  borrowing  in an
amount  equal  to,  in the  case of an Asset  Disposition,  100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds  therefrom or, in the case of an Equity  Issuance,  50% of the Net Cash
Proceeds therefrom, as applicable, together with accrued interest to the date of
such prepayment on the principal  amount  prepaid;  provided,  however,  that no
Lender shall be obligated to accept such offer. Any Lender may in its discretion
accept such offer by written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent (which notice
shall also state the  maximum  principal  amount of  prepayment  such  Lender is
willing to accept). To the extent one or more Lenders accepts any such offer and
one or more  Lenders  rejects  such  offer,  the  amounts  that  would have been
allocable  to the  rejecting  Lenders may (if and to the extent  accepted by the
accepting  Lenders)  be paid to  accepting  Lenders  in  accordance  with  their
Commitment Percentages. Any Lender that shall have failed to respond to an offer
described in this Section 2.6(c) shall be deemed to have rejected such offer. If
for any reason the proposed Reduction Event is delayed by more than 15 days, the
Borrower shall resend the notice and offer provided for in this Section 2.6(b).



                                       24

        (d) Mandatory  Prepayment.  If the Cash Collateral  Release Date has not
occurred on or prior to February 10,  2003,  then the Loans shall become due and
payable in full on February 11, 2003 and the Borrower  shall prepay the Loans on
such date,  together with a prepayment fee equal to one percent (1%) thereof (or
if no Loans are then outstanding,  the Commitments (and the Lenders' obligations
hereunder to extend any credit) shall terminate in full).

        (e)  Additional  Amounts.  Each  prepayment  of Loans  pursuant  to this
Section  2.6 shall be  accompanied  by payment in full of all  accrued  interest
thereon,  to and  including  the  date of such  prepayment,  together  with  any
additional  amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 and any outstanding  fees and
expenses due and owing with respect to the amount prepaid.

        2.7  Interest  Rate  Conversion  and  Continuation  Options(a) . (a) The
Borrower  may elect from time to time to convert  Eurodollar  Loans to Alternate
Base Rate Loans by giving the  Administrative  Agent prior irrevocable notice of
such  election  substantially  in the form of Exhibit B-2 (a "Notice of Interest
Rate Conversion") (which notice must be received by the Administrative  Agent by
at least  10:00  a.m.,  New York City  time,  two  Business  Days  prior to such
election);  provided that any such  conversion  of Eurodollar  Loans may be made
only on the last day of an Interest  Period with respect  thereto.  The Borrower
may elect from time to time to convert  Alternate  Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Loans by  giving  the  Administrative  Agent  prior  irrevocable  notice of such
election (which notice must be received by the Administrative  Agent by at least
10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to such election). Any
such Notice of Interest Rate  Conversion  to Eurodollar  Loans shall specify the
length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt
of any such notice, the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
thereof. All or any part of the outstanding  Eurodollar Loans and Alternate Base
Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein; provided that (i) no Loan may be
converted  into  a  Eurodollar  Loan  when  any  Default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  (ii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan after the date
that is one month prior to the Maturity Date and (iii) such conversion  shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

        (b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of
the then current  Interest  Period with respect  thereto by the Borrower  giving
notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 of the length of the next
Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans;  provided that (i) no Eurodollar
Loan may be continued  as such when any Default has  occurred and is  continuing
and (ii) no  Eurodollar  Loan which is a Loan may be  continued  as a Eurodollar
Loan  after the date that is one month  prior to the  Maturity  Date;  provided,
further,  that if the  Borrower  shall  fail  to give  any  required  notice  as
described  above in this  paragraph,  or if such  continuation  is not permitted
pursuant to the preceding proviso,  such Loans shall be automatically  converted
to  Alternate  Base Rate  Loans on the last day of such then  expiring  Interest
Period. The  Administrative  Agent agrees to notify the Lenders of any notice of
continuation referred to herein received by the Administrative Agent.



                                       25
<PAGE>



        2.8 Maximum Amounts of Eurodollar Tranches. All borrowings,  conversions
and  continuations  of Loans  hereunder and all  selections of Interest  Periods
hereunder  shall be in such amounts and shall be made pursuant to such elections
so that,  after giving effect  thereto,  the aggregate  principal  amount of the
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple  of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof.  There shall not be more than five
Eurodollar Tranches at any one time outstanding.

        2.9 Interest Rates;  Default Rate Payment Dates(a) . (a) Each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest for each day during each  Interest  Period with respect
thereto at a rate per annum  equal to the  Eurodollar  Rate  determined  for the
first  day of such  Interest  Period  (subject  to  daily  adjustments,  if any,
required by changes in the Eurodollar Reserve Requirements) plus 5.75%.

        (b) Each  Alternate  Base Rate Loan  shall bear  interest  at a rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 4.75%.

        (c) If an Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the Loans
shall bear  interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate that would  otherwise
be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing  provisions of this Section plus
2% from the date of  occurrence  of such  Event of  Default  until the date such
Event of  Default  is cured or waived  (after as well as  before  judgment).  In
addition,  should any interest on such Loans or any fees or other amount  (other
than  principal)  payable  hereunder not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest
(to the extent  permitted  by law in the case of interest on interest) at a rate
per annum as  determined  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence  which  would be
applicable to an Alternate  Base Rate Loan, in each case,  from the date of such
non-payment  until  such  amount  is  paid  in full  (after  as  well as  before
judgment).

        (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest  Payment Date;
provided that interest accruing pursuant to Section 2.9(c) shall be payable from
time to time on demand.

        2.10  Computation  of Interest(a) . (a) The Alternate Base Rate interest
(when  calculated based upon the prime rate) shall be calculated on the basis of
a 365/366 day year and all other  interest shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon
as practicable  notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each  determination  of a
Eurodollar  Rate.  Any change in the interest  rate on a Loan  resulting  from a
change in the Alternate Base Rate or the Eurodollar  Reserve  Requirements shall
become  effective  as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
becomes  effective.  The  Administrative  Agent shall,  as soon as  practicable,
notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each
such change in interest rate.

        (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to any provision of this  Agreement  shall be conclusive and binding on
the   Borrower  and  the  Lenders  in  the  absence  of  manifest   error.   The
Administrative Agent, at



                                       26
<PAGE>



the request of the Borrower,  shall deliver to the Borrower a statement  showing
the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to Section 2.10(a).

        2.11 Inability to Determine  Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of
any Interest Period:

        (a) the  Administrative  Agent shall have reasonably  determined  (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason
of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or

        (b) the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  received  notice  from  the
Required  Lenders that the  Eurodollar  Rate  determined or to be determined for
such Interest  Period will not  adequately  and fairly  reflect the cost to such
Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining its
affected Loans during such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the
Borrower and the Lenders as soon as  practicable  thereafter.  If such notice is
given,  (x) any Eurodollar  Loans  requested to be made on the first day of such
Interest  Period shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans,  (y) any Loans that
were to  have  been  converted  on the  first  day of such  Interest  Period  to
Eurodollar  Loans shall be continued  as  Alternate  Base Rate Loans and (z) any
outstanding  Eurodollar  Loans  shall be  converted,  on the  first  day of such
Interest  Period,  to  Alternate  Base Rate  Loans.  Until such  notice has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made
or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Alternate
Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

        2.12 Pro Rata  Treatment  and  Payments;  Funding  Reliance(a) . (a) The
borrowing by the Borrower of Loans from the Lenders  hereunder and any reduction
of the  Commitments  of the  Lenders  shall be made pro  rata  according  to the
respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders.  Except as provided in Section
2.6,  each payment  (including  each  prepayment)  by the Borrower on account of
principal of and  interest on the Loans of any one Type shall  (except as may be
required  as a  result  of  Section  2.16) be made  pro  rata  according  to the
respective  outstanding principal amounts of the Loans of such Type then held by
the Lenders.  All payments  (including  prepayments)  to be made by the Borrower
hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal,  interest,  fees
or otherwise,  shall be made without  setoff or  counterclaim  and shall be made
prior to 12:00  noon,  New  York  City  time,  on the due  date  thereof  to the
Administrative  Agent,  for the account of the  Lenders,  at the  Administrative
Agent's office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available
funds.  The  Administrative  Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders
promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other
than payments on the  Eurodollar  Loans)  becomes due and payable on a day other
than a Business  Day,  such  payment  shall be extended  to the next  succeeding
Business Day,  and, with respect to payments of principal and interest  thereon,
shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.



                                       27

        (b) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have been notified in writing
by any Lender prior to a borrowing  that such Lender will not make  available to
the  Administrative  Agent the  amount  that  would  constitute  its  Commitment
Percentage  of such  borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such
Lender is making such amount  available  to the  Administrative  Agent,  and the
Administrative  Agent may, in reliance upon such  assumption,  make available to
the Borrower a  corresponding  amount.  If the  Administrative  Agent makes such
amount available to the Borrower and if such amount is not made available to the
Administrative  Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor,  such
Lender  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent,  on demand,  such  amount  with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Rate for the
period  until  such  Lender  makes  such  amount  immediately  available  to the
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts  owing under this Section shall be conclusive
in the  absence  of  manifest  error.  If such  Lender  pays such  amount to the
Administrative  Agent,  then such amount shall  constitute  such  Lender's  Loan
included in such  borrowing.  If such  Lender's  Commitment  Percentage  of such
borrowing  is not made  available  to the  Administrative  Agent by such  Lender
within three Business Days of such  Borrowing  Date,  the  Administrative  Agent
shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest  thereon at the rate
per annum applicable to the applicable Loan, on demand,  from the Borrower.  The
obligations  of the  Lenders  hereunder  are  several  and no  Lender  shall  be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required hereunder.

        2.13  Illegality.  Notwithstanding  any other provision  herein,  if the
adoption of or any change in any  Requirement of Law after the date hereof or in
the interpretation or application  thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement,  (a) the
commitment  of  such  Lender  hereunder  to  make  Eurodollar  Loans,   continue
Eurodollar  Loans as such and convert  Alternate  Base Rate Loans to  Eurodollar
Loans shall forthwith be suspended until such condition shall cease to exist and
(b) such Lender's Loans then  outstanding as Eurodollar  Loans, if any, shall be
converted automatically to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the respective last days
of the then current  Interest  Periods with respect to such Loans or within such
earlier period as required by law. If any such  conversion of a Eurodollar  Loan
occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then  current  Interest  Period
with respect  thereto,  the Borrower  shall pay to such Lender such amounts,  if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.16.

        2.14  Requirements  of Law(a) . (a) If the  adoption of or any change in
any  Requirement  of Law or in the  interpretation  or  application  thereof  or
compliance  by any Lender with any request or  directive  (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority  made
subsequent to the date hereof:

               (i) shall  subject  any Lender to any tax of any kind  whatsoever
        with respect to this Agreement,  its Notes,  any Eurodollar Loan, or its
        obligation to make Eurodollar  Loans, or change the basis of taxation of
        payments to such  Lender in respect  thereof  (except  for  Non-Excluded
        Taxes  covered  by  Section  2.15 and  changes in the rate of tax on the
        overall net income of such Lender);



                                       28
<PAGE>



               (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
        deposit,  compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
        deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,  loans
        or other extensions of credit by, or any other  acquisition of funds by,
        any  office  of such  Lender  which  is not  otherwise  included  in the
        determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or

               (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount  which such  Lender  reasonably  deems to be  material,  of making,
converting into,  continuing or maintaining  Eurodollar  Loans, or to reduce any
amount  receivable  hereunder in respect  thereof,  then, in any such case,  the
Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate  such Lender for such  increased  cost or reduced amount
receivable.  If any Lender  becomes  entitled  to claim any  additional  amounts
pursuant to this  Section,  it shall  promptly  notify the Borrower  through the
Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
A certificate  as to any  additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to this Section
submitted by such Lender through the Administrative  Agent to the Borrower shall
be in writing and accompanied by calculations in reasonable detail demonstrating
the basis for such  Lender's  claim and shall be  considered  conclusive  in the
absence of manifest  error.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Obligations hereunder.

        (b) If any Lender  shall have  determined  that the  adoption  of or any
change  in  any  Requirement  of  Law  regarding  capital  adequacy  or  in  the
interpretation  or  application  thereof  or  compliance  by such  Lender or any
corporation  controlling  such Lender with any  request or  directive  regarding
capital adequacy  (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority  made  subsequent  to the date  hereof has or shall have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the  corporation's  capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender
or such  corporation  could  have  achieved  but for such  change or  compliance
(taking into  consideration  such Lender's or such  corporation's  policies with
respect to capital  adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then from time to time,  after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative  Agent) of a written request therefor  accompanied by
calculations  in  reasonable  detail  demonstrating  the basis for such Lender's
claims,  the Borrower shall pay to such Lender the additional  amount or amounts
as will compensate  such Lender for such reduction.  This covenant shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations hereunder.

        2.15  Taxes(a).  (a) Any and all payments made by the Borrower to or for
the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Agreement,  the
Notes or the other Loan  Documents  shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction  or  withholding  for or on account of, any present or future  income,
stamp or other taxes, levies,  imposts,  duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions or
withholdings,  and  all  liabilities  with  respect  thereto,  now or  hereafter
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any



                                       29
<PAGE>



Governmental Authority,  excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed
in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender
by a jurisdiction  under the Laws of which such Lender or its applicable lending
office,  or the  Administrative  Agent,  as the case  may be,  is  organized  or
maintained.  If any such non-excluded taxes, levies,  imposts,  duties, charges,
fees,  deductions,   withholdings  or  liabilities  ("Non-Excluded  Taxes")  are
required to be deducted or withheld from or in respect of any amounts payable to
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender  hereunder or under the Notes,  (i) the
amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased
to the  extent  necessary,  so that  after  making all  required  deductions  or
withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums
payable  under this  Section  2.15),  the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender
receives  an  amount  equal  to the  sum it  would  have  received  had no  such
deductions  or  withholdings  been  made,  (ii) the  Borrower  shall  make  such
deductions  or  withholdings,  and (iii) the Borrower  shall pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant  Governmental  Authority in accordance with
applicable law; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any
such  amounts  payable to any  Lender if such  Lender  fails to comply  with the
applicable  requirements  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Section.   Whenever  any
Non-Excluded  Taxes  are  payable  by the  Borrower,  as  promptly  as  possible
thereafter,  the  Borrower  shall send to the  Administrative  Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender,  as the case may be, a certified copy
of an  original  official  receipt  received  by the  Borrower  showing  payment
thereof.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and the
Administrative  Agent from the full  amount of  Non-Excluded  Taxes  (including,
without  limitation,  any such taxes imposed or asserted by any  jurisdiction on
amounts  payable under this Section 2.15) paid or incurred by such Lender or the
Administrative  Agent  (as  the  case  may  be)  and  any  liability  (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. The
covenants in this Section shall survive the  termination  of this  Agreement and
the payment of the Notes and payment of the Obligations hereunder.

        (b) Each Lender shall:

               (i) deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent (A) in
        the  case of a Lender  that is not  incorporated  under  the laws of the
        United States or any state thereof, either (x) two duly completed copies
        of United  States  Internal  Revenue  Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI,  as
        applicable,  or successor  applicable forms, as the case may be, or, (y)
        if  such  Lender  is  not  a  "bank"   within  the  meaning  of  Section
        881(c)(3)(A)  of the  Code and  intends  to claim  exemption  from  U.S.
        Federal  withholding  tax under Section  871(h) or Section 881(c) of the
        Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or
        any subsequent  versions  thereof or successors  thereto together with a
        certificate executed by such Lender representing that (1) such Lender is
        not a bank for  purposes  of  Section  881(c) of the  Code,  is not a 10
        percent shareholder  (within the meaning of Section  871(h)(3)(B) of the
        Code)  of  the  Borrower  and is not a  controlled  foreign  corporation
        related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section  864(d)(4) of the
        Code), and claiming complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax
        on payments of interest by



                                       30
<PAGE>



        the  Borrower  under  this  Agreement,  the  Notes  and the  other  Loan
        Documents  and (2) the Lender has  received in  replacement  of any Note
        held by or  assigned  to it,  a QFL  Note  in  accordance  with  Section
        2.15(c),  and (B) in the case of any other Lender,  an Internal  Revenue
        Service Form W-9, as applicable,  or successor  applicable  form, as the
        case may be;

               (ii)  deliver to the Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent two
        further copies of any such form or  certification  on or before the date
        that any such form or  certification  expires  or becomes  obsolete  and
        after the occurrence of any event  requiring a change in the most recent
        form previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and

               (iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such
        forms or  certifications  as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower
        or the Administrative Agent;

unless in any such case an event (including,  without limitation,  any change in
treaty,  law or  regulation)  has  occurred  prior to the date on which any such
delivery  would  otherwise be required which renders such form  inapplicable  or
which would prevent such Lender from duly  completing  and  delivering  any such
form  with  respect  to it and such  Lender  so  advises  the  Borrower  and the
Administrative Agent. Such Lender shall certify (i) in the case of a Form W-8BEN
or W-8ECI,  as  applicable,  that it is entitled to receive  payments under this
Agreement at a reduced rate of withholding, or without deduction or withholding,
as the case may be, of any United  States  federal  income taxes and (ii) in the
case of a Form W-9,  that it is entitled  to an  exemption  from  United  States
backup  withholding tax. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant
pursuant to Section 9.6 shall,  upon the  effectiveness of the related transfer,
be required to provide all the applicable forms and statements required pursuant
to this Section;  provided that, in the case of a Participant,  such Participant
shall furnish all such required  forms and  statements to the Lenders from which
the related participation shall have been purchased.

        (c) Any  Lender  that is not a "bank"  within  the  meaning  of  Section
881(c)(3)(A)   of  the  Code  and   satisfies   the   requirements   of  Section
2.15(b)(i)(A)(y)  (a  "Qualified  Foreign  Lender")  shall,  upon receipt of the
written  request of the  Administrative  Agent or the Borrower and may, upon its
own written request to the  Administrative  Agent,  exchange any Note held by or
assigned to it for a qualified  foreign  lender note (a "QFL Note").  A QFL Note
shall be  substantially  in the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit  A-2 and shall
contain the following legend,  "This Note is a QFL Note, and as such,  ownership
of the  obligation  represented  by such  QFL Note  may be  transferred  only in
accordance  with Section 2.15 of the Credit  Agreement."  Any QFL Note issued in
replacement  of any existing Note pursuant to this Section  2.15(c) shall be (i)
dated the Closing Date, (ii) issued in the name of the entity in whose name such
existing Note was issued and (iii) issued in the same  principal  amount as such
existing Note. Any Note replaced pursuant to this Section is sometimes  referred
to herein as a "Replaced Note".



                                       31

        (d) The  Borrower  agrees  that,  upon the  request of, or delivery of a
request  to, a  Qualified  Foreign  Lender  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c) of this
Section, it shall execute and deliver a QFL Note to the Administrative  Agent in
replacement  of the Replaced Note  surrendered  in connection  with such request
conforming to the requirements of this paragraph.  Each Qualified Foreign Lender
shall  surrender its Note in connection  with any  replacement  pursuant to this
Section 2.15. Upon receipt by the  Administrative  Agent, in connection with any
replacement, of a QFL Note and the existing Note to be replaced by such QFL Note
in accordance with this paragraph,  the  Administrative  Agent shall forward the
QFL Note to the Lender which has  surrendered  its Note for  replacement by such
QFL  Note  and  shall  forward  the  surrendered  Note  to the  Borrower  marked
"canceled".  Once issued,  QFL Notes (i) shall be deemed to and shall be "Notes"
for all purposes under the Loan  Documents,  (ii) may not be exchanged for Notes
which are not QFL Notes,  notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in the Loan
Documents  and (iii)  shall at all times  thereafter  be QFL  Notes,  including,
without limitation, following any transfer or assignment thereof.

        (e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents, the
QFL Notes are registered  obligations as to both principal and interest with the
Borrower  and  transfer  of the  obligations  underlying  such  QFL  Note may be
effected only by surrender of the QFL Note to the Borrower and either reissuance
by the Borrower of such QFL Note to the  transferee  or issuance by the Borrower
of a new QFL Note to the transferee. A QFL Note shall only evidence the Lender's
or an assignee's right, title and interest in and to the related obligation, and
in no event is a QFL Note to be considered a bearer  instrument  or  obligation.
This Section 2.15 shall be construed so that the obligations  underlying the QFL
Notes are at all times  maintained  in  "registered  form" within the meaning of
Sections 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.

        2.16 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold
each Lender  harmless  from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or
incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the
principal  amount of or  interest  on any  Eurodollar  Loan,  (b) default by the
Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar
Loans after the Borrower has given a notice  requesting the same, (c) default by
the  Borrower in making any  prepayment  after the  Borrower  has given a notice
thereof or (d) the making of a prepayment or conversion of Eurodollar Loans on a
day  which  is not the last  day of an  Interest  Period  with  respect  thereto
including,  without  limitation,  in each case, any such loss or expense arising
from the  redeployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate
the deposits from which such funds were  obtained.  This covenant  shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations hereunder.

        2.17 Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding.  Notwithstanding  any
other  provisions of this Agreement  (but subject to Section 2.18),  each Lender
shall be  entitled  to fund and  maintain  its funding of all or any part of its
Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being  understood  that for the  purposes of
this Agreement all  determinations  hereunder shall be made assuming each Lender
had actually  funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of
deposits of Dollars in the London interbank



                                       32
<PAGE>



market  having a  maturity  corresponding  to each  Loan's  Interest  Period and
bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

        2.18 Change of Lending Office;  Replacement  Lender(a) . (a) Each Lender
agrees that if it makes any demand for  payment  under  Section  2.14 or Section
2.15 or if any  adoption or change of the type  described  in Section 2.13 shall
occur with respect to it, such Lender will use  reasonable  efforts  (consistent
with its internal  policy and legal and regulatory  restrictions  and so long as
such  efforts  would  not be  disadvantageous  to it as  determined  in its sole
discretion)  to  designate  a different  lending  office if the making of such a
designation  would reduce or obviate the need for the Borrower to make  payments
under Section 2.14 or Section  2.15, or would  eliminate or reduce the effect of
any adoption or change described in Section 2.13.

        (b)  In  determining  the  amount  of any  claim  for  reimbursement  or
compensation  hereunder,  each Lender will use reasonable methods of calculation
consistent  with such  methods  customarily  employed  by such Lender in similar
situations.

        (c) Each Lender will notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
any  event  giving  rise to a claim  under  Sections  2.13,  2.14,  2.15 or 2.16
promptly  after the occurrence  thereof,  which notice shall be accompanied by a
certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the circumstances
of such claim.

        (d) If any  Lender,  other  than  (in  its  capacity  as a  Lender)  the
Administrative  Agent (an "Affected  Lender"),  seeks payment or indemnification
from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 2.15(a) (without prejudice
to any  amounts  then  due to such  Lender  under  such  Sections)  that are not
applicable  to all Lenders,  then the Borrower may designate  another  Lender or
another bank or financial institution  acceptable to the Administrative Agent to
assume,  in  accordance  with  Section  9.6,  all (but not  less  than  all) the
Commitments,  Loans and other rights and  obligations  of such  Affected  Lender
hereunder (a "Replacement  Lender"), in each case, on a date mutually acceptable
to  the  Replacement   Lender,   the  Affected  Lender,  the  Borrower  and  the
Administrative  Agent,  without recourse upon,  warranty by, or expense to, such
Affected Lender or the  Administrative  Agent, for a purchase price equal to the
outstanding  principal  amount of the  Loans of such  Affected  Lender  plus all
interest  accrued  thereon and all other amounts  owing to such Affected  Lender
hereunder,  or such other purchase price as may be mutually  agreed upon between
the  Affected  Lender  and the  Replacement  Lender,  upon such  assumption  and
purchase by the Replacement  Lender,  such Replacement  Lender shall be deemed a
"Lender" for purposes of this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents and such
Affected  Lender  shall cease to be a "Lender"  for such  purposes  and shall no
longer have any obligations hereunder.

                    ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

               To induce the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders to enter into
this Agreement and to make or participate in extensions of credit hereunder, the
Borrower  hereby  represents and warrants to the  Administrative  Agent and each
Lender:



                                       33

        3.1 Financial  Condition(a) . (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the
Borrower as of December  31,  1999,  December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001 and
the related consolidated  statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows
for the fiscal year ended on such date, and the unaudited  consolidated  balance
sheets of the Borrower and its  Consolidated  Subsidiaries  as of September  30,
2002; and the related consolidated  statements of income,  retained earnings and
cash flows for the period  ending as of such date,  reported  on, in the case of
the 1999 and 2000 annual audited financial  statements,  by Arthur Andersen LLP,
or in the case of the 2001 annual audited  financial  statements,  by Deloitte &
Touche LLP,  copies of which have  heretofore  been  furnished  to the  Lenders,
present  fairly the  consolidated  financial  condition  of the Borrower and its
Consolidated  Subsidiaries as at such date, and the results of their  operations
and their  retained  earnings and cash flows for each of the fiscal periods then
ended. All such financial statements,  including the related schedules and notes
thereto  relating to the audited  financials,  have been  prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved.

        (b) All balance sheets, all statements of income and shareholders equity
and of cash flows and all other financial  information  which shall hereafter be
furnished by or on behalf of or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the
purposes  of,  or  in  connection   with,  this  Agreement  or  any  transaction
contemplated  hereby  have  been or will be  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP
consistently  applied  throughout  the  periods  involved  (except as  disclosed
therein) and do or will present fairly  (subject to normal  year-end  adjustment
and the absence of footnotes in the case of financial  statements for any fiscal
quarter)  the  financial   condition  of  the  Borrower  and  its   Consolidated
Subsidiaries,  as the case may be, as at the dates  thereof  and the  results of
their  operations and their  shareholders  equity and cash flows for the periods
then ended.

        (c) The sum of  shareholders'  equity  and  preferred  stock  (including
mandatorily  redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trusts),  preference stock
and  preferred  securities  of the  Borrower  and  its  subsidiaries  (including
Excluded  Subsidiaries but excluding  discontinued  operations) on September 30,
2002 was $770,000,000.

        3.2 No Change. Since December 31, 2001, there has been no development or
event which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect.

        3.3 Corporate  Existence;  Compliance with Law. Each of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  (a) is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate or
limited  liability  company power and authority,  and the legal right to own and
operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct
the  business  in which it is  currently  engaged,  (c) is duly  qualified  as a
foreign  corporation or limited liability company and in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or
the conduct of its business  requires  such  qualification  except to the extent
that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate,  reasonably be
expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect and (d) is in  compliance  with all
Requirements of Law,



                                       34
<PAGE>



except to the extent that the failure to comply  therewith  could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.4  Corporate  Power;  Authorization;   Enforceable  Obligations.   The
Borrower  has (or with respect to the First  Mortgage  Bonds,  the  Supplemental
Indentures and the Bond Collateral Agreement,  when executed, the Borrower shall
have) the corporate power and authority,  and the legal right, to make,  deliver
and  perform  the  Indentures  and  the  Loan  Documents  and to  authorize  the
execution,  delivery  and  performance  of the  Loan  Documents,  and to  borrow
hereunder.  The Borrower has (or with respect to the First Mortgage  Bonds,  the
Supplemental  Indentures and the Bond Collateral Agreement,  when executed,  the
Borrower  shall have) taken all  necessary  corporate  action to  authorize  the
borrowings on the terms and  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement and in the
Notes and to execute,  deliver and perform its obligations  under the Indentures
and the  Loan  Documents.  Set  forth  on  Schedule  3.4a  are all  consents  or
authorizations  of, filings with,  notices to or other acts by or in respect of,
any  Governmental  Authority or any other Person required in connection with the
authorization,   execution,   or  issuance  of  any  First  Mortgage  Bond,  the
authorization,  delivery, performance or validity of any Supplemental Indenture,
or the execution, delivery, performance,  validity or enforceability of the Bond
Collateral  Agreement or any Collateral  Document related  thereto,  and in each
case any application therefor (collectively, the "First Mortgage Approvals"). No
consent  or  authorization  of,  filing  with,  notice  to or other act by or in
respect  of, any  Governmental  Authority  or any other  Person is  required  in
connection  with the  borrowings  hereunder,  or with the  execution,  delivery,
performance,  validity or  enforceability  of the Loan Documents  other than (x)
First  Mortgage  Approvals,  (y) as set  forth  on  Schedule  3.4b,  or (z)  any
consents,  authorizations  and filings in connection with the foregoing that, if
not  obtained,  could not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material  Adverse
Effect. On the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall have
received complete and current copies of all consents, authorizations and filings
listed on Schedule 3.4b. On the Cash Collateral Release Date, the Administrative
Agent and each Lender shall have  received  complete  and current  copies of all
First Mortgage Approvals.  No such consent,  authorization or filing is or shall
be conditioned  upon or otherwise  imposes any materially  burdensome or adverse
condition.  This  Agreement and the  Indentures  have been,  and each other Loan
Document  when  executed and  delivered  will be, duly executed and delivered on
behalf of the Borrower.  This Agreement and the Indentures constitute,  and each
other Loan Document when executed and delivered will constitute,  a legal, valid
and binding  obligation of the Borrower  enforceable  against the  Borrower,  in
accordance with their respective terms,  except as enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  generally  and  by  general
equitable  principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or
at law).

        3.5 No Legal Bar. The  execution,  delivery and  performance of the Loan
Documents,  the borrowings  hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof,  will
not violate any Requirement of Law or Contractual  Obligation of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary  which violation could  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, will not accelerate or result in the acceleration of any payment
obligations of the



                                       35
<PAGE>



Borrower or such Subsidiary and will not result in, or require,  the creation or
imposition  of any Lien on any of the  respective  properties or revenues of the
Borrower  or any such  Subsidiary  pursuant  to any such  Requirement  of Law or
Contractual  Obligation  (other  than Liens  pursuant to the  Indentures  or the
Collateral Documents).

        3.6 No Material Litigation.  No litigation,  investigation or proceeding
of or before any  arbitrator  or  Governmental  Authority  is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against the Borrower, any Subsidiary
or any  Excluded  Subsidiary  or against  any of the  respective  properties  or
revenues of the Borrower,  any Subsidiary or any Excluded Subsidiary which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.7 No  Default.  No  Default or Event of Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing.

        3.8 Ownership of Property;  Liens.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8,
each  of the  Borrower  and  its  Material  Subsidiaries  has  good  record  and
marketable  title in fee simple to, or a valid  leasehold  interest  in, all its
material real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all
its other material property.  None of such property is subject to any Lien other
than Permitted Liens.

        3.9 [Intentionally Omitted].

        3.10  Intellectual  Property.  Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
owns, or is licensed to use, all patents,  trademarks,  trade names, copyrights,
technology, know-how, processes, logos and insignia necessary for the conduct of
its business as currently conducted except for those which the failure to own or
license could not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect (the
"Intellectual  Property").  No claim has been  asserted  and is  pending  by any
Person  challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual  Property or
the validity or  effectiveness  of any such  Intellectual  Property  which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  nor does the Borrower
or any  Consolidated  Subsidiary know of any valid basis for any such claim. The
use of such  Intellectual  Property by the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  does not
infringe on the rights of any Person,  except for such claims and  infringements
that,  in the  aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

        3.11 No Burdensome  Restrictions.  No  Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation of the Borrower,  any  Subsidiary  or any Excluded  Subsidiary  could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.12 Taxes.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12,  each of the Borrower
and the  Subsidiaries  has filed or caused  to be filed all  federal,  state and
other material tax returns which are required to be filed and has paid all taxes
(including  interest and penalties)  shown to be due and payable on said returns
or on any  assessments  made  against  it or any of its  property  and all other
taxes,  fees  or  other  charges  imposed  on it or any of its  property  by any
Governmental Authority (other than any tax, fee or other



                                       36
<PAGE>



charge the amount or  validity of which is  currently  being  contested  in good
faith  by  appropriate  proceedings  and  with  respect  to  which  reserves  in
conformity  with GAAP have been  provided  on the books of the  Borrower or such
Subsidiary,  as the case may be);  and no tax Lien has been  filed,  and, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being asserted,  with respect to any such
tax, fee or other charge.

        3.13 Margin  Stock(a) . (a) The  Borrower is not engaged in the business
of  extending  credit for the purpose of  purchasing  or carrying  margin  stock
(within the meaning of Regulation U), and no proceeds of any extension of credit
hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit
to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock,  except in
compliance with applicable law and regulations.

        (b) Following  application  of the proceeds of each  extension of credit
hereunder,  not more  than 25% of the  value of the  consolidated  assets of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries that are subject to the provisions of
Section 6.3 will be comprised of margin stock.

        3.14  ERISA.   Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  Subsidiary   maintains,
contributes to or has material obligations with respect to, any welfare plan (as
defined in  Section(3)(1)  of ERISA) which provides  benefits to employees after
termination  of employment  other than as required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
or similar state laws regarding continuation of benefits. Each Plan has complied
and is in compliance in all respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code except where failure to do so could not  reasonably be expected to have
a Material  Adverse  Effect.  The Borrower and each Subsidiary have not breached
any of the  responsibilities,  obligations or duties imposed on it by ERISA, the
Code, or  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  with respect to any Plan,  which
breach could reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  Neither
the Borrower nor any  Subsidiary nor any fiduciary of any Plan who is an officer
or an employee  of the  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary  has engaged in a nonexempt
prohibited  transaction  described  in Section  406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code
with  respect to a Plan which  could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(3) of  ERISA)  currently  or  formerly  maintained  or  contributed  to by any
Commonly  Controlled Entity, no liability exists and no event has occurred which
could  subject  the  Borrower or any  Subsidiary  to any  liability  which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 3.14, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has any liability,  direct
or indirect,  contingent (including,  without limitation,  any such liability in
connection with a Multiemployer  Plan) or otherwise,  under Title IV of ERISA or
under  Section  412 of the Code which  could  reasonably  be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

        3.15 Holding Company;  Investment  Company Act; Other  Regulations.  The
Borrower  is not (a) an  "investment  company" or a company  "controlled"  by an
"investment company",  within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended,  or (b) except as described on Schedule 3.15,  subject to regulation
under any Federal or state statute, regulation, decree or order which limits its
ability to incur



                                       37
<PAGE>



Indebtedness or conditions such ability upon any act, approval or consent of any
Governmental  Authority  or an ISO.  The  Borrower  is either (i) not a "holding
company", a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company",  or an "affiliate" of a
"holding  company",  as each such term is defined in the Public Utility  Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended,  or (ii) exempt from  registration as a holding
company under The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 by reason of filing
an application on Form U-1 in good faith seeking an order of exemption  pursuant
to Section  3(a)(3) of that Act, and the  Borrower has not received  notice from
the SEC challenging or otherwise calling into question such exemption.

        3.16  Purpose of Loans.  The  proceeds  of Loans will be used solely (i)
first to repay in full and  terminate  the  Existing  Credit  Facility  and (ii)
thereafter for general corporate purposes of the Borrower,  its Subsidiaries and
its  Excluded  Subsidiaries  as  permitted  hereunder  (in  compliance  with all
applicable legal and regulatory requirements).

        3.17 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17,

        (a) The  facilities  and  properties  owned,  leased or  operated by the
Borrower, its Subsidiaries or any Excluded Subsidiary (the "Properties") and all
operations  at the  Properties  are in,  and  have  been in,  compliance  in all
material  respects  with all  applicable  Environmental  Laws,  and  there is no
contamination  in, at, under,  from or about the  Properties or violation of any
Environmental  Law or other  circumstance  or  condition,  with  respect  to the
Properties or the business  operated by the Borrower,  its  Subsidiaries  or any
Excluded Subsidiary, or any predecessor of any of them (the "Business") which in
either case could  reasonably  be  expected to result in any claims,  liability,
investigation or cost pursuant to any  Environmental  Law and to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

        (b) None of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Excluded Subsidiary,  or
any  predecessor of any of them,  has received any notice of violation,  alleged
violation,   non-compliance,   liability   or  potential   liability   regarding
environmental  matters or compliance with  Environmental Laws with regard to any
of the Properties or the Business,  nor do the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  have
knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being
threatened,  in each case which could  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

        (c) There has been no  Release  or threat of  Release  of  Materials  of
Environmental  Concern  at or from any of the  Properties,  or  arising  from or
related to the  operations  of the  Borrower,  any  Subsidiary  or any  Excluded
Subsidiary,  or any  predecessor  of any of them, in connection  with any of the
Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.18  Insurance.  All  policies  of  insurance  of any  kind  or  nature
maintained by or issued to the Borrower or any  Subsidiary,  including,  without
limitation,  policies of life, fire, theft, product liability, public liability,
property damage, other



                                       38
<PAGE>



casualty, employee fidelity, worker's compensation, employee health and welfare,
title,  property and  liability  insurance,  are in full force and effect in all
material respects and are of a nature and provide such coverage as is sufficient
and as is customarily carried by companies of similar size and character.

        3.19 Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All information,  reports
and other papers and data (other than projections) with respect to the Borrower,
any  Subsidiary  or any  Excluded  Subsidiary  furnished  to the  Lenders by the
Borrower,  or on behalf of the  Borrower,  and all SEC Reports were, at the time
furnished,  complete  and  correct  in  all  material  respects,  or  have  been
subsequently supplemented by other information, reports or other papers or data,
to the extent necessary to give the Lenders a true and accurate knowledge of the
subject matter in all material  respects.  All  projections  with respect to the
Borrower  or  any  Subsidiary  furnished  by the  Borrower,  were  prepared  and
presented in good faith by the Borrower  based upon facts and  assumptions  that
the  Borrower  believed to be  reasonable  in light of current  and  foreseeable
conditions,  it being  understood  that  projections  are subject to significant
uncertainties  and  contingencies,  many of which are beyond the  control of the
Borrower and that no assurance can be given that the financial results set forth
in such projections will actually be realized and the Borrower shall be under no
obligation to update such projections.  No document  furnished or statement made
in writing to the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with the
negotiation,  preparation  or  execution  of this  Agreement  and no SEC  Report
contains  any untrue  statement of a material  fact,  or omits to state any such
material fact  necessary in order to make the statements  contained  therein not
misleading,  in  either  case  which  has not been  corrected,  supplemented  or
remedied by subsequent  documents furnished or statements made in writing to the
Lenders.

        3.20 Leaseholds,  Permits,  etc. The Borrower possesses or has the right
to use, all leaseholds, easements, franchises and permits and all authorizations
and other  rights  which are  material to and  necessary  for the conduct of the
Business and its business.  All the foregoing are in full force and effect,  and
each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in substantial  compliance with the
foregoing without any known conflict with the valid rights of others, except for
such  noncompliance with the foregoing which could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material  Adverse Effect.  No event has occurred which permits,  or after
notice or lapse of time or both would permit,  the  revocation or termination of
any  such  leasehold,   easement,  franchise,  license  or  other  right,  which
termination or revocation,  considered as a whole,  could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.21 No  Restrictive  Covenants.  No Subsidiary of the Borrower is party
to, or otherwise  bound by, any agreement or other  arrangement  that  prohibits
such  Subsidiary  from  making any  payments,  directly  or  indirectly,  to the
Borrower,  by way of  dividends,  advances,  repayment  of  loans  or  advances,
reimbursements  of  management  or  other  intercompany  charges,  expenses  and
accruals or other returns on investment,  or any other  agreement or arrangement
that restricts the ability of such  Subsidiary to make any payment,  directly or
indirectly,  to the Borrower, other than prohibitions and restrictions permitted
to exist under Section 6.12.



                                       39

        3.22 Solvency. The Borrower is solvent, is able to pay its debts as they
mature,  owns property with fair saleable value greater than the amount required
to pay its debts and has  capital  sufficient  to carry on its  business as then
constituted.

        3.23 Montana First Mortgage Indenture.

        (a) The First  Mortgage  Bonds to be  issued  under  the  Montana  First
Mortgage  Indenture,  as heretofore  supplemented  and to be supplemented by the
Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture (the "Montana Supplemental Indenture"), when
delivered to the Collateral Agent, will be duly executed, authenticated,  issued
and delivered,  and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
Borrower,  entitled to the security  and  benefits  provided by the lien of such
Indenture (except to the extent that  enforceability of such lien may be limited
by the  effect  of  certain  laws of the  jurisdictions  in which  the  physical
properties  covered  thereby  are  located  upon the  remedies  provided in such
Indenture,  which  limitations,  however,  do not  make  the  remedies  afforded
inadequate  for the  realization  of the security and benefits  provided by such
Indenture,  and  except  as  enforceability  of  such  lien  may be  limited  by
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,   moratorium  or  other  similar  laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights).

        (b) The Montana First Mortgage Indenture as heretofore  supplemented now
constitutes,  and such Indenture,  when the Montana Supplemental Indenture shall
have been duly filed for  recording  and recorded,  will  constitute,  a legally
valid  and  directly   enforceable   first  mortgage  lien  for  the  equal  and
proportionate  security  of the  first  mortgage  bonds  issued  or to be issued
thereunder,  upon substantially all of the physical properties and franchises of
the Borrower  which are  specifically  described  therein as subject to the lien
thereof  and  which are used or useful in the  conduct  of the  Montana  Utility
Business,  free from all prior  liens,  charges or  encumbrances  (except to the
extent that  enforceability of such lien may be limited by the effect of certain
laws of the jurisdictions in which the physical  properties  covered thereby are
located upon the remedies provided in such Indenture as heretofore  supplemented
and to be supplemented by the Montana Supplemental Indenture, which limitations,
however, do not make the remedies afforded inadequate for the realization of the
security and benefits  provided by such Indenture,  and except as enforceability
of  such  lien  may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights)
and the  after-acquired  property clause in such Indenture  subjects to the lien
thereof all  after-acquired  utility property of the Montana Utility Business as
provided therein (except such thereof as is expressly  excepted from the lien of
such Indenture).

        (c) The Montana First  Mortgage  Indenture as  heretofore  supplemented,
(including  any  necessary  related  financing  statements),  has been filed and
recorded  wherever and to the extent  necessary to perfect the lien thereof upon
the properties now owned by the Borrower and intended to be subject thereto; all
fees or taxes in  connection  therewith  have been  paid and no other  filing or
recordation  is  presently  necessary  in  order  to  perfect  the  lien of such
Indenture on such properties.

<PAGE>



        (d) No filing or  recording  of the Montana  Supplemental  Indenture  is
necessary to perfect the lien of the Montana First  Mortgage  Indenture upon the
properties  now owned by the Borrower  and intended to be subject  thereto or to
extend  such  lien for the  benefit  of the  First  Mortgage  Bonds to be issued
thereunder;  no  re-recording  or  refiling  of  such  Indenture  or  any  other
instruments  or  documents   (except  for  periodic  filings  which  extend  the
effectiveness  of financing  statements) is required to preserve and protect the
lien of such  Indenture;  and under the present  laws of the States in which the
property  intended to be subject to the lien of such  Indenture  is located,  no
further  supplemental  indentures or other instruments or documents are required
to be executed,  filed and/or  recorded to extend the lien of such  Indenture to
after-acquired  property;  however, the Borrower is required by the terms of the
Montana  First  Mortgage  Indenture  to  promptly  record  and file the  Montana
Supplemental Indenture.

        (e) The Borrower has good and marketable  title to all properties  owned
by it which are subject to the Montana First  Mortgage  Indenture,  subject only
(a) to the lien of such Indenture,  (b) to Excepted  Encumbrances (as defined in
such Indenture)  which are Permitted Liens hereunder and (c) to minor exceptions
and defects which do not, in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use by
the  Borrower  of such  properties  for the  purposes  for which  they are held,
materially  detract  from the value of said  properties  or in any  material way
impair the security afforded by such Indenture.

        3.24 South Dakota First Mortgage Indenture.

        (a) The First  Mortgage  Bonds to be issued under the South Dakota First
Mortgage  Indenture,  as heretofore  supplemented  and to be  supplemented  by a
Supplemental  Indenture  creating  the South Dakota  First  Mortgage  Bonds (the
"South Dakota Supplemental Indenture"),  when delivered to the Collateral Agent,
will be duly executed, authenticated,  issued and delivered, and will constitute
valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower,  entitled to the security
and benefits  provided by the lien of such Indenture  (except to the extent that
enforceability  of such lien may be limited by the effect of certain laws of the
jurisdictions in which the physical  properties covered thereby are located upon
the remedies provided in such Indenture, which limitations, however, do not make
the  remedies  afforded  inadequate  for the  realization  of the  security  and
benefits  provided by such Indenture,  and except as enforceability of such lien
may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights).

        (b) The South Dakota First Mortgage Indenture as heretofore supplemented
now  constitutes,  and  such  Indenture,  when  the  South  Dakota  Supplemental
Indenture  shall  have  been  duly  filed  for  recording  and  recorded,   will
constitute, a legally valid and directly enforceable first mortgage lien for the
equal and  proportionate  security of the first  mortgage  bonds issued or to be
issued  thereunder,  upon  substantially  all of  the  physical  properties  and
franchises of the Borrower which are specifically  described  therein as subject
to the lien  thereof  and which are used or useful in the  conduct  of the South
Dakota  Utility  Business,  free from all prior liens,  charges or  encumbrances
(except to the  extent  that  enforceability  of such lien may be limited by the
effect of certain laws of the  jurisdictions  in which the  physical  properties
covered thereby are located upon the



                                       41
<PAGE>



remedies  provided  in  such  Indenture  as  heretofore  supplemented  and to be
supplemented  by the South Dakota  Supplemental  Indenture,  which  limitations,
however, do not make the remedies afforded inadequate for the realization of the
security and benefits  provided by such Indenture,  and except as enforceability
of  such  lien  may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights)
and the  after-acquired  property clause in such Indenture  subjects to the lien
thereof all  after-acquired  property of the South  Dakota  Utility  Business as
provided therein (except such thereof as is expressly  excepted from the lien of
such Indenture).

        (c) The South Dakota First Mortgage Indenture as heretofore supplemented
(including  any  necessary  related  financing  statements),  has been filed and
recorded  wherever and to the extent  necessary to perfect the lien thereof upon
the properties now owned by the Borrower and intended to be subject thereto; all
fees or taxes in  connection  therewith  have been  paid and no other  filing or
recordation  is  presently  necessary  in  order  to  perfect  the  lien of such
Indenture on such properties.

        (d) No filing or recording of the South Dakota Supplemental Indenture is
necessary to perfect the lien of the South Dakota First Mortgage  Indenture upon
the properties  now owned by the Borrower and intended to be subject  thereto or
to extend  such lien for the  benefit of the First  Mortgage  Bonds to be issued
thereunder;  no  re-recording  or  refiling  of  such  Indenture  or  any  other
instruments  or  documents   (except  for  periodic  filings  which  extend  the
effectiveness  of financing  statements) is required to preserve and protect the
lien of such  Indenture;  and under the present  laws of the States in which the
property  intended to be subject to the lien of such  Indenture  is located,  no
further  supplemental  indentures or other instruments or documents are required
to be executed,  filed and/or  recorded to extend the lien of such  Indenture to
after-acquired  property;  however, the Borrower is required by the terms of the
South Dakota  First  Mortgage  Indenture  to promptly  record and file the South
Dakota Supplemental Indenture.

        (e) The Borrower has good and marketable  title to all properties  owned
by it which are subject to the South Dakota First  Mortgage  Indenture,  subject
only (a) to the lien of such  Indenture,  (b) to Permitted  Liens (as defined in
such Indenture)  which are Permitted Liens hereunder and (c) to minor exceptions
and defects which do not, in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use by
the  Borrower  of such  properties  for the  purposes  for which  they are held,
materially  detract  from the value of said  properties  or in any  material way
impair the security afforded by such Indenture.

        3.25  Subsidiaries.  Set forth on Schedule  3.25 are all of the Material
Subsidiaries  of the Borrower,  which schedule  correctly sets forth,  as of the
date hereof,  the percentage  ownership (direct and indirect) of the Borrower in
each class of capital  stock or other  equity  interests of each of its Material
Subsidiaries  and also  identifies  the direct owner  thereof.  All  outstanding
shares of capital  stock of each  Subsidiary  of the  Borrower has been duly and
validly issued,  are fully paid and  non-assessable and have been issued free of
any preemptive  rights.  No Material  Subsidiary of the Borrower has outstanding
any securities convertible into or exchangeable for its Capital Stock or


                                       42
<PAGE>



outstanding  any  right to  subscribe  for or to  purchase,  or any  options  or
warrants  for the  purchase  or, or any  agreement  providing  for the  issuance
(contingent  or  otherwise)  of or  any  calls,  commitments  or  claims  of any
character  relating to, its Capital Stock or any stock  appreciation  or similar
rights.

referred  to or  provided  for in,  or  received  by  either  Agent  under or in
connection  with,  this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document or for the value,
validity,  effectiveness,  genuineness,  enforceability  or  sufficiency of this
Agreement  or the Notes or any other  Loan  Document  or for any  failure of the
Borrower to perform its obligations  hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent shall be
under  any  obligation  to any  Lender  to  ascertain  or to  inquire  as to the
observance or performance  of any of the agreements  contained in, or conditions
of, this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or to inspect the  properties,
books or records of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Excluded Subsidiary.



                                       65

        8.4 Reliance by Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully  protected  in relying,  upon any Note,  writing,  resolution,  notice,
consent,  certificate,  affidavit,  letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement,  order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and  correct  and to have  been  signed,  sent or made by the  proper  Person or
Persons and upon advice and  statements  of legal  counsel  (including,  without
limitation, counsel to the Borrower),  independent accountants and other experts
selected by such  Agent.  Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note or
any loan account in the Register as the owner thereof for all purposes  unless a
written  notice of assignment,  negotiation or transfer  thereof shall have been
filed with the  Administrative  Agent.  Each Agent shall be fully  justified  in
failing or refusing to take any action  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document  unless  it shall  first  receive  such  advice or  concurrence  of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction  by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred  by it by reason of taking or  continuing  to take any such  action.
Each Agent shall in all cases be fully  protected  in acting,  or in  refraining
from acting,  under this  Agreement,  the Notes and the other Loan  Documents in
accordance  with a request of the  Required  Lenders,  and such  request and any
action  taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the amounts owing hereunder.

        8.5 Notice of  Default.  No Agent shall be deemed to have  knowledge  or
notice of the  occurrence  of any Default or Event of Default  unless such Agent
has received  notice from a Lender or the Borrower  referring to this Agreement,
describing  such  Default or Event of Default and stating  that such notice is a
"notice of default".  In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  Each
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall be reasonably  directed by the Required Lenders;  provided that unless and
until such Agent shall have received such directions,  such Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,  with
respect to such  Default or Event of Default as it shall deem  advisable  in the
best interests of the Lenders.

        8.6  Non-Reliance  on Agents and Other  Lenders.  Each Lender  expressly
acknowledges  that no  Agent  nor  any of its  officers,  directors,  employees,
agents,   attorneys-in-fact  or  Affiliates  has  made  any  representations  or
warranties to it and that no act by either Agent hereafter taken,  including any
review  of the  affairs  of the  Borrower,  shall be deemed  to  constitute  any
representation or warranty by either Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents
to each Agent that it has,  independently and without reliance upon either Agent
or any other  Lender,  and based on such  documents  and  information  as it has
deemed  appropriate,  made  its own  appraisal  of and  investigation  into  the
business,   operations,    property,   financial   and   other   condition   and
creditworthiness  of the  Borrower  and made its own  decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also  represents  that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender,
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem  appropriate at the
time,  continue to make its own credit  analysis,  appraisals  and  decisions in
taking or not taking action under this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to



                                       66
<PAGE>



inform  itself as to the  business,  operations,  property,  financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices, reports and
other  documents  expressly  required  to be  furnished  to the  Lenders  by the
Administrative  Agent hereunder or furnished to the Administrative Agent for the
account of, or with a counterpart or copy for, each Lender,  no Agent shall have
any duty or  responsibility  to  provide  any  Lender  with any  credit or other
information concerning the business, operations,  property, condition (financial
or  otherwise),  prospects  or  creditworthiness  of  the  Borrower,  any of its
Subsidiaries  or any Excluded  Subsidiary  which may come into the possession of
either   Agent  or  any  of  its   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

        8.7  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify  each Agent in its
capacity  as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by the  Borrower  and  without
limiting  the  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to do  so)  and  their  respective
directors, officers, employees and agents, ratably according to their respective
Commitment  Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this Section (or, if  indemnification  is sought after the date upon which
the  Commitments  shall have  terminated  and the Loans  shall have been paid in
full, ratably in accordance with their Commitment Percentages  immediately prior
to such date),  from and against any and all liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including,  without limitation, at
any time  following the payment of all amounts  owing  hereunder) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions  contemplated  hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with
any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of
any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,
actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,  expenses or disbursements  resulting solely
from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
Section shall survive the payment of the Obligations hereunder.

        8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Each Agent and its Affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with the Borrower,  any  Subsidiary  and any Excluded  Subsidiary as though such
Agent  were not an Agent  hereunder  and under the other  Loan  Documents.  With
respect to Loans made or  renewed  by it and any Note  issued to it,  each Agent
shall have the same rights and powers  under this  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents  as any  Lender  and may  exercise  the same as  though it were not an
Agent,  and the terms  "Lender" and  "Lenders"  shall  include each Agent in its
individual capacity.

        8.9 Successor  Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign
as  Administrative  Agent upon ten days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.
If the  Administrative  Agent shall  resign as  Administrative  Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  then the Required  Lenders shall,  with
the consent of the Borrower  (which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld
and shall not be required  if an Event of Default  shall have  occurred  that is
continuing) appoint a successor  administrative agent,  whereupon such successor
Administrative  Agent  shall  succeed  to the  rights,  powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative



                                       67
<PAGE>



Agent"  shall  mean such  successor  Administrative  Agent  effective  upon such
appointment and approval,  and the former Administrative  Agent's rights, powers
and duties as  Administrative  Agent shall be  terminated,  without any other or
further  act or deed on the part of such former  Administrative  Agent or any of
the parties to this Agreement or any holders of any amounts  payable  hereunder.
After  any  retiring  or  terminated   Administrative   Agent's  resignation  or
termination, as the case may be, as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section  shall  inure to its  benefit as to any  actions  taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

                            ARTICLE 9. MISCELLANEOUS

        9.1  Amendments  and Waivers.  Neither this  Agreement,  any Note or any
other  Loan  Document,   nor  any  terms  hereof  or  thereof  may  be  amended,
supplemented  or  modified  except in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this
Section.  The Required Lenders may, or, with the written consent of the Required
Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with
the Borrower written  amendments,  supplements or  modifications  hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or changing in any manner the
rights of the  Lenders  or of the  Borrower  hereunder,  (b) enter into with the
Borrower  written  amendments,  supplements or modifications to the Note and the
other Loan  Documents for the purpose of adding  provisions to the Notes or such
other Loan  Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the
Borrower  thereunder or (c) waive,  on such terms and conditions as the Required
Lenders or the  Administrative  Agent,  as the case may be, may  specify in such
instrument,  any of the  requirements of this Agreement,  the Notes or the other
Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided
that no such waiver and no such amendment,  supplement or modification (i) shall
reduce the amount or extend the  scheduled  date of maturity of the Note or Loan
of any Lender or of any  installment  thereof,  or reduce the stated rate of any
interest or fee payable  hereunder or extend the  scheduled  date of any payment
thereof or increase  the amount or extend the  expiration  date of any  Lender's
Commitment,  in each case, without the consent of such Lender, (ii) shall amend,
modify or waive any  provision  of this  Section,  Section 2.12 in a manner that
would alter the pro rata sharing payments required by Section 2.12,  Section 2.6
or 2.12 in a manner  that would  eliminate  or limit a Lender's  right to reject
prepayments  under Section 2.6, or vary any  provision of this  Agreement or any
other Loan Document  which  specifically  by its terms  requires the approval or
consent of all the Lenders or reduce the percentage  specified in the definition
of Required Lenders, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of
any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement,  the Notes and the other
Loan Documents, or release any material portion of the Collateral (other than in
accordance  with the terms of the Loan  Documents),  in each case,  without  the
written  consent of all the Lenders,  or (iii) shall amend,  modify or waive any
provision of Article 8 or any other provision in any Loan Document governing the
rights  or  obligations  of the  Administrative  Agent or the  Collateral  Agent
without the written consent of the then Administrative  Agent and the Collateral
Agent. Any such waiver and any such amendment,  supplement or modification shall
apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the



                                       68
<PAGE>



Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the
case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall
be  restored  to their  former  position  and  rights  hereunder  and  under the
outstanding  Notes and any other  Loan  Documents,  and any  Default or Event of
Default  waived  shall be  deemed to be cured  and not  continuing,  but no such
waiver shall extend to any  subsequent  or other  Default or Event of Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right,
remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder or under the other Loan  Documents  shall

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

liabilities  with  respect  thereto,  which may be payable or  determined  to be
payable in connection  with the execution  and delivery of, or  consummation  or
administration of any of the transactions  contemplated by, or payment under, or
any amendment,  supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or

Administrative  Agent, the Collateral  Agent and each Lender  (including each of

(iii) any other Transaction or any transaction or document related thereto or in
connection  therewith (all the foregoing in this clause (d),  collectively,  the
"indemnified  liabilities");  provided  that  the  Borrower  shall  not have any
obligation  hereunder  to any Lender  with  respect to  indemnified  liabilities
arising from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of the  Administrative
Agent, the Collateral  Agent or such Lender.  The agreements in this Section 9.5
shall survive repayment of the Obligations hereunder.

        9.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments(a).  (a) This
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the  Borrower,  the
Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent,  all future  holders of the amounts  owing
hereunder and their respective successors and assigns,  except that the Borrower
may not assign or transfer



                                       70
<PAGE>



any of its rights or obligations  under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each Lender.

        (b) Any Lender may, in the  ordinary  course of its  commercial  banking
business and in accordance  with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks or other  entities  ("Participants")  participating  interests in any Loan
owing to such  Lender,  any Note held by such  Lender,  any  Commitment  of such
Lender or any other interest  hereunder and under the other Loan  Documents.  In
the  event  of any  such  sale by a  Lender  of a  participating  interest  to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties
to this  Agreement  shall remain  unchanged,  such Lender  shall  remain  solely
responsible for the performance thereof,  such Lender shall remain the holder of
any  such  Note  for all  purposes  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  the Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent shall  continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations  under this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents and such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower  relating
to the Loans and other  obligations  owing to such  Lender  and to  approve  any
amendment,  modification,  or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement  (other
than  amendments,  modifications,  or  waivers  (i)  decreasing  the  amount  of
principal  of or the rate at which  interest  is payable on such Loans or Notes,
(ii)  extending  any  scheduled  principal  payment  date or date  fixed for the
payment of interest on such Loans or Notes, (iii) extending its Commitment, (iv)
permitting  any  assignment  or  transfer  of any of the  Borrower's  rights  or
obligations  under this Agreement) or (v) releasing all or substantially  all of
the  Collateral.  The  Borrower  agrees that if amounts  outstanding  under this
Agreement and the Notes are due or unpaid,  or shall have been declared or shall
have become due and payable  upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default,  each
Participant  shall be  deemed to have the  right of  setoff  in  respect  of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and any Note to the
same extent as if the amount of its  participating  interest were owing directly
to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any Note; provided that, in purchasing
such participating  interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to
share with the Lenders  the  proceeds  thereof as provided in Section  9.7(a) as
fully as if it were a Lender  hereunder.  The  Borrower  also  agrees  that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14,  Section 2.15 and
Section 2.16 with respect to its  participation in the Commitments and the Loans
outstanding from time to time as if it were a Lender; provided that, in the case
of Section 2.15, such  Participant  shall have complied with the requirements of
said Section;  and provided,  further,  that no Participant shall be entitled to
receive any greater  amount  pursuant to any such  Section  than the  transferor
Lender  would  have been  entitled  to  receive  in respect of the amount of the
participation  transferred by such transferor  Lender to such Participant had no
such transfer occurred.

        (c)  Any  Lender,  in the  ordinary  course  of its  commercial  banking
business and in  accordance  with  applicable  law, at any time and from time to
time may, with the consent of the Administrative  Agent (which consent shall not
be  unreasonably  withheld),  assign to any Lender or any  affiliate or Approved
Fund thereof,  an additional  bank,  financial  institution,  fund or commingled
investment  vehicle,  or other  Person  (an  "Assignee")  all or any part of its
rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and the Notes  pursuant  to an
assignment agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit D (or



                                       71
<PAGE>



such other form approved by the  Administrative  Agent's in its sole discretion)
(an  "Assignment  and Assumption  Agreement"),  executed by such Assignee,  such
assigning Lender and, in the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender or an
affiliate or Approved Fund thereof, by the Administrative Agent and delivered to
the  Administrative  Agent for its  acceptance  and  recording in the  Register;
provided that (i) any such  assignment  must be in a minimum amount equal to the
lesser of (x) $1,000,000 and (y) the aggregate Commitments and outstanding Loans
of such  Lender  then in  effect,  and  (ii)  after  giving  effect  to any such
assignment,  such  Lender  shall  have  either  (x)  sold  all  its  rights  and
obligations hereunder and under the Notes or (y) retained at least $1,000,000 of
the aggregate Commitments and outstanding Loans. Upon such execution,  delivery,
acceptance and recording,  from and after the effective date determined pursuant
to such Assignment and Assumption  Agreement,  (1) the Assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent  provided in such Assignment and Assumption
Agreement,  have  the  rights  and  obligations  of a  Lender  hereunder  with a
Commitment  and  Loans  as set  forth  therein  and  (2)  the  assigning  Lender
thereunder,  to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Assumption  Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of
an  assigning  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  such
assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto;  provided that the provisions
of Section 2.14,  Section 2.15,  Section 2.16 and Section 9.5 shall  continue to
benefit such assigning  Lender to the extent required by such  Sections).  On or
prior  to  the  effective  date  determined  pursuant  to  such  Assignment  and
Assumption  Agreement,  (i) appropriate entries shall be made in the accounts of
the assigning  Lender and the Register  evidencing such assignment and releasing
the Borrower from any and all obligations to the assigning  Lender in respect of
the assigned Loan or Loans and (ii) appropriate  entries evidencing the assigned
Loan or Loans shall be made in the  accounts of the Assignee and the Register as
required  by Section  9.6(d).  In the event  that any Notes have been  issued in
respect of the assigned  Loan or Loans,  such Notes shall be marked  "cancelled"
and surrendered by the assigning Lender to the  Administrative  Agent for return
to the Borrower.

        (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain,  at its address referred to
in Section 9.2, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption  Agreement delivered to
it and a  register  (the  "Register")  for  the  recordation  of the  names  and
addresses  of the Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and  principal  amount of the
Loans  owing to,  each  Lender  from time to time.  To the extent  permitted  by
applicable law, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive,  in the absence
of manifest error,  and the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent may (and, in
the case of any Loan not  evidenced  by a Note,  shall)  treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the  Register as the owner of the Loan  recorded  therein as
the  owner  thereof  for all  purposes  of this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or
other obligation  hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon
appropriate  entries  with  respect  thereto  being  made in the  Register.  The
Register  shall be available for  inspection  by the Borrower at any  reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.



                                       72
<PAGE>



        (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption  Agreement executed
by the assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is
not  then a  Lender  or an  affiliate  thereof,  by the  Administrative  Agent )
together  with  payment  by  the  assigning  Lender  or by the  Assignee  to the
Administrative  Agent  of a  registration  and  processing  fee of  $3,500,  the
Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  accept  such  Assignment  and  Assumption
Agreement and, on the effective date determined  pursuant thereto,  shall record
the  information  contained  therein  in the  Register  and give  notice of such
acceptance and recordation to the Borrower.

        (f)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  herein,  any
Lender (a "Granting  Lender") may grant to a special  purpose funding vehicle (a
"SPC"),  identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting  Lender
to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Borrower,  the  option to  provide to the
Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting  Lender would  otherwise
be obligated to make to the Borrower  pursuant to this Agreement;  provided that
(i) nothing herein shall  constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any advance
hereunder,  (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails
to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting  Lender shall be obligated
to make such Loan pursuant to the terms  hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC
hereunder shall utilize the applicable  Commitment of the Granting Lender to the
same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party
hereto  hereby  agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any  indemnity or similar
payment  obligation  under this  Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
with the Granting  Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing,  each party hereto
hereby agrees (which  agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that,  prior to the date that is one year and one day after the  payment in full
of all outstanding  commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it
will not institute  against,  or join any other person in  instituting  against,
such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization,  arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings  under  the laws of the  United  States  or any  State  thereof.  In
addition,  notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained in this Section
9.6(f),  any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior  written  consent
of, the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent and without paying any processing
fee  therefor,  assign  all or a portion  of its  interests  in any Loans to the
Granting Lender or to any financial  institutions  (consented to by the Borrower
and the  Administrative  Agent) providing  liquidity and/or credit support to or
for the account of such SPC to support the funding or  maintenance  of Loans and
(ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency,  commercial  paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit or liquidity  enhancement  to such SPC. This section may not
be amended without the written consent of the SPC.

        (g) The Borrower  authorizes the Lenders to disclose to any  Participant
or Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective  Transferee,  any and all
financial information in the Lenders' possession concerning the Borrower and its
respective  Affiliates which has been delivered to the  Administrative  Agent or
the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower  pursuant to this Agreement or which
has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of
the Borrower in connection with the Lender's  credit  evaluation of the Borrower
and its respective Affiliates prior to



                                       73
<PAGE>



becoming  a party to this  Agreement;  provided  that each such  Transferee  and
prospective  Transferee  agrees  in  writing  to be bound by the  provisions  of
Section 9.8.

        (h) Nothing  herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or assigning
any Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law. In order
to facilitate  such pledge or assignment,  the Borrower hereby agrees that, upon
request  of any  Lender  at any time and from  time to time on or after the Cash
Collateral  Release  Date,  the Borrower  shall  provide to such Lender,  at the
Borrower's own expense,  a promissory note in substantially  the form of Exhibit
A-1.

        9.7  Adjustments;  Setoff(a) . (a) If any Lender (a "Benefited  Lender")
shall at any time  receive any payment of all or part of its Loans,  or interest
thereon,  or receive any collateral in respect thereof  (whether  voluntarily or
involuntarily,  by  setoff,  pursuant  to events or  proceedings  of the  nature
referred to in Section 7.1(f), or otherwise),  in a greater  proportion than any
such payment to or collateral  received by any other Lender,  if any, in respect
of such other Lender's Loans, or interest  thereon,  such Benefited Lender shall
purchase  for cash  from the  other  Lenders a  participating  interest  in such
portion of each such other Lender's  Loans,  or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral,  or the proceeds thereof,  as shall be
necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral or proceeds  ratably with each of the Lenders;  provided that
if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered
from such Benefited Lender,  such purchase shall be rescinded,  and the purchase
price and  benefits  returned,  to the  extent  of such  recovery,  but  without
interest.

        (b)  Upon the  occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of an Event of
Default,  in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right,  (without  prior notice to the  Borrower,  any
such notice being  expressly  waived by the Borrower to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law),  upon any amount  becoming  due and  payable  by the  Borrower
hereunder or under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise),  to setoff and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all
deposits  (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional  or final),  in any
currency,  and any other credits,  indebtedness or claims,  in any currency,  in
each case  whether  direct or  indirect,  absolute  or  contingent,  matured  or
unmatured,  at any time  held or owing by such  Lender  or any  branch or agency
thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.  Each Lender agrees
promptly  to notify the  Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent after any such
setoff and  application  made by such Lender;  provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

        9.8  Confidentiality.  Each  Lender  agrees to exercise  all  reasonable
efforts   (consistent  with  its  customary  methods  for  keeping   information
confidential)  to  keep  any  information  delivered  or made  available  by the
Borrower  confidential  from anyone other than  persons  employed or retained by
such Lender who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating,  approving,
structuring  or  administering  the Loans;  provided  that nothing  herein shall
prevent any Lender from disclosing such information (a) to any Affiliate of such
Lender or to any other Lender, (b) upon the order of any court or



                                       74
<PAGE>



administrative  agency,  (c) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency
or authority having  jurisdiction  over such Lender,  (d) that has been publicly
disclosed,  (e) in connection  with any litigation  relating to the Loans,  this
Agreement  or any  transaction  contemplated  hereby to which any  Lender or the
Administrative  Agent may be a party, (f) to the extent  reasonably  required in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (g) to such Lender's legal
counsel and independent auditors,  and (h) to any actual or proposed participant
or assignee  of all or any part of its Loans  hereunder,  if such other  Person,
prior to such disclosure, agrees, in writing, for the benefit of the Borrower to
comply with the provisions of this Section 9.8.

        9.9  Effectiveness.  This Agreement  shall become  effective on the date
when counterparts hereof executed on behalf of the Borrower,  the Administrative
Agent and each Lender shall have been received by the  Administrative  Agent and
notice  thereof  shall  have  been  given  by the  Administrative  Agent  to the
Borrower.

        9.10 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate  counterparts  (including by
telecopy),  and  all  said  counterparts  taken  together  shall  be  deemed  to
constitute  one and the same  instrument.  A set of the copies of this Agreement
signed by all the  parties  shall be lodged  with each of the  Borrower  and the
Administrative Agent.

        9.11  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited
or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  such  jurisdiction,  be
ineffective  to the  extent  of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof,  and any such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

        9.12 Integration.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent
the agreement of the  Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders with
respect to the subject  matter  hereof and  thereof,  and there are no promises,
undertakings,  representations or warranties by the Administrative  Agent or any
Lender  relative to subject  matter hereof or thereof not expressly set forth or
referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

        9.13  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE NOTES AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS  OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY, AND CONSTRUED AND  INTERPRETED  IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS THEREOF OTHER THAN
SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

        9.14   Submission  To   Jurisdiction;   Waivers.   The  Borrower  hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

        (a)  submits  for  itself  and  its  property  in any  legal  action  or
proceeding  relating to this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it
is a party, or for



                                       75

non-exclusive  general  jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the
courts of the United  States of America for the  Southern  District of New York,
and appellate courts from any thereof;

        (b) consents that any such action or  proceeding  may be brought in such
courts and waives any objection  that it may now or hereafter  have to the venue
of any such  action  or  proceeding  in any such  court or that  such  action or
proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

        (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding  may
be effected by mailing a copy thereof by  registered  or certified  mail (or any
substantially  similar form of mail),  postage prepaid, to the Borrower,  as the
case may be, at its address set forth in Section 9.2 or at such other address of
which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

        (d) agrees  that  nothing  contained  herein  shall  affect the right to
effect  service of process in any other  manner  permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

        (e) waives,  to the maximum  extent not  prohibited by law, any right it
may have to claim or recover in any legal  action or  proceeding  referred to in
this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

        9.15 Acknowledgments. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

        (a) Neither the  Administrative  Agent nor any Lender has any  fiduciary
relationship  with or duty to the Borrower  arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,  and the relationship between
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower,  on
the other hand, in  connection  herewith or therewith is solely that of creditor
and debtor; and

        (b) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or
otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions  contemplated  hereby between the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower.

        9.16 Waivers of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER,  THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT AND
THE LENDERS HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY AND  UNCONDITIONALLY  WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
