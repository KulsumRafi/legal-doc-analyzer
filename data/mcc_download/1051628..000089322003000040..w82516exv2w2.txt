     3.   Effective as of the Novation Date, Ceding Company hereby releases and
          discharges ALRe from and against any and all duties, obligations,

          connection with the Subject Agreement and shall look solely to XL for
          performance thereof.

     4.   From and after the Novation Date, the Ceding Company shall have no
          further duties, obligations, and/or liabilities whatsoever, express or
          implied, to ALRe under or in connection with the Subject Agreement,
          but any such duties, obligations, and/or liabilities theretofore
          existing shall continue as duties, obligations, and/or liabilities of
          the Ceding Company to XL.

     5.   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Novation Agreement or in
          the Subject Agreement, the Ceding Company shall not have the right to
          cede any policies under the Subject Agreement with an issue date after
