                                   ARTICLE II

                                 GRANT OF OPTION

2.1      Grant of Option

         In consideration of Employee's agreement to remain in the employ of
         Company or its subsidiaries and for other good and valuable
         consideration, on the date hereof the Company irrevocably

                                        2

<PAGE>

         grants to Employee the option to purchase any part or all of an
         aggregate of * shares of its $1.00 par value common stock upon the
         terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Such Option is
         granted pursuant to the Plan and shall also be subject to the terms and
         conditions set forth in the Plan.

2.2      Purchase Price

         The purchase price of the shares of stock covered by the Option shall
         be __________ dollars ($_____) per share without commission or other
         charge.

2.3      Consideration to Company

         In consideration of the granting of this Option by the Company, the
         Employee agrees to render faithful and efficient service to the Company
         or a Subsidiary, with such duties and responsibilities as the Company
         shall from time to time prescribe, for a period of at least one (1)
         year from the date this Option is granted (unless the Employee retires
         before the end of such period and the Employee satisfies the
         requirements of the last paragraph of Section 3.1(a) below). Nothing in
         this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Employee any right
         to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or shall
         interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge the
         Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good
         cause. Nor shall it interfere with or restrict in any way, other than
         the forfeiture of all rights under this Agreement, the right of the
         Employee voluntarily to terminate his employment with the Company or a
         Subsidiary.

2.4      Adjustments in Option

         In the event that the outstanding shares of the stock subject to the

         merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
         split-up, stock dividend, or combination of shares, the Committee shall
         make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of
         shares as to which the Option, or portions thereof then unexercised,
         shall be exercisable. Such adjustment shall be made with the intent
         that after the change or exchange of shares, the Employee's
         proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the occurrence of
         such event. Such adjustment in the Option may include a necessary
         corresponding adjustment in the option price per share, but shall be
         made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised
         portion of the Option (except for any change in the aggregate price
         resulting from rounding-off of share quantities or prices).

                                   ARTICLE III

                            PERIOD OF EXERCISABILITY

3.1      Commencement of Exercisability

         (a)      The Option will vest (become available for exercise) nine
                  years and nine months from the date the Option was granted.
                  However, if certain conditions are met, the Option will become
                  eligible for accelerated or early vesting three years from the
                  date the Option was

----------
* Refer to the attached Notice.

                                        3

<PAGE>

                  granted or on subsequent anniversary dates thereafter.

                  Such early or accelerated vesting will occur provided that the
                  Company's return on total capital as reported in the annual
                  report to shareholders (or other report) for the most recently
                  completed fiscal year equals or exceeds the sixty-seventh
                  (67%) percentile of the return on total capital for the peer
                  group companies (as listed in the Company's proxy statement)
                  for such third year (the performance test). (For example, the
                  performance test for accelerated vesting for options granted
                  in December 2002 will be based on the return on total capital
                  for 2005).

                  To facilitate the peer group performance comparison needed to
                  determine whether option vesting is accelerated, the figures
                  for peer group companies return on total capital will be based
                  upon the twelve-month performance for each company in the peer
                  group closest to the Company's fiscal year end, using the most
                  recent publicly available financial information for such
                  companies.

                  If the Company meets the performance test described above, all
                  prior non-vested Options eligible for accelerated vesting will
                  become available for exercise as soon as possible following
                  the Committee's certifications of the Company's performance as
                  compared to the performance of the peer group companies.

                  If the Company fails to meet the performance test described
                  above, all prior non-vested Options eligible for accelerated
                  vesting will be subject to a similar performance test
                  following the end of the next fiscal year. The test for
                  accelerated vesting of Options will continue to "roll" in the
                  manner described above until the Company passes the
                  performance test, until nine years and nine months have
                  elapsed from the date of grant, or until such Options
                  otherwise vest as described herein.

                  Alternatively, Options, granted to employees as participants
                  in the Long Term Incentive Plan, who (i) retire under the
                  Company's retirement plan within sixty (60) days of the date
                  of Termination of Employment, (ii) have worked for the Company
                  for ten (10) or more years, and (iii) have a combination of
                  age and service with the Company of seventy five (75) or more,
                  will vest as of the date of Termination of Employment,
                  provided that the Company has met the performance test (as
                  described above) for the fiscal year ending prior to the
                  employee's retirement.

         (b)      No portion of the Option which is unexercisable under
                  Subsection (a) above at Termination of Employment shall
                  thereafter become exercisable.

         (c)      Notwithstanding Subsections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) above, and
                  Section 3.4 below, upon a Change of Control, all Option
                  installments not yet exercisable shall become immediately
                  exercisable; provided, however, that if all or a portion of
                  the Option installments which otherwise would become
                  exercisable pursuant to this Subsection 3.1(c) is determined
                  by the Committee to constitute, when exercised, a "parachute
                  payment" as defined by Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
                  Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), such Option
                  installments or portion thereof shall not become exercisable
                  upon the Change of Control. In making this determination
                  pursuant to the preceding sentence the Committee shall first
                  take into account any payments to the Employee contingent on a
                  change in the ownership or control of the Company or its
                  assets (as provided in said Section 280G) under any other
                  agreement or arrangement between the Company and Employee,

                                        4

<PAGE>

                  exclusive of any agreement which is not subject to Section
                  280G because of Section 67(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984.
                  Subsection 3.1(c) shall be final and binding upon Employee.

3.2      Term of Option

         The Option will expire and will not, under any condition, be
         exercisable after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date the Option
         was granted. Such date shall be the Option's Expiration Date.

3.3      Exercise of Option after Termination of Employment

         This Option is exercisable by the Employee only while he is employed by
         the Company or a Subsidiary, subject to the following exceptions (or as
         authorized by the Committee):

         (a)      If the Employee dies while the Option is exercisable under the
                  terms of this Agreement, the Employee's Beneficiary may
                  exercise such rights, subject to the limitation in Subsection
                  3.1(b). The Option must be exercised within twelve (12) months
                  after the Employee's death, and the Committee may in its
                  discretion extend the Expiration Date of the Option to
                  accommodate such exercise.

         (b)      If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his

                  permanent and total disability, as defined in Section 22(c)(3)
                  of the Code, the Employee may exercise the Option, subject to
                  the limitation in Subsection 3.1(b), within twelve (12) months
                  after Termination of Employment, but not later than the
                  Option's Expiration Date.

         (c)      If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his
                  retirement, the Employee may exercise the Option, subject to
                  the limitations of Subsection 3.1(b), within sixty (60) months
                  after Termination of Employment, but not later than the
                  Option's Expiration Date.

         (d)      If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his
                  retirement at or after age fifty-five (55) and such Employee
                  continues as a director of the Company, the Employee may
                  exercise the Option to the same extent as he would be able to
                  exercise it if he continued to be employed, until the earlier
                  of two (2) years after he ceases to be a director of the
                  Company or the Option's Expiration Date.

         (e)      If the Employee's employment is terminated other than for good
                  cause or the reasons set forth in Subsections (a) through (d)
                  above, the Employee may exercise the Option, subject to the
                  limitations of Subsection 3.1(b), within three (3) months
                  after Termination of Employment, but not later than the
                  Option's Expiration Date.

3.4      Exercise of Option Upon Merger or Consolidation

         (a)      Notwithstanding Section 3.3, the Option may not be exercised
                  to any extent by anyone after the effective date of either the
                  merger or consolidation of the Company into another
                  corporation, the exchange of all or substantially all of the
                  assets of the Company for the securities of another
                  corporation, the acquisition by another corporation of 80% or
                  more of the Company's then outstanding voting stock, or the
                  liquidation or dissolution of the Company. At least ten (10)
                  days prior to the effective date of such merger,
                  consolidation, exchange, acquisition, liquidation, or
                  dissolution, the Committee shall give the

<PAGE>

                  Employee notice of such event if the Option has then neither
                  been fully exercised nor become unexercisable due to the
                  passage of the specified time period in Subsection (b) below.

         (b)      In the event of such merger, consolidation, exchange,
                  liquidation, or dissolution, the Committee may, in its
                  absolute discretion and on such terms and conditions as it
                  deems appropriate, provide by resolution adopted prior to such
                  event and incorporated in the notice referred to in Subsection
                  (a) above, that for a specified period of time prior to the
                  effective date of such event, the Option shall be exercisable
                  as to all shares covered hereby, notwithstanding that the
                  Option may not yet have become fully exercisable under
                  Subsection 3.1(a).

                                   ARTICLE IV

         unexercisable under Section 3.2. Each partial exercise shall be for not
         less than twenty-five (25) shares (or a smaller number, if it is the
