<PAGE>
          (g)     At and as of the Learning Curve Effective Time, each share of
common  stock  of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Learning
Curve  Effective  Time shall, by virtue of the Learning Curve Merger and without
any action on the part of any Party, be converted into and become one fully paid
and  nonassessable  share  of  common  stock  of  the  Learning  Curve Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the  Learning  Curve Surviving Corporation.  No shares of capital stock of Sub I
shall be deemed to be outstanding or to have any rights after the Learning Curve

     2.5     Anti-Dilution  Adjustment.  If,  subsequent  to the date hereof and
             -------------------------
prior to the Learning Curve Effective Time, RCE shall change or declare a change
in  the  number  of RCE Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable  for  RCE Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Learning Curve
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split, stock dividend or
distribution,  recapitalization,  merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange
offer  or  other similar transaction, then in each such case, from and after the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive such RCE Shares
or  other  securities,  an  appropriate adjustment (if any) shall be made to the
conversion  formula  set  forth in section 2.4(e)(iii)[a] above, for purposes of
determining  the  number  of Merger Shares into which the Learning Curve Class C
Common  Shares  shall  be  converted  to  the  extent  necessary to preserve the
proportional interest of the Merger Shares.  For purposes hereof, the payment of
a  dividend  in  RCE  Shares,  or  the  distribution on RCE Shares in securities
convertible into RCE Shares, shall be deemed to have effected an increase in the
number  of  outstanding  RCE Shares equal to the number of RCE Shares into which
such securities shall be initially convertible without the payment by the holder
thereof  of  any consideration other than the surrender for cancellation of such
convertible  securities.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, this section shall not
apply  to  any stock options issued under option plans of RCE existing as of the
date  of  this  Agreement.

     2.6     Dissenting  Shares.
             ------------------

          (a)     Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement
to  the  contrary,  any  Learning  Curve Shares that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Learning Curve Effective Time that are held by stockholders who (i)
have  not  consented  to the Learning Curve Merger, (ii) have demanded appraisal
rights  for  such  Learning  Curve  Shares  in accordance with the provisions of
section 262 of Delaware Law (if such provisions provide for appraisal rights for
such  Learning  Curve  Shares)  and (iii) have not failed to perfect or have not
effectively withdrawn such demand or otherwise lost their appraisal rights (each
a  "Dissenting  Share"  and  collectively,  the  "Dissenting  Shares"),  shall

                                       22
<PAGE>
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant  to  this Article II.  Such stockholders shall be entitled to have such
Learning  Curve  Shares  held by them appraised in accordance with Delaware Law,
except  that  all  Dissenting  Shares  held  by  stockholders who have failed to
perfect or have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost their right to appraisal
of  such  Learning  Curve Shares under Delaware Law shall thereupon be deemed to
have  been  converted  into,  and  to  have  become  exchangeable for, as of the
Learning  Curve  Effective  Time,  the right to receive the Merger Consideration
issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, upon surrender of the
certificates  that formerly represented such Learning Curve Shares in accordance
with  section  2.8  hereof.

          (b)     Learning Curve shall give RCE prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal  received  by  it, withdrawals of demands for appraisal, and any other
instrument  served  on  it  by  a  stockholder  pursuant  to  Delaware  Law.

     2.7     No  Fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
             ---------------------
Agreement, no certificates or scrip for fractional RCE Shares shall be issued in
the  Learning Curve Merger, and any fractional interests of RCE Shares resulting
from the calculations provided in section 2.4 hereof shall not entitle the owner
thereof  to  vote  such  fractional  shares or to any other rights of a security
holder  with  respect  thereto.  Each  holder of Learning Curve Shares who would
otherwise  have  been  entitled to receive a fraction of a RCE Share pursuant to
this  Article  II shall, in lieu thereof, be paid an amount in cash equal to $15
per  RCE  Share.  For  purposes  of  determining  whether  and  to what extent a
stockholder  is  entitled  to  receive a RCE Share in lieu of a fractional share
pursuant  to  this section 2.7, the Learning Curve Shares held of record by such
stockholder  and represented by two or more stock certificates of Learning Curve
shall  be  aggregated.

     2.8     Procedure  for  Exchange.
             ------------------------

          (a)     Immediately  prior  to the Learning Curve Effective Time, RCE
shall  deposit  with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., or such other exchange agent
selected  by  RCE  and  reasonably  acceptable to Learning Curve, (the "Exchange
Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Learning Curve Shares, for exchange in
accordance  with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, cash, including the
Cash  Consideration, and certificates representing the Merger Shares (such cash,
certificates  for Merger Shares, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any),
together  with  any  dividends  or  distributions  with  respect  thereto, being
hereinafter  referred to as the "Exchange Fund") payable or issuable pursuant to
section  2.4(e)  in  exchange  for  the  outstanding  Learning  Curve  Shares.


                                       23
<PAGE>
          (b)     As  soon  as  reasonably practicable after the Learning Curve
Effective  Time,  the  Exchange  Agent  shall mail or personally deliver to each
holder of record (or his or her attorney-in-fact) of Learning Curve Shares which
were converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and/or Merger Shares
pursuant  to  section  2.4(e) and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any) and
the  other  Merger  Consideration  pursuant  to  section 2.4(e), (i) a letter of
transmittal  (which  shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Learning  Curve  Effective  Time,  represented outstanding Learning Curve Shares
(the  "Certificates")  shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange  Agent  and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as RCE
may  reasonably  specify),  and  (ii)  instructions  for  use  in  effecting the
surrender  of  the  Certificates  in  exchange  for  Cash  Consideration  and/or
certificates  representing  Merger  Shares (together, the "Exchange Documents").
With  respect  to  any  Conversion  Shares,  the Certificate for such Conversion
Shares  may  be  represented  by  a  certificate representing the Learning Curve
Preferred  Shares  which  have  converted  into  Conversion  Shares prior to the
Learning Curve Effective Time.  Upon request of Learning Curve not less than ten
Business  Days  prior  to the Learning Curve Effective Time, RCE shall cause the
Exchange  Documents  to  be  delivered  to  all of the holders of Learning Curve
Shares  identified  by Learning Curve.  At the Learning Curve Effective Time and
upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with  such  letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall  be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Cash Consideration and/or
a  certificate representing that number of whole Merger Shares which such holder
has  the  right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the  provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all Learning Curve
Shares then held by such holder) and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any),
and  the  Certificate  so  surrendered  shall forthwith be canceled and the Cash
Consideration  and/or  cash  in  lieu  of  fractional  shares and/or certificate
representing  Merger  Shares  shall  be  sent as promptly as practicable to such
holder;  provided,  however,  that any holder of a Certificate who, prior to the
Closing  Date,  surrenders  such  Certificate  for  cancellation to the Exchange
Agent,  together  with  such  letter  of  transmittal,  duly  executed, and wire
transfer  instructions  in  proper  form  shall  be entitled to receive the Cash
Consideration  and  cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder
has  the  right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the  provisions  of  this  Article  II  by  wire transfer on the Closing Date in
accordance  with  such wire transfer instructions as well as, if applicable, the
delivery,  on  the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable,
of  a  certificate  representing  that  number of whole Merger Shares which such
holder  has  a  right  to  receive.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  Cash
Consideration  payable  to a holder of a Certificate shall be net of the amounts
due,  if  any, as of the Closing Date by such holder to Learning Curve under any
Stock  Option  Loan  to  which  such  holder  is  a  party.  In  the  event

                                       24
<PAGE>
of  a  transfer of ownership of Learning Curve Shares which is not registered in
the  transfer  records of Learning Curve, Cash Consideration and/or cash in lieu
of  fractional  shares  and/or  a  certificate representing the proper number of
Merger Shares may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Learning  Curve  Shares  is  presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable  stock  transfer taxes have been paid.  The Exchange Agent shall make
reasonable  efforts  to  make  available  additional  letters of transmittal and
instructions  to  all  such persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Learning  Curve  Shares.  Until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by  this section
2.8(b),  each  Certificate  shall be deemed at any time after the Learning Curve
Effective  Time  to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender Cash
Consideration and/or the certificate representing Merger Shares and cash in lieu
of  any  fractional  Merger  Shares  as  well as the rights to any Participants'
Working  Capital  Adjustment,  Participants'  Earnout  Consideration  and Escrow
Participation  Amount  as  contemplated  by  section  2.4(e).

          (c)     RCE  shall  not  pay any dividend or make any distribution on
RCE Shares, with a record date at or after the Learning Curve Effective Time, to
any  record  holder  of  Learning  Curve  Shares  unless  and  until  the holder
surrenders  for  exchange  the  stock  certificate or certificates that formerly
represented  the  holder's  Learning  Curve  Shares.  RCE  instead shall pay the
dividend or make the distribution to the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit
of  the  holder pending the surrender and exchange.  No holder of Learning Curve
Shares  shall  be  entitled  to  any  interest  or  earnings  on the dividend or
distribution  held in trust by the Exchange Agent pending receipt thereof by the
holder  upon  surrender  for  exchange of the Learning Curve Share certificates.

          (d)     In  the  event  any  certificate  representing Learning Curve
Shares  shall  have  been  lost,  stolen,  or  destroyed,  upon the making of an
affidavit  of  such  fact by the Person claiming such certificate has been lost,
stolen,  or  destroyed,  and  if reasonably required by RCE, the posting by such
Person  of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be
made  against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
in  exchange  for  such  documentation  of  the  lost,  stolen,  or  destroyed
certificate,  the  applicable  Cash  Consideration,  RCE  Shares  and any unpaid
dividends  or  other  distributions  in  respect  thereof.

          (e)     RCE  may  terminate  the Exchange Fund and cause the Exchange
Agent  to  return  any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed 180 days
after  the Closing Date, and thereafter each remaining record holder of Learning
Curve  Shares who has not surrendered for exchange the certificates representing
the  Learning  Curve  Shares  shall  be  entitled  to  look  to  RCE (subject to

                                       25
<PAGE>
abandoned  property,  escheat,  and  other  similar  Laws) as a general creditor
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled
upon  surrendering  for  exchange  the  stock  certificate  or certificates that
formerly  represented  the  holder's Learning Curve Shares.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  none  of  RCE,  the  Learning Curve Surviving Corporation, LC SUB II
Surviving  Corporation,  LC SUB III Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent
shall  be liable to any Escrow and Earnout Participants for any amounts properly
delivered  to  a  public  official  pursuant  to  applicable abandoned property,
escheat,  or  similar  Laws.

          (f)     RCE  shall  pay  all fees, expenses, and other charges of the
Exchange  Agent.

     2.9     Closing  of Stock Transfer Records.  After the close of business on
             ----------------------------------
the  Closing Date, no transfer of Learning Curve Shares outstanding prior to the
Closing  Date  shall  be  registered  in  the stock transfer records of Learning
Curve.

     2.10     Learning  Curve  Stock  Options  and  Warrants.
              ----------------------------------------------

          (a)     Pursuant  to  section  III.A  of  Article Two of the Learning
Curve Stock Option Plan, any Learning Curve Common Shares subject to outstanding
Learning  Curve  Stock  Options  shall  vest in full so that such Learning Curve
Stock  Options  shall,  immediately  prior to the Learning Curve Effective Time,
become  fully  exercisable  for  all  the  Learning Curve Shares subject to such
Learning  Curve Stock Options.  All Learning Curve Stock Options shall terminate
and  cease to be outstanding or of any force or effect immediately following the
Learning  Curve  Effective Time pursuant to section III.C. of Article Two of the
Learning  Curve  Stock  Option  Plan  and  neither  Learning  Curve nor the Plan
Administrator  (as  defined  in the Learning Curve Stock Option Plan) shall take
any  action to cause or permit any of the Learning Curve Stock Options to remain
outstanding  or  be  assumed  by  RCE  or  any  of  its Subsidiaries immediately
following  the  Learning  Curve  Effective  Time  or  to  otherwise  fail  to be
terminated  and  of no force or effect pursuant to section III.C. of Article Two
of the Learning Curve Stock Option Plan immediately following the Learning Curve
Effective Time.  Learning Curve shall require any holder of Learning Curve Stock
Options  who  exercises  any  Learning  Curve  Stock  Options at or prior to the
Learning Curve Effective Time to remit to Learning Curve an amount sufficient to
satisfy  any federal, state and local tax withholding requirements to the extent
not  withheld  by  Learning  Curve.

          (b)     Learning Curve shall give notice of the Learning Curve Merger
to  the  holder  of  the  Blair  Warrant,  which  notice shall (i) comply in all
respects  with  the  requirements of section 7 of the Blair Warrant, and (ii) be
received  by  the  holder  of  the  Blair Warrant more than 20 days prior to the
Closing  Date.  The  Blair  Warrant  shall  terminate  upon  the  Learning Curve
Effective  Time  pursuant  to  section  7  of  the  Blair  Warrant.

<PAGE>
          (c)     Not  less  than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Learning  Curve  shall  provide RCE with a copy of the HIT Letter, signed by the
HIT  Licensor,  together  with payment instructions to submit the HIT Payment to
the  HIT Licensor.  On the Closing Date, RCE shall, on behalf of Learning Curve,
pay  the  HIT  Payment  to  the  HIT  Licensor  in  accordance with such payment
instructions.  Once  RCE  pays the HIT Payment to the HIT Licensor in accordance
with  such payment instructions, the HIT Obligation shall terminate and be of no
further  force  or  effect  and  no further payment to the HIT Licensor shall be
required from RCE or the Learning Curve Surviving Corporation in connection with
the  HIT  Obligation  except  for  the  Other  HIT  Consideration.

          (d)     Learning  Curve  shall  ensure  that  no Learning Curve Stock
Options  or  other  Derivative  Securities of Learning Curve (including, but not
limited  to,  the Blair Warrant and the HIT Obligation) shall remain outstanding
upon  the  consummation  of  the  Learning Curve Merger and no shares of capital
stock  of  Learning  Curve  or the Learning Curve Surviving Corporation shall be
issued  or  outstanding with respect to any such Learning Curve Stock Options or
other  Derivative Securities upon the consummation of the Learning Curve Merger.

     2.11     Escrow.  At  the  Closing,  RCE  shall  deposit  $12,000,000  (the
              ------
"Escrow  Amount")  and deliver the Escrow Amount to an escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent") as described herein, to be held by the Escrow Agent to secure the rights
of  RCE and any other RCE Indemnitee to (i) indemnity under Article VII and (ii)
any  Post-Closing  Working Capital Adjustment that may be due to RCE pursuant to
section  2.12  below, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow  Agreement.  RCE shall also (x) deposit into the Escrow Account an amount
equal  to  the  tax  benefit, if any, of the part of the Other HIT Consideration
relating  to the Participants' Earnout Consideration, if any, promptly following
the  final  determination  of  the  Earnout  Payment  and the amount of such tax
benefit, if any, and (y) deposit into the Escrow Account for distribution to the
Escrow and Earnout Participants pursuant to the Escrow Agreement an amount equal
to  the tax benefit, if any, of the part of the Other HIT Consideration relating
to  the  Escrow  Participation Amount, if any, promptly following the end of the
Escrow  Period and the final determination of the amount of such tax benefit, if
any.  The  Escrow  Amount  shall  be  held  pursuant  to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.  The  Escrow  Amount will be held by the Escrow Agent for a period to
end  as  set  forth  in  the  Escrow  Agreement (the "Escrow Period"); provided,
however, that in the event RCE has made a claim under the Escrow Agreement prior
to  the end of the Escrow Period, then the Escrow Period shall continue (and the
Escrow Agent will continue to hold, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement some
or  all  of  the Escrow Amount, as required by the Escrow Agreement), until such
claim  is  fully  and finally resolved, all as provided in the Escrow Agreement.
In the event that this Agreement is adopted by the holders of the Learning Curve


                                       27
<PAGE>
Shares,  then  all such holders shall, without any further act of any holder, be
deemed  to  have  consented  to and approved (i) the use of the Escrow Amount to
secure  the  rights  of  RCE and the Learning Curve Surviving Corporation in the
manner set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) the appointment of
the  Shareholder Representatives as the representatives of the persons receiving
Merger  Consideration under this Agreement and as the attorney-in-fact and agent
for and on behalf of each such person (other than holders of Dissenting Shares).
RCE shall promptly deliver a notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to section 5(h)
of  the  Escrow Agreement, with a copy to the Shareholder Representatives, after
the  Litigation  has  resolved  by  a settlement agreement or a Court Order of a
court  or  other  tribunal  of  competent  jurisdiction  and time for appeal has
expired  and  no  appeal  has  been  perfected as more particularly described in
section  5(h)  of  the  Escrow  Agreement.

              ----------------------------------------

          (a)     Preliminary  Closing  Working Capital Adjustment.  On or prior

furnish  to  RCE the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and a statement (the
"Learning  Curve  Closing  Statement")  setting  forth  the  Preliminary Closing
Working  Capital  Adjustment.  Learning  Curve  shall  prepare  the  Preliminary
Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet and the Learning Curve Closing Statement, and make
the  calculations  set forth therein, in good faith and in accordance with GAAP,
and,  to  extent the principles used by Learning Curve are consistent with GAAP,
the  principles  will  be applied consistent with the most recent Learning Curve
Financial  Statements.  Learning Curve shall consult with RCE in the preparation
of  the Learning Curve Closing Statement and shall provide to RCE for its review
any  work  papers,  schedules  and other documents prepared by Learning Curve in
connection  with  its preparation of the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet.

          (b)     Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment.  Promptly, but in no
                   ---------------------------------------
event  later  than  five  Business  Days  after  the  final determination of the
Post-Closing  Working  Capital Adjustment pursuant to section 2.12(c) below, one
of  the  following  adjustments  shall  be  made:

               (i)     If  the  Post-Closing  Working  Capital  Adjustment  is a
negative  number,  RCE shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to release
to  RCE  from  the  Escrow  Account  an amount equal to the Post-Closing Working
Capital  Adjustment.

               (ii)     If  the  Post-Closing  Working  Capital  Adjustment is a
positive  number,  RCE shall promptly pay to the Escrow and Earnout Participants
an  amount  equal  to the Participants' Working Capital Adjustment to which each
such  holder  is  entitled.

          (c)     Determination  of  Post-Closing  Working  Capital Adjustment.
                   ------------------------------------------------------------
The  Post-Closing  Working  Capital  Adjustment  shall  be  determined  as  of
immediately  prior  to  the  Learning  Curve  Effective Time on the basis of the
consolidated  balance  sheet  of Learning Curve and its subsidiaries immediately
prior  to  the Learning Curve Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet").  The
Closing  Balance Sheet shall be prepared by RCE in accordance with GAAP, and, to
extent  the  principles  used  by  Learning  Curve are consistent with GAAP, the
principles  will  be  applied  consistent  with  the  most recent Learning Curve
Financial  Statements.  RCE shall deliver to the Shareholder Representatives the
Closing  Balance  Sheet within 45 days after the Closing Date.  KPMG LLP or such
other  independent accounting firm engaged by the Shareholder Representatives at
the  sole expense of the Escrow and Earnout Participants (which shall not be the
Unrelated  Accounting  Firm  referred  to below) ("Shareholders' Auditor") shall
have the opportunity to observe the taking of the inventory of Learning Curve in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, and to examine the
work  papers,  schedules  and other documents prepared by RCE in connection with
its  preparation  of  the  Closing  Balance Sheet.  The fees and expenses of the
Shareholders'  Auditor  pursuant to this section 2.12(c) and section 2.13 may be
deducted  from  the  Escrow  Account  in an amount not to exceed $100,000 in the
aggregate.  Within  30 days following the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet,
the  Shareholder  Representatives  shall deliver to RCE a notice of objection (a
"Balance  Sheet  Objection  Notice") or a notice of acceptance (a "Balance Sheet
Acceptance  Notice")  with  respect  to the Closing Balance Sheet.  Such Closing
Balance  Sheet  shall  be  final  and  binding on the parties if a Balance Sheet
Acceptance Notice is delivered to RCE or if no Balance Sheet Objection Notice is
delivered  to RCE within such 30 day period.  Any Balance Sheet Objection Notice
shall  specify in reasonable detail the items on the Closing Balance Sheet which
are  disputed  and  shall  describe  in  reasonable  detail  the  basis  for the
objection,  as  well  as  the  amount  in dispute.  If a Balance Sheet Objection
Notice  is  given, the parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
objection.  If  the parties are unable to reach agreement within 20 days after a
Balance  Sheet  Objection  Notice  has been given, any unresolved disputed items
shall  be  promptly  referred  to  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or another firm of
independent  public  accountants  mutually acceptable to RCE and the Shareholder
Representatives  (the  "Unrelated  Accounting  Firm").  The Unrelated Accounting
Firm  shall  be  directed  to render a written report on the unresolved disputed
issues  with  respect  to  the  Closing  Balance  Sheet within 30 days after the
dispute  is  submitted  to  them and to resolve only those issues of dispute set
forth  in  the Balance Sheet Objection Notice.  The resolution of the dispute by
the  Unrelated  Accounting  Firm shall be final and binding on the parties.  The
fees and expenses of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by RCE
and  the  Escrow and Earnout Participants (and RCE shall be authorized to deduct
such  amount  that  the Escrow and Earnout Participants are responsible for from
the  Escrow  Account  after  abiding  by  the  procedures  set  forth  therein).

after the final determination of the Earnout Payment pursuant to section 2.13(b)
below,  RCE  shall pay to the Escrow and Earnout Participants an amount equal to
the  Participants'  Earnout Consideration to which each such holder is entitled.

          (b)     The  amount of the Earnout Payment shall be determined on the
basis  of  the  consolidated  income  statement  of  Learning  Curve  and  its
subsidiaries  for  the  year  ending December 31, 2003 (the "Income Statement").
The  Income  Statement  shall  be  prepared  by  RCE  in  accordance  with GAAP,
consistent  with  RCE  current  practices  and  policies,  and  shall  include a
certificate  of  RCE's  Chief  Financial  Officer  regarding  the  amount of the
Learning  Curve  Net  Sales  and  the Learning Curve Trading Margin for the year
ending December 31, 2003 as well as the calculation of the amount of the Earnout
Payment.  RCE  shall  deliver  to  the  Shareholder  Representatives  the Income
Statement  by  March  15,  2004.  The  Shareholders'  Auditor  shall  have  the
opportunity  to  examine the work papers, schedules and other documents prepared
by  RCE  in  connection with its preparation of the Income Statement.  Within 30
days  following  the  delivery  of  the  Income  Statement,  the  Shareholder
Representatives shall deliver to RCE a notice of objection (an "Income Statement
Objection  Notice")  or  a notice of acceptance (an "Income Statement Acceptance
Notice")  with  respect  to the Income Statement.  The Income Statement shall be
final  and  binding  on  the parties if an Income Statement Acceptance Notice is
delivered  to RCE or if no Income Statement Objection Notice is delivered to RCE
within  such 30 day period.  Any Income Statement Objection Notice shall specify
in  reasonable  detail  the items on the Income Statement which are disputed and
shall  describe in reasonable detail the basis for the objection, as well as the
amount  in  dispute.  If  an  Income  Statement  Objection  Notice is given, the
parties  shall  consult  with  each other with respect to the objection.  If the
parties  are  unable to reach agreement within 20 days after an Income Statement
Objection Notice has been given, any unresolved disputed items shall be promptly
referred  to the Unrelated Accounting Firm.  The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall
be  directed  to  render a written report on the unresolved disputed issues with
respect to the Income Statement within 30 days after the dispute is submitted to
them  and  to  resolve  only  those  issues  of  dispute set forth in the Income
Statement  Objection  Notice.  The  resolution  of  the dispute by the Unrelated
Accounting  Firm  shall  be  final  and  binding  on  the parties.  The fees and
expenses  of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by RCE and the
Escrow  and  Earnout  Participants  (and  RCE shall be authorized to deduct such
amount  that  the  Escrow  and Earnout Participants are responsible for from the
Escrow  Account  after  abiding  by  the  procedures  set  forth  therein).

recognition  of  expenses taken into account in calculating the Earnout Payment;
and (iv) RCE will not, and will not cause any of the Affiliated Companies or any
other  Subsidiary  of  RCE  to,  dispose  of  or  take  any  actions intended to

business  relating  to  the  sale  of  any  products  included within any of the

protection of its Affiliated Company Intellectual Property have been timely paid
or,  if  not  timely  paid,  paid  late together with the payment of any fees or
penalties  required  in order for such late payment to not result in any adverse
effect  on  the Affiliated Company's current use or ownership of such Affiliated
Company  Intellectual  Property.  To  Learning  Curve's Knowledge, no Affiliated
Company  is required to pay any royalty, honorarium, fee, or other amount to any
Person  for  its  use of any Affiliated Company Intellectual Property other than
(i)  fees  and payments to the respective government offices required to be paid
by  the  Affiliated  Company  for  obtaining  and  maintaining protection of the
Affiliated  Company  Intellectual  Property and (ii) royalties and other license
fees  under  Contracts  with respect to Licensed Affiliated Company Intellectual
Property.  Any  Affiliated  Company's use of any of the Owned Affiliated Company
Intellectual  Property  and,  to Learning Curve's Knowledge, any of the Licensed
Affiliated Company Intellectual Property, does not infringe or has not infringed
any  Intellectual  Property  right  of any Person, nor has it, through such use,
misappropriated or improperly used or disclosed any Intellectual Property of any
Person.  Except  as  disclosed  in  section  3.19  of  the  Affiliated  Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Learning Curve,
threatened  claim,  charge,  demand,  inquiry,  investigation,  action,  suit,
arbitration,  or  other legal proceeding relating to any of the Owned Affiliated
Company  Intellectual  Property.  Except  as  disclosed  in  section 3.19 of the
Affiliated  Company  Disclosure  Schedule,  there  is  no pending claim, charge,
demand,  inquiry,  investigation,  actions,  suit,  arbitration,  or other legal
proceeding  against  any  Affiliated  Company  relating  to  any of the Licensed
Affiliated  Company  Intellectual  Property,  or,  to  the Knowledge of Learning
Curve,  any  threatened  claim, charge, demand, inquiry, investigation, actions,
suit,  arbitration,  or  other  legal proceeding relating to any of the Licensed
Affiliated Company Intellectual Property or, to the Knowledge of Learning Curve,
any  pending  claim,  charge,  demand,  inquiry,  investigation,  actions, suit,
arbitration,  or  other legal proceeding against any licensor relating to any of
the  Licensed  Affiliated Company Intellectual Property.  Following the Learning
Curve  Merger  and  the  other  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, an
Affiliated  Company  will continue to own or have the uninterrupted right to use
the  Affiliated  Company  Intellectual  Property  pursuant to the same terms and
conditions  existing  on  the  date  hereof.

employment,  wages and hours, occupational health and safety, and the employment
of  nonresidents,  except  for  such  instances  of  noncompliance  that  in the
aggregate  have  not had and could reasonably be expected not to have a Material
Adverse  Effect.  There  is  no  outstanding  and  unresolved  written  claim or
grievance,  unfair labor practice charge or complaint, charge of discrimination,
or  health  and  safety  citation  or  complaint involving any present or former
employee or other personnel retained by an Affiliated Company other than routine
individual  grievances.  There  is  no  pending or, to the Knowledge of Learning
Curve,  threatened  claim, charge, demand, inquiry, investigation, action, suit,
arbitration,  or  other  legal  proceeding  concerning  any Affiliated Company's
employment  practices.  No  Affiliated  Company  is  a  party  to any collective
bargaining agreement or other Contract with any labor union and has not received
written  notice  of  any  labor  organizational  efforts  with  respect  to  its
employees.  No  Affiliated  Company  has  experienced any strike, organized work

              ------------------------

          (a)     All  Employee  Benefit  Plans  maintained  or  operated by an
Affiliated Company or an ERISA Affiliate of an Affiliated Company or under which

adopted  by  Learning  Curve  has  received  a  favorable  opinion  letter dated
September 18, 2001 with respect to its prototype non-standardized profit sharing
plan.  To the Knowledge of Learning Curve, no act, omission, event, development,
condition,  or  circumstance  has  occurred  or is existing that would cause any
Employee  Benefit  Plan  to  become  disqualified  for  purposes of Code section
401(a).  No  Affiliated Company has any trust which is intended to qualify under
Code  section  501(c)(9).  Each Affiliated Company is, and each Employee Benefit
Plan is maintained and operated, in compliance with all applicable Laws relating
to  Employee  Benefit  Plans (including, without limitation, Code section 401(a)
and  ERISA)  and  all  the  terms of such Employee Benefit Plan, except for such
instances  of  noncompliance  that  in  the  aggregate  have  not  had and could
reasonably  be  expected  not  to have a Material Adverse Effect.  No Affiliated
Company  has  incurred  any  Liability  to  the  IRS,  the  DOL,  or the PBGC in
connection  with  any  Employee  Benefit  Plan.

          (c)     Except as disclosed in section 3.24 of the Affiliated Company
Disclosure  Schedule,  neither  an Affiliated Company nor any of its officers or
directors,  has  taken  any  action  directly  or  indirectly which obligates an
Affiliated  Company  to institute or modify or change any Employee Benefit Plan,
any  actuarial  or  other  assumption used to calculate funding obligations with
respect to any of the Affiliated Company's Employee Benefit Plans, or the manner
in  which  contributions  to  any  of the Employee Benefit Plans are made or the
basis  on  which  such  contributions  are  determined.

          (d)     With  respect to each Employee Benefit Plan (i) no prohibited
transaction  as  defined in ERISA section 406 or Code section 4975 has occurred,
(ii)  neither  an Affiliated Company nor any of its current or former directors,
officers,  employees  or  any  other  "fiduciary,"  within  the meaning of ERISA
section  3(21),  has committed any breach of fiduciary responsibility imposed by
ERISA  or  any  other applicable Law, or has any Liability for failure to comply
with  ERISA  or the Code for any action or failure to act in connection with the
administration  or  investment  of  the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan, and
there  is  no  pending,  or  to  the  Knowledge of Learning Curve, threatened or
anticipated  action,  suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner of litigation
or  claim under any Employee Benefit Plan or with respect to the assets thereof,
or  by  or  on behalf of any current or former director, officer or employee, or
dependent  or  beneficiary  thereof, or otherwise (other than routine claims for
benefits  where  the  plan's  administrative  claims  procedure has not yet been
exhausted),  including  but  not  limited  to  any  action,  suit,  grievance,
arbitration  or  other  manner  of  litigation  or claim regarding conduct which
allegedly  interferes  with  the attainment of rights under any Employee Benefit
Plan,  and  (iii) neither Learning Curve nor any of its directors or officers or
any  fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan has any Knowledge of any facts which
could  give  rise  to  arbitration  or other manner of litigation or claims with
respect  to any Employee Benefit Plan, except for, with respect to (i), (ii) and
(iii)  above, such instances of noncompliance that in the aggregate have not had
and  could  reasonably  be  expected  not  to  have  a  Material Adverse Effect.

          (e)     All  reports  and  descriptions of the Employee Benefit Plans
(including,  without  limitation,  IRS  Form 5500 annual reports, summary annual
reports,  and  summary  plan  descriptions) required to be filed within the past
five  years  by  an  Affiliated Company with the IRS, the DOL, or the PBGC on or
before  the  date  hereof  have been timely filed, and as appropriate, have been
timely  provided  to  the  participants  in  the  Employee  Benefit  Plans.

          (f)     There  is  no pending or, to the Knowledge of Learning Curve,
threatened  claim,  charge,  demand,  inquiry,  investigation,  action,  suit,
arbitration,  or  other  legal proceeding relating to any Employee Benefit Plan,
except  for  claims  for  benefits  thereunder  made  in  the  ordinary  course.

          (g)     Except as disclosed in section 3.24 of the Affiliated Company
Disclosure  Schedule,  the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  will  not  accelerate the time of vesting or payment, or increase the
amount, of the compensation or benefits to be paid or provided to any present or
former  officer  or  employee  of an Affiliated Company.  Except as disclosed in
section  3.24  of  the  Affiliated  Company  Disclosure Schedule, no Contract or
Employee  Benefit  Plan  provides for any "excess parachute payment," within the
meaning of Code section 4999, upon or in connection with the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement.


                                       48

          (h)     No  Affiliated  Company  has  been  liable  at  any  time for
contributions to any Employee Benefit Plan that is or was subject to ERISA Title
IV.

          (i)     Each  Affiliated  Company  or  an  ERISA  Affiliate  of  the
Affiliated  Company,  as  applicable,  has made all contributions required to be
made  by it pursuant to the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan or any collective
bargaining  agreement  to  which  it  is  a  party  or  as otherwise required by
applicable  law.  With  respect  to  each Employee Benefit Plan, subject to only
normal retrospective adjustments in the ordinary course, all insurance premiums,
including premiums to the PBGC, have been paid in full for policy years or other
applicable  policy  periods ending on or prior to the date hereof.  There exists
no  "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of ERISA section 302 and
Code  section  412,  with  respect  to  any Employee Benefit Plan, regardless of
whether  such  deficiency  has  been  waived.

          (j)     Each  Affiliated  Company does not have, and the consummation
of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement will not result in, any
Liability  for (i) any minimum funding contribution required under ERISA section
302(c)(11)  or  Code  section  412(c)(11), (ii) any payment required under ERISA
section  302(e)  or  Code  section  412(m),  (iii)  any lien imposed under ERISA
section  302(f) or Code section 412(n), (iv) any excise tax imposed with respect
to  an  accumulated  funding  deficiency  under  Code  section  4971,  (v)  the
termination  of  or withdrawal from any plan under ERISA sections 4062, 4063, or
4064,  or  (f)  the  withdrawal from any multi-employer plan under ERISA section
4201.

          (k)     Except as disclosed in section 3.24 of the Affiliated Company
Disclosure  Schedule,  no  Employee  Benefit  Plan is (i) a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of ERISA sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) or Code section 414(f),
(ii)  a  "multiple  employer  welfare  plan"  or  a  "multiple  employer welfare
arrangement"  within  the  meaning  of  ERISA  section  514(b)(6), or a "welfare
benefit  fund"  within  the  meaning  of  Code  section 419(e).  Each Affiliated
Company  has  not incurred and does not expect to incur any withdrawal Liability
(either  as  a  contributing  employer  or  as  part of a controlled group which
includes  a contributing employer) to any multiemployer plan, in connection with
any  complete  or  partial  withdrawal from such plan occurring on or before the
Closing  Date  or  as  a  result  of  the  transactions  contemplated under this
Agreement.

          (l)     Except as disclosed in section 3.24 of the Affiliated Company
Disclosure  Schedule,  no  Employee Benefit Plan provides medical, life or other
welfare  benefits  (whether  or  not insured), with respect to current or former
employees  after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage

                                       49
<PAGE>
mandated  by  applicable Law).  With respect to any Contract or arrangement with
an insurance company providing funding under any Employee Benefit Plan, there is
no  Liability  for any retroactive rate adjustment.  Each Affiliated Company has
the  right to amend or terminate its participation with respect to each Employee
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.  Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a

executed  and/or  delivered  by RCE or any of the Acquisition Subsidiaries or of
their  Subsidiaries  pursuant  hereto,  including,  but not limited to, any such
breach  that  may  have  caused  any such conditions not to have been satisfied;
provided  that,  in  the  event  of the Closing of the transactions contemplated

                                   ARTICLE VII

     7.1     Survival  of  Representations  and  Warranties;  Right  to
             ----------------------------------------------------------

of the Parties shall survive and remain in full force and effect for a period of
24  months  after the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the previous sentence, any claim of indemnification pursuant to this Article VII
relating  to  a  breach  of  a  representation  or  warranty asserted in writing

applicable,  an  estimated  amount of the claim, if known, and the basis for the
claim)  on  or  before  24  months  after  the  Closing Date shall survive until
resolved  or  judicially  determined.  The  right to indemnification, payment of
Damages or other remedy based on the representations, warranties, covenants, and

obligation.  The  waiver  of  any  condition  based  on  the  accuracy  of  any
representation  or  warranty,  or  on  the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of
Damages,  or  other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants,

alleged to have been made by any such Person with any Affiliated Company (or any
Person  acting  on  its  behalf)  in  connection  with  any  of the transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement;

          (d)     any  Learning  Curve  Debt,  Learning  Curve  Capital  Lease
Obligations,  Preferred  Consideration or Transaction Expenses to the extent not
either  (i)  subtracted  in  the  calculation  of  the  Initial  Merger  Cash
Consideration  or  (ii)  reflected  as  a  current  liability on the Preliminary
Closing  Date  Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet but not reflected as a
current  liability on Learning Curve's consolidated balance sheet as of December
31,  2002;

          (e)     any  Liability  for  Taxes  of  Learning  Curve or any of its
Subsidiaries  for  any  period prior to the Learning Curve Effective Time to the

liability  on  Learning  Curve's  consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31,
2002;

          (f)     any  Liability  arising  from  or  relating  to  any  claims,
charges,  inquiries,  investigations  or  actions arising from, or in connection
with  the  Litigation;  or

          From and after the Closing Date, recourse to the Escrow Amount and the
Earnout  Payment,  if  any, as provided for in this Article VII will be the sole
and  exclusive  remedies  available  to  RCE,  the  Learning  Curve  Surviving
Corporation  and the other RCE Indemnitees with respect to the matters set forth


                                       69
<PAGE>
above  and  to  any  other  claim relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  hereby,  except  for  (i) claims based on fraud or (ii) a claim or
action for breach of covenant or for specific enforcement of any obligation of a
Learning  Curve  Indemnitor  pursuant  to this Agreement or an agreement entered
into  in  connection  with  this  Agreement.

     7.3     Indemnification  and Payment of Damages by RCE.  From and after the
             ----------------------------------------------
Closing Date, RCE will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Learning Curve
Shares  and  each  of  their  respective  representatives,  officers, directors,
employees,  agents,  stockholders,  controlling  persons,  subsidiaries  and
Affiliates  (collectively,  the "Learning Curve Indemnitees") from, and will pay
to  the  Learning Curve Indemnitees the amount of, any Damages arising, directly
or  indirectly,  from  or  in  connection  with:

          (a)     any  breach  of any representation or warranty made by RCE or

other  certificate  or  document  delivered by RCE or any Acquisition Subsidiary
pursuant  to  this  Agreement;

          (b)     any  breach  by  RCE  or  any  Acquisition  Subsidiary of any

          (c)     any  claim  by  any  Person  for  broker  or finder's fees or
commissions  or  similar  payments  based  upon  any  agreement or understanding
alleged  to  have  been  made  by  any  such  Person with RCE or any Acquisition
Subsidiary  (or  any  Person acting on its behalf) in connection with any of the
transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement;

          (d)     Damages  under  WARN  or  similar  state or foreign Laws with
respect  to  the  termination  of  employment,  including  any  constructive
termination,  after the Learning Curve Effective Time of any individual employed
by  any  of the Affiliated Companies prior to the Learning Curve Effective Time,
including  with respect to any termination prior to the Learning Curve Effective
Time  set  forth  on  Schedule  7.3(d) which results in liability under such Law
because it is aggregated with any termination after the Learning Curve Effective
Time;

          (e)     any  Liability resulting from the LC SUB II Stock Purchase or
the  LC  SUB  III  Stock  Purchase;  or

          (f)     any  amount  (which  would  be paid to the Escrow and Earnout
Participants)  by  which the amount subtracted in the calculation of the Initial
Merger  Cash  Consideration  with  respect  to the Learning Curve Debt, Learning
Curve

                                       70
<PAGE>
Capital  Lease  Obligations,  Preferred  Consideration  or  Transaction Expenses
exceeds  the  actual  amount  as  finally determined of the Learning Curve Debt,
Learning Curve Capital Lease Obligations, Preferred Consideration or Transaction
Expenses  to  the extent not reflected as an adjustment adding to current assets
on  the  Preliminary  Closing  Date  Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet;
provided,  however,  that if an excess amount with respect to the Learning Curve
Debt,  Learning  Curve  Capital  Lease  Obligations,  Preferred Consideration or
Transaction  Expenses  is paid to any Person by Learning Curve or RCE, RCE shall
not  be  obligated for indemnification under this section 7.3(e) for such excess
amount unless and until such excess amount is returned to Learning Curve or RCE.

          From and after the Closing Date, the remedies provided in this section
7.3  will  be  the  sole and exclusive remedies available to Learning Curve, the
holders  of  Learning Curve Shares and the other Learning Curve Indemnitees with
respect  to  the matters set forth above and to any other claim relating to this
Agreement  or  the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) claims based
on  fraud,  (ii)  a  claim  or  action  for  breach  of covenant or for specific
enforcement  of any obligation of RCE pursuant to this Agreement or an agreement
entered  into  in  connection  with  this Agreement or (iii) with respect to the
holders  of Learning Curve Class C Common Shares, a claim brought by any holders
of  RCE  Shares  generally  as  a  class.

     7.4     Procedure  for  Indemnification.
             -------------------------------

          (a)     As soon as is reasonably practicable after any RCE Indemnitee
or  Learning  Curve Indemnitee becomes aware of any claim, event or circumstance
(a  "Claim")  that has or might give rise to an indemnification obligation under
section  7.2  or  section 7.3 of this Agreement, such RCE Indemnitee or Learning
Curve  Indemnitee,  as  the  case  may  be (an "Indemnified Person"), shall give
written  notice  thereof  (a  "Claim Notice") to the party or parties from which
indemnification  is sought (the "Indemnifying Persons").  The Claim Notice shall
describe  the  Claim  in  reasonable  detail,  and  shall  indicate  the  amount
(estimated  if  necessary  and  to the extent feasible) of the Damages that have
been  or  may  be  suffered  by  the  Indemnified  Person.  The  failure  of any
Indemnified  Person  to  promptly  give  the Indemnifying Persons a Claim Notice
shall  not preclude such Indemnified Person from obtaining indemnification under
this  Article  VII,  except  to  the  extent,  and only to the extent, that such
Indemnified Person's failure has actually prejudiced the rights or increased the
liabilities  and  obligations  of  any  of  the  Indemnifying Persons hereunder.

          (b)     With  respect  to  any Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Persons
shall  have the right by written notice to the Indemnified Person not later than
30  days  after  receipt  of  such  Claim  Notice,  to assume the control of the
defense,

                                       71
<PAGE>
compromise or settlement of such Claim, provided that (i) such assumption shall,
by  its  terms,  be  without  cost  to  the Indemnified Person, (ii) each of the
Indemnifying Persons agree in writing that they are responsible to indemnify the
Indemnified  Person  for such Claim upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set  forth herein, and (iii) any settlement of such Claim shall involve only the
payment  of  money  damages  by  the  Indemnifying  Persons.

          (c)     Upon the assumption of control by the Indemnifying Persons as
provided  in  section  7.4(b), the Indemnifying Persons shall diligently proceed
with  the  defense,  compromise  or  settlement of the Claim at the Indemnifying
Persons'  sole  expense, including employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to  the  Indemnified Person and, in connection therewith, the Indemnified Person
shall  cooperate  fully, but at the expense of the Indemnifying Persons, to make
available  to  the  Indemnifying Persons all pertinent information and witnesses
under  the  Indemnified Person's control, and to take such other steps as in the
opinion  of  counsel  for  the  Indemnifying Persons are necessary to enable the
Indemnifying  Persons  to  conduct  such  defense.

          (d)     The  final,  non-appealable  determination  of  any  Claim,
including  all  related costs and expenses, shall be binding and conclusive upon
the  Indemnifying  Persons  and  the  Indemnified Person as to the amount of the
indemnification; provided, however, that in the Indemnifying Persons' defense of
such  Claim,  except  with  the  written  consent of the Indemnified Person, the
Indemnifying  Persons  shall  not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any  settlement,  which  does  not  include as an unconditional term thereof the
provision  by  the  claimant  to  the  Indemnified  Person  of  a release of the
Indemnified  Person  from  all  liability  in  respect  of  such  Claim.

          (e)     Should  the  Indemnifying  Persons fail to give notice to the
Indemnified  Person  as provided in section 7.4(b), the Indemnified Person shall
be  entitled  to  defend,  settle  or  compromise the Legal Claim as in its sole
discretion  may  appear  advisable,  and such final determination, settlement or
compromise  of  the  Legal Claim shall be binding upon the Indemnifying Persons.

          (f)     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  RCE  agrees  to provide the
Shareholder Representatives with written notice (the "RCE Notice") not more than
30  days  after  receiving  written  notice  of  any  audits,  examinations  or
proceedings relating to the Affiliated Companies that are related to a Liability
for  any  Taxes  for  which  the Learning Curve Indemnitors would be required to
indemnify  any RCE Indemnitee pursuant to section 7.2(e) (a "Tax Contest").  The
failure  of  RCE to promptly give the Shareholder Representatives the RCE Notice
shall not preclude any RCE Indemnitees from obtaining indemnification under this
Article VII with respect to a Tax Contest, except to the extent, and only to the

                                       72
<PAGE>
extent,  that  RCE's failure has actually prejudiced the rights or increased the
liabilities  and obligations of any of the Learning Curve Indemnitors hereunder.
The  Shareholder Representatives shall have the right to control and conduct the
Tax Contest relating to the Affiliated Companies by giving written notice to RCE
not  more  than  30  days after receiving the RCE Notice, including the right to
determine,  to the extent reasonably satisfactory to RCE, such issues as (i) the
forum,  administrative or judicial, in which to contest any proposed adjustment,
(ii)  the  attorney  and/or  accountant  to  represent the applicable Affiliated
Company  in  the Tax Contest, (iii) whether or not to appeal any decision of any
administrative  or  judicial  body,  and  (iv)  whether  to  settle any such Tax
Contest.  Any  such  control  and  conduct  of  a Tax Contest by the Shareholder
Representatives  shall  be  without  cost  to any RCE Indemnitee and each of the
Shareholder  Representatives  shall  agree  in  writing  that the Learning Curve
Indemnitors  are responsible to indemnify the RCE Indemnitees in connection with
such  Tax Contest upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Article  VII.  The RCE Indemnitees shall cause the applicable Affiliated Company
to  deliver to the Shareholder Representatives any power of attorney required to
allow  the  Shareholder  Representatives  and  their  counsel  to  represent the
applicable  Affiliated  Company in connection with the Tax Contest and shall use
commercially  reasonably efforts to provide the Shareholder Representatives with
such  assistance  as  may  be  reasonably  requested  by  the  Shareholder
Representatives  in  connection  with  the  Tax  Contest.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  the Shareholder Representatives shall consult in good faith with RCE
with  respect to the conduct of, and before entering into any settlement of, any
Tax  Contest,  but  the  Shareholder  Representatives shall alone be entitled to
determine whether, and on what terms, any such settlement shall be entered into,
provided  that  any such settlement shall involve only monetary payments. Should
the  Shareholder  Representatives  fail  to give the LCI Notice to RCE within 30
days  after  receipt  of the RCE Notice as provided above in this section 7.4(f)
with respect to a Tax Contest, RCE shall be entitled to control and conduct such
Tax  Contest as in its reasonable discretion may appear advisable, and any final
determination, settlement or compromise of the Tax Contest shall be binding upon
the  Learning  Curve  Indemnitors.

     7.5     The  Shareholder  Representatives.
             ---------------------------------

          (a)     Each  of  Richard  E. Rothkopf and Michael Kurzman are hereby
appointed  as  the  representative  and  agent  of  each  of  the Learning Curve
Indemnitors (collectively, the "Shareholder Representatives") with the power and
authority  to  fulfill  the  role  of  Shareholder  Representatives  hereunder.

          (b)     In  the  event of the death, resignation or incapacity of any
Shareholder  Representative,  his successor shall be appointed by consent of the
majority in interest in Learning Curve Shares within 30 days of such event.  The

                                       73
<PAGE>
decisions  and actions of any successor Shareholder Representative shall be, for
all  purposes,  those  of  a  Shareholder  Representative as if originally named
herein.  The  death  or  incapacity  of any Shareholder Representative shall not
terminate  the  authority  and  agency  of the Shareholder Representatives.  Any
Shareholder  Representative  may  resign at any time upon notice to RCE and each
holder  of  Learning  Curve Shares given at least 30 days prior to the effective
date  of  such resignation, provided that no such resignation shall be effective
until  his  successor has been appointed in accordance with this section 7.5(b),
and  has  accepted  such  appointment.

          (c)     The  Shareholder Representatives shall take any actions as he
may  deem  appropriate  with respect to (i) any Claim Notice as provided in this
Article  VII,  (ii) any dispute regarding the payment of amounts from the Escrow
Account  pursuant  to the Escrow Agreement, (iii) any Tax Contest as provided in
section 7.4(f) and (iv) the determination of any adjustments pursuant to section
2.12  or  2.13.  The  Shareholder  Representatives  shall  have  full  power and
authority  to  receive  all  Claim  Notices  with  respect  to Claims by any RCE
Indemnitee,  to  control  the defense, compromise or settlement of any Claims by
any RCE Indemnitee and otherwise to act on behalf of the holders of the Learning
Curve  Shares  for  all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
any  action  by  either  Shareholder  Representative  within  the  scope of such
authority  shall  be binding on all of the holders of the Learning Curve Shares.
In  performing  any  of his duties hereunder, a Shareholder Representative shall
not  incur  any  liability to anyone for damages, losses or expenses, except for
willful  misconduct.

     7.6     Indemnification  Claims by RCE Indemnitees; Cap on Indemnification.
             ------------------------------------------------------------------
The sole and exclusive means for any of the RCE Indemnitees to satisfy any Claim
for  indemnification  hereunder  shall be giving notice of a Claim to the Escrow
Agent  and  the  Shareholder  Representatives  under  the  Escrow  Agreement and
receiving  payment  from  the  Escrow  Account  of  the  amount to which the RCE
Indemnitee may be entitled under this Article VII.  In addition, if (i) there is
a Claim by any RCE Indemnitee outstanding or unpaid at the time when any payment
is  to be made by RCE under section 2.12 or 2.13 of this Agreement, then RCE may
reduce  the  amount  of  the  payment  to be made under section 2.12 or 2.13, as
applicable,  by  the  amount  of  such  Claim and instead pay such amount to the
Escrow  Agent  to  be  held  pursuant  to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement and this Article VII and to be available for satisfaction of Claims by
RCE  Indemnitees or otherwise distributed to the Escrow and Earnout Participants
pursuant  to  the  terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Article
VII,  and  (ii)  one  or  more  Claims  by  any RCE Indemnitee have been finally
determined prior to the time when any payment is to be made by RCE under section
2.12 or 2.13 of this Agreement, then RCE may reduce the amount of the payment to
be  made  under  section  2.12  or  2.13,  as  applicable,  by  the  aggregate

                                       74
<PAGE>
amount of such Claims and instead pay such amount to the Escrow Agent to be held
pursuant  to  the  terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Article
VII  and  to  be  available  for  satisfaction  of  Claims by RCE Indemnitees or
otherwise  distributed  to  the  Escrow and Earnout Participants pursuant to the
terms  and  conditions  of  the  Escrow Agreement and this Article VII or, if no
funds  remain  in  the Escrow Account at such time, RCE may setoff the aggregate
amount  of  such Claims against the payment to be made by RCE under section 2.12
or  2.13  of  this Agreement.  No Learning Curve Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover,  and RCE shall not be obligated to pay to any Learning Curve Indemnitee
any  amount pursuant to this Article VII or otherwise (except as provided in the
last  paragraph  of  section  7.3)  any amount in excess of $12 million plus the
amount  of  the  Earnout  Payment.

     7.7     Deductibles.  No  Indemnified  Person  shall be entitled to recover
             -----------
any  amount  pursuant  to section 7.2(a), 7.2(g) or 7.3(a), as applicable, until
and  unless  the amount which all RCE Indemnitees or Learning Curve Indemnitees,
as  applicable, are entitled to recover exceeds, in the aggregate, $500,000 (the
"General  Deductible"),  in  which  event, RCE Indemnitees or all Learning Curve
Indemnitees, as applicable, shall only be entitled to recover amounts for Claims
in  excess  of  the  General  Deductible.

     The  RCE  Indemnitees  shall only be entitled to recover 50% of all amounts
recoverable  pursuant  to  section  7.2(f)  until  the  total  aggregate  amount
recoverable  (without  taking  into  account  the  50%  limitation  provided for
herein),  as  Damages  pursuant  to  section  7.2(f)  exceeds, in the aggregate,
$1,000,000  (the  "Litigation Deductible") and shall be entitled to recover 100%
of  amounts  for  Claims  of  recoverable  Damages  in  excess of the Litigation
Deductible.

     7.8     Mitigation.  Each  Indemnified  Person  shall  take  commercially
             ----------
reasonable  actions  to  mitigate  Damages,  and  shall  reasonably  consult and
cooperate  with each Indemnifying Person with a view towards mitigating Damages,
in  connection with Claims for which an Indemnified Person seeks indemnification
under  this  Article  VII.

     7.9     Amount  of  Damages.  The  amount  of any Damages payable hereunder
             -------------------
shall  be  reduced by (a) any insurance proceeds or litigation or other monetary
recoveries (net of any increased premiums or expenses of obtaining such proceeds
or  monetary  recoveries)  which  the  Indemnified Person actually receives with
respect  to  the  event  or  occurrence  giving  rise  to such Damages for which
indemnification  is  sought  under  this  Article  VII,  (b)  the  amount of any
reduction  of  an actual Tax Liability (provided that no such reduction shall be
made  prior  to  the  taxable  period  in  which the Indemnified Person actually
receives  the  benefit  of  such  reduced Tax Liability and, if such reduced Tax
Liability  will  accrue  in  periods

                                       75
<PAGE>
after  the  indemnification  payment  is  due,  the Indemnifying Person shall be
required  to  pay  the  full  indemnification  amount subject to the Indemnified
Person's  obligation  to  pay the amount of such reduction when such reduced Tax
Liability is actually realized to the Indemnifying Person (or, with respect to a
reduced  Tax Liability by any RCE Indemnitee, pay into the Escrow Account during
the  term  of  the  Escrow  Agreement))  realized  by  the  Indemnified Party in
connection  with  such  Damages,  (c)  the  amount  of  any reserves or accruals
reflected  as  a  current  liability  on  the  Closing  Date Balance Sheet which
specifically  relate  to  the  facts  giving rise to the payment of such Damages
hereunder,  and  (d)  to  the extent the matter was addressed in calculating the
Preliminary  Closing  Working  Capital  Adjustment  or  the Post-Closing Working
Capital  Adjustment.  The  Indemnified  Person shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to  pursue  insurance  claims  or third party claims that may reduce or
eliminate  Damages.  If  the  Indemnified Person both collects proceeds from any
insurance  company  or  third party and received a payment from the Indemnifying
Person  hereunder  subject  to  reduction pursuant to this section 7.9 after the
payment  of the related indemnification amounts to such Indemnified Person, then
the  Indemnified  Person shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Person (or, with
respect  to proceeds received by any RCE Indemnitee, pay into the Escrow Account
during  the  term  of the Escrow Agreement), or offset against other outstanding
Claims  of  the  Indemnified  Person,  the  amount  of  such  proceeds.

     7.10     Materiality.  Any  qualifications  in  the  representations,
              -----------
warranties and covenants with respect to a Material Adverse Effect, materiality,
material  or  similar  terms  will  not  have  any  effect  with  respect to the
calculation  of  the  amount  of any Damages or losses or the application of the
General  Deductible  or  the Litigation Deductible pursuant to this Article VII.
However, such qualifications will have an effect in determining whether a breach
has  occurred.

any  material  respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the  part  of  the  other  Party,  set  forth  in this Agreement; or (ii) if any
representation or warranty of the other Party shall be discovered to have become
untrue  in  any  material  respect such that the conditions set forth in section

breach  or  other condition has not been cured within 20 Business Days following

provided, however, this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this section
8.1(d)  by  the  breaching  Party or Party making any representation or warranty
which  shall  have  become  untrue  in  any  material  respect;  or

the  Parties  and  their  respective  successors and permitted assigns and, with

of  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement.
