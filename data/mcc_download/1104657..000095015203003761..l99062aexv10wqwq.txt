Existing Default), but only to the extent that the Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth as of such date was not less than $198,000,000.

      B. The foregoing waiver is limited to its express terms and shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any other Default

<PAGE>

which may have existed on or prior to the date hereof or any Default which may
hereafter arise under any of the foregoing Section or under any other provision
of the Lease Agreement or any of the other Lease Documents. Further, the

Agreement or any of the other Lease Documents.

      3. Authorization. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Ninth

authorized to sign this Ninth Amendment and any Mortgage required hereby on

Property to be duly perfected and subject only to such matters as are approved
by the Collateral Agent, and shall have accompanied each such Mortgage with an
ALTA loan policy of title insurance in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent; provided, however, that no such Mortgage
shall encumber any Mortgaged Property if the grant of such Mortgage would cause
a default under, or accelerate the maturity of indebtedness secured by, any
mortgage, deed of trust, ground lease or other lien or lease instrument that
encumbers such Mortgaged Property on the Effective Date (each a "Prior
Encumbrance") until such time as the Lessee or such Guarantor, as applicable,

efforts (subject to commercial reasonableness) to obtain such consent promptly
following the Effective Date.

delivered an amendment thereto in form and substance satisfactory to the Lessor,

by the Lessor of this Ninth


                                       9
<PAGE>

Amendment shall not constitute, or be deemed to be or construed as, a waiver of
any right, power or remedy of the Lessor or a waiver of any provision of the
Lease Agreement, except as expressly stated herein. None of the provisions of
this Ninth Amendment shall constitute, or be deemed to be or construed as, a
wavier of any Default or Potential Default.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Lessee, the Lessor and its participants have
hereunto set their hands as of the date first above written.
