the covenants of any of the Selling Parties contained in SECTION 6.5, which

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

                  (x)     The minimum Purchase Price shall equal $3,607,680.37,
which is equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of 1.5 TIMES $3,206,827.00, the

<PAGE>
                                                                       PAGE 3

                  (z)     Subject to the Minimum Purchase Price Amount, (i) in

"NEW PROFIT CENTER") does not maintain an average annual Operating Profit (as
defined below) margin of at least twenty-five percent (25%) as of the end of
the two (2)-year period ending November 30, 2004, then the amount of the
Regular Accounts Amount payable at that time shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Regular Accounts Amount TIMES the difference between the New
Profit Center's actual Operating Profit Margin and twenty-five percent (25%),
and (ii) in the event that (A) NAICO's A.M. Best rating drops below "B++" at
any time during the three (3)-year period following the Effective Date and
Buyer exercises its right, as described below, to rewrite any business written
with NAICO with Buyer's carriers, or (B) NAICO enters into receivership, makes
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a petition for bankruptcy
protection is filed voluntarily by NAICO or involuntarily against NAICO that
is not dismissed within ten (10) days after such filing, any unearned, return
premium amounts relating to business written with NAICO due to the accounts
comprising the Purchased Book of Business shall be offset against any Purchase
Price amounts otherwise due to the Shareholder.

          (b)     As defined herein, the term:

                  (i)     "CORE REVENUE" means commission revenue net of any
commissions paid to any third party producing agent or agency, or to any third
party broker, but shall not include late fees charged to clients, contingent
commissions, override commissions, first year life insurance commissions, any
life insurance commissions for policies written on the lives of any director,
officer or key employee of the Company, the Shareholder, Parent, NAICO, or any
other Affiliate of any of the foregoing entities, or any family member of any
director, officer or key employee of the Company, the Shareholder, Parent,
NAICO, or any other Affiliate of any of the foregoing entities, or any income
item (such as interest and countersignature fees) other than earned commissions
and fees earned in lieu of commissions. Revenues generated from any one account
shall not be included more than once in any twelve (12)-month period in
determining Core Revenue for such period.  Core Revenue shall be determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in any event in
accordance with Buyer's standard accounting methodology and procedures.
Specifically, direct bill revenue is recognized when received (cash basis) and
agency bill revenue is recognized on the later of the effective date of the
policy installment or the date the installment is billed to the customer.

                  (ii)    "PURCHASED BOOK OF BUSINESS" means (A) those active
accounts (I.E., accounts that have not canceled or non-renewed) of the Company
as of Closing, excluding any sub-brokered or co-brokered accounts (the "CURRENT
BOOK OF BUSINESS"), PLUS (B) any new business generated by the New Profit
Center during the two (2)-year or three (3)-year earn-out period, as
applicable, MINUS (net of) (C) any business lost during the applicable
Earn-Out Period and excluding any agency or book of business acquired by the
New Profit Center during the Earn-Out Period.  The Purchased Book of Business
shall only include accounts that are one hundred percent (100%) owned as of
the end of the Earn-Out Period; no revenue would be included for co-brokered
or sub-brokered accounts.

                  (iii)   "OPERATING PROFIT" means the excess of revenues
(excluding contingent commission revenues except as described below) over
expenses, determined in

<PAGE>
                                                                       PAGE 4

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in any event
pursuant to Buyer's usual methods and conventions of accounting, as
reflected in the pro forma profit and loss statement attached hereto as
SCHEDULE 1.2(b)(iii) (the "PRO FORMA").

                          (A)     Operating income as set forth in the Pro
Forma reflects the annual average contingent commission revenues generated by
the Company  (whether or not actually received by the Company) over the sixty
(60)-month period prior to Closing.  Buyer shall determine the amount of
profit-sharing and contingent commission revenue to be included within
Operating Profit  during the Regular Accounts Earn-Out Period by calculating
the annual average profit-sharing and contingent commission revenues over the
sixty (60)-month period prior to such determination (I.E., Buyer shall
calculate the annual average for the sixty (60)-month period ending as of the
end of the Regular Accounts Earn-Out Period).

                          (B)     Among other things in determining Operating
Profit, direct bill commission revenue shall be deemed earned on the cash
method and agency bill commission income shall be deemed earned on the later
of the policy's effective date or the policy installment billing date.
However, in no event shall there be more than twelve (12) months of revenue in
any twelve (12) month-period.  Further, as to any account (i) for which greater
than $100,000 in commission revenue has been booked in the six (6)-month period
prior to Closing, or (ii) which generates revenues, regardless of amount, in
the form of fees rather than commissions, such commission or fee revenue (as
the case may be) and related expense shall be treated as being earned and
incurred pro-rata over the Regular Accounts Earn-Out Period.

                          (C)     Revenues during the Earn-Out Period shall
exclude any life insurance commissions for policies written on the lives of any
director, officer or key employee of the Company, the Shareholder, Parent,
NAICO, or any other Affiliate of any of the foregoing entities, or any family
member of any director, officer or key employee of the Company, the
Shareholder, Parent, NAICO, or any other Affiliate of any of the foregoing
entities.

                          (D)     Expenses shall include all standard corporate
charges of Buyer as reflected in the Pro Forma, including but not limited to:
an overhead charge based on revenues (net of commission and fee expenses) as
calculated in the manner set forth in the Pro Forma (which shall be set at four
percent (4.0%) for purposes of determining the Purchase Price); charges for
insurance coverages allocated in the manner shown in the Pro Forma; charges up
to the first $25,000.00 of any judgment or settlement amounts, and the full
amount of all related legal fees, costs and expenses, with respect to any
errors and omissions claim or unlawful discrimination or harassment claim
after the Closing Date against the New Profit Center to which Buyer's errors
and omissions (E&O) policy or employment practices liability (EPL) policy, as
the case may be, must respond (Parent shall be responsible for the full amount
of any deductibles or legal fees, costs or expenses for any such claims as to
which its applicable tail policy must respond); one hundred percent (100%) of
the profit center bonus payable to the New Profit Center for the applicable
period, in accordance with Buyer's profit center bonus program as set forth in
SCHEDULE 1.2(b)(iii)(D); but shall not include income Taxes or amortization
expense.  Expenses associated with the office relocation to the Oklahoma City
metropolitan area shall also be excluded for purposes of determining Operating
Profit, PROVIDED that, in the event such relocation occurs within the six-(6)
month period following the Effective Date, any rental

<PAGE>
                                                                       PAGE 5
expense attributable to the new office location shall not be excluded for
purposes of determining Operating Profit.  In determining Operating Profit,
accounts receivable aged in excess of fifty-nine (59) days are written off as
bad debt expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that accounts receivable aged in excess
of forty-five (45) days as of February 15, 2006 shall also be written off as
bad debt expense.

                          (E)     Additionally, the Shareholder must
immediately apply for and maintain a term life insurance policy on the life
of Company employee Malinda Laird ("LAIRD") with limits at least equal to the
Minimum Purchase Price Amount and with a term at least equal to the Large
Accounts Earn-Out Period.  Such term life insurance policy shall be assigned
to Buyer pursuant to the Assignment of Life Insurance Policy described in
SECTION 2.2(d) hereof, and must provide Buyer with the right to be informed if
the premium for such policy has not been paid by Parent, as well as the right
in such event to pay such premium (or, if such policy is canceled for
non-payment, Buyer may obtain a term life insurance policy on the life of
Laird with Buyer named as beneficiary).  In the event Buyer must pay such
premium for such assigned policy or, if canceled, must pay premium for a new
term life policy, such premium shall be included as an expense within the New
Profit Center income statement.

                          (F)     The Pro Forma sets forth the parties' current
expectation as to revenues and expenses for the first twelve (12)-month
measurement period of the Regular Accounts Earn-Out Period.  In determining
Operating Profit in the second and third twelve (12)-month measurement periods
of the Regular Accounts Earn-Out Period, expenses shown in the Pro Forma for
the first twelve (12)-month measurement period shall be subject to normal and
prudent increases in the second and third twelve (12)-month measurement
periods to reflect normal increases incident to the business, such as pay
raises for non-commission employees that the parties expect shall average
three and one-half percent (3.5%) per year, and otherwise in a manner
consistent with Buyer's accounting methodology as of the Closing Date.  Line
item expenses may be decreased in certain cases, but only upon agreement of
Buyer based on the most recent year's operating results of the New Profit
Center.  Without limiting the foregoing:

                                  (1)     There shall be no material staff
reductions unless dictated by a corresponding reduction in business or, in
individual cases and with Buyer's reasonable prior written approval, unless
there is a legitimate business reason unrelated to the determination of the
Purchase Price. In addition, the method of revenue and expense recognition in
the second twelve (12)-month measurement period must be consistently applied
(I.E., the changeover from the Company's system of revenue and expense
recognition to that of Buyer must be completed prior to the end of the first
twelve (12)-month measurement period);

                                  (2)     An amount equal to two-thirds (2/3)
of any profit center bonus payable to the New Profit Center shall be allocated
to the New Profit Center for distribution at the sole discretion of the New
Profit Center Manager, and the remaining one-third (1/3) amount shall be
allocated to Buyer; and

                                  (3)     No Buyer acquisitions made in the
Oklahoma City metropolitan area shall be merged into the New Profit Center
until the Large Accounts Earn-Out Period is concluded, unless mutually
agreed-upon by the parties (or, if Buyer nevertheless merges

<PAGE>
                                                                       PAGE 6

any acquisition into the New Profit Center without such mutual agreement, any
revenue or expenses attributable to such acquisition shall be excluded for
purposes of determining Operating Profit for the New Profit Center).

                          (G)     It is the intention of the parties that the
New Profit Center Manager shall have broad discretion to run the New Profit
Center, within sound business practices and overall corporate policies
existing as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
not take action to increase expenses to the New Profit Center during the
Earn-Out Period for the primary purpose of minimizing the Purchase Price.

          (c)     Subject to SECTION 1.2(d), the Purchase Price shall be paid
to the Shareholder as follows:

                  (i)     A down payment of $3,246,912.33 (the "DOWN PAYMENT
AMOUNT"), which is equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Minimum Purchase Price
Amount, shall be paid to the Shareholder at the Closing;

                  (ii)    The Non-Compete Amount shall be paid in appropriate
amounts to the Principals, Parent and NAICO pursuant to SCHEDULE 1.2(a)(iv)
hereto at the Closing;

                  (iii)   Buyer shall calculate and, subject to the Minimum
and Maximum Purchase Price Amounts, pay (A) the first Contingent Amount, (B)
the first Large Accounts Amount, and (C) the remaining ten percent (10%) of
the Minimum Purchase Price Amount (the "HOLDBACK AMOUNT"), to the Shareholder
on or before December 31, 2003;

                  (iv)    Buyer shall calculate the final Regular Accounts
Amount, the second Contingent Amount and the second Large Accounts Amount,
and, subject to the Minimum and Maximum Purchase Price Amounts, pay the
resulting amounts, less the Minimum Purchase Price Amount (including  the
Holdback Amount), to the Shareholder on or before December 31, 2004; and

                  (v)     Buyer shall calculate and, subject to the Minimum
and Maximum Purchase Price Amounts, pay the third and final Large Accounts
Amount to the Shareholder on or before February 15, 2006.

No portion of the Purchase Price shall bear interest.

          (d)     The deferred portions of the Purchase Price described in
CLAUSES (iii), (iv),  AND (v)  of SECTION 1.2(c) shall be subject to reduction
by Buyer to offset any obligations of the Sellers under the indemnification
provisions contained in ARTICLE 8 hereof.  As additional security, at the
Closing, the Shareholder, Buyer and Bank of Oklahoma , as trustee (the
"TRUSTEE"), shall enter into a Trust Agreement substantially in the form of
EXHIBIT 2.2(v)(ii) hereto (the "TRUST AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which the
Shareholder shall deposit with the Trustee, and maintain a minimum aggregate
balance during the term of the Trust Agreement of $500,000.00 in "Assets" (as
defined in the Trust Agreement).  Satisfaction of any indemnity obligations
from the deferred portion of the Purchase Price and/or the Assets on deposit

indemnification obligations of the Sellers contained in ARTICLE 8 for damages
incurred by Buyer in excess of such aggregate amounts.

be obtained or if any attempted transfer would be ineffective or would impair

such rights, the Shareholder, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall act
after the Closing as Buyer's agent in order to obtain for it the benefits
thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted by law, with
Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to
Buyer.

Buyer's request, the Shareholder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and transfer and shall take such
other actions and execute and deliver such other documents, certifications and
further assurances as Buyer may reasonably request in order to vest more
effectively in Buyer, or to put Buyer more fully in possession of, the Company
Shares.  Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the others and execute
and deliver to the other parties such other instruments and documents and take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested from time to time by such
other party as necessary to carry out, evidence and confirm the intended
purposes of this Agreement.

     Section 2.7  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The Effective Date of this Agreement and
all related instruments executed at the Closing shall be December 1, 2002,
unless otherwise specified.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
retain the risk of loss for errors and omissions committed up until the latter
of the Effective Date or the Closing Date.

shareholders of such Person (or by any Person or group of Persons exercising

is solvent on the date hereof and shall be solvent on the Closing Date.
Neither of the Sellers nor the Company has, and at the Closing Date shall not
have, made any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or admitted in writing
insolvency or that its property at fair valuation shall not be sufficient to

any Legal Requirement prohibiting the making or offering of any improper

reflected all Taxes required to be shown thereon, and has fully paid or made
adequate provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are
due and payable pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment with
respect to Taxes in such jurisdictions, whether or not in connection with such
returns.  The Company is not currently subject to any audits with respect to
any federal, state, local or foreign Tax returns required to be filed and
there are no unresolved audit issues with respect to prior years' Tax returns.
There are no circumstances or pending questions relating to potential Tax
liabilities nor claims asserted for Taxes or assessments of the Company that,
if adversely determined, could result in a Tax liability that would have a
Material Adverse Change on the Company or Buyer for any period.  The Company
has not executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the
assessment or collection of any Tax due that is currently in effect.  The
Company is not holding any unclaimed property that it is required to surrender

                                    ARTICLE 4
                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

     Buyer represents and warrants to the Sellers as follows:

     Section 4.1  ORGANIZATION.  Buyer is a corporation organized under the
laws of the State of Florida and its status is active. Buyer has all requisite
corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased, or operated
by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or
licensed and be in good standing would not in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Change.

     Section 4.2  AUTHORITY. Buyer has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.  The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Buyer and no
other corporate proceeding on the part of Buyer is necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.  This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes its valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
from time to time in effect which offset creditors' rights generally and
general equitable principles.

     Section 4.3  CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS.  Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Buyer nor the
consummation by it of the Contemplated Transactions nor compliance by it with
any of the provisions hereof shall (a) conflict with or result in any breach
of any provision of its Governing Documents, (b) require any filing with, or
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity, or
(c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default  under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its properties
or assets may be bound.

     Section 4.4  SECURITIES LAW REPRESENTATIONS.  (a) Buyer was granted access
to the business premises, offices, properties, and business, corporate and
financial books and records of the Company.  Buyer was permitted to examine
the foregoing records, to question officers of the

<PAGE>
                                                                       PAGE 23

Company, and to make such other investigations as it considered appropriate to
determine or verify the business and financial condition of the Company.  The
Sellers have furnished to Buyer all information regarding the business and
affairs of the Company that Buyer requested.

          (b)     Because of its considerable knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters, Buyer is able to evaluate the merits, risks,
and other factors bearing on the suitability of the Company Shares as an
investment.

          (c)     Buyer's annual income and net worth are such that it would
not now be, and does not contemplate being, required to dispose of any
investment in the Company Shares, including the risk of losing all or any part
of its investment and the inability to sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise
dispose of any of the Company Shares for an indefinite period. Buyer
recognizes that the Company Shares shall not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and shall therefore constitute "restricted securities,"
which means, among other things, that Buyer generally shall not be able to
sell the Company Shares for a period of at least one (1) year following the
Closing Date.

          (d)     Buyer's acquisition of the Company Shares shall be solely
for its own account, as principal, for investment, and not with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any underwriting or distribution.

     Section 4.5  DISCLOSURE.  None of the representations and warranties of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement, notwithstanding any investigation thereof
by the Sellers, contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits the
statement of any material fact necessary to render the statements made not
misleading.

the Acquisition does not close, and shall return such information if the
Acquisition does not close.

all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

of the parties agrees to indemnify and hold the others harmless from and

or statement alleged to have been made by such party or its affiliate.

and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

regulations to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions,
including cooperating fully with the other parties.

of this SECTION 6.5(a) (this covenant is referred to herein as the

          (b)  NON-SOLICITATION COVENANT.  Without limiting the foregoing, and
subject to the requirements of 36 O.S. section 1220, none of the Selling

solicit, divert, accept business from, nor service, directly or indirectly, as

(iii) hire or directly or indirectly solicit any employees of Buyer or its
Affiliates to work for any of the Selling Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates, or any company that competes with Buyer or its Affiliates.  In the

          (c)     NON-DISPARAGEMENT COVENANT. After the Closing Date, none of

directors, officers, employees or agents.

voluntarily and for consideration and that, given the nature and geographic
scope of the Company's business, the Restricted Period and the Restricted Area
are reasonable in time and space.

          (e)     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the covenants set forth in this SECTION 6.5 shall not be held invalid or
unenforceable because of the scope of the territory or actions subject hereto
or restricted hereby, or the period of time within which such covenants are
imperative; but the maximum territory, the actions subject to such covenants,
and the period of time in which such covenants are enforceable, respectively,
are subject to determination by a final judgment of any court which had
jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter.

the provisions of SECTION 6.5, Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to
injunctive relief as well as any other applicable remedies at law or in equity.
Should a court of competent jurisdiction declare the covenants set forth in
SECTION 6.5 unenforceable due to a unreasonable restriction, duration,
geographical area or otherwise, the parties agree that such court shall be
empowered and shall grant Buyer, the Company and their affiliates injunctive
relief to the extent reasonably necessary to protect their respective
interests.  The Selling Parties each acknowledge that the covenants set forth
in SECTION 6.5 represent an important element of the value of the Company
Shares and were a material inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement.

     Section 6.7  SUCCESSOR RIGHTS.  The covenants contained in SECTION 6.5
shall inure to the benefit of any successor in interests of Buyer by way of
merger, consolidation, sale or other succession.

shall, promptly after the Closing, issue a press release (as to which the

certain details with respect to the Contemplated Transactions including, but
not limited to, the Company's estimated Core Revenue for the twelve (12)-month

Company harmless against, all Taxes due or payable by or with respect to the
Company for any taxable year (I.E., the taxable year ended December 31, 2001)
or taxable period (I.E., the taxable period beginning on January 1, 2002 and

Tax returns must be prepared and filed for the Company as part of the

a maximum indemnifiable amount equal to the amount by which the final Purchase
Price is less than the Minimum Purchase Price Amount.

          (c)     The Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and
