<P>&#9;Section 17.8. <B>Closing of Purchase.</B> If Issuer has title to the real property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever except as stated above or has such other title to the real property as may be acceptable to Tenant, then on the specified date, Issuer shall deliver to Tenant its special warranty deed, properly executed and conveying the real property of Tenant free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever except as stated above, and then and there Tenant shall pay the aforesaid purchase price, for the real property, said purchase price to be paid to the Trustee for the account of the Issuer and deposited by the Trustee in the Principal and Interest Account and shall be used to pay or redeem Bonds on the date the Bonds are first subject to redemption as provided in the Indenture; provided, however, nothing herein shall require Issuer to deliver its said special warranty deed to Tenant until after all duties and obligations of Tenant under this Lease to the date of such delivery have been fully performed and satisfied.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 17.9. <B>Effect of Purchase on Lease. </B>The exercise by Tenant of the option granted under these Sections 17.6 to 17.10 and the purchase and sale and conveyance of a portion or portions of the Land constituting a part of the Project pursuant hereto shall in no way whatsoever affect this Lease, and all the terms and provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect the same as though no notice of election to purchase had been given, and specifically, but not in limitation of the generality of the foregoing, exercise of such option shall not affect, alter, diminish, reduce or abate Tenant's obligations to pay all Basic Rent and Additional Rent required hereunder.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 17.10.<B> Effect of Failure to Complete Purchase.</B> If, for any reason whatsoever, the purchase by Tenant of the real property described in said notice is not effected on the specified date, this Lease shall be and remain in full force and effect according to its terms the same as though no notice of election to purchase had been given.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XX</P>
</B><P>&#9;Section 20.1. <B>Remedies on Default.</B> Whenever any Event of Default shall have happened and be continuing, the Issuer may take any one or more of the following remedial actions:</P>
<P>&#9;(a) By written notice to the Tenant upon acceleration of maturity of the Bonds as provided in the Indenture, the Trustee may declare the aggregate amount of all unpaid Basic Rent or Additional Rent then or thereafter required to be paid under this Lease by the Tenant to be immediately due and payable as liquidated damages from the Tenant, whereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable by the Tenant.</P>
<P>&#9;(b) Give Tenant written notice of intention to terminate this Lease on a date specified therein, which date shall not be earlier than Ten (10) days after such notice is given and, if all defaults have not then been cured on the date so specified, Tenant's rights to possession of the Project shall cease, and this Lease shall thereupon be terminated, and Issuer may re-enter and take possession of the Project as of Issuer's former estate; or</P>
<P>&#9;(c) without terminating the term hereof, or this Lease, re-enter the Project or take possession thereof pursuant to legal proceedings or pursuant to any notice provided for by law, and having elected to re-enter or take possession of the Project without terminating the term or this Lease, Issuer shall use reasonable diligence to relet the Project, or parts thereof, for such term or terms and at such rental and upon such other terms and conditions as Issuer may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Project, and no such re-entry or taking of possession of the Project by Issuer shall be construed as an election on Issuer's part to terminate this Lease, and no such re-entry or taking of possession by Issuer shall relieve Tenant of its obligation to pay Basic Rent or Additional Rent (at the time or times provided herein), or of any of its other obligations under this Lease, all of which shall survive such re-entry or taking of possession, and Tenant shall continue to pay the Basic Rent and Additional Rent provided for in this Lease until the end of the Term, whether or not the Project shall have been relet, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the Project after deducting all of Issuer's expenses incurred in connection with such reletting, including without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, legal expenses, expenses of employees, alteration costs and expenses of preparation of the Project for reletting.</P>
<P>&#9;Net proceeds of any reletting shall be deposited in the Principal and Interest Payment Account. Having elected to re-enter or take possession of the Project pursuant to subsection (c) hereunder, Issuer may (subject, however, to any restrictions against termination of this Lease in the Indenture), by notice to Tenant given at any time thereafter while Tenant is in default in the payment of Basic Rent of Additional Rent or in the performance of any other obligation under this Lease, elect to terminate this Lease in accordance with subsection (b) hereunder If, in accordance with any of the foregoing provisions of this Article, Issuer shall have the right to elect to re-enter and take possession of the Project, Issuer may enter and expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant and remove the property and effects of both or either (forcibly if necessary) without being guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies for arrears of Basic Rent or Additional Rent or preceding breach of covenant.</P>
<P>&#9;Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary and regardless of any election by Issuer or Trustee with respect to the exercise of any remedies provided herein, whenever an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall not have the right to exercise any discretion or election with respect to the custody, use, application or other disposition of monies deposited or required to be deposited with Trustee by tenant or on behalf of Tenant, including but not limited to, proceeds of any insurance or condemnation awards.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 20.2. <B>Survival of Obligations.</B> Tenant covenants and agrees with Issuer and the Bondowners that until the Bonds and the interest thereon and redemption premium, if any, are paid in full or provision made for the payment thereof in accordance with the Indenture, its obligations under this Lease shall survive the cancellation and termination of this Lease, for any cause, and that Tenant shall continue to pay Basic Rent and Additional Rent and perform all other obligations provided for in this Lease, all at the time or times provided in this Lease.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 20.3. <B>No Remedy Exclusive. </B>No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Issuer is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but any such right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Issuer to exercise any remedy reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than notice required herein.</P>

No one of them shall be exhausted by the exercise thereof on one or more occasions. Issuer and Tenant shall each be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief for any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Lease, notwithstanding the availability of an adequate remedy at law, and each party hereby waives the right to raise such defense in any proceeding in equity.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 25.2. <B>Waiver of Breach.</B> No waiver of any breach of any covenant or agreement herein contained shall operate as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant or agreement or as a waiver of any breach of any other covenant or agreement, and in case of a breach by either party of any covenant, agreement or undertaking, the nondefaulting party may nevertheless accept from the other any payment or payments or performance hereunder without in any way waiving its right to exercise any of its rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise with respect to any such default or defaults which were in existence at the time such payment or payments or performance were accepted by it.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 25.3.<B> Issuer Shall Not Unreasonably Withhold Consents and Approvals.</B> Wherever in this Lease it is provided that Issuer shall, may or must give its approval or consent, or execute supplemental agreements, exhibits or schedules, Issuer shall not unreasonably, arbitrarily or unnecessarily withhold or refuse to give such approvals or consents or refuse to execute such supplemental agreements, exhibits or schedules.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XXVI</P>

<P>&#9;Section 26.2. <B>Quiet Enjoyment and Possession.</B> So long as Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease, Tenant shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Project.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XXVIII</P>
</B><P>&#9;Section 28.1. <B>Amendments.</B> This Lease may be amended, changed or modified in the following manner:</P>
<P>&#9;(a) With respect to any amendment, change or modification which will materially adversely affect the security or rights of the Bondowners, by an agreement in writing executed by Issuer and Tenant and consented to in writing by the owners of at least Sixty-six and Two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding.</P>
<P>&#9;(b) With respect to any amendment, change or modification which reduces the Basic Rent or Additional Rent, or any amendment which reduces the percentage of Bondowners whose consent is required for any such amendment, change or modification, by an agreement in writing executed by Issuer and Tenant and consented to in writing by the owners of One Hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding; and</P>
<P>&#9;(c) With respect to all other amendments, changes, or modifications, by an agreement in writing executed by Issuer and Tenant.</P>
<P>At least Thirty (30) days prior to the execution of any agreement pursuant to (c) above, Issuer and Tenant shall furnish the Trustee and the Purchaser of the Bonds with a copy of the amendment, change or modification proposed to be made.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 28.2. <B>Granting of Easements.</B> If no Event of Default under this Lease shall have happened and be continuing, Tenant may, at any time or times, (a) grant easements, licenses and other rights or privileges in the nature of easements with respect to any property included in the Project, free from any rights of Issuer or the Bondowners, or (b) release existing easements, licenses, rights-of-way and other rights or privileges, all with or without consideration and upon such terms and conditions as Tenant shall determine, and Issuer agrees, to the extent that it may legally do so, that it will execute and deliver any instrument necessary or appropriate to confirm and grant or release any such easement, license, right-of-way or other right or privilege or any such agreement or other arrangement, upon receipt by Issuer of: (i) a copy of the instrument of grant or release or of the agreement or other arrangement, (ii) a written application signed by the Authorized Tenant Representative requesting such instrument and (iii) a certificate executed by Tenant stating (aa) that such grant or release is not detrimental to the proper conduct of the business of Tenant, and (bb) that such grant or release will not impair the effective use or interfere with the efficient and economical operation of the Project and will not materially adversely affect the security of the Bondowners. if the instrument of grant shall so provide, any such easement or right and the rights of such other parties thereunder shall be superior to the rights of Issuer and the Bondowners and shall not be affected by any termination of this Lease or default on the part of Tenant hereunder. If no Event of Default shall have happened and be continuing, any payments or other consideration received by Tenant for any such grant or with respect to or under any such agreement or other arrangement shall be and remain the property of Tenant, but, in the event of the termination of this Lease or default of Tenant, all rights then existing of Tenant with respect to or under such grant shall inure to the benefit of and be exercisable by Issuer.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 28.3. <B>Security Interests.</B> Issuer and Tenant agree to execute and deliver all instruments (including financing statements and statements of continuation thereof) necessary for perfection of and continuance of the security interest of Issuer in and to the Project.

Wherever in this Lease it is provided that either party shall or will make any payment or perform or refrain from performing any act or obligation, each such provision shall, even though not so expressed, be construed as an express covenant to make such payment or to perform, or not to perform, as the case may be, such act or obligation.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 28.6. <B>Invalidity of Provisions of Lease.</B> If , for any reason, any provision hereof shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and effect of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby.</P>
