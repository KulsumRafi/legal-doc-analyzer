To:

                            PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear :

In order to continue Grace's successful operating performance in the Chapter 11
environment, it is important to retain key employees by providing compensation
programs that are valued and compete with our industry peers. Therefore, Grace
has proposed, and the Court has approved, a special retention program for
selected key employees.

I am pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in this
retention program for 2003. The total amount of your retention payment will be [
]% of your base earnings. You will receive payment in one lump sum installment
on December 26, 2003 (based on earnings from January 1 - December 31, 2003). The
terms applicable to the supplemental payments are more specifically described in
the attachment to this letter.

I realize that cash is not the only reason why an employee should stay with an
organization. At Grace, you should expect to continue to receive opportunities
to experience personal growth, to upgrade your skills, and to engage in
challenging, satisfying work.

Your commitment to Grace's Vision and Values is appreciated.  Thanks.

Sincerely,



Paul J. Norris
