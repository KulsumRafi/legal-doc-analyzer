         1.2 Date. This agreement is dated and effective October 3, 2002.

2.0      Recitations and Acknowledgments

         2.1 Previous Employment Agreements. Stevens has been employed by Kitty
Hawk since on or about September 1, 1998, and there is currently no written
employment agreement effective between Stevens and Kitty Hawk. This agreement
supersedes, modifies and restates all previous employment agreements between
Stevens and Kitty Hawk.

3.0      Terms of Employment

         3.1 Responsibilities. Stevens will be President of Kitty Hawk, and will
be subject to the direction of Kitty Hawk's Chief Executive Officer and board of
directors, but he will have authority commensurate with his responsibilities and
shall use his full working time and in fulfillment of his employee and fiduciary
duties will commit his productive time and exert his efforts to the extent
normally and generally expected of a full-time president of a corporation of the
size and complexity of Kitty Hawk in carrying out those responsibilities.
Stevens is expected to continue to be involved in all of Kitty Hawk's business,
and to play a major role in the success of the entire enterprise. Both Stevens
and Kitty Hawk expect Stevens' responsibility, authority and compensation to be
adjusted from time to time as determined by Kitty Hawk's board of directors.

         3.2 Annual Compensation. Stevens's basic annual compensation ("basic
annual compensation") shall not be less than $185,000.00, payable in equal
semi-monthly installments. His basic annual compensation may otherwise be
adjusted from time to time, and he may be paid other bonus compensation from
time to time based upon his performance and the success of the Kitty Hawk
enterprise, all as determined by the board of directors.

         3.3 Fringe Benefits. Stevens shall receive the employee fringe benefits
that are generally available to all Kitty Hawk employees, and such other fringe
benefits as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors.

         3.4 Medical Insurance. During his employment under this agreement and
as provided in P. 3.6B below, Kitty Hawk will provide to Stevens at no cost to
Stevens medical and hospitalization insurance coverage at least substantially
equivalent to the coverage that is now provided to Stevens under Kitty Hawk's
employee medical plans.

         3.5 Proprietary information.

         A.  Stevens shall while in Kitty Hawk's employ diligently safeguard
             Kitty Hawk's proprietary information; and when leaving Kitty Hawk's
             employment for whatever reason, shall surrender to Kitty Hawk all
             written or recorded evidence of Kitty Hawk's proprietary
             information, as well as all Kitty Hawk property, in Stevens' actual
             or constructive possession.

         B.  After leaving Kitty Hawk's employment for whatever reason, Stevens
             shall never disclose, disseminate or utilize Kitty Hawk's
             proprietary information unless Kitty Hawk's chief executive officer
             expressly authorizes the disclosure, dissemination or utilization
             in writing.

         C.  For the purpose of this agreement, the term "proprietary
             information" shall specifically not include: (a) information that
             is now in or hereafter enters the public domain without a breach of
             this agreement by Stevens; (b) information Stevens knew already
             prior to the time of his employment by Kitty Hawk; (c) information
             that is obtained, after the date of Stevens' termination, by
             Stevens from any third party that is lawfully in possession of such
             information, but only if such disclosure of information to Stevens
             does not violate any contractual or legal obligation to Kitty Hawk
             on the part of such third party or does not breach a confidential
             relationship of such third party to Kitty Hawk; and (d) information
             required or requested to be disclosed by court order, subpoena,
             data request or other legal process or by applicable regulatory
             authorities; provided, however, that Stevens provide Kitty Hawk
             with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so
             that we may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.


         3.6 Termination. Both Kitty Hawk and Stevens shall have the right to
terminate this employment agreement with or without cause at any time with
30-days' written notice to the other party.

         A.  If Stevens terminates the agreement without material breach by
             Kitty Hawk, Stevens shall waive all rights to any compensation
             under this agreement that would otherwise have been payable after
             the termination. If Stevens terminates the agreement without
             material breach, Stevens agrees to deliver to Kitty Hawk a letter
             of resignation related to all positions Stevens holds within Kitty
             Hawk.

         B.  If Kitty Hawk terminates his employment without material breach by
             Stevens prior to December 31, 2002, Stevens shall be entitled as
             his exclusive remedies to (i) such portion of the basic annual
             compensation he would have received from the date of termination
             through December 31, 2002, payable when it would have been paid in
             the absence of such termination, and (ii) the medical insurance
             benefits provided under P. 3.4 he would have otherwise received
             through December 31, 2002 in the absence of such termination, plus
             (iii) three (3) months worth of his basic annual compensation,
             payable when it would have been paid in the absence of termination
             and (iv) the medical insurance benefits provided under P. 3.4 for a
             period of three (3) months after the date of termination. If Kitty
             Hawk terminates his employment without material breach by Stevens
             after December 31, 2002, Stevens shall be entitled as his exclusive
             remedies to (i) three (3) months worth of his basic annual
             compensation, payable when it would have been paid in the absence
             of termination and (ii) the medical insurance benefits provided
             under P. 3.4 for a period of three (3) months after the date of
             termination. If Kitty Hawk terminates Stevens' employment for
             cause, he shall not be entitled to the remedies set forth in this
             P. 3.6B. If Kitty Hawk terminates Stevens' employment without his
             material breach either before or after December 31, 2002, Stevens
             agrees to deliver to Kitty Hawk a letter of resignation related to
             all positions Stevens holds within Kitty Hawk.

         C.  If because of disability Stevens becomes unable to perform his
             duties under his employment prior to any termination, or if Stevens
             dies during his employment under this agreement prior to any
             termination, Stevens' shall rely on the proceeds of insurance
             policies covering his disability or death as maintained by Kitty
             Hawk as his sole remedy in lieu of the compensation set for in P.
             3.6B above. If Stevens shall become disabled or shall die after
             termination and during the time the severance compensation is being
             paid, Stevens' estate shall be paid the compensation as set forth
             in P. 3.6B above.

4.0      Hiring of Kitty Hawk Employees after Termination. If Stevens is
         terminated without material breach of this agreement, for a period of
         three (3) years after Stevens's termination, Stevens agrees that he
         will not attempt to knowingly hire, directly or by someone under his
         direct

         contractor or otherwise, any of Kitty Hawk's officers or key employees,
         so long as such officer or key employee was not terminated by Kitty
         Hawk and such officer or key employee is still employed by Kitty Hawk.
