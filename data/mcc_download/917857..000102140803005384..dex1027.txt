                              DOMINION HOMES, INC.

                       ENDORSEMENT SPLIT DOLLAR AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT, effective January 1, 2003, is made this 20/th/ day of December,
2002, by and between Dominion Homes, Inc. ("Company") and Douglas G. Borror who
is an employee of Company ("Insured").

WHEREAS, the Company and the Insured previously entered into a split-dollar
agreement dated January 15, 2001 ("Prior Arrangement"); and

WHEREAS, due to changes in the laws governing split-dollar arrangements, the
Company and the Insured want to revise the Prior Arrangement; and

WHEREAS, the Company wants to provide death benefit protection if the Insured
dies while actively employed and if other conditions described in this Agreement
are met; and

WHEREAS, the Company and the Insured have agreed to substitute this agreement
for the Prior Agreement and the Insured has transferred to the Company his or
her ownership rights in the policy subject to the Prior Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises described
below, the parties agree to cancel the Prior Arrangement, subject to the
following terms:

1.   Policy Title and Ownership. By entering into this Agreement, the Insured
surrenders all rights under the Prior Arrangement and under the policy (or
policies) through which the Prior Arrangement was funded and agrees to execute
all documents required to transfer that interest to the Company. Title and
ownership of the policies described in Attachment A to the Agreement
("Policies") will reside in the Company for its use and for the use of the
Insured, all in accordance with this Agreement. The Company will not borrow
against or withdraw from the policy cash values.

2.   Beneficiary Designation Rights. The Insured (or his or her assignee) will
have the right and power to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
his or her share of the proceeds payable on his or her death and to elect and
change a payment option for such beneficiaries but subject to any right or
interest the Company may have in such proceeds as provided in this Agreement.

3.   Policy Dividends. Any dividend declared on the Policy will be applied to
purchase additional paid-up insurance on the Insured's life.

4.   Premium Payments. For periods during which the Policy is outstanding,
premiums will be paid as follows:

     (a)  The Company will pay all premiums due.

     (b)  On or before the date it is due (or within any grace period provided
     under the Policy), the Company will pay to the Insurer the full amount of
     each Policy premium due and, if asked to do so, will give the Insured
     evidence that these premiums have been paid.

<PAGE>

     (c)  If any Policy contains any disability waiver of premium or mortality
     charge provision, neither the Insured nor the Company will be required to
     pay any Policy premium for any period that waiver is in effect.

     (d)  As of the end of each calendar year, the Company will give the Insured
     a statement of any taxable income arising under this program. The Insured
     is solely responsible for calculating and paying his or her income tax
     liability on this income.

5.   Division of Death Proceeds of Policy

     (a)  Subject to the terms of paragraph 5(b), the Company will be entitled
     to an amount equal to the cumulative premiums paid as of the date of death
     or, if greater, the policy's cash value determined as of the date of death.
     Such cash value will include any outstanding dividend accumulations and the
     cash value of any paid-up additions and any postmortem dividends determined
     as of the date of death.

     (b)  (1)  Despite paragraph 5(a), the Company will irrevocably waive its
     right to receive the amounts described in paragraph 5(a) if the Insured
     dies while actively employed but:

               (i)    After both (A) completing at least 10 years of
               participation (calculated from January 1, 1999) and (B) the
               Company's net worth (calculated by applying standard accounting
               principles) first exceeds $100,000,000; or

               (ii)   After a "change of control" [as defined in paragraph 5(c)]
               occurs; and

          (2)  The Insured dies while actively employed but after reaching age
          55; or

          (3)  For any other reason, the Company decides to waive its interest
          in the Policy.

     (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" means the
     occurrence of the first of any of the following events:

          (1)  Douglas Borror and David Borror both cease to be members of
          Company's Board of Directors; or

          (2)  Any direct or indirect acquisition by a "person," including a
          "group" [as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Act")] after which the
          "person" or "group" is the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
          13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
          Company representing more than 40 percent of the combined voting power
          of the Company's then outstanding securities; provided, however, that
          "person" or "group" will not include (i) the Company, (ii) any entity
          under common control with the Company [within the meaning of Section
          414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("Code")], (iii) BRC
          Properties Inc. or any

<PAGE>

          of its shareholders or members of the family [as defined in Code
          (S)318] of Donald Borror or [iv] any employee benefit plan of any
          entity described in Section 5(c)(2)(i), (ii) and/or (iii) of this
          definition; or

          (3)  The adoption or authorization by the shareholders of the Company
          of a definitive agreement or a series of related agreements (i) for
          the merger or other business combination of the Company with or into
          another entity in which the shareholders of the Company immediately
          before the effective date of that merger or other business combination
          own less than 50 percent of the voting power in the entity immediately
          after the effective date of that merger or other business combination;
          or (ii) for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
          of the assets of the Company; or

          (4)  The adoption by the shareholders of the Company of a plan
          relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

6.   Limits on Insured's Rights in the Policy.

     (a)  Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Insured may not
     sell, assign, transfer, borrow against, surrender or cancel his or her
     rights under the Policy or change the dividend election described in
     paragraph 3 without the Company's written consent.

     (b)  Regardless of any other provision of this Agreement, the Employee may
     absolutely and irrevocably transfer his or her rights under the Policy to a
     donee, subject to the terms of paragraph 5.

7.   Collection of Death Benefits.

     (a)  If the Insured dies while the Policy is in effect and while he or she
     is actively employed, the Insured's beneficiary will receive a death
     benefit equal to the amount specified in Attachment B. Subject to paragraph
     5, the balance of any death benefit payable under any Policy will be paid
     to the Company. The Company will cooperate with the named beneficiary to
     take any action necessary to collect the death benefit under the Policy.
     This Agreement will terminate when that benefit has been collected and paid
     as provided in this paragraph.

     (b)  If the Insured terminates employment for any reason other than death,
     no death benefit will be paid under the Policy and the Company will
     surrender the Policy and be solely entitled to all value associated with
     that Policy.

8.   Cash Surrender Value. The Company will be entitled to an amount equal to
the policy's cash value, determined as of the date of surrender less any
indebtedness and interest on such indebtedness determined as of the date of
surrender. Such cash value will include any outstanding dividend accumulations
or cash value of any paid-up additions determined as of the date of surrender.

9.   Termination of Agreement During the Insured's Lifetime. This Agreement will
automatically terminate if the Insured terminates employment for any reason
other than death before the Policy is distributed to him or her.

<PAGE>

10.  Insurer Not a Party. The Insurer is not a party to this Agreement and has
no obligation or duty under this Agreement and will have fully discharged its
obligations by paying benefits under the terms of the Policy. No provision of
this Agreement or any modification or amendment of this Agreement will, in any
way, be construed as enlarging, changing or in any way affecting the Insurer's
obligations.

11.  Named Fiduciary, Determination of Benefits, Claims Procedure and
Administration.

     (a)  The Company is the named fiduciary under this Agreement and has
     authority to control and manage the operation and administration of this
     Agreement and must establish a funding policy and method consistent with
     the objectives stated in this Agreement.

     (b)  The Company will apply the following claims procedure to resolve any
     disputes under this Agreement.

          (i)    Filing Claims. The Insured or his or her beneficiary may file a
          claim for Plan benefits with the Company.

          (ii)   Notification to Claimant. If a claim is wholly or partially
          denied, the Company will send a written notice of denial to the
          claimant. This notice must be sent within 90 days after receipt of the
          claim, must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
          claimant and must include (A) the specific reason or reasons for which
          the claim was denied, (B) specific reference to pertinent Plan
          provisions, rules, procedures or protocols upon which the Company
          relied to deny the claim, (C) a description of any additional material
          or information that the claimant may file to perfect the claim and an
          explanation of why this material or information is necessary and (D) a
          description of the steps the claimant may take to appeal an adverse
          determination including a statement of the claimant's right to bring
          an action under ERISA after all appeals have been exhausted.

          (iii)  Review Procedure. If a claim has been wholly or partially
          denied, the affected claimant, or his or her authorized representative
          may (A) request that the Company reconsider its initial denial by
          filing a written appeal no more than 60 days after receiving written
          notice that all or part of the initial claim was denied, (B) review
          pertinent documents and other material upon which the Company relied
          when denying the initial claim, and (C) submit a written description
          of the reasons for which the claimant disagrees with the Company's
          initial adverse decision. An appeal of an initial denial of benefits
          and all supporting material must be made in writing and directed to
          the Company. The Company is solely responsible for reviewing all
          benefit claims and appeals and taking all appropriate steps to
          implement its decision.

          (iv)   Decision on Review. The Company will render its decision within
          60 days of receiving a benefit appeal. However, if special
          circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing on any matter
          pertaining to the denied claim) require additional time, this decision
          will be rendered as soon as possible, but, not later than 120 days
          after receipt of the claimant's written

<PAGE>

          appeal and only if the Company notifies the claimant, in writing, that
          it needs more time to review an appeal and why that additional time is
          needed. The Company's decision on review will be sent to the claimant
          in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written
          in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, specific
          references to the pertinent Plan provisions, rules, procedures or
          protocols upon which the Company relied to deny the appeal and a
          statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and
          free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents
          relevant to the claim and a statement regarding the claimant's right
          to bring an action under ERISA.

12.  Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified except by
the written agreement of each party or their respective successors or assigns
and may not be terminated except under the terms specifically provided in this
Agreement.

13.  Binding Effect. This Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the
benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns and to the Insured and his
or her successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and beneficiaries.

mailed, it must be sent by United States certified mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the recipient's last known address. The date any notice, consent or
