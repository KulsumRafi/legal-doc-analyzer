MOVE TO A SINGLE PRIMARY STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING &#150;<BR>
WILL REMAIN ON SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE</B></FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="3"><B>Creative Will Initiate Steps Toward Delisting From NASDAQ</B></FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>SINGAPORE &#150; January&nbsp;28, 2003 </B>&#150; Creative Technology Ltd. (Nasdaq: CREAF) today
announced that the Company intends to move to a single primary stock exchange
listing. The Company&#146;s current listing on the Singapore Exchange Securities
Trading Limited (&#147;SGX-ST&#148;) would become Creative&#146;s sole exchange listing. The
Company has the intention to delist its Ordinary Shares from the NASDAQ
exchange, and will initiate steps that can facilitate the elimination of its
U.S. public reporting obligations. The delisting from NASDAQ would not affect
the status of Creative&#146;s shares on the SGX-ST.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&#147;We believe our shareholders will be best served if Creative is able to delist
from NASDAQ and retain only our exchange listing on the SGX-ST in Singapore,&#148;
said Sim Wong Hoo, Chairman and CEO of Creative Technology Ltd. &#147;Creative&#146;s
initial public offering was on the NASDAQ in 1992, and we added a primary
listing on the SGX-ST in 1994. Over time, the majority of our shares have moved
to the Singapore exchange. Since November 2001, our NASDAQ daily trading
volume has declined to a low level, representing less than one-tenth the
average daily trading volume of its shares on the SGX-ST over the past six
months. And the vast majority of analysts who cover Creative, even for the
major U.S. institutions, are based in Singapore.&#148;

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Sim continued, &#147;With the relatively low trading volume of our shares on NASDAQ
and the accessibility of the Singapore exchange to our U.S. shareholders, we
believe the rising costs of maintaining our NASDAQ listing and meeting the new
SEC reporting requirements are no longer economically justifiable for our
company and shareholders. However, through the process we are announcing
today, we expect to reduce our current administrative overhead and costs and
still provide shareholders access to our highest-volume public equity market,
the Singapore exchange, which is one of the premier stock exchanges in all of
Asia. We believe it is in our shareholders&#146; best interest that we initiate
steps that can facilitate the elimination of our SEC reporting obligations and
our intended delisting from NASDAQ.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">An overview of the steps Creative is considering taking is included below, and
further details will be contained in a Schedule&nbsp;13E-3 filing with the SEC,
which will be mailed to shareholders in the near future.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Background</B><BR>
Creative&#146;s shares have been traded on NASDAQ since August 1992, and on the main
board of the SGX-ST since June 1994. Creative&#146;s shares in Singapore are traded
in scripless form, with the underlying shares deposited with The Central
Depository (Pte) Limited (&#147;CDP&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Creative currently has primary listings on both the NASDAQ and the SGX-ST.
Creative is obligated to file publicly available reports with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning its financial results and other
matters. These reports have been filed with the SEC since 1992 when Creative
completed its initial public offering in the U.S. With its listing on the
SGX-ST in 1994, Creative was further required to comply with the SGX-ST&#146;s
Continuing Listing Rules. Effective October&nbsp;6, 1998, Creative obtained an
exemption from having to comply with the Listing Rules of SGX-ST, subject to
conditions requiring Creative, amongst other matters, to make prompt releases
to the SGX-ST and the Singapore market of all announcements and filings made in
the U.S.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Rationale for the Delisting from NASDAQ</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The administrative overhead and cost of the evolving and increasingly
burdensome U.S. reporting obligations has become significant, especially for
Creative, a Singapore company with dual primary listings &#150; particularly in
relation to the limited benefit that Creative believes it presently derives
from its NASDAQ listing. Since November 2001, Creative&#146;s SGX-ST trading volume
has significantly exceeded the Company&#146;s NASDAQ trading volume. Creative&#146;s
NASDAQ daily trading volume has declined to a low level, representing less than
one-tenth the average daily trading volume of its shares on the SGX-ST over the
past six months. Additionally, over the past two years, there has been an
increasing trend for Creative shares to move from NASDAQ to SGX-ST, where the
majority of its shares are currently registered.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For these reasons, and with the potential to substantially reduce
administrative overheads and costs while retaining its listing on the SGX-ST
(which is also accessible to U.S. shareholders), the Directors of Creative
believe it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders for
Creative to take the steps to eliminate its U.S. public reporting obligations
and seek to delist from NASDAQ while maintaining its SGX-ST listing.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Continued Listing on the SGX-ST</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Delisting from NASDAQ will not affect the status of Creative&#146;s shares on the
SGX-ST. After the intended delisting from NASDAQ, Creative would retain the
listing of its Ordinary Shares on the SGX-ST, and would comply with the
Continuing Listing Rules of the SGX-ST.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">SGX-ST has agreed to Creative retaining its primary listing on SGX main board
upon the delisting from NASDAQ subject to compliance with the SGX-ST&#146;s
Continuing Listing

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Proposals to reduce the number of shareholders in the U.S.</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Creative can eliminate its U.S. public reporting obligations by reducing the
number of holders of its Ordinary Shares resident in the U.S. (including
holders who own shares in the name of a broker), and the number of holders of
options to purchase Ordinary Shares resident in the U.S., in each case to less
than 300. As a result, Creative intends to implement proposals to reduce the
number of holders of Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares resident in the United States.
These proposals would include the termination of the electronic transfer of
Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares from the register of the CDP in Singapore to
accounts with brokers located in the United States (the &#147;Flow Back
Restriction&#148;). Creative may also repurchase its Ordinary Shares on NASDAQ in an
open market repurchase program (&#147;Repurchase Program&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Flow Back Restriction</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Presently, Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares can be moved between SGX-ST and NASDAQ by
electronic transfers through CDP or, in the case of scrip-based shares, the
physical transfers of the shares. The Flow Back Restriction will stop the
electronic transfer of Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares from the register of the CDP
in Singapore to accounts with brokers located in the U.S. so that there will
not be an increase in the number of shares in the U.S. arising from the
electronic movement of shares from Singapore to the U.S. This will ensure that
the number of shares in the U.S. can be reduced by the number of shares that
may be transferred from the U.S. to CDP. The Flow Back Restriction does not
prevent the physical transfer of shares from Singapore to the U.S.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Repurchase Program</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Creative may also reduce the number of holders of Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares
resident in the United States by the repurchase of its Ordinary Shares on
NASDAQ in an open market purchase program. The repurchase of shares is
authorized under the shareholders&#146; mandate given by Creative&#146;s shareholders at
its last annual general meeting held on November&nbsp;20, 2002, which is valid until
its next annual general meeting. The share repurchase mandate allows Creative
to repurchase up to 7,918,552 shares, which was 10% of its outstanding Ordinary
Shares as of November&nbsp;20, 2002.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Estimated Timing</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Creative currently expects the Flow Back Restriction to commence in March,
2003.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Creative is currently unable to estimate the timing of the proposed delisting
from NASDAQ or the termination of its U.S. reporting obligations. Termination
of Creative&#146;s U.S. reporting obligations and a delisting from NASDAQ would
occur if the numbers of U.S. holders of its Ordinary Shares and options to
purchase Ordinary Shares are reduced to the levels noted above. Notwithstanding
that the number of U.S. holders of its Ordinary Shares and options may not be
reduced below these levels, Creative may proceed to delist from NASDAQ at an
appropriate time if the number of holders of Creative&#146;s Ordinary Shares and
options resident in the United States are reduced to such levels as it deems
appropriate.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Further announcements will be made by Creative whenever the dates for any of
the events noted above are finalized.
