(including, without limitation, pursuant to subsection 12.6 of Credit
Agreement).

                  3.8 Consent. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that certain
provisions of this Amendment require that the Borrowers cause (i) certain
additional Subsidiaries to execute the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and
grant to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a
security interest in certain additional Collateral and (ii) the existing
Grantors to grant to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Lenders, a security



<PAGE>

interest in certain additional Collateral. The Lenders hereby agree that the
Borrowers and such Subsidiaries shall have 30 days from the Third Amendment
Effective Date to take all actions necessary to create valid perfected security
interests in such additional Collateral. The Borrowers and such Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to duly execute and deliver a control
agreement with respect to each Deposit Account for which a control agreement is
required under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement of such Borrower or
Subsidiary and in any event, shall duly execute and deliver such control
agreements no later than the date that is 30 days after the Third Amendment
Effective Date.

                  3.9 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  3.10 Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to consent to a
waiver that would have the effect of waiving an existing Default or Event of
Default in order to permit a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans or issuing of a
Letter of Credit unless the Revolving Credit Lenders the Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentages of which aggregate at least a majority of the Revolving
Credit Commitments consent to such waiver.

                  3.11 Acknowledgment of Third Amendment. Each of the
undersigned Subsidiaries of the US Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees to
the Third Amendment, and further acknowledges and agrees that the Obligations
under the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Third Amendment, and the other
Loan Documents shall include the US Tranche C Term Loans and that such
Obligations under the Loan Documents remain in full force and effect as of the
date hereof. Each Credit Party hereby agrees that all security interests and
Liens securing the Obligations remain in full force and effect as security for
the Obligations, as they may be increased and modified in connection with the
Third Amendment. Each Credit Party hereby (a) confirms and agrees that its
guarantee under the Loan Documents is, and shall continue to be, in full force
and effect, is hereby confirmed and ratified in all respects and extends to
include the Obligations, as they may be modified and increased in connection
with the Third Amendment; (b) confirms and acknowledges that it is and remains
validly and justly indebted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the
payment of all of the obligations which it has guaranteed (including the
Obligations as they may be modified and increased in connection with the Third

or nature whatsoever; and (c) reaffirms and admits the validity and
enforceability of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Third Amendment, and
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and Liens in the Collateral which were
granted by it pursuant to any of the Loan Documents or otherwise.
