                         4% CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2008

1.       Interest.

         This Security shall bear interest at a rate of 4% per year on the
principal amount hereof, from December 31, 2002 or from the most recent
Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which payment has been paid or duly
provided for, payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30
and December 31 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date") to the persons
in whose names the Securities are registered at the close of business on March
1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (each, a "Regular Record Date") (whether
or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest
Payment Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

         Interest on Securities converted during the period after a Regular
Record Date, but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (i) will not
be required to be paid if the Security is to be purchased in connection with a
Fundamental Change on a Fundamental Change Purchase Date that occurs during
this period; or (ii) if the Security is not purchased during this period, will
be paid to the Holder of the Securities on the Regular Record Date but, upon
conversion, the Holder must pay the Company the interest which has accrued and
will be paid on such Interest Payment Date unless at the time of conversion
there is a default in the payment of interest on the Securities.

         If the principal amount of a Security, premium, if any, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, or any portion thereof, is not paid when due (whether upon
acceleration pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Indenture, upon the date set for
payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price pursuant to Paragraph 5
hereof, or upon the Stated Maturity of this Security), then, in each such case,
the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear interest at the
annual rate of 1% above the applicable interest rate on the Securities,
compounded semi-annually, which interest shall accrue from the date such
overdue amount was originally due to the date of payment of such amount,
including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such
interest shall be payable on demand and shall be based on a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

         Except as provided below, interest and Liquidated Damages Amounts, if
any, will be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the
written election of the Holders of these Securities.

2.       Method of Payment.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will
make payments in cash in respect of Fundamental Change Purchase Prices and at
Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to the Paying Agent to
collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay cash
amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal
tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make
such cash payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds or check
payable in such money.


                                       3.
<PAGE>
3.       Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.

         Initially, LaSalle National Banking Association (the "Trustee") will
act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint
and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice,
other than notice to the Trustee; provided, however, that the Company will
maintain at least one Paying Agent in the State of New York, City of New York,
Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be an office or agency of the
Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may
act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar.

4.       Indenture.

         The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of
December 31, 2002 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The
terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made
part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in
effect from time to time (the "TIA"). Capitalized terms used herein and not
defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The
Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to
the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of those terms. To the extent any
provisions of this Security and the Indenture conflict, the provisions of the
Indenture shall control.

         The Securities are unsecured obligations of the Company limited to
$13,400,000 aggregate principal amount.

         The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and
without charge a copy of the Indenture, which has in it the text of this
Security in larger type. Requests may be made to:

         ProxyMed, Inc.
         2555 Davie Road, Suite 110
         Ft. Lauderdale, Florida 33317
         Attn:  General Counsel
         Facsimile No:  (954) 473-2341
         Telephone No:  (954) 473-1001

5.       Purchase by the Company at the Option of the Holder.

         (a)      At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to offer to
purchase the Securities held by such Holder as of a date that is 30 days after
the date of notice of a Fundamental Change delivered by the Company (or, if
such 30th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) for a
purchase price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Purchase
Date. The Company shall mail a written notice of a Fundamental Change by first
class mail to the Trustee and the Holders no later than 10 days after the
occurrence of the Fundamental Change. Such notice shall describe the purchase
right arising as a result of such Fundamental Change. To exercise such purchase
right, a Holder shall deliver to the Company a Fundamental Change Purchase
Notice containing


                                      4.
<PAGE>
the information set forth in the Indenture at any time prior to the 30th day
after the date of the delivery of the Fundamental Change Notice and shall
deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture.

         The Fundamental Change Purchase Price shall be paid in cash.

         (b)      Holders have the right to withdraw any Fundamental Change
Purchase Notice by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of
withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

         If cash sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of all
Securities or portions thereof to be purchased on the Fundamental Change
Purchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Fundamental Change
Purchase Date, interest ceases to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof
immediately after such Fundamental Change Purchase Date, and the Holder thereof
shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the
Fundamental Change Purchase Price upon surrender of such Security.

6.       Conversion.

         (a)      The Securities may be converted into shares of common stock
on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Indenture and this Security.

         (b)      At the option of the Holder, the Holder may surrender
Securities or portions thereof for conversion into shares of Common Stock at
any time prior to the Stated Maturity if the Triggering Event for conversion of
such Securities or portion thereof has been met by the time of surrender.
One-third of the par value of each Security shall become convertible on the
first date, if any, during each Measurement Period on which the Company and its
Subsidiaries achieves the Triggering Event for such Measurement Period as
evidenced in the Triggering Event Certification for such Measurement Period.
The Triggering Event for the first Measurement Period shall be met if the
Company and its Subsidiaries recognizes $5,000,000 in Included Revenue in
excess of the Baseline Revenue for such first Measurement Period. The
Triggering Event for the second Measurement Period shall be met if the Company
and its Subsidiaries recognizes $12,500,000 in Included Revenue in excess of
the Baseline Revenue for such second Measurement Period. The Triggering Event
for the third Measurement Period shall be met if the Company and its
Subsidiaries recognizes $21,000,000 in Included Revenue in excess of the
Baseline Revenue for such third Measurement Period. If the Included Revenue for
any Measurement Period exceeds the incremental revenue required to satisfy the
Triggering Event for that Measurement Period, then such excess Included Revenue
will be counted as Included Revenue in the next Measurement Period and shall be
included in the Annual Certification and the Triggering Event Certification.

         (c)      If the Company (1) distributes any rights or warrants to all
holders of shares of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring
within 45 days of such distribution) to purchase shares of Common Stock at less
than the average of the Sales Prices of a share of the Common Stock for the 10
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the
date of such distribution or (2) distributes to all holders of shares of its
Common Stock any of its debt securities or assets or any rights, warrants or
options to purchase securities


                                      5.
<PAGE>
of the Company, which distribution has a per share value exceeding 10% of the
Sales Price of a share of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the declaration date for such distribution, unless the Holder may
participate in this distribution without conversion, the Securities may be
surrendered for conversion beginning on the date the Company gives notice to
the Holders of such right, which shall be not less than 20 days prior to the
Ex-Dividend Time for such dividend or distribution, and the Securities may be
surrendered for conversion at any time thereafter until the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Time or until the
Company announces that such distribution will not take place.

         (d)      A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a
Fundamental Change Purchase Notice exercising the option of such Holder to
require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such
notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

         The initial Conversion Rate is 54.57621569 shares of Common Stock per
$1,000 principal amount of Securities, subject to adjustment in certain events
described in the Indenture. A Holder that surrenders Securities for conversion
will receive cash or a check, or, at the Company's option, a whole share of
Common Stock, in lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock.

         To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and
manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice below (or complete and manually
sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion
Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and (4) pay any transfer or
similar tax, if required.

         A Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the principal amount
of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. No payment or
adjustment will be made for dividends on the shares of Common Stock except as
provided in the Indenture. Except as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, on
conversion of a Security, the Holder will not receive any cash payment
representing accrued interest with respect to the converted Securities.
Instead, upon conversion the Company will deliver to the Holder a fixed number
of shares of Common Stock and any cash payment to account for fractional
shares. Accrued interest will be deemed paid in full rather than canceled,
extinguished or forfeited. The Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to
account for accrued interest.

         The Conversion Rate will be adjusted as provided in Article X of the
Indenture. The Company may increase the Conversion Rate for any period of at
least 20 days, upon at least 15 days' notice so long as the increase is
irrevocable during such period. In addition, the Company may increase the
Conversion Rate if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or
diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any stock or
rights distribution.

         In addition, if the Company is a party to any transaction or event
(whether by means of a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale of
all or substantially all of the Company's assets or any similar transaction or
series of transactions), in connection with which (i) all or substantially all
of the Company's common stock would be converted into cash, securities or


                                      6.
<PAGE>
other property or (ii) the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to such
transaction or event hold less than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock immediately following such transaction or event (such transaction or
event, a "Conversion Event"), the Holder may at such Holder's option surrender
its Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15
days prior to the anticipated effective date of such Conversion Event until and
including the date which is 45 days after the actual date of such Conversion
Event unless the Conversion Event Exception has been satisfied. In the event of
a Conversion Event, in which the Conversion Event Exception is not satisfied,
the Holder may convert a Security into the maximum number of shares of the
Company's Common Stock into which such Security could be converted assuming
that all Triggering Events had been met immediately prior to such Conversion
Event. If the Company is a party to a Conversion Event, then at the effective
time of such Conversion Event, the Holder's right to convert a Security into
the Company's common stock will be changed into a right to convert it into the
kind and amount of cash, securities and other property which the Holder would
have received if the Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to the
transaction.

7.       Subordination.

         The Securities are subordinated to Senior Debt as provided in the
Indenture. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Debt must be paid
before the Securities may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder
by accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination and authorizes the Trustee
to give it effect.

8.       Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

         The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons. A Holder
may transfer or exchange the Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The
Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by
law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange
any Securities in respect of which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has
been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased
in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased).

9.       Persons Deemed Owners.

         The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of
this Security for all purposes.

10.      Unclaimed Money or Securities.

         The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company any money
held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that
remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law.
After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must
look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable
abandoned property law designates another person.


                                      7.
<PAGE>
11.      Amendment; Waiver.

         Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the
Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities
at the time outstanding and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Securities at the time outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions set forth
in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the
Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities among other things, (i) to
cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, provided that such
modification or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the
Holders of the Securities in any material respect; (ii) to modify the
restrictions on, and procedures for, resale and other transfers of Securities
pursuant to any change in applicable law or regulation (or the interpretation
thereof) or in practice relating to the resale or transfer of "restricted
securities" under the Securities Act generally; (iii) to comply with Article V
or Section 10.15 of the Indenture; (iv) to secure the Company's obligations or
to add any guarantee under the Securities and the Indenture; (v) to add events
of default with respect to the Securities; (vi) to add to the covenants of the
Company for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Company; (vii) to make any change necessary for the
registration of the Securities under the Securities Act or to comply with the
TIA, or any amendment thereto, or to comply with any requirement of the SEC in
connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, provided that
such modification or amendment does not materially and adversely affect the
interests of the Holders of the Securities; (viii) to provide for
uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities
or to provide for bearer Securities; (ix) to evidence and provide for the
acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee pursuant to Section
7.8 of the Indenture; or (x) to add or modify other provisions herein with
respect to matters or questions arising hereunder that the Company and the
Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and that will not materially adversely
affect the interests of the Holders.

12.      Defaults and Remedies.

         Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default in payment
of the principal amount or premium, if any, on any Security when the same
becomes due and payable, whether or not the payment is prohibited by the
provisions of Article XI of the Indenture; (ii) default in the payment of any
interest or Liquidated Damages Amounts, if any, when due and payable, and the
continuance of such default for a period of 30 days, whether or not the payment
is prohibited by the provisions of Article XI of the Indenture; (iii) failure
by the Company to comply in any material respect with other agreements or
covenants in the Indenture or the Securities, for forty-five (45) days after
notice; (iv) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (v) certain events of default under any Senior
Debt, and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days.

         Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as
provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or
the Securities unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to
certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any
continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause
(i) or (ii) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their
interests.


                                      8.
<PAGE>
13.      Trustee Dealings with the Company.

         Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under
the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or
pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates
with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

14.      Calculations in Respect of Securities.

         The Company or its agents will be responsible for making all
calculations called for under the Securities. These calculations include, but
are not limited to, determination of the Sales Prices for the Common Stock, the
rate of interest payable on the Securities and the Conversion Rate of the
Securities. Any calculations made in good faith and without manifest error will
be final and binding on Holders of the Securities. The Company or its agents
will be required to deliver to the Trustee a schedule of its calculations and
each of the Trustee and the Trustee will be entitled to rely upon the accuracy
of such calculations without independent verification. The Trustee will forward
the Company's calculations to any Holder of the Securities upon the request of
such Holder.

15.      Successor Persons.

         When a successor person or other entity assumes all the obligations of
its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor person
will be released from those obligations.

16.      No Recourse Against Others.

         A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company
or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company
under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security,
each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

17.      Authentication.

         This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other
side of this Security.

18.      Abbreviations.

         Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an
assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the
entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as
tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors
Act).

19.      Governing Law.

         THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY WILL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD AS TO
CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES.

20.      Registration Rights.

         The Holders of the Securities are entitled to the benefits of a
Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of even date herewith, by and among the
Company and the parties thereto, including the receipt of Liquidated Damages
Amounts in respect of Events (each as defined in such agreement).
