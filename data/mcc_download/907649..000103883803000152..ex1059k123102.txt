on-going transaction.

II. SET-OFFS: In the event either party shall fail to make timely delivery of
any crude oil and/or condensate or other applicable products due and owing to
the other party, or in the event that either party shall fail to make timely
payment of any monies due and owing to the party, the other party may set off
any deliveries or payments due under this or any other agreement between the
parties. "Party" for the purposes of this paragraph shall include for each party
its affiliates (including, but not limited to, both parent and subsidiary
companies). It is the intent of the parties to this contract to treat each party
hereto and its respective affiliates (including, but not limited to, both parent
and subsidiary corporate entities) as a single legal entity for the purposes of
set-off regarding debts and claims.

this agreement, and Buyer or its duly authorized representatives shall have
access to such records, and the right to audit the same, at all reasonable times

method in effect. Tests for quality shall be made at regular intervals by Seller

have a representative or independent inspector (which cost shall be shared
equally between the parties hereto) present to witness all gauges, tests and
measurements.

V. WARRANTY: Seller warrants title, free and clear of all taxes, liens and
encumbrances which are customarily paid by Seller prior to delivery, to the oil
sold and delivered hereunder and warrants that said oil has been produced,

later proves to be invalid, or any cause beyond the reasonable control of either
Buyer or Seller whether similar or dissimilar to the enumeration contained
herein, except inability to discharge financial obligations when due. The party
suspending performance under this clause shall give prompt notice and shall use
its best efforts to cure promptly the cause for such suspension. Upon cessation
of the cause for suspension, performance shall resume (or commence) immediately.

contract upon the giving of written notice thereof to the other party.

amendment of this Contract except by writing, signed by both parties hereto.
