Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessor may do one or more of the

performance by Lessee of the applicable covenants of this Lease or to recover

Item of Equipment may be located and, without notice to Lessee and with or

possession, and without such action constituting a termination of this Lease
unless Lessor notifies Lessee in writing to such effect; (7) by written notice
to Lessee specifying a payment date, demand that Lessee pay to Lessor, and
Lessee shall pay to Lessor, on the payment date specified in such notice, as
liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty, any unpaid Rent
due prior to the payment date specified in such notice plus whichever of the
following amounts Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall specify in such notice
(together with interest on such amount at the Late Payment Rate from the payment
date specified in such notice to the date of actual payment): (i) an amount,
with respect to an Item of Equipment, equal to the Rent payable for such Item of
Equipment for the remainder of the then current Term thereof, after discounting
such Rent to present worth as of the payment date specified in such notice on
the basis of a per annum rate of discount equal to five percent (5%) from the
respective dates upon which such Rent would have been paid had this Lease not
been terminated; or (ii) the Stipulated Loss Value, computed as of the payment
date specified in such notice or, if such payment date is not a Rent Payment
Date, the Rent Payment Date next following the payment date specified in such
notice (provided, however, that, with respect to any Item of Equipment returned
to or repossessed by Lessor, the amount recoverable under this clause (ii) shall
be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the Fair Market Sales
Value (taking into account its actual condition) of such Item of Equipment; (8)
cause Lessee, at its expense, to promptly assemble any and all Items of
Equipment and return the same to Lessor at such place as Lessor may designate in
writing; and (9) exercise any other right or remedy available to Lessor under
applicable law or proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the terms
hereof or to recover damages for the breach hereof or to rescind this Lease. In
addition, Lessee shall be liable, except as otherwise provided above, for any
and all unpaid Rent due hereunder before or during the exercise of any of the
foregoing remedies, and for legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by
reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the exercise of
Lessor&#146;s remedies with respect thereto, including without limitation the
repayment in full of any costs and expenses necessary to be expended in
repairing any Item of Equipment in order to cause it to be in compliance with
all maintenance and regulatory standards imposed by this Lease. If an Event of
Default occurs, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Lessee hereby waives any
right to notice of sale and further waives any defenses, rights, offsets or
claims against Lessor because of the manner or method of sale or disposition of
any Items of Equipment. None of Lessor&#146;s rights or remedies hereunder are
intended to be exclusive of, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any
other right or remedy referred to hereunder or otherwise available to Lessor or
its assigns at law or in equity. No express or implied waiver by Lessor of any
Event of Default shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default or a
waiver of any of Lessor&#146;s rights.</FONT></div></TD>
