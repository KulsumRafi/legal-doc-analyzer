          If Close of Escrow occurs, it is the desire of BUYER and SELLER that (i) the Fee
          Land, (ii) the Contract Parcel and, if timely acquired by BUYER prior to
          submission to County of the Subdivision Applications (as defined below), (iii)
          the real property described as Parcel Twenty-seven (27) in Exhibit &#147;A&#148;
          attached hereto (&#147;<B>BLM Parcel</B>&#148;) be legally combined to
          constitute a single legal parcel in which all dedicated street areas, all patent
          reservation areas and all other right-of-way areas between all of the parcels
          currently comprising the Fee Land, the Contract Parcel and, if timely acquired
          by BUYER prior to submission to County of the Subdivision Applications, the BLM
          Parcel, are vacated, terminated and eliminated; provided, however, that
          dedicated street areas, patent reservation areas and right-of-way areas for
          Parvin Avenue would not be vacated, terminated and eliminated if County refuses
          to approve the Subdivision Documents (as defined below) unless they are
          retained. Prior to February 1, 2002, SELLER, at its sole cost and expense, shall
          prepare, submit to County and diligently thereafter pursue approval of, a
          proposed commercial subdivision map and all such other petitions (including
          vacation petitions), applications, plans and other documents and filings
          (collectively, &#147;<B>Subdivision Applications</B>&#148;) as may be necessary
          to have a final commercial subdivision map, orders of vacation and any other
          required documents (including all plans for improvements required as a condition
          to the approval, filing and recording of a final commercial subdivision map
          [&#147;<B>Subdivision Improvement Plans</B>&#148;]) (collectively,
          &#147;<B>Subdivision Documents</B>&#148;) approved by County and, if applicable,
          filed and recorded, resulting in the Contract Parcel, the Fee Land and, if
          timely acquired by BUYER prior to submission of the Subdivision Applications to
          the County, the BLM Parcel, being so combined. The Subdivision Applications
          contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence need not be initially based
          on a specific development site plan for the subject land, but instead may
          initially provide for a standard or generic map, the purpose of which is to
          combine such parcels into a single legal parcel, taking into consideration the
          zoning for the Property and all required conditions of County approval of zoning
          application ZC-0667-01. BUYER may from time to time provide SELLER with
          tentative site development information for BUYER&#146;S specific desired use of
          the subject land, and may from time to time require reasonable modifications to
          the Subdivision Applications and/or Subdivision Documents. SELLER shall use its
          commercially reasonable best efforts, taking into consideration any delays
          caused by changes, requirements, disapprovals, acts or omissions of BUYER,
          including delays resulting from changes requested by BUYER to the Subdivision
          Applications and/or Subdivision Documents and delays resulting from information
          or requirements related to BUYER information referenced in the preceding
          sentence, to have final, County-approved Subdivision Documents approved, filed
          and recorded on or before December 31, 2002. SELLER&#146;s actions in that
          regard shall include preparation of, and pursuing approval by County of, all
          Subdivision Improvement Plans. BUYER agrees to reasonably cooperate with SELLER
          in a timely manner with respect to the activities and matters contemplated in
          this Paragraph and sign such maps and plats and execute such deeds and other
          instruments as may be necessary to effect the filing and recording of the
          Subdivision Documents; provided, however, that any and all conditions imposed by
          County on the filing and recording thereof, including, but not limited to,
          required boundary dedications, easements, covenants, conditions and
          restrictions, shall be subject to the approval of BUYER, in its discretion, and
          SELLER shall at all times keep BUYER informed of and in communication with
          County personnel relative to all such conditions. SELLER shall not be obligated
          to acquire any real property that SELLER does not own on the date of this
          Agreement or to pay the cost of acquiring any real property that SELLER does not
          own on the date of this Agreement to fulfill or satisfy any such condition. If
          SELLER fails (taking into account delays as referenced above) to (i) timely
          submit the Subdivision Applications to the County, (ii) diligently pursue
          approval of the Subdivision Applications as contemplated in this Paragraph or
          (iii) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have all necessary
          Subdivision Documents filed and recorded on or before December 31, 2002, in each
          such event, time being of the essence, BUYER may at any time thereafter give
          notice to SELLER of such failure and demand that such failure be cured with
          twenty (20) days of SELLER&#146;S receipt of that notice. If such failure is not
          cured within that 20 days, or if such failure is not capable of being cured in
          that 20-day period and SELLER does not within that period commence such cure and
          thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion, or if such failure is
          timely cured but is subsequently repeated at any time following SELLER&#146;S
          receipt of that notice, BUYER may at any time thereafter, by notice to SELLER
          (&#147;<B>Subdivision Notice</B>&#148;) elect to relieve SELLER of the
          obligation to further process the Subdivision Applications and Subdivision
          Documents and itself proceed to have the Subdivision Documents filed and

          &#147;B&#148; attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein. At
          Close of Escrow, SELLER shall deposit with the ESCROW AGENT for delivery to
          BUYER at Close of Escrow, a performance and completion bond in the sum of THREE
          MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($3,500,000) <B>(&#147;Performance
          Bond</B>&#148;) in form attached hereto as Exhibit &#147;D&#148; or in another

          timely and faithful performance and completion of Seller&#146;s Work by SELLER
          following Close of Escrow as required in this Agreement. The Performance Bond
          shall be written by a surety (&#147;<B>Surety</B>&#148;) which is a member of
          the Gulf Insurance Group, or another surety which is listed in A.M. Best&#146;s
          rating guide with a rating of at least &#147;A&#148;VIII, has a certificate of
          authority issued by the Nevada Division of Insurance and is approved by the
          United States Department of Treasury as reflected in Department Circular 570. If
          SELLER is required to post an off-site improvement bond or bonds or other
          improvement bond or bonds (an &#147;<B>Improvement Bond</B>&#148;) with County
          or a utility-providing agency or company for all or substantially all of
          Seller&#146;s Work described in one or more of the numbered items listed in
          Exhibit &#147;B&#148;, then upon the posting of such Improvement Bond with
          County, the company or agency, SELLER may thereafter reduce the amount of the
          Performance Bond by the dollar amount noted in Exhibit &#147;B&#148; to be paid
          by BUYER to SELLER for the item or items (which payment obligations are more
          fully described in Paragraph 15). BUYER shall take such actions as may be
          reasonably requested to allow the reduction of the amount of the Performance
          Bond in accordance with the foregoing provisions, which actions shall include
          but shall not necessarily be limited to, the providing of such consents,
          requests and approvals of BUYER as may be reasonably requested by SELLER or the
          Surety and the exchange of the original Performance Bond with the Surety for a
          revised Performance Bond in an appropriately reduced amount. When all
          Seller&#146;s Work in all categories on Exhibit &#147;B&#148; is either covered
          by an Improvement Bond or has been Accepted (as defined below), and provided
          BUYER is not then pursuing a claim under or against the Performance Bond, BUYER
          shall take all action reasonably requested by SELLER or the Surety for the
          release, termination and return of any remaining Performance Bond then held by
          BUYER, including without limitation the return of the original of any such
          Performance Bond to the Surety. Any modifications to Seller&#146;s Work shall be
          in writing signed by both SELLER and BUYER; provided that SELLER may without the
          consent of BUYER, and at SELLER&#146;S sole expense, make minor field
          modifications to Seller&#146;s Work reasonably required by SELLER, so long as
          such modifications do not modify the size, location or capacity of the
          improvement and do not materially adversely affect the Property, the nature,
          value or specifications of Seller&#146;s Work or BUYER&#146;S intended
          development or use of the Property. If any other modifications are requested by
          SELLER, BUYER shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent provided that
          such modifications (i) do not delay or hinder the construction of Seller&#146;s
          Work, (ii) do not adversely impact any intended use or development of the
          Property by BUYER, (iii) do not modify the size, location or capacity of the
          improvements and (iv) do not materially modify the nature, value or

          BUYER, SELLER shall not unreasonably withhold its consent provided that such
          modifications (i) do not increase the estimated costs of Seller&#146;s Work (or,
          at the option of either BUYER or SELLER, if BUYER pays or agrees to timely pay
          any excess costs), (ii) do not delay or hinder the construction of Seller&#146;s
          Work or any other work being conducted by SELLER on adjacent properties owned by
          SELLER, and (iii) do not adversely impact any intended development of any

          all construction and building permits for completion of all phases of each item
          of Seller&#146;s Work and shall post all required bonds for all phases of each
          item of Seller&#146;s Work, all within sixty (60) days following release by the

          contracts shall require the contractors to name BUYER (or BUYER&#146;S permitted
          nominee or assignee) as an additional insured on the contractors&#146;
          construction liability policies. Subject to the following provisions of this
          Paragraph, the Seller&#146;s Work shall be completed by SELLER with (i) the
          County having Accepted (as defined below) all off-site improvements and surface
          water drainage facilities and (ii) all utility companies and agencies (including

          Power Company) having either fully constructed and installed or Accepted the
          utility lines and laterals to be furnished pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit
          &#147;B&#148; prior to the date that is ten (10) months following the date of
          recordation of the Subdivision Documents, except as such work may be delayed or
          hindered by any changes, acts or omissions of BUYER or by any &#147;force
          majeure&#148; event. As used herein, a &#147;force majeure&#148; event shall

          or military or naval authority; or (vi) any other cause (excluding financial
          inability) not within the reasonable control of SELLER. SELLER and its
          contractors, subcontractors and agents shall have the right to enter upon the
          Property at any time and from time to time following the Close of Escrow as
          reasonably required to complete Seller&#146;s Work. Promptly upon SELLER&#146;S
          request, BUYER shall provide SELLER with any information or documentation, and
          shall execute any instruments or other documents, reasonably required by SELLER
          to complete Seller&#146;s Work. As utilized in this Agreement, the term
          &#147;<B>Accepted</B>&#148; or &#147;<B>Acceptance</B>&#148; of improvements,
          facilities, utility lines and laterals by the County or a utility company or
          agency means (i) that the County, company or agency (as applicable) has provided
          written acceptance of the improvement, facility or utility line and laterals and
          (ii) that all replacements, modifications, corrections, completions, additions
          and repairs required as a condition to that acceptance by the County, company or
          agency to be made to the constructed improvement, facility or utility line and
          laterals (or any other public improvements or utility improvements damaged
          during the course of construction) have been in all respects made and completed.
          BUYER shall at its cost repair and restore all damage to Seller&#146;s Work
          caused by BUYER, its contractors or other representatives. In the event of
          BUYER&#146;S delivery of a Subdivision Notice to SELLER, so long as, but only so

          circumstances, and so long as SELLER after receipt of the Subdivision Notice
          timely performs SELLER&#146;S obligations in (a) and (d) in Paragraph 12, BUYER
          (and not SELLER) shall thereafter be responsible for completion of the

          the Subdivision Documents, including without limitation, the obtaining of all

Agreement with respect to the commencement, prosecution, completion and Acceptance of
Seller&#146;s Work, including all items noted as Seller&#146;s Work in this Agreement and
all obligations of SELLER noted in Exhibit &#147;B&#148;, are herein collectively referred
to as the &#147;<B>Seller&#146;s Work Obligations</B>&#148;. In the event of any failure
or refusal of SELLER to timely perform one or more of Seller&#146;s Work Obligations,
BUYER shall notify SELLER, GREENPARK and the Surety in writing, and those parties shall
have thirty (30) days from receipt of such written notice to cure such default or, if such
default is not capable of cure in such 30-day period, to commence such cure and thereafter
prosecute the same to completion. If SELLER, GREENPARK or the Surety does not cure such
breach in such manner, a &#147;<B>Seller&#146;s Work Default</B>&#148; shall be deemed to
have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Seller&#146;s Work Default, BUYER, subject to the
Damage Limit (as defined below), shall thereafter have the right to pursue any remedy
available to BUYER at law or in equity with respect to such Seller&#146;s Work Default,
including without limitation a suit for specific performance, an action for monetary
damages, a claim or suit against the Surety and/or the right to undertake and complete
Seller&#146;s Work. Any action by BUYER to undertake and complete Seller&#146;s Work shall
be with the consent or approval of, and in cooperation with, the Surety unless the Surety
denies responsibility under the Performance Bond or fails to timely respond to demands or
requests made by BUYER with respect to the Performance Bond. In the event BUYER undertakes
to complete the Seller&#146;s Work, BUYER shall have the right to offset &#147;Unrecovered
Buyer Costs&#148; (as defined below) incurred by BUYER in connection therewith against any
amounts payable by BUYER to SELLER pursuant to Paragraph 15 below. As used herein, the

by BUYER in completing Seller&#146;s Work, minus all amounts paid or reimbursed to BUYER
for those costs by SELLER, the Surety or GREENPARK. Notwithstanding any provision of
Paragraphs 16 or 24 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in all
events (i) any monetary damages recoverable by BUYER shall not include, and SELLER shall
not be liable for, losses incurred, or profits lost relative to, the operation of a hotel
casino or other business on the Property, and (ii) the aggregate of all monetary damages
recoverable by BUYER for Seller&#146;s Work Defaults shall in no event exceed the

          property which SELLER or any such affiliate may now or hereafter own in the
          North Half (N 1/2) of the North Half (N 1/2) of the Westerly Property prior to
          (i) the cancellation of the transaction and Escrow contemplated in this
          Agreement or (ii) the expiration of two (2) years following Close of Escrow,
          whichever is first to occur, and if SELLER or the affiliate receives a bona fide
          written offer to purchase all or a portion of that real property on terms and
          conditions that SELLER or the affiliate is willing to accept, then SELLER shall
          cause the terms and conditions of that offer to be incorporated into a proposed
          written agreement between SELLER or the affiliate and BUYER, the provisions of
          which shall parallel and incorporate the provisions of this Agreement to the
          extent that they may be appropriately made to apply. A copy of the written offer
          originally received shall be attached as an exhibit to the written agreement.
          SELLER or the affiliate shall then execute the written agreement and deliver it
          to BUYER, offering to enter into the written agreement with BUYER. If the
          original written offer is based in part upon consideration to be paid other than
          cash or cash equivalent, BUYER shall have the right to pay cash equal to the
          fair market value of such consideration in lieu thereof, and the written
          agreement forwarded by SELLER shall so specify. BUYER, at its option, shall have
          ten (10) business days following receipt of the written agreement from SELLER
          within which to execute that agreement and return the fully executed agreement
          to SELLER. Unless the option is exercised by BUYER by the execution and return
          to SELLER of the agreement within those 10 business days, SELLER or the
          affiliate shall be free to accept the original offer with the offering party and
          shall be free to enter into the same agreement with that party. BUYER shall have
          the right to assign its rights hereunder from time to time to such assignees or
          nominees as BUYER, in its discretion, may designate. </FONT></P>

          SELLER warrants to BUYER that SELLER is not a &#147;foreign person&#148; as that
          term is defined in Section 1445 of the U. S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
          amended. SELLER shall deposit into Escrow, at or prior to Close of Escrow, an
          affidavit in such form and setting forth such information as may be required by
          the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (which information shall include
          SELLER&#146;S full name, address and taxpayer identification number) stating
          under penalty of perjury that SELLER is not a &#147;foreign person&#148; as so
          defined. </FONT></P>

          If Close of Escrow fails to timely occur without an extension that is expressly
          permitted in this Agreement because one or more conditions to a party&#146;s
          obligation to close Escrow (other than conditions consisting of one or more
          breaches of the other party&#146;s obligations or warranties under this
          Agreement) have not been fulfilled, tendered or waived, or if the transaction
          that is the subject of this Agreement is terminated pursuant to an express
          provision in this Agreement requiring or permitting such termination, then (i)
          the transaction that is the subject of this Agreement, the Escrow and the
          further rights and obligations of the parties (save and except for those rights
          and obligations specifically noted in Paragraph 35 as surviving termination)
          shall terminate; (ii) BUYER and SELLER shall equally bear all costs, fees and
          expenses incurred with and through the ESCROW AGENT; and (iii) the ESCROW AGENT
          shall return to the depositing party, all documents and monies. SELLER shall
          promptly perform all acts and provide all written consents and agreements
          requested by the ESCROW AGENT and/or BUYER to permit expeditious disbursement to
          BUYER of the Deposit and all other sums that have been deposited into Escrow by
          BUYER. </FONT></P>

          Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding Paragraph to the contrary,
          if (i) all conditions to BUYER&#146;S obligations to close Escrow set forth in
          Paragraph 10 have been fulfilled or waived, (ii) the time for Close of Escrow
          has expired without expressly permitted or agreed extension and (iii) BUYER has
          failed to timely close Escrow, then the transaction that is the subject of this
          Agreement and the Escrow shall terminate. In such event, BUYER shall bear all
          fees, costs and expenses incurred with and through the ESCROW AGENT, and the
          ESCROW AGENT shall return to the depositing party, all documents that have been
          placed in Escrow. In such case, SELLER, as its sole and exclusive remedy against
          BUYER, both at law and in equity, shall be entitled to obtain and retain the
          Deposit as liquidated damages in full and complete settlement and payment of all
          of SELLER&#146;S claims, causes of action and rights against BUYER for costs,
          expenses and damages (including consequential damages) resulting from the
          breach, default or failure of BUYER to purchase the Property and effect Close of
          Escrow under this Agreement, including all claims, causes of action and rights
          which are known or unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, all other rights,
          remedies and recourse therefor against BUYER being hereby expressly waived by
          SELLER. The parties agree that the exact amount of costs, expenses and damages
          incurred and suffered by SELLER would be difficult to determine and that the
          amount of the Deposit is a reasonable estimate of that amount. Notwithstanding
          anything in the immediately preceding Paragraph or elsewhere in this Agreement
          to the contrary, if Close of Escrow fails to timely occur after the failure of
          SELLER to fulfill an obligation of SELLER under this Agreement, after the
          failure of a condition resulting from the breach of an obligation or warranty of
          SELLER under this Agreement, or upon the breach of any warranty of SELLER under
          this Agreement, then, in any of such events, BUYER shall have available all
          remedies at law or in equity. </FONT></P>

          The ESCROW AGENT is hereby authorized by each of the parties to disburse funds

          with the terms of this Agreement. If this Agreement or any other matter related
          to the transaction that is the subject of this Agreement becomes the subject of
          any litigation or controversy, BUYER and SELLER agree to jointly and severally
          hold the ESCROW AGENT free and harmless from resulting associated loss or
          expense, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, that may be suffered by the
          ESCROW AGENT unless the loss or expense results from an act or omission of the
          ESCROW AGENT. If either BUYER or SELLER gives written claim or notice to the
          ESCROW AGENT that the transaction that is the subject of this Agreement and the
          Escrow have terminated, the ESCROW AGENT shall (i) provide the other party
          (BUYER or SELLER) with a copy of that claim or notice and (ii) give further
          notice to that party that the ESCROW AGENT shall consider the transaction and
          Escrow terminated and shall perform as provided in this Agreement unless that
          party gives the ESCROW AGENT a conflicting notice or claim within five (5)
          business days of the date the ESCROW AGENT&#146;S notice is given to that party;
          provided, however, that if this Agreement directs the ESCROW AGENT to follow a
          particular course of conduct in such instance, the ESCROW AGENT may, at its
          option, perform as directed by this Agreement without the necessity of
          communicating with the other party or providing the other party with a copy of
          the claim or notice. If the ESCROW AGENT elects to provide or is required to
          provide the other party with a copy of the claim or notice, then unless
          conflicting notice or claim is given to the ESCROW AGENT by that party within
          those 5 business days, the ESCROW AGENT may thereupon and shall thereupon
          perform as provided in this Agreement, and particularly as provided in the
          applicable Paragraph 27 or 28. If conflicting demands, claims or notices are
          given to the ESCROW AGENT with respect to this Agreement, the ESCROW AGENT shall
          be entitled to refrain from any further action until it shall have received
          further instructions executed by BUYER and SELLER or, in the alternative, the
          ESCROW AGENT shall be entitled to file a suit in interpleader following twenty
          (20) days&#146; notice to BUYER and SELLER of its intent to do so. Upon filing
          of any action in interpleader and the deposit of all documents and funds in its
          possession with the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada or
          such other depository as may be agreed upon by the parties, the ESCROW AGENT
          shall be fully released and discharged from any further obligation imposed upon
          it by this Agreement. The ESCROW AGENT shall not be liable in its capacity as
          such for any deficiency or correctness as to format or execution or validity of
          any instruments deposited with it, nor as to the identity, authority or rights
          of any person executing them, nor for the failure by any person other than the
          ESCROW AGENT to comply with any of the provisions of any agreement, contract or
          any other instrument deposited with the ESCROW AGENT or referred to in this
          Agreement. The ESCROW AGENT&#146;S duties hereunder shall be limited to the
          safekeeping of all monies, instruments and other documents received by it as the
          ESCROW AGENT and for disposition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
          or as the ESCROW AGENT may be further instructed. </FONT></P>

          otherwise encourage any other party to so bid. Further, SELLER agrees to
          cooperate with BUYER on a confidential basis with respect to the acquisition by
          BUYER of any such parcel and render such assistance to BUYER in that regard as
          may be reasonably requested by BUYER, but at no material cost to SELLER. </FONT></P>

          Following Close of Escrow, BUYER and SELLER agree to reasonably cooperate with
          each other to provide such reasonable temporary construction easements from time
          to time on and along the boundaries of the Property and the boundaries of any
          property of SELLER in the immediate vicinity of the Property to permit BUYER and
          SELLER to construct and install off-site improvements relating to the
          development of the Property and the development of the property of SELLER in the
          immediate vicinity of the Property. </FONT></P>

          Time is of the essence with respect to each performance required of BUYER and
          SELLER hereunder, notwithstanding any other and additional references which may
          be made in this Agreement to time being of the essence (which other and
