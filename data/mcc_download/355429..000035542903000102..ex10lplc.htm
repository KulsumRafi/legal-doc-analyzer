cause whatsoever (including,  without limitation,  fire, casualty or act of God or enemy or any other force majeure

modify or to avoid  strict  compliance  with its  obligations  under this Lease.  All  payments  made to the Lessor
hereunder  as required  hereby  shall be final and  irrevocable,  and the Lessee shall not seek to recover any such
payment or any part thereof for any reason whatsoever, absent manifest error.</FONT></P>

amounts to be paid by the Lessee  hereunder to the Lessor shall be made without  deduction  for, and free from, any
taxes, imposts,  levies,  duties,  deductions or withholdings of any nature now or at any time hereafter imposed by
any Governmental  Authority or by any taxing authority thereof or therein imposed or levied upon,  assessed against

Participant  and the  jurisdiction  imposing  such tax (all  such  non-excluded  taxes,  imposts,  levies,  duties,
deductions or  withholdings  of any nature being  "Taxes").  In the event that the Lessee is required by applicable

necessary in order that the amount received by the Lessor or such Lease  Participant  after the required  deduction
or  withholding  shall  equal the  amount  the Lessor or such Lease  Participant  would have  received  had no such
deduction  or  withholding  been  made.  In  addition,  the  Lessee  agrees  that it will  promptly  pay all  other
Impositions  imposed upon or levied or assessed against the Facility or any part thereof,  or against the Lessor or
any Lease  Participant  in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this Lease and the other  Operative
Documents,  or any sums levied in connection with the execution,  delivery or recording of the Operative Documents,

that are excluded from the definition of Taxes;  or (ii) any Impositions  attributable  to the gross  negligence or
willful misconduct of the Lessor or any Lease  Participant.  The Lessee further agrees that, subject to its contest
rights under  Section 13, it will,  at its expense,  do all things  required to be done by the Lessor in connection
with the levy,  assessment,  billing or payment of any  Impositions  that it is  required  to pay  pursuant  to the

in any and all such  respects and to prepare and file,  on behalf of the Lessor or any Lease  Participant,  all tax
returns and reports  required to be filed by the Lessor or any Lease  Participant  (other than  federal  income tax
returns and  documents  related  thereto,  subject to Section 25)  concerning  the Facility.  The Lessee's  payment
obligations  under  this  Section  3(f)  shall  survive  the  termination  of this  Lease.  In the  event  that any
withholding  or  deduction  from any  payment  to be made by the Lessee  hereunder  is  required  in respect of any
Imposition pursuant to any Governmental Requirement, then the Lessee will:</FONT></P>

         amounts as is  necessary  to ensure  that the net  amount  actually  received  by the Lessor or such Lease
         Participant  will equal the full amount the Lessor or such Lease  Participant  would have  received had no
         such withholding or deduction been required.</FONT></P>

day which is not a Business Day,  except as otherwise  expressly  provided  herein or in the Investment  Agreement,
such payment shall be made on the next  succeeding  Business Day and such extension  shall be included in computing
Rent, interest, yield and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.</FONT></P>

executed by the Lessee in  connection  with the  subletting  of the  Facility (i) shall  expressly  state that such
sublease is subject and  subordinate  to the terms of this Lease and the Liens created by the Security  Instruments
and (ii) shall not provide for a sublease  term ending after the then current  Scheduled  Lease  Termination  Date.
The Lessee will furnish  promptly to the Lessor copies of all subleases and related  documentation  entered into by
the  Lessee  from time to time.  No  sublease  permitted  by the  terms  hereof  will  reduce  in any  respect  the
obligations  of the Lessee  hereunder,  it being the  intent of the  Lessee  and the Lessor  that the Lessee be and
remain  directly and primarily  liable as a principal for its  obligations  hereunder.  Any sublease made otherwise
than as expressly permitted by this Section 21(c) shall be null and void and of no force or effect.</FONT></P>

     future  advances were made on the date of the  execution of this  Mortgage,  although  there may be no advance
     made on the date of the execution of this  Mortgage,  and although  there may be no  indebtedness  outstanding
     under the Loan or under any other  indebtedness  of Lessee to Lessor at the time this  Mortgage is executed or
     at the time any  advance  is made  under the Loan or under any other  indebtedness  of Lessee to  Lessor.  The
     parties hereby  acknowledge and intend that all advances under the Loan,  including  future advances  whenever
     hereafter  made,  shall be secured by this Mortgage and, to the extent  allowed by law, have priority from the
     time this Mortgage is recorded; and</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of this Lease shall be deemed to  constitute  the filing of a mortgage  and the filing
of any financing  statement in connection  with this Lease shall be deemed to constitute  the filing of a financing
statement to perfect the  mortgage  lien and  security  interests  in the  Facility as aforesaid  and to secure the
payment of the Secured Amount.  If this  transaction is treated as a financing,  the obligation  arising  hereunder
shall be with full  recourse  to the  Lessee  and shall not be treated as  recourse  only to the  Facility.  To the
fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  law, the Lessor and the Lessee  intend that the Facility  (other than the
real  property  constituting  the Site) be and remain at all times  personal  property  regardless of the manner or
extent to which any of the  Facility  (other  than the real  property  constituting  the Site) may be  attached  or
affixed to any real property.  Except as required by applicable  law, the Lessee shall not under any  circumstances
take any action or make any filing or  recording  which would  cause the  Facility  (other  than the real  property
constituting  the  Site) to be deemed to be real  property  or permit  any  Person to obtain  any  interest  in the
Facility  (other than the real  property  constituting  the Site) as a result of the Facility  (other than the real
property constituting the Site) being deemed to be in whole or in part real property.</FONT></P>

hereinafter referred to as <u>"Collateral"</u>):</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      <u>Change in  Location of  Collateral  or the  Lessee. </u> The Lessee (i) will  notify the  Secured  Party on or
before the date of any change in (A) the location of the Collateral  (B) the location of Lessee's  chief  executive
office or address,  (C) the name of the Lessee and (D) the corporate  structure of the Lessee, and (ii) will, on or
before the date of any such change,  prepare and file new or amended financing  statements as necessary so that the
Secured Party shall  continue to have a first and prior  perfected  Lien  (subject only to Permitted  Liens) in the
Collateral after any such change.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)      <u>Intentionally Omitted.</u></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)      <u>Sale,  Disposition or Encumbrance of Collateral.</u>  Except as set forth herein and for Permitted  Liens,  as
permitted by any of the Operative  Documents or with the Secured  Party's prior  written  consent,  the Lessee will
not in any way encumber any of the  Collateral  (or permit or suffer any of the  Collateral  to be  encumbered)  or
sell,  assign,  lend, rent,  lease or otherwise  dispose of or transfer any of the Collateral to or in favor of any
Person other than the Secured Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)      <u>Proceeds of  Collateral.</u>  Except as permitted by any of the Operative  Documents,  the Lessee will deliver
to the Secured Party  promptly upon receipt all proceeds  delivered to the Lessee from the sale or  disposition  of
any Collateral.  This Section shall not be construed to permit sales or  dispositions  of the Collateral  except as
may be elsewhere expressly permitted by this Lease or the other Operative Documents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)     <u>Further  Assurances.</u>  Upon the request of the Secured Party,  Lessee shall (at Lessee's  expense)  execute
and deliver  all such  mortgages,  deeds of trust,  deeds to secure  debts,  assignments,  certificates,  financing
statements  or other  documents and give further  assurances  and do all other acts and things as the Secured Party
may  reasonably  request to perfect  the  Secured  Party's  interest in the  Collateral  or to protect,  enforce or
otherwise effect the Secured Party's rights and remedies hereunder,  all in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Secured Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)      <u>Collateral  Attached  to Other  Property.</u>  In the event that any of the  Collateral  is  removed  from the
Facility  and is to be  attached  or affixed  to any real  property,  the Lessee  hereby  agrees  that a  financing
statement  which is a fixture  filing  may be filed for  record in any  appropriate  real  estate  records.  If the
Lessee is not the record  owner of such real  property,  it will  provide  the  Secured  Party with any  additional

Documents in a timely manner, then this Mortgage shall be cancelled and surrendered.</FONT></P>

Secured Party.  All payments under the Lease shall be made only to such account as specified by the Secured Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)      <u>Receiver  and  Mortgage  Remedies. </u> If an Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and be  continuing,  the

                    forthwith  surrender to the Lessor,  the actual possession of the Collateral and if, and to the
                    extent,  permitted by applicable  law and the Operative  Documents,  the Lessor  itself,  or by
                    such  officers  or  agents  as it may  appoint,  may  enter  and  take  possession  of all  the
                    Collateral without the appointment of a receiver, or an application  therefor,  and may exclude
                    the Lessee and its agents and employees  wholly  therefrom,  and may have joint access with the
                    Lessee to the books,  papers and accounts of the Lessee  pertaining to the  Collateral.  If the
                    Lessee  shall for any reason fail to surrender  or deliver the  Collateral  or any part thereof
                    after such demand by the Lessor,  the Lessor may obtain a judgment  or decree  conferring  upon
                    the Lessor the right to  immediate  possession  or  requiring  the Lessee to deliver  immediate
                    possession  of the  Collateral  to the  Lessor,  to the entry of which  judgment  or decree the
                    Lessee hereby  specifically  consents.  Upon every such entering upon or taking of  possession,
                    the Lessor may hold,  store,  use,  operate,  manage and control the Collateral and conduct the
                    business  thereof,  and,  from  time to time (i) make all  necessary  and  proper  maintenance,
                    repairs, renewals,  replacements,  additions,  betterments and improvements thereto and thereon
                    and purchase or otherwise  acquire  additional  fixtures,  personalty and other property;  (ii)
                    insure or keep the  Collateral  insured;  (iii) manage and operate the  Collateral and exercise
                    all the  rights and  powers of the  Lessee to the same  extent as the  Lessee  could in its own
                    name or otherwise  with respect to the same;  and (iv) enter into any and all  agreements  with
                    respect to the exercise by others of any of the powers  herein  granted the Lessor,  all as the
                    Lessor from time to time may determine to be in its best  interest.  The Lessor may collect and
                    receive all the rents, issues,  profits and revenues from the Collateral,  including those past
                    due as well as those accruing  thereafter,  and,  after  deducting (aa) all expenses of taking,
                    holding,  managing and operating the  Collateral  (including  compensation  for the services of
                    all  persons  employed  for such  purposes);  (bb) the cost of all such  maintenance,  repairs,
                    renewals,  replacements,  additions,  betterments,  improvements,  purchases and  acquisitions;
                    (cc) the cost of such  insurance;  (dd) such taxes,  assessments  and other similar  charges as
                    the Lessor may at its option pay;  (ee) other proper  charges upon the  Collateral  or any part
                    thereof;  and (ff) the reasonable  compensation,  expenses and  disbursements  of the attorneys
                    and agents of the Lessor,  the Lessor  shall apply the  remainder of the monies and proceeds so
                    received by the Lessor in  accordance  with the terms of this Lease.  Anything in this  Section
                    26 to the contrary  notwithstanding,  the Lessor shall not be obligated to discharge or perform
                    the duties of a landlord to any tenant or incur any  liability  as a result of the  exercise by
                    the Lessor of its rights  under this  Mortgage,  and the Lessor shall be liable to account only
                    for  the  rents,  income,  issues,  profits  and  revenues  actually  received  by the  Lessor.
                    Whenever all that is due upon such  interest,  deposits and  principal  installments  and under
                    any of the terms, covenants,  conditions and agreements of this Mortgage,  shall have been paid
                    and all Events of Default made good,  the Lessor shall  surrender  possession of the Collateral
                    to the Lessee, its successors or assigns. The same right of taking possession,  however,  shall
                    exist if any  subsequent  Event of Default shall occur and be  continuing.  In connection  with
                    any action  taken by the Lessor  pursuant to this  Section  26, the Lessor  shall not be liable
                    for any loss  sustained  by the  Lessee  resulting  from any act or  omission  of the Lessor in
                    administering,  managing,  operating or controlling  the  Collateral,  including a loss arising
                    from the  ordinary  negligence  of the  Lessor,  unless  such  loss is  caused by its own gross
                    negligence,  willful  misconduct or bad faith, or the gross negligence,  willful  misconduct or
                    bad faith of its officers,  directors,  employees, agents or contractors,  nor shall the Lessor
                    be obligated  to perform or  discharge  any  obligation,  duty or liability of the Lessee.  The
                    Lessee  hereby  assents  to,  ratifies  and  confirms  any and all  actions of the Lessor  with
                    respect to the Collateral taken under this Section 26.</FONT></P>
