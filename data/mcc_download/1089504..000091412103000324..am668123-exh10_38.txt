                               SECURITY AGREEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAREHOUSING CREDIT, TERM LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of May 3, 2001,
between COLUMBIA NATIONAL, INCORPORATED, a Maryland corporation ("Borrower"),
RESIDENTIAL FUNDING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("RFC"), U.S. BANK
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("U.S. Bank"), ALLFIRST BANK, a Maryland state chartered
commercial bank ("Allfirst Bank"), FLEET NATIONAL BANK ("Fleet"), NATIONAL CITY
BANK OF KENTUCKY ("National City"), CREDIT LYONNAIS NEW YORK BRANCH ("Credit
Lyonnais"), COMERICA BANK ("Comerica"), GUARANTY BANK, F.S.B., a federal savings
bank ("Guaranty") and COLONIAL BANK, an Alabama banking corporation ("Colonial")
(RFC, U.S. Bank, Allfirst Bank, Fleet, National City, Credit Lyonnais, Comerica,
Guaranty, Colonial, and any Additional Lender as may from time to time become a
party hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns being
referred to individually as a "Lender" and collectively as the "Lenders"), and
RFC as credit agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Credit Agent"), and
U.S. Bank, as collateral agent for the Credit Agent and the Lenders ("Collateral
Agent").

      A.    Borrower has requested certain financing from Lenders.

      B.    Lenders have agreed to provide that financing to Borrower subject to
            the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

      C.    The "Closing Date" for the transactions contemplated by this
            Agreement is May 3, 2001.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

1.    THE CREDIT

1.1.  THE WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT

      Effective as of the date of this Agreement, Lenders shall make Warehousing
      Advances under this Agreement in an amount equal to all outstanding
      warehousing loans and working capital loans made under the Existing
      Agreements, and such Advances shall be applied by Credit Agent to repay
      such outstanding loans. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
      Agreement, Lenders agree, severally and not jointly, to make Warehousing
      Advances to Borrower from the Closing Date to the Business Day immediately
      preceding the Warehousing Maturity Date, pro rata in accordance with their
      respective Percentage Shares, during which period Borrower may borrow,
      repay and reborrow in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
      The total aggregate principal amount of all Warehousing Advances and
      Swingline Advances outstanding at any one time may not exceed the
      Warehousing Credit Limit. While a Default or Event of Default exists,
      Lenders may refuse to make any additional Warehousing Advances to
      Borrower. All Warehousing Advances under this Agreement constitute a
      single indebtedness, and all of the Collateral is security for the
      Warehousing Note and for the performance of all of the Obligations.


                                       1
<PAGE>

1.2.  EXPIRATION OF WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT

      The Warehousing Commitments expire on the earlier of ("Warehousing
      Maturity Date"): (a) May 2, 2002, as such date may be extended in writing
      by Lenders, in their sole discretion, on which date the Warehousing
      Commitment will expire of its own term and the Warehousing Advances will
      become due and payable, in each case without the necessity of Notice or
      action by Lenders, and (b) the date the Warehousing Commitment is
      terminated and the Warehousing Advances become due and payable under
      Section 11.2.

1.3.  SWINGLINE FACILITY

      On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, RFC may, from
      time to time to, but not including, the Warehousing Maturity Date, make
      Warehousing Advances requested by Borrower, in an aggregate not to exceed
      the Swingline Facility Amount, without requesting Warehousing Advances
      from the Other Lenders. Such Advances ("Swingline Advance") shall be
      evidenced by the Swingline Note. The Lenders hereby agree to purchase from
      RFC an undivided participation interest in all outstanding Swingline
      Advances held by RFC at any time in an amount equal to each Lender's
      Percentage Share of such Swingline Advances. RFC may at any time in its
      sole and absolute discretion (and shall no less frequently than weekly and
      upon the acceleration of the Obligations following an Event of Default)
      request the Lenders to make Advances in principal amounts equal to their
      Percentage Shares in the aggregate amount necessary to repay the
      outstanding Swingline Advances and each Lender absolutely and
      unconditionally agrees to fund such Warehousing Advances, regardless of
      any Default or Event of Default or other condition which would otherwise
      excuse such Lender from funding Warehousing Advances, provided that no
      Lender shall be required to make Advances to repay Swingline Advances
      which would cause such Lender's aggregate Warehousing Advances then
      outstanding to exceed the amount of such Lender's Warehousing Commitment
      Amount. Each Lender's Warehousing Advances made pursuant to the preceding
      sentence shall be delivered directly to RFC in immediately available funds
      at the office of the Credit Agent by 4:00 p.m. on the day of the request
      therefor by RFC if such request is made on or before 3:00 p.m., or by 9:00
      a.m. on the 1st Business Day following such request if such request is
      made after 3:00 p.m. and shall be promptly applied against the outstanding
      Swingline Advances. At the time of any request for Warehousing Advances
      from Lenders pursuant to this Section 1.3, the Credit Agent shall deliver
      to each Lender a certificate in the form of Exhibit M attached hereto (the
      "Advance Certificate"), certified by the Credit Agent. For purposes of the
      limitations set forth in Exhibit H and Exhibit I hereto, Swingline
      Advances shall be deemed to be Warehousing Advances.

1.4.  WAREHOUSING NOTES, SUBLIMIT NOTES AND SWINGLINE NOTE

      Warehousing Advances, other than Advances made against Other Eligible
      Assets, made by each Lender are evidenced by Borrower's promissory note,
      payable to such Lender, in the form prescribed by Credit Agent (each, a
      "Warehousing Note"). Warehousing Advances made against Other Eligible
      Assets by each Lender are evidenced by Borrower's promissory note, payable
      to such Lender, in the form prescribed by Credit Agent (each, a "Sublimit
      Note"). Swingline Advances made by RFC are evidenced by Borrower's
      promissory note, payable to RFC, in the form prescribed by the Credit
      Agent ("Swingline Note"). The terms "Warehousing Notes," "Sublimit Note"
      and "Swingline Note," as used in this Agreement, include all amendments,
      restatements, renewals or replacements of the original Warehousing Notes,
      Sublimit Notes or Swingline Note and all substitutions therefor. All terms
      and provisions of the Warehousing Notes, Sublimit Notes and Swingline Note
      are incorporated into this Agreement.

1.5.  THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENT

      Effective as of the date of this Agreement, Lenders shall make Term Loan
      Advances in an amount equal to all outstanding revolving/term loans made
      under the Existing Agreements, and such Advances shall be applied by
      Lender to repay such outstanding loans. On the terms and subject to the
      conditions of this Agreement, Lenders agree, severally and not jointly, to
      make Term Loan Advances to Borrower from the Closing Date to the Business
      Day immediately preceding the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, pro
      rata in accordance with their respective Percentage Shares, during which
      period Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow in accordance with the
      provisions of this Agreement. The total aggregate principal amount
      outstanding at any one time of all Term Loan Advances may not exceed the
      Term Loan Credit Limit. While a Default or Event of Default exists,
      Lenders may refuse to make any additional Term Loan Advances to Borrower.
      All Term Loan Advances under this Agreement shall constitute a single
      indebtedness, and all of the Collateral shall be security for the Term
      Loan Note and for the payment and performance of all the Obligations.

1.6.  EXPIRATION OF THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENTS.

      The Term Loan Commitments expire on the earlier of ("Term Loan Commitment
      Termination Date"): (a) May 2, 2002, as such date may be extended in
      writing by Lenders, in their sole discretion, on which date the Term Loan
      Commitments will expire of their own term, without the necessity of Notice
      or action by Lenders, and (b) the date the Term Loan Commitments are
      terminated and the Warehousing Advances become due and payable under
      Section 11.2.

1.7.  TERM LOAN NOTE

      Term Loan Advances made by each Lender are evidenced by Borrower's
      promissory note, payable to such Lender, in the form prescribed by the
      Credit Agent (each, a "Term Loan Note"). The term "Term Loan Note" as used
      in this Agreement includes all amendments, restatements, renewals or
      replacements of the original Term Loan Note and all substitutions for it.
      All terms and provisions of the Term Loan Note are incorporated into this
      Agreement.

1.8.  NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE CREDIT AGENT.

      If the Credit Agent receives notice from a Lender that such Lender does
      not intend to make its Percentage Share of any Advances, neither the
      Credit Agent nor any other Lender shall have any obligation to fund such
      Lender's Percentage Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless a Lender
      notifies the Credit Agent by 3:00 p.m. on the date of a proposed Advance
      that it does not intend to make its Percentage Share of such Advance
      available to the Credit Agent at such time and on such date, the Credit
      Agent may assume that such Lender will make such amount available to the
      Credit Agent to be advanced to the Borrower, and in reliance on such
      assumption, the Credit Agent may, at its option, make a corresponding
      amount available to the Borrower.

      1.8(a)  If the Credit Agent makes such corresponding amount available to
              the Borrower and such amount is not made available to the Credit
              Agent by such Lender by close of business on the date of the
              Warehousing Advance, such Lender shall pay such amount to the
              Credit Agent upon demand plus interest to the date of payment at a
              rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

      1.8(b)  If a Lender fails to pay as provided herein, the Borrower shall
              pay such amount to the Credit Agent upon demand plus interest (at
              the rate applicable to the Borrower for such Warehousing Advance)
              to the date of repayment.

      1.8(c)  Nothing in this Section 1.8 shall relieve any Lender from its
              obligation to fund its Percentage Share of any Advance, or
              prejudice any rights the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
              result of such Lender's failure to make its Percentage Share of
              any Advance

1.9.  REPLACEMENT NOTES.

      theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note, and, in the case of any such
      loss, theft, destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such Note,

3.    PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING ADVANCES

3.1.  WAREHOUSING ADVANCES

      3.1(a)  To obtain a Warehousing Advance against an Eligible Loan under
              this Agreement, Borrower must deliver to Collateral Agent, not
              later than 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day on which Borrower
              desires the Warehousing Advance against Eligible Loans, the
              documents provided for in the Collateral Agency Agreement
              ("Warehousing Advance Request").

      3.1(b)  Collateral Agent has a reasonable time to examine Borrower's
              Warehousing Advance Request and the Collateral Documents to be
              delivered by Borrower before funding the requested Warehousing
              Advance, and may reject any Eligible Loan that does not meet the
              requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
              Exhibits hereto), the Collateral Agency Agreement.

      3.1(c)  Borrower must hold or cause its custodian to hold, in trust for
              Credit Agent and Collateral Agent, those original Collateral
              Documents of which only copies are required to be delivered to
              Collateral Agent under the Collateral Agency Agreement. Unless a
              Pledged Loan is being held by an Investor for purchase or has been
              redeemed from pledge by Borrower, promptly upon request by
              Collateral Agent (or, if the recorded Collateral Documents have
              not yet been returned from the recording office, immediately upon
              receipt by Borrower or its custodian of those recorded Collateral
              Documents), Borrower must deliver or cause its custodian to
              deliver to Collateral Agent any or all of the original Collateral
              Documents.

      3.1(d)  If, for the purpose of funding the origination or acquisition of
              an Eligible Loan against which the Lenders have made Warehousing
              Advances or RFC has made Swingline Advances in accordance with
              this Agreement and the Collateral Agency Agreement, the Credit
              Agent debits the Borrower's Operating Account at the Funding Bank
              to the extent necessary to cover a wire to the Collateral Agent,
              and such debit results in an overdraft, the Swingline Lender may
              make an additional Swingline Advance to fund such overdraft.

      3.1(e)  Warehousing Advances against Eligible Loans will be funded in
              accordance with the Collateral Agency Agreement.

      3.1(f)  To obtain a Warehousing Advance against Other Eligible Assets

              than 8:30 a.m. on the Business Day on which Borrower desires to
              borrow such Warehousing Advances hereunder, an estimate of the
              amount of such Warehousing Advances, and no later than 9:30 a.m.
              on such Business Day, a completed and signed request for
              Warehousing Advances against Other Eligible Assets ("Working
              Capital Advance Request") on the then current form approved by the
              Credit Agent. The current form in use by the Credit Agent is
              Exhibit A-WC attached hereto. The Credit Agent shall have the
              right, on not less than 3 Business Days' prior Notice to Borrower,
              to modify Exhibit A-WC to conform to current legal requirements or
              lender practices and, as so modified, said Exhibit shall be deemed
              a part hereof.

      3.1(g)  To make Warehousing Advances against Other Eligible Assets
              hereunder, the Credit Agent shall disburse the amount thereof (i)
              in the case of Advances made on the Closing Date to refinance
              loans outstanding under the Existing Agreements, to the agent
              thereunder, and (ii) in all other cases, into the Operating
              Account.

              the then current form approved by the Credit Agent. The current
              form in use by the Credit Agent is Exhibit A-TL attached hereto.
              The Credit Agent shall have the right, on not less than 3 Business
              Days' prior Notice to Borrower, to modify Exhibit A-TL to conform
              to current legal requirements or lender practices and, as so
              modified, said Exhibit shall be deemed a part hereof.

      3.3(b)  To make Term Loan Advances hereunder, the Credit Agent shall
              disburse the amount thereof (i) in the case of Term Loan Advances
              made on the Closing Date to refinance loans outstanding under the
              Existing Agreements, to the agent thereunder, and (ii) in all

4.    INTEREST, PRINCIPAL AND FEES

4.1.  INTEREST

      4.1(a)  Except as provided in Sections 4.1(c), 4.1(e) and 4.1(f), Borrower
              must pay interest on the unpaid amount of each Warehousing Advance
              from the date the Warehousing Advance is made until it is paid in
              full at the Interest Rate specified in Exhibit H or Exhibit I, as
              applicable.

      4.1(b)  Except as provided in Sections 4.1(c), 4.1(e) and 4.1(f), Borrower
              must pay interest on the unpaid amount of the Term Loan Advance
              from the date the Term Loan Advance is made until it is paid in
              full at the Interest Rate specified on Exhibit I.

      4.1(c)  Borrower and any Lender may enter into an agreement (the "Balance
              Funded Agreement") pursuant to which Borrower agrees to maintain
              Deposit Balances on deposit with such Lender or a Designated Bank
              in consideration of the funding of all or a portion of such
              Lender's Advances at a Balance Funded Rate. Borrower may give
              written notice to any Lender with which it has a Balance Funded
              Agreement, as and when provided in such Balance Funded Agreement,
              of Borrower's election to have a portion (the "Balance Funded
              Portion") of the principal amount of the Lender's Advances bear
              interest at the Balance Funded Rate during any calendar month. In
              the event Borrower elects to have all or a portion of any Lender's
              Advances bear interest at the Balance Funded Rate during any
              month, such Lender shall notify the Credit Agent no later than
              12:00 Noon on the second Business Day of the following month of
              the estimated amount by which the interest to be paid by Borrower
              on such Lender's Advances during such month was reduced as a
              result of the application of such Balance Funded Agreement. If the
              Deposit Balances maintained by Borrower with such Lender or its
              Designated Bank during such month are less than the Balance Funded
              Portion, or if the estimate provided by Lender pursuant to the
              previous sentence is not accurate, the Lender may charge and
              separately bill Borrower a deficiency fee (a "Balance Deficiency
              Fee"), or credit Borrower with any amount by which interest billed
              exceeded interest actually due, the amount of which shall be set
              forth in the Balance Funded Agreement between Borrower and such
              Lender.

      4.1(d)  Credit Agent computes interest on the basis of the actual number
              of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Interest is payable monthly
              in arrears, on the first day of each month, commencing with the
              first month following the Closing Date and on the Maturity Date,
              as applicable.

      4.1(e)  If, for any reason, (1) Borrower repays a Warehousing Advance on
              the same day that it was made by Credit Agent or (2) Borrower
              instructs Collateral Agent not to make a previously requested
              Warehousing Advance after Credit Agent has reserved funds or made
              other arrangements necessary to enable Credit Agent to fund that
              Warehousing Advance, Borrower agrees to pay to Credit Agent, for
              its own account and the account of any Lenders who have provided
              funds to the Credit Agent, an administrative fee equal to 1 day of
              interest on that Warehousing Advance at the Interest Rate that
              would otherwise be applicable under Exhibit H or Exhibit I for the
              applicable Eligible Loan or Other Eligible Assets type.
              Administrative fees are due and payable in the same manner as
              interest is due and payable under this Agreement.

      4.1(f)  After an Event of Default occurs and upon Notice to Borrower by
              Credit Agent, the unpaid amount of each Advance will bear interest
              at the Default Rate until paid in full.


                                       9
<PAGE>

      4.1(g)  The rates of interest provided for in this Agreement will be
              adjusted as of the effective date of each change in the applicable
              index. Credit Agent's determination of such rates of interest as
              of any date of determination are conclusive and binding, absent
              manifest error.

4.2.  INTEREST LIMITATION

      Lenders do not intend, by reason of this Agreement, the Notes or any other
      Loan Document, to receive interest in an amount in excess of that
      permitted by applicable law. If Lenders receive any interest in excess of
      the amount permitted by applicable law, whether by reason of acceleration
      of the maturity of this Agreement, the Notes or otherwise, Lenders will
      apply the excess to the unpaid principal balance of the Advances and not
      to the payment of interest. If all Advances have been paid in full and the
      Commitments have expired or have been terminated, Lenders will remit any
      excess to Borrower. This Section controls every other provision of all
      agreements between Borrower and Lenders and is binding upon and available
      to any subsequent holder of the Notes.

4.3.  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS

      4.3(a)  Borrower must pay Lenders the outstanding principal amount of all
              Warehousing Advances on the Warehousing Maturity Date.

      4.3(b)  Borrower must pay Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the
              Term Loan Advances on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

      4.3(c)  Borrower may prepay any portion of the Warehousing Advances, Term
              Loan Advances and Swingline Advances without premium or penalty at
              any time.

      4.3(d)  Borrower must pay to Collateral Agent, for distribution to the
              Credit Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, without the necessity
              of prior demand or Notice from Credit Agent or Collateral Agent,
              and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to cause the Funding Bank to
              charge Borrower's Operating Account and the Collateral Agent to
              charge any account of Borrower (other than any trust or escrow
              account) with it, for the amount of any outstanding Warehousing
              Advances or Swingline Advance against a specific Pledged Asset
              upon the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:

              (1)   One (1) Business Day elapses from the date a Warehousing
                    Advance was made if the Pledged Loan that was to have been
                    funded by that Warehousing Advance is not closed and funded.

              (2)   Fifteen (15) calendar days elapse without the return of a
                    Collateral Document delivered by Collateral Agent to
                    Borrower under a Trust Receipt for correction or completion.

              (3)   On the date on which a Pledged Loan is determined to have
                    been originated based on untrue, incomplete or inaccurate
                    information or otherwise to be subject to fraud, whether or
                    not Borrower had knowledge of the misrepresentation,
                    incomplete or incorrect information or fraud, or on the date
                    on which Borrower knows, or has reason to know, or receives
                    Notice from Credit Agent, that one or more of the
                    representations and warranties set forth in Article 10 were
                    inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect on any date
                    when made or deemed made.

              (4)   On the date the Pledged Loan or a Lien prior to the Pledged
                    Loan is defaulted and remains in default for a period of 30
                    days or more.

              (5)   Upon the sale, other disposition or prepayment of any
                    Pledged Asset, the date that any Pledged Asset is collected
                    by Borrower, or, with respect to a Pledged Loan included in
                    an Eligible Mortgage Pool, upon the sale or other
                    disposition of the related Agency Security.

      4.3(e)  Upon telephonic or facsimile Notice to Borrower by Collateral
              Agent, Borrower must pay to Collateral Agent, for distribution to
              the Credit Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, and Borrower
              authorizes Credit Agent to cause the Funding Bank to charge
              Borrower's Operating Account and the Collateral Agent to charge
              any account of Borrower (other than any trust or escrow account)
              with it, for the amount of any outstanding Warehousing Advance
              against a specific Pledged Asset upon the earliest occurrence of
              any of the following events:

              (1)   For any Pledged Loan, the Warehouse Period elapses.

                    examination and purchase or for inclusion in a Mortgage
                    Pool, without the purchase being made or an Eligible
                    Mortgage Pool being initially certified, or upon rejection
                    of a Pledged Loan as unsatisfactory by an Investor or

              (3)   Nine (9) calendar days elapse from the date a Wet Settlement
                    Advance was made against a Pledged Loan without receipt by
                    Collateral Agent of all Required Documents relating to the
                    Pledged Loan, or the Required Documents, upon examination by
                    Collateral Agent, do not comply with the requirements of
                    this Agreement or the Collateral Agency Agreement.

              (4)   With respect to any Pledged Loan, any of the Collateral
                    Documents, upon examination by Collateral Agent (and at the
                    reasonable discretion of the Credit Agent and the Collateral
                    Agent), are found not to be in compliance with the
                    requirements of this Agreement.

      4.3(f)  In addition to the payments required pursuant to Sections 4.3(d)
              and 4.3(e), if the principal amount of any Pledged Loan or Other
              Eligible Assets is prepaid in whole or in part while Warehousing
              Advances or a Swingline Advance are outstanding against the
              Pledged Loan or Other Eligible Asset, Borrower must pay to Credit
              Agent, without the necessity or prior demand or Notice from Credit
              Agent or Collateral Agent, and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to
              cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for,
              the amount of the prepayment, to be applied against the
              Warehousing Advance or Swingline Advance.

      4.3(g)  The proceeds of the sale, other disposition or collection of
              Pledged Assets must be paid directly by the Investor or other
              Obligor to the Settlement Account. Borrower must give Notice to
              Collateral Agent (by telephone or electronic mail, and if by
              telephone, followed promptly by written notice) of the Pledged
              Assets for which proceeds have been received no later than 11:00
              a.m. on the date on which Borrower wants such proceeds applied to
              the Advances. Upon receipt of Borrower's Notice, Collateral Agent
              will disburse such proceeds to the Cash Collateral Account and
              notify the Credit Agent to apply such proceeds to the payment of
              the Advances related to the Pledged Assets identified by Borrower
              in its Notice, and those Pledged Assets will be considered to have
              been redeemed from pledge. Collateral Agent is entitled to rely
              upon Borrower's affirmation that deposits in the Settlement
              Account represent payments from Investors or obligors for the
              purchase or in payment of the Pledged Assets specified by Borrower
              in its Notice. If the payment from an Investor or obligor for the
              purchase or in payment of Pledged Assets is less than the
              outstanding Warehousing Advances against the Pledged Assets


                                       11
<PAGE>

              identified by Borrower in its Notice, Borrower authorizes Credit
              Agent to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating
              Account in an amount equal to that deficiency. As long as no
              Default or Event of Default exists, Credit Agent will return to
              Borrower any excess payment from an Investor or other Obligor for
              Pledged Assets unless the Majority Lenders instruct the Credit
              Agent otherwise. For purposes of this Section 4.3(g), payments
              made by check into the Settlement Account shall be deemed received
              when the check has cleared in accordance with the Collateral
              Agent's usual procedures.

      4.3(h)  If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all
              Term Loan Advances exceeds the Servicing Collateral Value,
              Borrower shall prepay the Term Loan Advances in the amount of such
              excess. If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal balance
              of all Term Loan Advances and Warehousing Advances made against
              Other Eligible Assets exceeds 90% of the most recent Appraisal
              Value of the Servicing Portfolio (adjusted to reflect additions to
              and deletions from the Eligible Servicing Portfolio since the date
              of the relevant Appraisal), Borrower shall prepay the following
              types of Advances, in order, in the amount of such excess:

              (1)   Warehousing Advances outstanding against Other Eligible
                    Assets, other than Repurchased Maturing Mortgage Loans;

              (2)   Term Loan Advances; and

              (3)   Warehousing Advances outstanding against Repurchased
                    Maturing Mortgage Loans.

      4.3(i)  Amounts received by the Credit Agent as proceeds of the sale or
              other disposition of or payments on Pledged Mortgages, Pledged
              Securities and Other Eligible Assets and applied to the principal
              amount of Warehousing Advances, including without limitation,
              amounts from time to time deposited in the Settlement Account,
              shall be allocated among the Lenders as follows:

              (1)   First, except in the case of proceeds of or payments on
                    Other Eligible Assets, to RFC until the principal amount of
                    the Swingline Advances have been paid in full; and

              (2)   Second, pro rata to the Lenders in accordance with their
                    respective Percentage Shares.

              Amounts applied to the Swingline Advances set forth above shall,
              unless the Warehousing Advances outstanding against such Pledged
              Mortgages or Pledged Securities were Swingline Advances, shall be
              deemed to be (i) a repayment of the Warehousing Advances
              outstanding against such Pledged Mortgages or Pledged Securities
              and (ii) a refunding of the Swingline Advances repaid as
              Warehousing Advances made by the Lenders in accordance with
              Section 1.3 hereof.

      4.3(j)  Credit Agent reserves the right to revalue any Pledged Loan that
              is not (i) covered by a Purchase Commitment from Fannie Mae or
              Freddie Mac, or (ii) to be exchanged for an Agency Security if
              that Agency Security is covered by a Purchase Commitment. Borrower
              must pay to Credit Agent, without the necessity of prior demand or
              Notice from Credit Agent, and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to
              cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for,
              any amount required after any such revaluation to reduce the
              principal amount of the Warehousing Advance outstanding against
              the revalued Pledged Loan to an amount equal to the Advance Rate
              for the applicable Eligible Loan type multiplied by the Fair
              Market Value of the Mortgage Loan.


                                       12
<PAGE>

      4.3(k)  The outstanding amount of any Swingline Advance made pursuant to
              Section 3.1(d) shall be payable in full within one (1) Business
              Day after the date of such Advance.

4.4.  WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT FEES

      Borrower must pay each Lender, through Credit Agent, a fee ("Warehousing
      Commitment Fee") in the amount of 0.125% per annum of the amount of such
      Lender's Warehousing Commitment Amount. The Warehousing Commitment Fee is
      payable quarterly in advance. Credit Agent computes the Warehousing
      Commitment Fee on the basis of the actual number of days in each Calendar
      Quarter and a year of 360 days. On the Closing Date, Borrower must pay the
      prorated portion of the Warehousing Commitment Fee due from the Closing
      Date to the last day of the current Calendar Quarter. After the Closing
      Date, Borrower must pay the Warehousing Commitment Fee within 10 days
      after the date of Credit Agent's invoice or account analysis statement. If
      any Lender increases its Warehousing Commitment Amount, or if an
      Additional Lender becomes a party hereto, during any Calendar Quarter,
      Borrower shall pay the Warehousing Commitment Fee on the amount of such
      increase or the amount of such Additional Lender's Warehousing Commitment
      Amount from the effective date thereof to the last day of the current
      Calendar Quarter. If the date set forth in clause (a) of the definition of
      Warehousing Maturity Date occurs on a day other than the last day of a
      Calendar Quarter, Borrower must pay the prorated portion of the
      Warehousing Commitment Fee due from the beginning of the then current
      Calendar Quarter to and including that date. Borrower is not entitled to a
      reduction in the amount of the Warehousing Commitment Fee if (a) the
      Warehousing Commitment Amounts are reduced or (b) the Warehousing
      Commitments are terminated at the request of Borrower or as a result of an
      Event of Default. If the Warehousing Commitments terminate at the request
      of Borrower or as a result of an Event of Default, Borrower must pay, on
      the date of termination, a Warehousing Commitment Fee on the Warehousing
      Commitment Amounts in effect immediately prior to termination, for the
      period from the first day of the first month following the date of
      termination to and including the date set forth in clause (a) of the
      definition of Warehousing Maturity Date. Credit Agent's determination of
      the Warehousing Commitment Fee for any period is conclusive and binding,
      absent manifest error.

4.5.  AGENT'S FEES

      Borrower shall pay to Credit Agent and Collateral Agent, for their own
      accounts, such fees as shall be separately agreed between Borrower and
      Credit Agent and Borrower and Collateral Agent, respectively.

4.6.  TERM LOAN NON-USAGE FEES

      At the end of each Calendar Quarter during the term of this Agreement,
      Credit Agent will determine the average usage of the Term Loan Commitment
      by calculating the arithmetic daily average of the Term Loan Advances
      outstanding during each month during such Calendar Quarter ("Used
      Portion"). Credit Agent will then subtract the Used Portion from the
      arithmetic daily average of the Term Loan Credit Limit outstanding during
      each such month, and the result, if positive, will be known as the "Unused
      Portion." Borrower agrees to pay to Credit Agent, for the account of
      Lenders, a fee ("Non-Usage Fee") in the amount of 0.20% per annum of the
      Unused Portion during each month during such Calendar Quarter. The
      Non-Usage Fee is payable quarterly, in arrears. Credit Agent computes the
      Non-Usage Fee on the basis of the actual number of days in each month and
      a year of 360 days. Borrower must pay the Non-Usage Fee within 10 days
      after the date of Credit Agent's invoice or account analysis statement. If
      the date set forth in clause (a) of the definition of Maturity Date occurs
      on a day other than the last day of a Calendar Quarter, Borrower must pay
      the prorated portion of the Non-Usage Fee due from the beginning of the
      then current Calendar Quarter to and including that date. Borrower is not


                                       13
<PAGE>

      entitled to a reduction in the amount of the Non-Usage Fee if the Term
      Loan Commitments are terminated at the request of Borrower or as a result
      of an Event of Default. If the Term Loan Commitments terminate at the
      request of Borrower or as a result of an Event of Default, Borrower must
      pay, on the date of termination, a Non-Usage Fee on (i) through the date
      of such termination, the Unused Portion, and (ii) from and after the date
      of such termination to and including the date set forth in clause (a) of
      the definition of Term Loan Commitment Termination Date. Credit Agent's
      determination of the Non-Usage Fee for any period is conclusive and
      binding, absent manifest error.

4.7.  MISCELLANEOUS CHARGES

      Borrower must reimburse Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent for all
      Miscellaneous Charges. Miscellaneous Charges are due when incurred, but
      will not be considered delinquent if Borrower pays them within 10 days
      after the date of Credit Agent's or the Collateral Agent's invoice or
      account analysis statement.

4.8.  METHOD OF MAKING PAYMENTS

      Billing and Payment.

      4.8(a)  Credit Agent shall, on or before the 5th Business Day of each
              month, deliver to Borrower billings for interest due and payable
              on Advances, the Commitment Fee, the Non-Usage Fee, Miscellaneous
              Charges payable to it and other fees and charges calculated
              through the end of the preceding month. On or before the 10th
              Business Day of each month, Borrower shall pay to the Credit Agent
              the full amount of interest, fees and charges billed as described
              above. Collateral Agent shall separately bill Borrower for all
              fees described in Section 4.5 and Miscellaneous Charges payable to
              it.

      4.8(b)  All payments made on account of the Obligations shall be made by
              Borrower to the Credit Agent for distribution to the Lenders,
              except for proceeds of the sale or collection of Collateral
              securing Warehousing Advances, which will be deposited into the
              Settlement Account and remitted to the Credit Agent by the
              Collateral Agent, Balance Deficiency Fees, which shall be made
              directly to the applicable Lender, and fees and charges payable to
              the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent for its own account. All
              payments made on account of the Obligations shall be made without
              setoff or counterclaim, free and clear of and without deduction
              for any taxes, fees or other charges of any nature whatsoever
              imposed by any taxing authority, and must be received by Credit
              Agent or (in the case of Collateral Proceeds used to repay
              Warehousing Advances, fees and charges payable to Collateral
              Agent) by Collateral Agent by 1:30 p.m. on the day of payment, it
              being expressly agreed and understood that if a payment is
              received after 1:30 p.m. by Credit Agent or Collateral Agent such
              payment will be considered to have been made on the next
              succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable by
              Borrower at the then applicable rate during such extension. No
              principal payments resulting from the sale of Pledged Mortgages or
              Pledged Securities shall be deemed to have been received by
              Collateral Agent until Collateral Agent has also received the
              Notice required under Section 4.3(g). All payments shall be made
              in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately
              available funds transferred via wire to the Settlement Account or
              the Cash Collateral Account. If any payment required to be made by
              Borrower hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a
              Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
              succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable on Advances
              so extended at the then applicable rate during such extension.


                                       14
<PAGE>

      4.8(c)  All amounts received by Credit Agent on account of the Obligations
              (except amounts received in respect of fees or expenses payable
              hereunder to the Credit Agent for its own account or amounts
              payable to RFC for Swingline Advances) shall be disbursed to the
              Lenders by wire transfer on the date of receipt if received by
              Credit Agent by the applicable deadlines for payment thereof as
              specified in Section 4.8(b) hereof, or if received later, by 12:00
              noon on the next succeeding Business Day, without any interest
              payable by Credit Agent thereon.

      4.8(d)  Without limiting any other right that Credit Agent, Collateral
              Agent or any Lender may have under applicable law or otherwise,
              while a Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower authorizes
              Credit Agent to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's
              Operating Account, and to cause Collateral Agent to charge any
              account of Borrower (other than any trust or escrow account) with
              it, for any Obligations due and owing, without the necessity of
              prior demand or Notice from Credit Agent.

4.9.  ILLEGALITY

      In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination
      shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) at any time that
      the introduction of, or any change in, any applicable law, rule,
      regulation, order or decree or in the interpretation or the administration
      thereof by any Person charged with the interpretation or administration
      thereof, or compliance by such Lender with any request or directive
      (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Person, shall make it
      unlawful or impossible for such Lender to charge interest at the Balance
      Funded Rate based on Borrower's Eligible Balances as contemplated by this
      Agreement, then such Lender shall forthwith give Notice thereof to Credit
      Agent and Borrower describing such illegality in reasonable detail. Upon
      the giving of such Notice, the obligation of such Lender to charge
      interest at the Balance Funded Rate based on Borrower's Eligible Balances
      shall be immediately suspended for the duration of such illegality and
      with respect to Advances bearing interest at the Balance Funded Rate, each
      such Advance of such Lender shall bear interest at the applicable Interest
      Rate described in Exhibit H or Exhibit I, as applicable. If and when such
      illegality ceases to exist, such Lender shall notify Credit Agent and
      Borrower thereof and such suspension shall cease.

4.10. INCREASED COSTS; CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

      In the event any applicable law, order, regulation or directive issued by
      any governmental or monetary authority, or any change therein or in the
      governmental or judicial interpretation or application thereof, or
      compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not
      having the force of law) by any governmental or monetary authority:

      4.10(a) Does or shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
              with respect to this Agreement or any Advances made hereunder, or
              change the basis of taxation on payments to such Lender of
              principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder
              (except for change in the rate of tax on the overall gross or net
              income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's
              principal office is located);

      4.10(b) Does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
              capital requirement, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
              requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
              liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or
              other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
              such Lender which are not otherwise included in the determination
              of the interest rate as calculated hereunder;

      and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
      Lender of making, renewing or maintaining any Advance or to reduce any
      amount receivable in respect thereof or to reduce


                                       15
<PAGE>

      the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling
      such Lender as it relates to credit facilities in the nature of that
      evidenced by this Agreement, then, in any such case, Borrower shall
      promptly pay any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
      for such additional cost or reduced amounts receivable or reduced rate of
      return as determined by such Lender with respect to this Agreement or
      Advances made hereunder. If a Lender becomes entitled to claim any
      additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall notify Borrower
      through Credit Agent of the event by reason of which it has become so
      entitled and Borrower shall pay such amount within 15 days thereafter. A
      certificate as to any additional amount payable pursuant to the foregoing
      sentence containing the calculation thereof in reasonable detail submitted
      by a Lender, through Credit Agent, to Borrower shall be conclusive in the
      absence of manifest error.

4.11. WITHHOLDING TAXES

      4.11(a)(1) Any and all payments by Borrower hereunder or under the Notes
                 shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
                 and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
                 charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
                 thereto imposed on it by any jurisdiction (excluding, in the
                 case of each Lender and Credit Agent, (y)franchise taxes
                 imposed on or measured by its income by the jurisdiction under
                 the laws of which such Lender or Credit Agent, as the case may
                 be, is organized or any political subdivision thereof, and,
                 (z)if such Lender or Credit Agent is entitled at such time to a
                 total or partial exemption from withholding that is required to
                 be evidenced by a United States Internal Revenue Service Form,
                 taxes imposed on it by reason of any failure of such Lender or
                 Credit Agent to deliver to the Credit Agent or the Borrower,
                 from time to time as required by the Credit Agent or Borrower,
                 such Form, completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
                 Credit Agent or the Borrower) (all such non-excluded taxes,
                 levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
                 liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If
                 Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
                 in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to
                 any Lender or Credit Agent (i) the sum payable shall be
                 increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
                 deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
                 payable under this Section 4.11) such Lender or Credit Agent
                 (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
                 would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)
                 Borrower shall make such deductions, and (iii) Borrower shall
                 pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority
                 or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

      (2)        Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Credit Agent for
                 the full amount of Taxes(including, without limitation, any
                 Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
                 Section 4.11) paid by such Lender or Credit Agent (as the case
                 may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
                 expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
                 not such Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
                 indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the
                 date such Lender or Credit Agent (as the case may be) makes
                 written demand therefor.

      (3)        Within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes ,
                 Borrower will furnish to Credit Agent the original or a
                 certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

      (4)        Prior to the Closing Date, in the case of each Lender which is
                 an original signatory hereto, and on the date of the assignment
                 pursuant to which it becomes a Lender, in the case of each
                 other Lender, and from time to time


                                       16

                 thereafter if requested by Borrower or Credit Agent, each
                 Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
                 United States that is entitled to an exemption from United
                 States withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a
                 reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty, shall provide
                 Credit Agent and Borrower with an Internal Revenue Service Form
                 W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate or
                 document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the
                 United States certifying as to such Lender's entitlement to
                 such exemption or reduced rate with respect to all payments to
                 be made to such Lender hereunder and under the Notes. Unless
                 Borrower and Credit Agent have received forms or other
                 documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments
                 hereunder or under any Note are not subject to United States
                 withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by
                 an applicable tax treaty, Borrower or Credit Agent shall
                 withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory
                 rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender organized
                 under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States.

      (5)        Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
                 this Section 4.11 shall use its best efforts (consistent with
                 its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
                 change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office to a
                 jurisdiction in which such Lender already has a lending office
                 if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or
                 reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts which may
                 thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of
                 such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

      (6)        Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
                 Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
                 Borrower contained in this Section 4.11 shall survive the
                 payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under
                 the Notes.

      4.11(b)    If Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts
                 described in Section 4.11(a) as a result of any condition
                 described in such Section and payment of such amount is
                 demanded by any Lender, then unless a Default or an Event of
                 Default shall have occurred and be continuing or such Lender
                 has theretofore taken steps that will promptly remove or cure
                 the conditions creating the cause for such obligation to pay
                 such additional amounts, or has revoked such election, as the
                 case may be, Borrower may, on 10 Business Days' prior written
                 Notice to Credit Agent, who shall promptly send a copy of such
                 notice to each Lender, cause such Lender to (and such Lender
                 shall, upon payment in full of all amounts outstanding in
                 respect of such Lender's Loans, including accrued interest
                 thereon, and all other amounts due and payable to such Lender
                 hereunder) assign pursuant to Section 13.7 all of its rights
                 and obligations under this Agreement to a Lender or other
                 Person selected by Borrower and reasonably acceptable to Credit
                 Agent.

              payment to Collateral Agent of the Release Amount in connection
              with those Pledged Loans. If Pledged Loans are transferred to a
              pool custodian or an investor for inclusion in a Mortgage Pool and
              Credit Agent's security interest in the Pledged Loans included in
              the Mortgage Pool is not released before the


                                       19
<PAGE>

              issuance of the related Mortgage-backed Security, then that
              Mortgage-backed Security, when issued, is a Pledged Security.
              Credit Agent's security interest continues in the Pledged Loans
              backing that Pledged Security and Collateral Agent is entitled to
              possession of the Pledged Security in the manner provided in this
              Agreement.

      5.2(b)  If Pledged Loans are transferred to an Approved Custodian and
              included in an Eligible Mortgage Pool, Credit Agent's security
              interest in the Pledged Loans included in the Eligible Mortgage
              Pool will be released upon the delivery of the Agency Security to
              Collateral Agent (including delivery to or registration in the
              name of a third party on behalf of Collateral Agent), and that
              Agency Security is a Pledged Security. Credit Agent's security
              interest in that Pledged Security will be released only against
              payment to Collateral Agent of the Release Amount in connection
              with the Mortgage Loans backing that Pledged Security.

      5.2(c)  If no Default or Event of Default occurs, Borrower may redeem a
              Pledged Loan or Pledged Security from Credit Agent's security
              interest by notifying Collateral Agent of its intention to redeem
              the Pledged Loan or Pledged Security from pledge and either (1)
              paying, or causing an Investor to pay, to Collateral Agent, for
              application to prepayment on the principal balance of the
              Warehousing Note, the Release Amount in connection with the
              Pledged Loan or the Pledged Loans backing that Pledged Security,
              or (2) delivering substitute Collateral that, in addition to being
              acceptable to Credit Agent in its sole discretion will, when
              included with the remaining Collateral, result in a Fair Market
              Value of all Eligible Loans held by Collateral Agent that is at
              least equal to the aggregate outstanding Warehousing Advances
              (other than Warehousing Advances against Other Eligible Assets).

      5.2(d)  After a Default or Event of Default occurs, Credit Agent may, with
              no liability to Borrower or any Person, continue to release its
              security interest in any Pledged Loan or Pledged Security against
              payment of the Release Amount in connection with that Pledged Loan
              or the Pledged Loans backing that Pledged Security.

      5.2(e)  The amount ("Release Amount") to be paid by Borrower to obtain the
              release of Credit Agent's security interest in a Pledged Loan will
              be (a) the payment required in any bailee letter pursuant to which
              the Collateral Agent ships a Pledged Loan to an Investor or
              Approved Custodian, and (b) otherwise, until an Event of Default
              occurs, the principal amount of the Warehousing Advances
              outstanding against the Pledged Loan, and while an Event of
              Default exists, the amount paid to Credit Agent or the Collateral
              Agent in a commercially reasonable disposition of that Pledged
              Loan.

5.3.  RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST IN OTHER ELIGIBLE ASSETS

      Assets other than Pledged Loans, Pledged Securities and related Collateral
      will be released from Lender's security interest in connection with any
      sale thereof permitted pursuant to this Agreement, provided that any
      prepayment of Advances required in connection with or a result of such
      sale under Section 4.3, including Section 4.3(f), 4.3(g) and 4.3(h), is
      made prior to, or at the time of, such sale.

5.4.  COLLECTION AND SERVICING RIGHTS

      If no Event of Default exists, Borrower may service and receive and
      collect directly all sums payable to Borrower in respect of the Collateral
      other than proceeds of any Purchase Commitment, amounts paid on any
      Receivables (other than Servicing Contracts) or proceeds of the sale of
      any Collateral.


                                       20
<PAGE>

      After an Event of Default, Credit Agent or its designee are entitled to
      service and receive and collect all sums payable to Borrower in respect of
      the Collateral, and in such case (1) Credit Agent or its designee in its
      discretion may, in its own name, in the name of Borrower or otherwise,
      demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time
      payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the
      Collateral, but Credit Agent has no obligation to do so, (2) Borrower
      must, if Credit Agent requests it to do so, hold in trust for the benefit
      of Credit Agent and immediately pay to Credit Agent at its office
      designated by Notice, all amounts received by Borrower upon or in respect
      of any of the Collateral, advising Credit Agent as to the source of such
      funds and (3) all amounts so received and collected by Credit Agent will
      be held by it as part of the Collateral.

5.5.  RETURN OF COLLATERAL AT END OF COMMITMENTS

      If (a) the Commitments have expired or been terminated, and (b) no
      Advances, interest or other Obligations are outstanding and unpaid, Credit
      Agent will release its security interest and Collateral Agent will deliver
      all Collateral in its possession to Borrower at Borrower's expense.
      Borrower's acknowledgement or receipt for any Collateral released or
      delivered to Borrower under any provision of this Agreement is a complete
      and full acquittance for the Collateral so returned, and Collateral Agent
      is discharged from any liability or responsibility for that Collateral.

5.6.  DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS

      5.6(a)  Collateral Agent may deliver documents relating to the Collateral
              to Borrower for correction or completion under a Trust Receipt.

      5.6(b)  If no Default or Event of Default exists, upon delivery by
              Borrower to Collateral Agent of shipping instructions pursuant to
              the Collateral Agency Agreement, Collateral Agent will transmit
              Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities, together with all related
              loan documents and pool documents in Collateral Agent's
              possession, to the applicable Investor, Approved Custodian or
              other party acceptable to Collateral Agent in its sole discretion.

      5.6(c)  If a Default or Event of Default exists, Collateral Agent may,
              without liability to Borrower or any other Person, continue to
              transmit Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities, together with all
              related loan documents and pool documents in Collateral Agent's
              possession, to the applicable Investor, Approved Custodian or
              other party acceptable to Credit Agent in its sole discretion.

      5.6(d)  Upon receipt of Notice from Borrower under Section 4.3 (g), and
              payment of the Release Amount with respect to a Pledged Loan
              identified by Borrower, Collateral Agent will, at Borrower's
              request, release to Borrower any Collateral Documents relating to
              the redeemed Pledged Loan or the Pledged Loans backing a Pledged
              Security that Collateral Agent has in its possession and that have

      of such financial statements and all years and periods prior to those
      financial statements and for which Borrower and its Subsidiaries may be
      liable in its own right or as transferee of the assets of, or as successor
      to, any other Person. No tax Liens have been filed and no material claims
      are being asserted against Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower or any
      property of Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower with respect to any
      taxes, fees or charges.

      described in Section 7.5. Neither Borrower nor any Subsidiary of Borrower
      is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
      obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement,
      instrument, or indenture which default could result in a material adverse
      change in Borrower's business, operations, properties or financial
      condition as a whole. No holder of any indebtedness of Borrower or of any
      of its Subsidiaries has given notice of any asserted default under that
      indebtedness, and no liquidation or dissolution of Borrower or of any of
      its Subsidiaries and no receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,

      properties and assets that Borrower has disposed of since the date of

11.2. REMEDIES

      11.2(a)If a Lender shall have knowledge of a Default or an Event of
              Default, it shall forthwith give Notice thereof to the Credit
              Agent. If the Credit Agent shall have knowledge of a Default or an
              Event of Default, it shall forthwith give Notice thereof to each
              Lender and to Borrower. The Credit Agent shall not be deemed to
              have knowledge or Notice of the occurrence of a Default or an
              Event of Default unless the Credit Agent has received Notice from
              a Lender or Borrower. No Lender shall be deemed to have knowledge
              or Notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default
              unless such Lender has received Notice from the Credit Agent or
              Borrower.

      11.2(b) If an Event of Default described in Section 11.1 (f) occurs with
              respect to Borrower, the Commitments will automatically terminate
              and the unpaid principal amount of and accrued interest on the
              Notes and all other Obligations will automatically become due and
              payable, without presentment, demand or other requirements of any
              kind, all of which Borrower expressly waives.

      11.2(c) If any other Event of Default occurs, Majority Lenders may, by
              Notice to Borrower, terminate the Commitments and declare the
              Obligations to be immediately due and payable.


                                       44
<PAGE>

      11.2(d) If any Event of Default occurs, Credit Agent, on behalf of the
              Lenders, may, and at the direction of the Majority Lenders shall
              (subject to Section 12.3(c)), also take any of the following
              actions:

              (1)   Foreclose upon or otherwise enforce its security interest in
                    and Lien on the Collateral to secure all payments and
                    performance of the Obligations in any manner permitted by
                    law or provided for in the Loan Documents.

              (2)   Notify all obligors under any of the Collateral that the
                    Collateral has been assigned to Credit Agent , on behalf of
                    Lenders (or to another Person designated by Credit Agent)
                    and that all payments on that Collateral are to be made
                    directly to Credit Agent (or such other Person); settle,
                    compromise or release, in whole or in part, any amounts any
                    obligor or Investor owes on any of the Collateral on terms
                    acceptable to Credit Agent; enforce payment and prosecute
                    any action or proceeding involving any of the Collateral;
                    and where any Collateral is in default, foreclose on and
                    enforce any Liens securing that Collateral in any manner
                    permitted by law and sell any property acquired as a result
                    of those enforcement actions.

              (3)   Act, or contract with a third party to act at Borrower's
                    expense, as servicer or subservicer of Collateral requiring
                    servicing and perform all obligations required under any
                    Servicing Contracts and Purchase Commitments.

              (4)   Require Borrower to assemble and make available to Credit
                    Agent the Collateral and all related books and records at a
                    place designated by Credit Agent.

              (5)   Enter onto property where any Collateral or related books
                    and records are located and take possession of those items
                    with or without judicial process; and obtain access to
                    Borrower's data processing equipment, computer hardware and
                    software relating to the Collateral and use all of the
                    foregoing and the information contained in the foregoing in
                    any manner Credit Agent deems necessary for the purpose of
                    effectuating its rights under this Agreement and any other
                    Loan Document.

              (6)   Before the disposition of the Collateral, prepare it for
                    disposition in any manner and to the extent Credit Agent
                    deems appropriate.

              (7)   Exercise all rights and remedies of a secured creditor under
                    the Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota or other applicable
                    law, including selling or otherwise disposing of all or any
                    portion of the Collateral at one or more public or private
                    sales, whether or not the Collateral is present at the place
                    of sale, for cash or credit or future delivery, on the terms
                    and in the manner as Credit Agent may determine, including
                    sale under any applicable Purchase Commitment. Borrower
                    waives any right it may have to prior notice of the sale of
                    all or any portion of the collateral to the extent allowed
                    by applicable law. If notice is required under applicable
                    law, Credit Agent will give Borrower not less than 10 days'
                    notice of any public sale or of the date after which any
                    private sale may be held. Borrower agrees that 10 days'
                    notice is reasonable notice. Credit Agent may, without
                    notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale
                    one or more times by announcement at the time and place
                    fixed for the sale, and the sale may be held at any time or
                    place announced at the adjournment. In the case of a sale of
                    all or any portion of the Collateral on credit or for future
                    delivery, the Collateral sold on those terms may be may be
                    retained by Credit Agent until the purchaser pays the
                    selling price or takes possession of the Collateral. Credit
                    Agent has no liability to Borrower if a purchaser fails to
                    pay for or take possession of the


                                       45
<PAGE>

                    Collateral sold on those terms, and in the case of any such
                    failure, Credit Agent may sell the Collateral again upon
                    notice complying with this Section.

              (8)   Instead of or in conjunction with exercising the power of
                    sale authorized by Section 11.2 (d)(7), Credit Agent may
                    proceed by suit at law or in equity to collect all amounts
                    due upon the Collateral, or to foreclose Credit Agent's Lien
                    on and sell all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to
                    a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

              (9)   Proceed against Borrower on the Notes.

              (10)  Retain all excess proceeds from the sale or other
                    disposition of the Collateral, and apply them to the payment
                    of the Obligations under Section 11.3.

      11.2(e) Credit Agent shall follow the instructions of the Majority Lenders
              in exercising or not exercising its rights under this Section
              11.2, but (i) the Credit Agent shall have no obligation to take or
              not to take any action which it believes may expose it to any
              liability, and (ii) the Credit Agent may, but shall be under no
              obligation to, await instructions from the Majority Lenders before
              exercising or not exercising its rights under this Section 11.2.

      11.2(f) Credit Agent or any Lender will incur no liability as a result of
              the commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of all or
              any portion of the Collateral at any public or private sale or
              other disposition. Borrower waives (to the extent permitted by
              law) any claims it may have against Credit Agent and each other
              Lender arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the
              Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the
              price that Credit Agent might have obtained at a public sale, or
              was less than the aggregate amount of the outstanding Advances,
              plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Advances, and unpaid fees,
              even if Credit Agent accepts the first offer received and does not
              offer the Collateral to more than one offeree. Borrower agrees
              that any sale of Collateral under the terms of a Purchase
              Commitment, or any other disposition of Collateral arranged by
              Borrower, whether before or after the occurrence of an Event of
              Default, will be deemed to have been made in a commercially
              reasonable manner.

      11.2(g) Borrower acknowledges that Mortgage Loans are collateral of a type
              that is the subject of widely distributed standard price
              quotations and that Mortgage-backed Securities are collateral of a
              type that is customarily sold on a recognized market. Borrower
              waives any right it may have to prior notice of the sale of
              Pledged Securities, and agrees that Credit Agent may purchase
              Pledged Loans and Pledged Securities at a private sale of such
              Collateral.

      11.2(h) Borrower specifically waives and releases (to the extent permitted
              by law) any equity or right of redemption, stay or appraisal that
              Borrower has or may have under any rule of law or statute now
              existing or adopted after the date of this Agreement, and any
              right to require Credit Agent to (1) proceed against any Person,
              (2) proceed against or exhaust any of the Collateral or pursue its
              rights and remedies against the Collateral in any particular
              order, or (3) pursue any other remedy within its power. Credit
              Agent is not be required to take any action to preserve any rights
              of Borrower against holders of mortgages having priority to the
              Lien of any Mortgage included in the Collateral or to preserve
              Borrower's rights against other prior parties.

      11.2(i) Credit Agent may, but is not obligated to, advance any sums or do
              any act or thing necessary to uphold or enforce the Lien and
              priority of, or the security intended to be afforded by, any
              Mortgage included in the Collateral, including payment of
              delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. All
              advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable
              attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by Credit
              Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy
              conferred by this


                                       46
<PAGE>

              Agreement, or in the enforcement of this Agreement, together with
              interest on those amounts at the Default Rate, from the time paid
              by Credit Agent until repaid by Borrower, are deemed to be
              principal outstanding under this Agreement and the Notes.

      11.2(j) No failure or delay on the part of Credit Agent to exercise any
              right, power or remedy provided in this Agreement or under any
              other Loan Document, at law or in equity, will operate as a waiver
              of that right, power or remedy. No single or partial exercise by
              Credit Agent or any Lender of any right, power or remedy provided
              under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, at law or in
              equity, precludes any other or further exercise of that right,
              power, or remedy by Credit Agent or any Lender, or Credit Agent's
              exercise of any other right, power or remedy. Without limiting the
              foregoing, Borrower waives all defenses based on the statute of
              limitations to the extent permitted by law. The remedies provided
              in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
              are not exclusive of any remedies provided at law or in equity.

      11.2(k) Credit Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use,
              without charge, Borrower's computer programs, other programs,
              labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of any name, trade
              secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks and advertising
              matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the
              Collateral, in advertising for sale and selling any Collateral and
              Borrower's rights under all licenses and all other agreements
              related to the foregoing inure to Lenders' benefit until the
              Obligations are paid in full.

11.3. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

      The proceeds of any sale, disposition or other enforcement of the Credit
      Agent's security interest in all or any part of the Collateral shall be
      applied by the Credit Agent as follows:

              Servicing Contracts) and related collateral:

11.4. CREDIT AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT

      Borrower appoints each of Credit Agent and Collateral Agent its
      attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, for the purpose of
      carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, the Notes and the other
      Loan Documents and taking any action and executing any instruments that
      Credit Agent or Collateral Agent deems necessary or advisable to
      accomplish that purpose. Borrower's appointment of Credit Agent and
      Collateral Agent as attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and coupled with an
      interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Credit Agent
      or Collateral Agent may give notice of Credit Agent's Lien on the
      Collateral to any Person, either in the name of Borrower or in its own
      name, endorse all Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities payable to the order
      of Borrower, change or cause to be changed the book-entry registration or
      name of subscriber or Investor on any Pledged Security, or receive,
      endorse and collect all checks made payable to the order of Borrower
      representing payment on account of the principal of or interest on, or the
      proceeds of sale of, any of the Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities and
      give full discharge for those transactions.

<PAGE>

11.5. RIGHT OF SET-OFF

      Without limiting any other right that Credit Agent, Collateral Agent or
      any Lender may have under applicable law or otherwise, if Borrower
      defaults in the payment of any Obligation or in the performance of any of
      its duties under the Loan Documents, each Lender may, without Notice to or
      demand on Borrower (which Notice or demand Borrower expressly waives),
      set-off, appropriate or apply any and all property of Borrower held at any
      time by such Lender, or any indebtedness at any time owed by such Lender
      to or for the account of Borrower, against the Obligations, whether or not
      those Obligations have matured.

11.6. SHARING OF PAYMENTS

      If upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the
      Obligations, if any Lender shall hold or receive and retain any payment,
      whether by setoff, application of deposit balance or security, or
      otherwise, in respect of the Obligations, then such Lender shall purchase
      from the other Lenders for cash and at face value and without recourse,
      such participation in the Obligations held by them as shall be necessary
      to cause such payment to be shared ratably with each of them; provided,
      that if such payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such
      purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be
      rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of
      such excess payment so recovered, but without interest thereon unless the
      purchasing Lender is required to pay interest on such amounts to the
      Person recovering such payment, in which case with interest thereon,
      computed at the same rate, and on the same basis, as the interest that the
      purchasing Lender is required to pay. If any Lender receives a payment
      from the Borrower not in respect of the Obligations, but relating to
      another relationship of such Lender and the Borrower, such Lender may
      apply the payment first to the indebtedness arising out of the other
      relationship and then against the Obligations as provided for above.

      Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
      provisions of the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform
      such duties as are expressly delegated to the Credit Agent and the
      Collateral Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such
      other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Credit Agent and
      the Collateral Agent each hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to
      act in accordance with this Agreement.

12.2. DUTIES OF AGENTS

      The provisions of the Loan Documents set forth the exclusive duties of the
      Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent and no implied duties or obligations
      shall be read into the Loan Documents against the Credit Agent or the
      Collateral Agent. The Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be
      bound in any way by any agreement or contract other than the Loan
      Documents and any other agreement to which it is a party. The Credit Agent
      and the Collateral Agent shall each act as an independent contractor in
      performing its obligations as Credit Agent or Collateral Agent under the
      Loan Documents and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create any
      fiduciary relationship among or between the Credit Agent, the Collateral
      Agent, Borrower or the Lenders.

12.3. STANDARD OF CARE

      The Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent each shall act in accordance
      with customary standards for those engaged as credit agents or collateral
      agents of commercial transactions in similar capacities.

      12.3(a) Neither the Credit Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be
              required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
              observance of any of the conditions or agreements to be performed
              or observed by any other party, except as specifically provided in
              the Loan Documents. The Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent each
              disclaims any responsibility for the validity or accuracy of the
              recitals to the Loan Documents and any representations and
              warranties contained herein, unless specifically identified as
              recitals, representations or warranties of the Credit Agent or the
              Collateral Agent.

      12.3(b) Neither the Credit Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any
              responsibility for ascertaining the value, collectibility,
              insurability, enforceability, effectiveness or suitability of any
              Collateral, the title of any party therein, the validity or
              adequacy of the security afforded thereby, or the validity of the
              Loan Documents (except as to its authority to enter into the Loan
              Documents and to perform its obligations hereunder and
              thereunder).

      12.3(c) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Credit Agent or
              the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
              incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its
              duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or
              powers, if, in its sole judgment, it shall believe that repayment
              of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
              is not assured to it.


                                       51
<PAGE>

      12.3(d) Neither the Credit Agent nor the Collateral Agent is responsible
              for preparing or filing any reports or returns relating to
              federal, state or local income taxes with respect to this
              Agreement, other than for its compensation or for reimbursement of
              expenses.

12.4. DELEGATION OF DUTIES

      Each of the Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent may execute any of its
      duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact
      and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters
      pertaining to such duties. Neither the Credit Agent nor the Collateral
      Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents
      or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

12.5. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS

      Neither the Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any of their respective
      officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
      shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken
      by it or such Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents
      (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
      misconduct), or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for
      any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower
      or any officer thereof contained in the Loan Documents or in any
      certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided
      for in, or received by the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent under or
      in connection with, the Loan Documents or for the value, validity,
      effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of the Loan
      Documents or for any failure of Borrower to perform its obligations under
      any Loan Document. Neither the Credit Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall
      be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
      observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
      conditions of, the Loan Documents or to inspect the properties, books or
      records of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

12.6. RELIANCE BY AGENT

      The Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
      shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution,
      notice, consent, certification, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram,
      telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
      conversation reasonably believed by it to be correct and to have been
      signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
      statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to
      Borrower), independent accountants (including, without limitation,
      accountants to Borrower) and other experts selected by the Credit Agent
      and the Collateral Agent. The Credit Agent may deem and treat the payee of
      any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes. As to the Lenders (a) the
      Credit Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
      action under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice
      or concurrence of the Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
      appropriate, or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
      Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Percentage Shares
      against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
      reason of taking or continuing to take any action (except for liabilities
      and expenses resulting from the Credit Agent's gross negligence or willful
      misconduct), (b) the Credit Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
      acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in
      accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders,
      as appropriate, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
      pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders, (c) the Collateral
      Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
      under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or
      concurrence of the Credit Agent, and (d) the Collateral Agent shall in all
      cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
      the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of or instructions from
      the Credit Agent, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
      pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

<PAGE>

12.7. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS OR OTHER LENDERS

      Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Credit Agent, the
      Collateral Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
      employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any
      representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Credit
      Agent or the Collateral Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
      affairs of Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
      warranty by the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent to any Lender. Each
      Lender represents to the Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent that it
      has, independently and without reliance upon the Credit Agent, the
      Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
      information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
      investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
      condition and creditworthiness of Borrower and made its own decision to
      enter into and make Advances under the Credit Agreement. Each Lender also
      represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
      Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
      documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
      continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
      taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement, and to make such
      investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
      operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness
      of Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
      required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Credit Agent or the
      Collateral Agent hereunder or under the Collateral Agency Agreement, the
      Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or responsibility
      to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
      business, operations, property, financial or other condition or
      creditworthiness of Borrower or any Subsidiary which may come into the
      possession of the Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent or any of their
      respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
      Affiliates.

12.8. AGENTS IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY

      The Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent may make loans to, accept
      deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower
      as though it were not an agent hereunder. With respect to the Advances
      made or renewed by them and any Note issued to them, the Credit Agent and
      the Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan
      Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
      the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
      "Lenders" shall include the Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent in its
      individual capacity.

12.9. SUCCESSOR AGENT

      The Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent may resign as such at any time
      upon giving 30 days Notice to Borrower and the Lenders. The Credit Agent
      may be removed immediately with cause or at any time upon 30 days Notice
      from the Majority Lenders to the Credit Agent and Borrower. The Collateral
      Agent may be removed immediately with cause or at any time upon 30 days
      Notice from the Credit Agent to the Collateral Agent, Lenders and
      Borrower. Upon Notice of such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders
      may appoint a successor Credit Agent, and the Credit Agent may appoint a
      successor Collateral Agent (which successor Credit Agent or Collateral
      Agent, assuming that no Default or Event of Default exists, shall be
      reasonably acceptable to Borrower). The date on which Borrower, the Credit
      Agent and Lenders have received Notice from such successor of its
      acceptance of appointment as the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent
      shall constitute the effective date of resignation or removal of the
      resigning or removed Credit Agent or Collateral Agent. If no successor
      Credit Agent or Collateral Agent, shall have been so appointed by the
      Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within the
      allotted time period, then, upon 5 days Notice to Borrower, the resigned
      or removed Credit Agent or Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
      appoint a successor. Upon the effective date of resignation or removal of
      the resigning or removed Credit Agent or Collateral


                                       53
<PAGE>

      Agent, such successor will thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
      the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the resigning or removed
      Credit Agent or Collateral Agent, but the resigning or removed Credit
      Agent or Collateral Agent shall not be discharged from any liability as a
      result of its or its directors', officers', agents', or employees' gross
      negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties and
      obligations under this Agreement prior to the effective date of its
      resignation or removal. Upon the effective date of its resignation or
      removal, the Credit Agent shall assign all of its right, title and
      security interest in and to all Collateral to its successor, without
      recourse, warranty or representation, express or implied.

      electronic transmission, have the same force and effect as the originals.

13.2. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNITY

      Borrower must: (a) pay such documentation production fees as Credit Agent
      may require and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Credit Agent and
      the Collateral Agent, including reasonable fees, service charges and
      disbursements of counsel (including allocated costs of internal counsel),
      in connection with the amendment, enforcement and administration of this
      Agreement, the Notes, and other Loan Documents and the making and
      repayment of the Advances, and the payment of interest thereon; (b)
      indemnify, pay, and hold harmless Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent and
      any other holder of the Notes from and against, all present and future
      stamp, documentary and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing
      matters and save Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent and any other holder
      of the Notes harmless from and against any and all liabilities with
      respect to or resulting from any delay or omission to pay such taxes; and
      (c) indemnify, pay and hold harmless Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent,
      each Lender, any of their officers, directors, employees or agents and any
      subsequent holder of the Notes (collectively called the "Indemnitees")
      from and against all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
      judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
      whatsoever (including


                                       55
<PAGE>

      the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel of the Indemnitees
      (including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with any
      investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not the
      Indemnitees have been designated as parties to such proceeding) that may
      be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitees in any
      manner relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes, or any
      other Loan Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
      thereby ("Indemnified Liabilities"), except that Borrower has no
      obligation under this Agreement to any Indemnity with respect to
      Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
      misconduct of such Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertaking to
      indemnify, pay and hold harmless as set forth in the preceding sentence
      may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy,
      Borrower must contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay
      and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
      Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them. The
      agreement of Borrower contained in this Article survives the expiration or
      termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Notes.
      Attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in enforcing, or on appeal
      from, a judgment under this Agreement are recoverable separately from and
      in addition to any other amount included in such judgment, and this clause
      is intended to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement
      and to survive and not be merged into such judgment.

13.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE LENDERS

      The Lenders agree to indemnify each of the Credit Agent and the Collateral
      Agent in its respective capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
      Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so),
      ratably according to the respective amounts of their Percentage Shares,
      from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
      penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
      any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at
      any time following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred
      by or asserted against the Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent in any way
      relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any documents
      contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
      contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the
      Credit Agent or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with any of
      the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of
      any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
      actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from
      the Credit Agent's or the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful
      misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of
      the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. Attorneys' fees and
      disbursements incurred in enforcing, or on appeal from, a judgment
      pursuant hereto shall be recoverable separately from and in addition to
      any other amount included in such judgment, and this clause is intended to
      be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to survive
      and not be merged into such judgment.

13.4. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

      All financial statements and reports furnished to Credit Agent under this
      Agreement must be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis
      consistent with that applied in preparing the financial statements as at
      the end of and for Borrower's most recent fiscal year (except to the
      extent otherwise required to conform to good accounting practice).

13.5. TERMS BINDING UPON SUCCESSORS; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

      The terms and provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure to
      the benefit of Borrower, Credit Agent, the Collateral Agent and their
      respective successors and assigns. All of Borrower's representations,
      warranties, covenants and agreements survive the making of any Advance,
      and remain effective for as long as the Commitments are outstanding or
      there remain any Obligations to be paid or performed.


                                       56

13.6. LENDERS IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY

      The Lenders and their Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
      and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrowers, any
      Subsidiary and/or the Parent regardless of the capacity of Lenders
      hereunder. The Lenders may disclose to the other Lenders information
      regarding other relationships which they may have Borrower and Borrower
      hereby consents to these disclosures.

13.7. ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATIONS

      This Agreement and the Obligations of Borrower may not be assigned by
      Borrower. Any Lender may, subject to the limitations set forth below,
      assign or transfer, in whole or in part, this Agreement and the other Loan
      Documents and further may sell participations in all or any part of its
      Advances or Maximum Commitment or any other interest in the Obligations or
      any of its obligations hereunder to another Person. In the case of an
      assignment, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower and consent of
      the Credit Agent, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such
      assignment (unless otherwise provided thereby), the same rights and
      benefits as it would have if it were a "Lender" hereunder, and, if the
      assignee has expressly assumed, for the benefit of Borrower, such Lender's
      obligations hereunder, such Lender shall be relieved of its obligations
      hereunder to the extent of such assignment and assumption, provided that
      the Credit Agent shall have no obligation to consent to there being more
      than a total of 10 Lenders (a Participant is not a Lender). In the case of
      a participation, the participating Person's (a "Participant") rights
      against the Lender from whom it has purchased such participation in
      respect of such participation are those set forth in the agreement
      executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto. Such
      Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
      performance of such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents, whether
      or not such Lender shall remain the holder of any Note. Such Lender shall
      retain all voting rights with respect to such Note, the Advances hereunder
      and the Lender's Maximum Commitment. Borrower, the Credit Agent and the
      other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
      in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
      Documents. Without limiting any Lender's exclusive right to collect and
      enforce the Obligations owed to it, Borrower agrees that each
      participation will give rise to a debtor-creditor relationship between
      Borrower and the Participant, and Borrower authorizes each Participant,
      upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to proceed directly by right
      of setoff, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of Borrower
      that may be held by that Participant. Nothing contained herein shall in
      any manner or to any extent affect the right of any Lender to pledge or
      assign its Notes and interests in this Agreement to any Federal Reserve
      Bank pursuant to applicable laws or regulations, or to assign its Notes
      and its right to receive and retain payments on its Notes provided such
      Lender remains primarily and directly liable pursuant to the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement to keep, observe and perform all of its
      obligations under this Agreement, and all such assignments shall be
      treated, considered and administered as a sale of a participation and not
      as an assignment and shall be subject to and governed by the provisions of
      this Section. Any Lender may furnish any information concerning Borrower
      in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Affiliates of such
      Lender and to assignees and Participants (including prospective assignees
      and Participants) and Borrower hereby consents to the provision of such
      information.

13.8. AMENDMENTS

      13.8(a) This Agreement may not be amended or terms or provisions hereof
              waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by
              the Majority Lenders, the Credit Agent and Borrower; provided,
              however, that without the prior written consent of 100% of the
              Lenders, no amendment or waiver shall: (1) waive or amend any term
              or provision of Sections 8.4, 8.14 or 8.15 hereof or the
              definition of any type of Collateral or the provisions of Section
              5.2 hereof, (2) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest or
              fees on,


                                       57

              Warehousing Credit Limit or the Term Loan Credit Limit, (4) modify
              any Lender's Percentage Share of the Warehousing Credit Limit or
              the Term Loan Credit Limit, (5) modify the definition of "Majority
              Lenders," or of the number or percentage of Lenders that are
              required to take action under the Loan Documents, (6) extend the
              Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, the Term Loan Maturity Date
              or the Warehousing Maturity Date, (7) release any material portion
              of the Collateral, except as expressly contemplated by the Loan
              Documents or in connection with a sale of such Collateral
              permitted hereunder, (8) amend Exhibit H or Exhibit I, or (9)
              amend this Section. It is expressly agreed and understood that the
              failure by the Majority Lenders to elect to accelerate amounts
              outstanding hereunder or to terminate the obligation of the
              Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall not constitute an
              amendment or waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement.

      13.8(b) Borrower hereby agrees that it shall, upon requesting any
              amendment of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
              waiver of any material term or provision of this Agreement or any
              other Loan Document (except an extension of the Maturity Date),
              pay at the time of such request a modification fee (1) to the
              Credit Agent in a minimum amount of $2,500 or such greater amount
              as may be notified to Borrower by the Credit Agent in its sole
              discretion and (2) to each Lender (except any Lender which becomes
              party to the Agreement by virtue of such amendment) in a minimum
              amount of $1,000 or such greater amount as may be notified to
              Borrower by the Majority Lenders, acting through the Credit Agent,
              in their sole discretion. The payment of such modification fees
              shall be in addition to and shall not limit Borrower's
              reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 13.2(a) hereof, and
              any other fee or charge imposed by the Credit Agent or the Lenders
              as a condition to any amendment.

13.10. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

      This Agreement provides for the making and repayment of Advances by
      Lenders (in their capacity as lenders) and Borrower (in its capacity as a
      borrower), for the payment of interest on those Advances and for the
      payment of certain fees by Borrower to Lenders and the Credit Agent and
      the Collateral Agent. The relationship between Lenders and Borrower is
      limited to that of creditor and secured party on the part of Lenders, the
      Credit Agent and the Collateral Agent and of borrower and debtor on the
      part of Borrower. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
      Documents for compliance with financial covenants and the delivery of
      financial statements and other operating reports are intended solely for
      the benefit of Lenders to protect its interest as a creditor and lender.
      Nothing in this Agreement creates or may be construed as permitting or
      obligating any Lender to act as a financial or business advisor or
      consultant to Borrower, as permitting or obligating any Lender to control
      Borrower or to conduct Borrower's operations, as creating any fiduciary
      obligation on the part of Lenders to Borrower, or as creating any joint
      venture, agency, or other relationship between Lenders and Borrower other
      than as explicitly and specifically stated in the Loan Documents. Borrower
      acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to obtain the advice of
      experienced counsel of its own choosing in connection with the negotiation
      and execution of the Loan Documents and to obtain the advice of that
      counsel with respect to all matters contained in the Loan Documents,
      including the waiver of jury trial contained in Section 13.16. Borrower
      further acknowledges that it is experienced with respect to financial and
      credit matters and has made its own independent decisions to apply to
      Lenders for credit and to execute and deliver this Agreement.
