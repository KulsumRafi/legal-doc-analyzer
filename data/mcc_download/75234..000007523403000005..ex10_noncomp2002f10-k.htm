<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Hiner
acknowledges that in the course of his employment with OWENS CORNING he
          acquired confidential and proprietary information regarding OWENS CORNING&#146;S
          operations, assets, liabilities, businesses and practices, and Hiner
understands           and agrees that he (a) will keep such information including all
OWENS CORNING           files, information, and materials confidential at all times; (b)
will not           disclose or communicate such OWENS CORNING information to any person
or persons           unless first authorized in writing by OWENS CORNING; and (c) will
not make use           of such information on his own behalf or on the behalf of any
other person,           persons or entities unless he first obtains authorization from
OWENS CORNING in           writing. In view of the nature of Hiner&#146;s employment and
the nature of the           OWENS CORNING&#146;S information that Hiner has received and
generated during           the course of his employment, Hiner agrees that any
unauthorized disclosure to           any person or persons of such OWENS CORNING
information would cause irreparable           damage to OWENS CORNING, and therefore,
OWENS CORNING shall be entitled to seek           an appropriate injunction and legal
remedies in a court of appropriate           jurisdiction. If required by operation of
law to disclose any such information,           or in the course of defense or
prosecution of any action, Hiner may do so           provided that he first notifies
OWENS CORNING&#146;S General Counsel, in writing           via fax and U.S. mail, within
24 hours of his receipt of the underlying court           order/subpoena (enclosing
same), in order to provide OWENS CORNING with the           opportunity to respond to
said subpoena/court order.  </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Hiner
agrees that during the remainder of his employment and for a period of           five (5)
years thereafter, he will not, directly or indirectly, engage in, be           engaged by
(including engagement for consulting or advising), provide services           for or have
any interest in, any other person, firm, corporation or entity which           conducts
any activity competitive with the business of OWENS CORNING; provided           however,
that nothing contained herein shall restrict Hiner from owning 1% or           less of
the corporate securities of any competitor of the Company where these
          securities are listed on any national securities exchange or traded actively in
          the national over-the-counter market. Hiner further agrees that he will not at
          any time engage in any form of conduct, or make any statements or
          representations, that disparage or otherwise impair the reputation, goodwill or
          business interests of OWENS CORNING, its management, directors or officers.  </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Hiner
recognizes the broad scope of the foregoing covenants, but expressly           agrees
that they are reasonable in light of the worldwide scope of the business
          conducted by OWENS CORNING. If any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
          shall refuse to enforce the foregoing covenants because the time limit
          applicable thereto is deemed unreasonable, it is expressly understood and
agreed           that such covenants shall not be void, but that for the purpose of such
          proceedings and in such jurisdictions such time limitation shall be deemed to
be           reduced to the extent necessary to permit enforcement of the covenants. If
any           court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall refuse to enforce any or
all           of the foregoing covenants because they are more extensive (whether as to
          geography, the scope of business or otherwise) than is deemed reasonable, it is
          expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that such covenants
          shall not be void, but that for the purpose of such proceedings and in such
          jurisdictions, the restrictions contained herein (whether as to geography, the
          scope of business or otherwise) shall be deemed to be reduced to the extent
          necessary to permit enforcement of the covenants.  </FONT></P>

acknowledges and agrees that he has had adequate time to read and review           this
Agreement, and was advised to consult with legal counsel. Hiner           acknowledges
