the Board of Directors ("Board").The Board shall have full power and authority to construe, interpret and administer this Plan and to make determinations which shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon all persons, including without limitation, the Bank, the stockholders, the directors, and any persons having any interest in any options which may be granted under this Plan. </FONT></P>

<U>April&nbsp;14</U>, 1997, and it shall be generally effective as of said date, subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Bank at its next regularly scheduled
