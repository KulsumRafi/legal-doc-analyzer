additional Interest Period after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default. Each Notice of Revolving Loan Interest Period Selection shall be given by
first-class mail or facsimile to the office or the facsimile number specified in <u>Section&nbsp;8.01</u>.
The Borrower may provide the Administrative Agent with telephonic notice of its intention
to submit a Notice of Revolving Loan Interest Period Selection; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that no Notice of Revolving Loan Interest Period Selection shall be deemed effective until
received by first-class mail or facsimile in accordance with the immediately preceding

shall automatically convert to Base Rate Loan(s) on the last day of the current Interest
Period therefor unless such LIBOR Loan(s) are repaid as provided herein.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Scheduled

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Extension
of Maturity Date</u>. On or before the last Business Day which is six (6) months prior to
the three-year anniversary date of this Agreement, the Borrower may, provided that no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, request that the
Lenders extend the Maturity Date for one, but only one, additional one-year period. The
Borrower shall request such extension by appropriately completing, executing and
delivering to the Administrative Agent a written request in the form of <u>Exhibit K</u>
(an &quot;<u>Extension Request</u>&quot;) and attaching thereto updated Projections of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries for such one-year period. The Borrower understands that this
<u>Section 2.01(h)</u> is included in this Agreement for the Borrower&#146;s convenience
in requesting an extension and acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any
other Lender has promised (either expressly or implicitly), or has any obligation or
commitment, to extend the Maturity Date at any time. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly mail to each Lender three (3) copies of the Extension Request received by the
Administrative Agent. If a Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, consents to any
Extension Request, such Lender shall evidence such consent by executing and returning two
(2) copies of the Extension Request to the Administrative Agent not later than the last
Business Day which is five (5) months prior to the Maturity Date. Any failure by any
Lender so to execute and return an Extension Request shall be deemed a denial thereof. If
the Borrower delivers an Extension Request to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
first sentence of this <u>Section 2.01(h)</u>, then not later than the last Business Day
which is four (4) months prior to the Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower in writing whether (i) the Administrative Agent has received a copy of the
Extension Request executed by each Lender, in which case the definition of &quot;Maturity
Date&quot; set forth in <u>Section 1.01</u> shall be deemed extended for a period of one
year as of the date of such written notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower,
or (ii) the Administrative Agent has not received a copy of the Extension Request executed
by each Lender, in which case such Extension Request shall be deemed denied. The
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, with each written notice under clause
(i) of the preceding sentence which notifies the Borrower that the Administrative Agent
has received an Extension Request executed by each Lender, a copy of the Extension Request
so executed by each Lender.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If less than all the Lenders shall
agree to such Extension Request, the extension contemplated in this <u>Section 2.01(h)</u>
may nonetheless occur with respect to the consenting Lenders; provided that any such
extension shall be conditioned upon (x) payment in full to each Lender not extending (each
a &quot;<u>Non-Continuing Lender</u>&quot;) of all amounts owing to such Lender with
respect to its Commitment and its Proportionate Share of any outstanding Revolving Loans
and L/C Obligations, (y) termination (or assumption) of such Lender&#146;s Commitment, and
(z) the exact aggregate amount (the &quot;<u>Deficiency</u>&quot;) of then existing
Commitments for each Non-Continuing Lender shall be accounted for in any one or any
combination of the following: (i) an increase in the Commitment of one or more Lenders
party to this Agreement (each such Lender increasing its Commitment, an &quot;<u>Increasing
Lender</u>&quot;) pursuant to a Commitment Increase Agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel (a &quot;<u>Commitment Increase
Agreement</u>&quot;) and as more fully described below, (ii) the addition of one or more
Assignee Lenders as a party to this Agreement, in each case pursuant to an Assignment
Agreement as set forth in <u>Section 8.05(c)</u> and as more fully described below, and/or
(iii) the Commitments shall be reduced by an amount equal to that portion of the
Deficiency not otherwise accounted for pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, effective as
of the Increased Commitment Date (as defined below). The Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower and each of the Lenders as to the new Maturity Date or that such extension
shall not occur, as the case may be. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of any such
extension is further subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) in the
case of a Commitment increase by an Increasing Lender, that the Borrower and such
Increasing Lender shall have entered into a Commitment Increase Agreement, and such
Commitment Increase Agreement shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent; (ii)
in the case of an accession hereto by an Assignee Lender, that the parties thereto shall
have entered into an Assignment Agreement, and such Assignment Agreement shall have been
delivered to the Administrative Agent; and (iii) that any fees and other amounts payable
to any Increasing Lender or Assignee Lender in connection with such increase or accession
shall have been paid. Upon the effectiveness of any Commitment Increase Agreement, the
Commitment(s), the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Increasing Lender&#146;s
Proportionate Share of Revolving Loans and the L/C Obligations be increased in the amount
set forth in the Commitment Increase Agreement, and upon the effectiveness of any
Assignment Agreement, the Assignee Lender party thereto shall be and become a party hereto
and shall constitute a Lender hereunder with the rights and obligations of a Lender under
the Credit Documents (each such date of effectiveness, an &quot;<u>Increased Commitment
Date</u>&quot;). Effective on each Increased Commitment Date, the Proportionate Shares of
Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations then existing and held by each Lender shall be
adjusted to reflect any such changes in such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share. Each
Non-Continuing Lender having Revolving Loans or L/C Obligations or a Commitment then
outstanding shall be deemed to have assigned, without recourse, to any Increasing Lenders
increasing their Commitments and any Assignee Lenders, such Non-Continuing Lender&#146;s
Proportionate Share of such outstanding Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations and Commitment
as shall be necessary to effectuate such adjustment. Each Increasing Lender and Assignee
Lender shall be deemed to have assumed such Proportionate Share of Revolving Loans and L/C
Obligations and Commitment. Additionally, promptly following the Increased Commitment Date
for a Commitment increase, the Administrative Agent shall cause <u>Schedule I</u> to be
modified to accurately reflect the Commitments and Proportionate Shares of the Lenders,
whereupon such amended <u>Schedule I</u> shall be substituted for the pre-existing <u>Schedule
I</u>, be deemed a part of this Agreement without any further action or consent of any
party and be promptly distributed to each Lender and the Borrower by the Administrative
Agent. Additionally, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Increasing Lender
and Assingee Lender of the amount of any funding obligations under this <u>Section 2.01(h)</u>.

subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower&#146;s ability to obtain Letters
of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing
period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that
have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Prior Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have
been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and

not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the
L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the
Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form
of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, at least three Business
Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in
its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case
may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such
Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to
the L/C Issuer: (A)&nbsp;the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit
(which date shall be a Business Day); (B)&nbsp;the amount thereof; (C)&nbsp;the expiry
date thereof; (D)&nbsp;the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E)&nbsp;the
documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder;
(F)&nbsp;the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of
any drawing thereunder; and (G)&nbsp;such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably
require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit,
such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory
to the L/C Issuer (A)&nbsp;the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B)&nbsp;the proposed date
of amendment thereof (which date shall be a Business Day); (C)&nbsp;the nature of the
proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly
after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has
received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the
L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the
L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or
amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may
be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer&#146;s usual and customary business
practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be
deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C
Issuer a participation in such Letter of Credit and any related L/C Obligations and L/C
Borrowings in an amount equal to the product of such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share <u>times</u>
the amount of such Letter of Credit.</font></p>

the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer
shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an
&quot;<u>Evergreen Letter of Credit</u>&quot;); <u>provided</u> that any such Evergreen
Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in
each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit)
by giving notice to the beneficiary thereof and the Borrower on a date (the &quot;<u>Nonrenewal
Notice Date</u>&quot;) that is not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of such
twelve-month period. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not
be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such renewal. Once an
Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized
(but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any
time to a date not later than the Maturity Date; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the
L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A)&nbsp;the L/C Issuer would have no
obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms
hereof, or (B)&nbsp;it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or
before the Business Day immediately preceding the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1)&nbsp;from the
Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or
(2)&nbsp;from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the
applicable conditions specified in <u>Section 3.02</u> is not then satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the L/C Issuer shall have no
obligation to permit the renewal of any Evergreen Letter of Credit at any time.</font></p>

after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an
advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such
Letter of Credit or amendment.</font></p>

any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of the amount to be paid by the L/C Issuer as a result of such
drawing and the date on which payment is to be made by the L/C Issuer to the beneficiary
of such Letter of Credit in respect of such drawing. Not later than 12:00 noon, on the
date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an &quot;<u>Honor
Date</u>&quot;), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative
Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so
reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the &quot;<u>Unreimbursed
Amount</u>&quot;), and such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share thereof. In such event, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without
regard to the minimum and multiples specified in <u>Section 2.01</u> for the principal
amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the
Total Commitment and the conditions set forth in <u>Section 3.02</u> (other than the
delivery of a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or
the Administrative Agent pursuant to this <u>Section 2.02(c)(i)</u> may be given by
telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; <u>provided</u>, that the lack of such an
immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such
notice.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to <u>Section
2.02(c)(i)</u> make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer at the Administrative Agent&#146;s Office in an amount equal to its Proportionate
Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in
such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of <u>Section&nbsp;2.02(c)(iii)</u>,
each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to
the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to
the L/C Issuer.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Loan
Borrowing because the conditions set forth in <u>Section 3.02</u> cannot be satisfied or
for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an
L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which
L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear
interest at the rate applicable to Revolving Loans upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default. In such event, each Lender&#146;s payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to <u>Section 2.02(c)(ii)</u>
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation
under this <u>Section&nbsp;2.02</u>.</font></p>

to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in
respect of such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share of such amount shall be solely for the
account of the L/C Issuer.</font></p>

Lender&#146;s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C
Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this <u>Section
2.02(c)</u>, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (A)&nbsp;any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person
for any reason whatsoever; (B)&nbsp;the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of
Default, or (C)&nbsp;any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to
any of the foregoing. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made
by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.</font></p>

any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this <u>Section 2.02(c)</u> by the time specified in <u>Section 2.02(c)(ii)</u>, the
L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from
the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time
to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the
Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.</font></p>

account of the L/C Issuer any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly
from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by
the Administrative Agent), or any payment of interest thereon, the Administrative Agent
will distribute to such Lender its Proportionate Share thereof in the same funds as those
received by the Administrative Agent.</font></p>

any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
pursuant to <u>Section 2.02(c)(i)</u> is required to be returned, each Lender shall pay to

on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand

unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of

of L/C Issuer</u>. Each of the Borrower and the Lenders agrees that, in paying any drawing
under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any
document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the
Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such
document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor the L/C Issuer nor any of their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors nor any of the correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i)&nbsp;any
action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the
Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii)&nbsp;any action taken or omitted in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii)&nbsp;the due execution,
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any
Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assume all risks of
the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that this assumption is not intended
to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower&#146;s pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor the L/C Issuer nor any of their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors nor any of the
correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible
for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (xiii) of <u>Section 2.02(e)</u>; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the
Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves
were caused by the L/C Issuer&#146;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C
Issuer&#146;s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to
it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order,
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information
to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or
assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.</font></p>

Collateral and Back-Up Letters of Credit</u>. Upon the request of the Administrative
Agent, (i)&nbsp;if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under
any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing that has not been
repaid as provided herein, or (ii)&nbsp;if, as of the Maturity Date, any Letter of Credit
may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
promptly (x) Cash Collateralize the Obligations in an amount equal to 103% of the then
Effective Amount of the L/C Obligations, or (y) obtain a letter of credit (a &quot;<u>Back-Up
Letter of Credit</u>&quot;) issued for the benefit of the L/C Issuer by a bank or other
financial institution acceptable to the L/C Issuer in its sole but reasonable discretion
in an amount at least equal to the Effective Amount of the L/C Obligations. The Borrower
hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders, a Lien on all cash and deposit account balances described in the definition of
&quot;Cash Collateralize&quot; as security for the Obligations. Cash collateral shall be
maintained in blocked deposit accounts at Wells Fargo or other institutions reasonably
satisfactory to it. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits
pursuant to the immediately succeeding sentence, which investments shall be made at the
risk and expense of the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest. If requested in
writing by the Borrower at the time cash collateral is delivered to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this <u>Section 2.02(g)</u>, such cash collateral shall be invested by
the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, in Cash Equivalents and applied by
the Administrative Agent to reimburse the L/C Issuer for L/C Borrowings for which it has
not been reimbursed. The Lien held by the Administrative Agent in such cash collateral to
secure the Obligations shall be released, or the Back-up Letter of Credit shall be
terminated, as applicable, upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:
(a)&nbsp;no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding as of the Maturity Date, (b)&nbsp;all
L/C Obligations shall have been repaid in full and (c)&nbsp;no Default shall have occurred
and be continuing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Applicability
of ISP98</u>. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a
Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter
of Credit), the rules of the &quot;International Standby Practices 1998&quot; published by

Swing Line</u>. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Swing
Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a &quot;<u>Swing Line Loan</u>&quot;) in
Dollars to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Closing Date to the Maturity Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such
Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Effective Amount of Revolving Loans of the
Swing Line Lender in its capacity as a Lender of Revolving Loans, may exceed the amount of
such Lender&#146;s Commitment; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that after giving effect
to any Swing Line Loan, (i)&nbsp;the aggregate Effective Amount of all Revolving Loans,
Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing
shall not exceed the Total Commitment on such date, and (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate Effective
Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, <u>plus</u> such Lender&#146;s Proportionate
Share of the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations, <u>plus</u> such Lender&#146;s
Proportionate Share of the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such
Lender&#146;s Commitment, and <u>provided</u> <u>further</u>, that the Swing Line Lender
shall not make any Swing Line Loan to refinance an outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may
borrow under this <u>Section&nbsp;2.03</u>, prepay under <u>Section 2.06</u>, and reborrow
under this <u>Section 2.03</u>. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.
Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a
risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such
Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share <u>times</u> the amount of such Swing Line Loan.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Borrowing
Procedures</u>. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower&#146;s
irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be
given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00&nbsp;a.m., on the requested borrowing date, and
shall specify (i)&nbsp;the amount to be borrowed, which amount shall be a minimum of
$100,000, and (ii)&nbsp;the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each
such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and
the Administrative Agent of a written Notice of Swing Line Borrowing, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by
the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Notice of Swing Line Borrowing, the Swing Line
Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
Administrative Agent has also received such Notice of Swing Line Borrowing and, if not,
the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of
the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in
writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to
12:00&nbsp;noon, on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A)&nbsp;directing the
Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set
forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of <u>Section 2.03(a)</u>, or
(B)&nbsp;that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in <u>Section&nbsp;3.02</u>
is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line
Lender will, not later than 2:00&nbsp;p.m., on the borrowing date specified in such Notice
of Swing Line Borrowing, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower
at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swing Line
Lender in immediately available funds.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans exceeds $500,000 on ten (10)
consecutive Business Days, then on the next Business Day (unless<b> </b>the Borrower has
repaid the Swing Line Loans as provided herein or made other arrangements acceptable to
the Swing Line Lender to reduce the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans below
$500,000), the Borrower shall request a Revolving Loan Borrowing pursuant to <u>Section
2.01(b)</u> sufficient to reduce the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans below
$500,000. In addition, upon any demand for payment of the Effective Amount of all Swing
Line Loans by the Swing Line Lender (unless the Borrower has repaid the Swing Line Loans
as provided herein or made other arrangements acceptable to the Swing Line Lender to
reduce the Effective Amount of the Swing Line Loans to $0), the Borrower shall request a
Revolving Loan Borrowing pursuant to <u>Section 2.01(b)</u> sufficient to repay all Swing
Line Loans (and, for this purpose, <u>Section 2.01(b)(i)</u> shall not apply). In each
case, the Administrative Agent shall automatically provide the proceeds of the responsive
Revolving Loans made by each Lender to the Swing Line Lender (which the Swing Line Lender
shall then apply to the Effective Amount of the Swing Line Loans). In the event that the
Borrower fails to request a Revolving Loan Borrowing within the time specified by <u>Section
2.01(b)</u> on any such date, the Administrative Agent may, but is not required to,
without notice to or the consent of the Borrower, cause Base Rate Loans to be made by the
Lenders in amounts which are sufficient to reduce the Effective Amount of the Swing Line
Loans as required above. The proceeds of such Base Rate Loans shall be paid directly to
the Swing Line Lender for application to the Effective Amount of the Swing Line Loans.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
for any reason any Revolving Loan Borrowing cannot be requested in accordance with <u>Section
2.03(c)(i)</u> or any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Loan
Borrowing, the Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing submitted by the Swing Line Lender shall
be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its
participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender&#146;s payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to <u>Section
2.03(c)(i)</u> shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from
the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any
Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Lender&#146;s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund participations in
Swing Line Loans pursuant to this <u>Section 2.03(c)</u> shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A)&nbsp;any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever,
(B)&nbsp;the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, or (C)&nbsp;any
other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. Any
such purchase of participations shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.</font></p>

any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a participation in a Swing Line Loan,
if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the
Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Proportionate Share of such payment
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time
during which such Lender&#146;s participation was outstanding and funded) in the same
funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any
Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender, each Lender shall pay
to the Swing Line Lender its Proportionate Share thereof on demand of the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent
will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Interest
for Account of Swing Line Lender</u>. Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate <i>per
annum</i> equal to the Base Rate <u>plus</u> the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans.
The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the
Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or participation pursuant to
this <u>Section&nbsp;2.03</u> to refinance such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share of any
Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Proportionate Share shall be solely for the
account of the Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Swing Line Loan at the end of each month, upon prepayment (to the
extent thereof) and at maturity.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Repayment

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Payments
in Respect of Swing Line Loans</u>. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and
interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Administrative Agent, who will
then, in turn, distribute such amounts to the Swing Line Lender in accordance with <u>Section
2.09(a)(ii)</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided
that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon written notice to
the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), and subject to <u>Section
2.04(b)(iii)</u> below, the Borrower may (A) at any time prior to the Maturity Date,
request an increase in the Total Commitment up to an aggregate amount of One Hundred Ten
Million Dollars ($110,000,000) and (B) on a one-time basis, at any time after an increase
pursuant to <u>subclause (A)</u> of this <u>clause (i)</u> and prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, request an increase in the Total Commitment up to an
aggregate amount of One Hundred Thirty Five Million Dollars ($135,000,000). At the time of
sending such written notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent)
shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which
shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such
notice to the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time
period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an
amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Proportionate Share of such requested
increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have
declined to increase its Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
and each Lender of the Lenders&#146; responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve
the full amount of a requested increase, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible
Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.</font></p>

the Total Commitment is increased in accordance with this <u>Section 2.04(b)</u>, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the &quot;<u>Increase
Effective Date</u>&quot;) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such
increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated
as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a
Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions
adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and, (ii) in the case
of the Borrower, including a Compliance Certificate demonstrating <i>pro forma</i>
compliance with the financial covenants contained in <u>Section 5.03</u> after giving
effect to such increase and (iii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such
increase, the representations and warranties contained in <u>Section 4.01</u> are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date (except for
representations and warranties expressly made as of a specified date, which shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of such date) and no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower shall deliver new or amended Revolving Loan
Notes reflecting the increased Commitment of any Lender holding or requesting a Revolving
Loan Note. The Administrative Agent shall distribute an amended <u>Schedule I</u> (which
shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement), to reflect any changes therein
resulting from such increase. The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on
the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to <u>Section
2.13</u>) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any
revised Proportionate Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments
hereunder.</font></p>

the Borrower shall amend, or cause to be amended, each Leasehold Mortgage that contains a
provision stating that the maximum amount secured thereunder is less than the amount of
such increased Total Commitment to reflect in such Leasehold Mortgage the increase in the
Total Commitment and the Revolving Loan Notes; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the
Borrower shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a

the Total Commitment may not be increased or reinstated without the prior written consent
of all Lenders. Any reduction of the Total Commitment pursuant to <u>Section 2.04(c), (d)

at any time the aggregate cumulative amount of Designated Asset Sale Proceeds exceeds
$10,000,000 in any Fiscal Year, the Borrower shall, promptly after the receipt of

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Payment Terms</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Place
and Manner</u>. All payments to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other

defense, recoupment or setoff. The Borrower shall make all payments due to each Lender or
the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Credit Document by payments to
the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent&#146;s office located at the address
specified in <u>Section 8.01</u>, with each payment due to a Lender to be for the account
of such Lender and such Lender&#146;s Applicable Lending Office. The Borrower shall make
all payments under this Agreement or any other Credit Document in lawful money of the
United States of America and in same day or immediately available funds not later than
12:00 noon on the date due. The Administrative Agent shall promptly disburse to each
Lender each payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Date</u>.
Whenever any payment due hereunder shall fall due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time
shall be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Late
Payments</u>. If any amount required to be paid by the Borrower under this Agreement or
the other Credit Documents (including principal or interest payable on any Loan, any L/C
Borrowing, any fee or other amount) remains unpaid after such amount is due, the Borrower
shall pay interest on the aggregate, outstanding balance of such amount from the date due
until such amount is paid in full at a <i>per annum</i> rate (such rate, the &quot;<u>Late
Fee Rate</u>&quot;) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans
plus two percent (2.00%), such rate to change from time to time as the Base Rate shall
change; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that nothing in this <u>Section 2.07(c)</u> shall
require the Borrower to pay interest at the Late Fee Rate while the Borrower is otherwise
paying interest at two percent (2.00%) above the Applicable Margin as a result of the
continuation of an Event of Default and as set forth in the definition of &quot;Applicable
Margin&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Application
of Payments</u>. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied first to unpaid fees, costs and
expenses then due and payable under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, second
to accrued interest then due and payable under this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents and finally to reduce the principal amount of outstanding Swing Line Loans,
Revolving Loans and L/C Borrowings.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Failure
to Pay the Administrative Agent</u>. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in
full, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the Borrower has made or
will make such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be paid to the
Lenders on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lenders. If and to
the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at a <i>per annum</i> rate equal to (i)&nbsp;the
Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days and (ii)&nbsp;the rate applicable to Base
Rate Loans thereafter. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender
with respect to any amount owing by such Lender under this <u>Section 2.07(e)</u> shall
constitute <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such amount.</font></p>

and to pay interest thereon at the rates provided herein shall be evidenced by an account
or accounts maintained by such Lender on its books (individually, a &quot;<u>Loan Account</u>&quot;),
except that any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a note or notes pursuant
to <u>Section 2.08(b)</u> and <u>Section 2.08(c)</u>. Each Lender shall record in its Loan
Accounts (i)&nbsp;the date and amount of each Loan made by such Lender, (ii)&nbsp;the
interest rates applicable to each such Loan and the effective dates of all changes
thereto, (iii)&nbsp;the Interest Period for each LIBOR Loan, (iv)&nbsp;the date and amount
of each principal and interest payment on each Loan and (v)&nbsp;such other information as
such Lender may determine is necessary for the computation of principal and interest
payable to it by the Borrower hereunder; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that any failure
by a Lender to make, or any error by any Lender in making, any such notation shall not
affect the Borrower&#146;s Obligations. The Loan Accounts shall constitute <i>prima facie</i>
evidence of the matters noted therein (in the absence of manifest error). In addition to
the Loan Accounts, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the
accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of
the Administrative Agent shall control.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Revolving
Loan Notes</u>. If any Lender so requests, such Lender&#146;s Revolving Loans shall be
evidenced by a promissory note in the form of <u>Exhibit&nbsp;E</u> (individually, a
&quot;<u>Revolving Loan Note</u>&quot;) which note shall be (i)&nbsp;payable to the order
of such Lender, (ii)&nbsp;in the amount of such Lender&#146;s Commitment, (iii)&nbsp;dated
the Closing Date and (iv)&nbsp;otherwise appropriately completed. The Borrower authorizes
each Lender to record on the schedule annexed to such Lender&#146;s Revolving Loan Note
the date and amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Lender and of each payment or
prepayment of principal thereon made by the Borrower, and agrees that all such notations
shall constitute <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters noted (in the absence of
manifest error); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that any failure by a Lender to make, or
any error by any Lender in making, any such notation shall not affect the Borrower&#146;s
Obligations. The Borrower further authorizes each Lender to attach to and make a part of
such Lender&#146;s Revolving Loan Note continuations of the schedule attached thereto as
necessary.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Swing

promissory note in the form of <u>Exhibit&nbsp;F</u> (individually, a &quot;<u>Swing Line
Note</u>&quot;) which note shall be (i)&nbsp;payable to the order of the Swing Line
Lender, (ii)&nbsp;in the principal amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, (iii)&nbsp;dated the

date of each Revolving Loan Borrowing, make available to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent&#146;s office specified in <u>Section 8.01</u>, in same day or
immediately available funds, such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share of such Revolving Loan
Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent&#146;s receipt of such funds and upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in <u>Section 3.02</u> (and, if such
Revolving Loan Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, <u>Section 3.01</u>), the
Administrative Agent shall promptly make all funds so received available to the Borrower
in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i)&nbsp;crediting the
account of the Borrower on the books of Wells Fargo with the amount of such funds or
(ii)&nbsp;wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions
provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that if, on the date of the Revolving Loan Borrowing there are Swing Line Loans and/or L/C
Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be
applied, <u>first</u>, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, <u>second</u>,
to the payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and <u>third</u>, to the Borrower as
provided above.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Lender
Failure to Fund</u>. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Revolving Loan Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share of such
Revolving Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that such
Lender has made or will make such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the
date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing in accordance with <u>Section 2.09(a)</u>, and the
Administrative Agent may on such date, in reliance upon such assumption, disburse or
otherwise credit to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If any Lender does not make the
amount of its such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share of any Revolving Loan Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such Revolving Loan
Borrowing, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, interest which
shall accrue on such amount from the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing until such
amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at rates equal to (i)&nbsp;the daily Federal
Funds Rate during the period from the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing through the
third Business Day thereafter and (ii)&nbsp;the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
thereafter. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect
to any amount owing by such Lender under this <u>Section 2.09(b)</u> shall constitute <i>prima
facie</i> evidence of such amount. If the amount of any Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share
of any Revolving Loan Borrowing is not paid to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within three (3) Business Days after the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, the
Borrower shall repay such amount to the Administrative Agent, on demand, together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was disbursed to the Borrower
until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Lenders&#146;

part of any Revolving Loan Borrowing or to fund participations in Letters of Credit and
Swing Line Loans shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make
its Loan as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing or fund its participations in Letters of
Credit and Swing Line Loans, but no Lender shall be obligated in any way to make any Loan
or fund any participation in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans which another Lender
has failed or refused to make or otherwise be in any way responsible for the failure or
refusal of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender on
the date of any Revolving Loan Borrowing or to fund any participation required to be
funded by such other Lender.</font></p>

among the Lenders (except for Defaulting Lenders) <i>pro rata</i> according to

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Sharing
of Payments, Etc</u>. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the
Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by
it, in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans and the L/C
Obligations obtained by all Lenders entitled to such payments, such Lender shall forthwith
purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans and/or participations in
L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an
amount equal to such other Lender&#146;s ratable share (according to the proportion of
(i)&nbsp;the amount of such other Lender&#146;s required repayment to (ii)&nbsp;the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this <u>Section
2.10(b)</u> may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.</font></p>

giving of any such notice and until the Administrative Agent shall otherwise notify the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such condition no longer exist,
Borrower&#146;s right to request the making of, conversion to or a new Interest Period for
LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. Any LIBOR Loans outstanding at the commencement of any

Governmental Rule by any Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental
Authority (a &quot;<u>Change of Law</u>&quot;) shall make it unlawful or impossible for
any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan, such Lender shall immediately notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such Change of Law. Upon receipt of such notice,

that otherwise constitute taxes shall be without duplication of amounts that the Borrower
is otherwise required to pay such Lender pursuant to <u>Section 2.12(a)</u>. The
obligations of the Borrower under this <u>Section 2.11(c)</u> shall survive the payment
and performance of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. </font></p>

Requirements</u>. If, after the date of this Agreement, any Lender determines that
(i)&nbsp;any Change of Law affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender (a &quot;<u>Capital
Adequacy Requirement</u>&quot;) and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of capital maintained by such
Lender or such Person which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Letters of
Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement must be increased as a result of such Capital
Adequacy Requirement (taking into account such Lender&#146;s or such Person&#146;s
policies with respect to capital adequacy), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such
Person, within five (5) Business Days after the Borrower receives the certificate referred
to in the following sentence from such Lender, such amounts as such Lender or such Person
shall determine are necessary to compensate such Lender or such Person for the increased
costs to such Lender or such Person of such increased capital. A certificate setting forth
in reasonable detail the amount of such increased costs, submitted by any Lender to the
Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error; <u>provided</u>, that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this <u>Section 2.11(d)</u> for
any increased costs unless the Borrower receives such a certificate within 180 days after
such costs are incurred or realized. The obligations of the Borrower under this <u>Section
2.11(d)</u> shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.</font></p>

Any Lender which becomes aware of (i)&nbsp;any Change of Law which will make it unlawful
or impossible for such Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan or (ii)&nbsp;any Change
of Law or other event or condition which will obligate the Borrower to pay any amount
pursuant to <u>Section 2.11(c)</u> or <u>Section 2.11(d)</u> shall notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent thereof as promptly as practical. If any Lender has given notice
of any such Change of Law or other event or condition and thereafter becomes aware that
such Change of Law or other event or condition has ceased to exist, such Lender shall
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof as promptly as practical. Each
Lender affected by any Change of Law which makes it unlawful or impossible for such Lender
to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan or to which the Borrower is obligated to pay any amount
pursuant to <u>Section 2.11(c)</u> or <u>Section 2.11(d)</u> shall use reasonable
commercial efforts (including changing the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office
or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
Affiliates) to avoid the effect of such Change of Law or to avoid or materially reduce any
amounts which the Borrower is obligated to pay pursuant to <u>Section&nbsp;2.11(c)</u> or <u>Section
2.11(d)</u> if, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender, such efforts would not be
disadvantageous to such Lender or contrary to such Lender&#146;s normal banking practices.</font></p>

Free of Taxes</u>. Except as otherwise provided in this <u>Section 2.12</u>, all payments
made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present
or future income, stamp, documentary or other taxes, any duties, or any other levies,
imposts, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (except net income taxes,
franchise taxes and taxes on capital in lieu of net income taxes (other than taxes in the
nature of withholding taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender by its
jurisdiction of incorporation or the jurisdiction in which its Applicable Lending Office
is located or in which it is otherwise doing business or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein (other than a jurisdiction in which it is deemed to be
doing business solely as a result of its having executed, delivered or performed its
obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, any Credit Document)) (all such
non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, charges, fees, deductions and withholdings
being hereinafter called &quot;<u>Taxes</u>&quot;). If any Taxes are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or
under the other Credit Documents, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative
Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts
payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the Borrower shall not be required
to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent with
respect to any taxes (i) that result from such Lender&#146;s or the Administrative
Agent&#146;s failure to comply with the requirements of <u>Section 2.12(b)</u>, gross
negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) imposed at the time the Person becomes a party to
this Agreement, or in the case of an Assignment, designation of a new Applicable Lending
Office (other than pursuant to <u>Sections 2.11(e) or 2.12(c)</u>), or appointment of a
successor Administrative Agent, the effective date thereof, except to the extent such
Person&#146;s predecessor in interest (or the Lender&#146;s prior Applicable Lending
Office, as the case may be) was entitled to such amounts. Whenever any Taxes are payable
by the Borrower, as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case
may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing
payment thereof. Subject to <u>Section 2.12(b)</u>, if the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent
the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent and the relevant Lender(s) for any Taxes, interest or penalties
that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of any such
failure. The indemnification provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be made
within 30 days after the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as the case may be,
makes written demand for it. Such written demand shall include a certificate setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amount. Such certificate shall be
presumed to be correct in the absence of manifest error. The obligations of the Borrower
under this <u>Section 2.12(a)</u> shall survive the payment and performance of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Withholding
Exemption Certificates</u>. On or prior to (i) the date of the initial Borrowing or
issuance of a Letter of Credit or, if such date does not occur within thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement, by the end of such 30-day period, or (ii) in the case of
a designation of a new lending office (other than pursuant to <u>Section 2.12(c)</u> or <u>Section
2.11(e)</u>) or appointment of a successor Administrative Agent, the effective date
thereof, each Lender and successor Administrative Agent which is not organized under the
laws of the United States or a state thereof shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent as appropriate two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (and/or other applicable forms or certifications),
as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Person is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and other Credit Documents without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes. Each such Person further agrees to promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as appropriate) of any change of
circumstances (including any change in any treaty, law or regulation) which would prevent
such Person from receiving payments hereunder without any deduction or withholding of such
taxes. On or before the date that any certificate or other form delivered by such Person
under this <u>Section 2.12(b)</u> expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent such certificate or form
previously delivered by such Person, such Person Agrees (to the extent it is entitled to
do so) to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as appropriate) a new
certificate or form, certifying that such Person is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of such Taxes or subject to withholding of
Taxes at a reduced rate. Each Lender, Assignee Lender and Administrative Agent that is a
United States person, as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the IRC (other than Persons
that the Borrower may treat as otherwise exempt from United States backup withholding
tax), shall deliver at the time(s) and in the manner(s) described above with respect to
the other forms, to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as applicable), properly
completed and duly executed United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and/or other
forms and certification, certifying that such Person is exempt from United States backup
withholding tax on payments made hereunder. If any such Person fails to provide to the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as appropriate) pursuant to this <u>Section 2.12(b)</u>
(or, in the case of an Assignee Lender, <u>Section 8.05(c)</u>) any certificates or other
evidence required by such provision to establish that such is Person, at the time it
becomes a Lender, Assignee Lender or successor Administrative Agent hereunder, entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes, such Person shall not be entitled to any indemnification
under <u>Section 2.12(a)</u> for any Taxes imposed on such Person primarily as a result of
such failure.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Mitigation</u>.
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender claims any additional amounts to be payable to
it pursuant to this <u>Section 2.12</u>, such Person shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to file any certificate or document requested in writing by the Borrower
(including copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or other applicable
forms and certifications) (but only to the extent it is legally entitled and eligible to
furnish such forms and certifications) reflecting a reduced rate of withholding or to
change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a filing or
such change in the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office would avoid the need for
or materially reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue
and if, in the reasonable opinion of such Person, in the case of a change in the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office, such change would not be disadvantageous to
such Person or contrary to such Person&#146;s normal banking practices; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and any Lender for any cost in
complying with the obligations under this <u>Section 2.12(c)</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Payments
on After-Tax Basis</u>. Any payment that the Borrower shall be required to make to or for
the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any Tax that is
subject to indemnification under this <u>Section 2.12</u> shall be paid on an After-Tax
Basis. If the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, shall actually
realize any saving (as determined in its good faith discretion) of any Tax (by way of
credit (including any foreign tax credit), deduction, exclusion from income or otherwise)
by reason of any amount with respect to which the Borrower has indemnified such Person
pursuant to this <u>Section 2.12</u>, and such Tax saving was not taken into account in
determining the amount payable by the Borrower on account of such indemnification, such
Person shall pay to the Borrower, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, within 30 days after such Person shall have actually realized such Tax
saving, the amount of such saving (minus any detriment), together with the amount of any
Tax saving resulting from any payment pursuant to this sentence; <u>provided</u> that the
Borrower shall not be entitled to receive an amount in excess of all amounts previously
paid by the Borrower pursuant to this <u>Section 2.12</u>, to such Person (less the
aggregate amount of all prior payments by such Person to the Borrower under this <u>Section
2.12(d)</u>) (but any excess amount described in this proviso shall reduce pro tanto any
amount that the Borrower is subsequently obligated to pay to such Person pursuant to this <u>Section
2.12</u>), and <u>provided further</u> that any amount otherwise due to the Borrower
pursuant to this sentence shall not be paid to the extent of any payment or indemnity then
due and owing from the Borrower to such Person (and any amount not so paid shall become
payable at such time and to such extent as the Borrower shall have made such payments). If
it is later determined that the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as
applicable, was not entitled to such Tax saving, the portion of such tax saving that is
repaid, recaptured or disallowed will be treated as Taxes for which the Borrower must
indemnify pursuant to this <u>Section 2.12</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, shall have sole control over
positions taken with respect to its tax returns and filings.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Tax
Returns</u>. Nothing contained in this <u>Section 2.12</u> shall require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available any of its tax returns (or any other
information relating to its taxes which it deems to be confidential).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Funding
Loss Indemnification</u>. (a) Upon payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Loan on a day other
than the last day in the applicable Interest Period (whether voluntarily, involuntarily,
by reason of acceleration, or otherwise), or upon the failure of the Borrower (for a
reason other than the breach by a Lender of its obligation pursuant to <u>Section&nbsp;2.01(a)</u>)
to borrow on the date or in the amount specified for a LIBOR Loan in any Notice of
Revolving Loan Borrowing, the Borrower shall pay to the appropriate Lender within five (5)
Business Days after demand a prepayment fee or failure to borrow fee, as the case may be
(determined as though 100% of the LIBOR Loan had been funded in the Designated Eurodollar
Market) equal to the sum of</font></p>

plus</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the
amount, if any, by which (i) the additional interest would have accrued on the amount
prepaid or not borrowed at the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin if that amount had
remained or been outstanding through the last day of the applicable Interest Period
exceeds (ii) the interest that the Lender could recover by placing such amount on deposit
in the Designated Eurodollar Market for a period beginning on the date of the prepayment
or failure to borrow and ending on the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, if
no deposit rate quotation is available for such period, for the most comparable period for
which a deposit rate quotation may be obtained); plus</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lender reasonably attributable to such payment,
prepayment or failure to borrow.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Lender&#146;s determination of
the amount of any prepayment fee payable under this <u>Section&nbsp;2.13</u> shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The obligations of the Borrower under this <u>Section
2.13</u> shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the termination
of this Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Security</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Security
Documents</u>. The Loans, together with all other Obligations, shall be secured by the
Liens created by the Security Documents. So long as the terms thereof are in compliance
with this Agreement, each Lender Rate Contract shall be secured by the Lien of the
Security Documents (a) on a <i>pari passu</i> basis to the extent of the associated
Termination Value, and (b) to the extent of any excess, on a basis which is in all
respects subordinated to all other Obligations.</font></p>

the Administrative Agent such additional mortgages, deeds of trust, security agreements,
pledge agreements, lessor consents and estoppels (containing appropriate mortgagee and
lender protection language) and other instruments, agreements, certificates, opinions and
documents (including UCC financing statements and fixture filings and landlord waivers) as
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to:</font></p>

improvements thereon)) of the Borrower and the Guarantors prior to the Liens or other
interests of any Person, except for Permitted Liens; and</font></p>

and the Lenders and perform all additional acts reasonably requested by the Administrative

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Replacement
of the Lenders</u>. If (a)&nbsp;any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender more than one

a reason which is not applicable to any other Lender or (d)&nbsp;any Lender shall demand
any payment under <u>Section 2.11(c)</u>, <u>2.11(d)</u> or <u>2.12(a)</u> for a reason
which is not applicable to any other Lender, then the Administrative Agent may (or upon
the written request of the Borrower, shall) replace such Lender (the &quot;<u>affected
Lender</u>&quot;), or cause such affected Lender to be replaced, with another lender (the
&quot;<u>replacement Lender</u>&quot;) satisfying the requirements of an Assignee Lender
under <u>Section 8.05(c)</u>, by having the affected Lender sell and assign all of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including for
purposes of this <u>Section 2.15</u>, participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line
Loans) to the replacement Lender pursuant to <u>Section 8.05(c)</u>; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that if the Borrower seeks to exercise such right, it must do so within sixty (60) days
after it first knows or should have known of the occurrence of the event or events giving
rise to such right, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any
obligation to identify or locate a replacement Lender for the Borrower (it being expressly
agreed that in such circumstances it is the Borrower&#146;s obligation to identify or
locate a replacement Lender that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent).
Upon receipt by any affected Lender of a written notice from the Administrative Agent
stating that the Administrative Agent is exercising the replacement right set forth in
this <u>Section&nbsp;2.15</u>, such affected Lender shall sell and assign all of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including for
purposes of this <u>Section 2.15</u>, participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line

Governmental Authority regarding (i)&nbsp;any revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
termination or modification of, or the imposition of any material conditions with respect
to, any Governmental Authorization, or (ii)&nbsp;any other limitations on the conduct of

Obligation of such Person (nor is there any waiver in effect which, if not in effect,
would result in such a violation or default), where, in each case, such violation or
default is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no Loan Party (A)&nbsp;has violated any Environmental Laws,
(B)&nbsp;has any liability under any Environmental Laws or (C)&nbsp;has received notice or
other communication of an investigation or is under investigation by any Governmental
Authority having authority to enforce Environmental Laws where, in each case, such
violation, liability or notice is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default has occurred and is continuing.</font></p>

them before any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Title;
Possession Under Leases</u>. Set forth in Part A of <u>Schedule 4.01(h)</u> is a complete
list of all real property owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date, with the owner of such property, the location of such property, a brief
description of such property. Set forth in Part B of <u>Schedule 4.01(h)</u> is a complete
list of all real property leased by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee or
sublessee as of the Closing Date, with the lessee or sublessee of such property, the
location of such property, a brief description of such property, the owner of such
property and the date and title of and parties to the lease for such property (including
all amendments thereof), other than leased facilities with a term of less than one year
and a square footage of less than 5,000 feet. Set forth in Part C of <u>Schedule 4.01(h)</u>

4.01(h)</u>, (ii) have valid leasehold interests in the real property referred to in Parts
B and C of <u>Schedule 4.01(h)</u>, (iii) own and have good title (without regard to minor
defects of title) to all their other respective properties and assets which are material

most recent Financial Statements delivered to the Administrative Agent (except those
assets and properties disposed of since the date of such Financial Statements in
compliance with this Agreement) and (iv) own and have good title (without regard to minor
defects of title) to all respective properties and assets acquired by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries since such date which are material to the business of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (except those assets and properties disposed of in
compliance with this Agreement). Such assets and properties are subject to no Lien, except
for Permitted Liens. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession under all leases, except for any failure to enjoy such possession
which (alone or in the aggregate with any other such failures) is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Financial
Statements</u>. The audited Financial Statements delivered to the Administrative Agent

covered thereby. All such Financial Statements (i) are in accordance with the books and
records of the Loan Parties, which have been maintained in accordance with good business
practice, and (ii) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case of any
unaudited Financial Statements, to changes resulting from audit and normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of footnotes). No Loan Party has any Contingent Obligations,
liability for taxes or other outstanding obligations which, in any such case, are material
in the aggregate, except as disclosed in the audited Financial Statements dated December
29, 2001, furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent prior to the date hereof,
or in the Financial Statements delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause
(i) or (ii) of <u>Section 5.01(a)</u> or in the other documents delivered by the Borrower
hereunder and that, in any such case, are material in relation to the business,
operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the
Borrower individually or the Borrower and the other Loan Parties taken as a whole.</font></p>

As of the Closing Date, subject to the disclosure on <u>Schedule 4.01(j)</u>, the
assumptions set forth in the Projections are reasonable and consistent with each other and
with all facts known to the Borrower, and the Projections are reasonably based on such

upon the latest valuation of each Employee Benefit Plan that the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate maintains or contributes to, or has any obligation under (which occurred within
twelve months of the date of this representation), the aggregate benefit liabilities of
such plan within the meaning of Section&nbsp;4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate
value of the assets of such plan. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
liability with respect to any post-retirement benefit under any Employee Benefit Plan
which is a welfare plan (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA), other than liability for
health plan continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title I(B) of ERISA, which
liability for health plan contribution coverage is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Employee Benefit Plan complies, in both form and operation, in all material respects, with
its terms, ERISA and the IRC, and no condition exists or event has occurred with respect
to any such plan which would result in the incurrence by the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate of any material liability, fine or penalty. Each Employee Benefit Plan, related
trust agreement, arrangement and commitment of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate is
legally valid and binding and in full force and effect, except as could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Employee Benefit Plan is being audited
or investigated by any government agency or is subject to any pending or threatened claim
or suit which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates nor any fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan has
engaged in a prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the IRC.

of the Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability (including
secondary liability) to any Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan under Section 4201 of ERISA or as a result of a
sale of assets described in Section 4204 of ERISA. None of the Borrower and the ERISA
Affiliates has been notified that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or insolvent
under and within the meaning of Section 4241 or Section 4245 of ERISA or that any
Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has been terminated under Section 4041A of
ERISA.</font></p>

own, license or otherwise have the full right to use could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.</font></p>

become due pursuant to said returns or otherwise and all other indebtedness, except such
Governmental Charges or indebtedness, if any, which are being contested in good faith and

authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions

contrary contained herein the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any

Governmental Rule. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible to
any other Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any
Loan Party contained in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document, for the value,

except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Except as otherwise
provided under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall take such action with

additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Reliance

any certificate, notice or other document (including any cable, telegram, facsimile or
telex) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent with reasonable care. As to any other matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action or exercise
any discretion, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting upon instructions
of the Required Lenders and shall in all cases be fully protected by the Lenders in
acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions of the
Required Lenders and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
on all of the Lenders. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.03.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Defaults</u>.
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default unless the Administrative Agent has received a written notice from a Lender
or Borrower, referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such
notice is a &quot;Notice of Default&quot;. If the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however,
that until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interest of the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything in the contrary contained herein, the

suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any
time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any documents contemplated by or referred
to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement
of any of the terms hereof or thereof; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that no Lender
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the Administrative
Agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in refusing to take or in continuing to take any action hereunder unless
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. The obligations of each Lender under this <u>Section 7.04</u> shall
survive the payment and performance of the Obligations, the termination of this Agreement
and any Lender ceasing to be a party to this Agreement (with respect to events which
occurred prior to the time such Lender ceased to be a Lender hereunder). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.05.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Non-Reliance</u>.
Each Lender represents that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of the business, prospects, management,
financial condition and affairs of the Loan Parties and its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own appraisals and decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents
or advisors shall (a)&nbsp;be required to keep any Lender informed as to the performance
or observance by any Loan Party of the obligations under this Agreement or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or to make inquiry of, or to inspect the
properties or books of any Loan Party; (b)&nbsp;have any duty or responsibility to provide

into the possession of the Administrative Agent, except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder; or (c)&nbsp;be responsible to any Lender for (i)&nbsp;any
recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer,

or Removal of the Administrative Agent</u>. The Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by
the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative
Agent, if not a Lender, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that the Borrower shall have no right to approve a successor Administrative Agent if a
Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from the duties and obligations thereafter
arising hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation or removal
hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this <u>Article&nbsp;VII</u>
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, Wells Fargo may not be removed as Administrative Agent at the request
of the Required Lenders unless Wells Fargo shall also simultaneously be replaced and fully
released as &quot;L/C Issuer&quot; and &quot;Swing Line Lender&quot; hereunder pursuant to
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Wells Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.07.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Authorization</u>.
The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the Lenders to execute and deliver such
documents, instruments and agreements as the Administrative Agent may deem necessary to
release any Collateral which the Borrower or any other Loan Party is permitted to sell,
lease or otherwise transfer pursuant to the terms of the Credit Documents.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.08.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The
Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity</u>. The Administrative Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits
from and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with the any Loan Party
and its Affiliates as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent,
L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder. With respect to Loans, if any, made by the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender, the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as a Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, and the terms &quot;Lender&quot; or
&quot;Lenders&quot; shall include the Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender. </font></p>

Notice of Revolving Loan Interest Period Selection shall be given by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent&#146;s office located at the address referred to above during the
Administrative Agent&#146;s normal business hours. In any case where this Agreement
authorizes notices, requests, demands or other communications by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to be made by telephone or facsimile, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may conclusively presume that anyone purporting to be a
person designated in any incumbency certificate or other similar document received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender is such a person.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Expenses</u>.
The Borrower shall pay on demand, whether or not any Credit Event occurs hereunder,
(a)&nbsp;all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses, incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the syndication of the facilities provided hereunder, the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of, and the exercise of its duties under, this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of amendments and waivers hereunder and thereunder and (b)&nbsp;after a Default,
all reasonable fees and expenses (which such fees and expenses shall be set forth in a
written request sent by the Administrative Agent to each Grantor), including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees and expenses, incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
the enforcement or attempted enforcement of any of the Obligations or in preserving any of
the Administrative Agent&#146;s or the Lenders&#146; rights and remedies (including,
without limitation, all such fees and expenses incurred in connection with any
&quot;workout&quot; or restructuring affecting the Credit Documents or the Obligations or
any bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving any Loan Party). As used herein, the term
&quot;attorneys&#146; fees and expenses&quot; shall include, without limitation, allocable
costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent&#146;s and, in the case of clause (b)
above, the Lenders&#146; in-house legal counsel and staff. The obligations of the Borrower
under this <u>Section 8.02</u> shall survive the payment and performance of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.03.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Indemnification</u>.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower agrees to protect, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender, the
Lenders and their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
trustees and advisors (collectively, &quot;<u>Indemnitees</u>&quot;) on an After-Tax Basis
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages or expenses of any kind or
nature and from any suits, claims or demands (including in respect of or for reasonable
attorney&#146;s fees and other expenses) arising on account of or in connection with any
matter or thing or action or failure to act by Indemnitees, or any of them, arising out of
or relating to (a)&nbsp;the Credit Documents or any transaction contemplated thereby,
including without limitation any use by the Borrower of any proceeds of the Loans or the
Letters of Credit (but excluding amounts relating to taxes, which shall be governed solely
and exclusively by <u>Section 2.12</u>), <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that nothing
herein shall preclude payments of any amounts that are required to be paid on an After-Tax
Basis, (b)&nbsp;any Environmental Damages, and (c)&nbsp;any claims for brokerage fees or
commissions in connection with the Credit Documents or any transaction contemplated
thereby; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the Borrower shall in no event be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from any Indemnitee&#146;s gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Upon receiving knowledge of any suit, claim or demand
asserted by a third party that the Administrative Agent or any Lender believes is covered
by this indemnity, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall give the Borrower notice
of the matter and an opportunity to defend it, at the Borrower&#146;s sole cost and
expense, with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent or such Lender may also require
Borrower to defend the matter. Any failure or delay of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to notify Borrower of any such suit, claim or demand shall not relieve the Borrower
of its obligations under this <u>Section 8.03</u> but shall reduce such obligations to the
extent of any increase in those obligations caused solely by any such failure or delay
which is unreasonable. The obligations of the Borrower under this <u>Section&nbsp;8.03</u>
shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.</font></p>

Credit Document may be amended or waived, and any consent under this Agreement or any
other Credit Document may be given, if such amendment, waiver or consent is in writing and
is signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent on behalf
of the Required Lenders with the written approval of the Required Lenders); <u>provided</u>,

(iii) reduce the principal of or interest on any Loan or L/C Borrowing or any fees or
other amounts payable for the account of the Lenders hereunder, (iv) extend any date fixed
for any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loans or any fees or other amounts
payable for the account of the Lenders, (v) amend this <u>Section 8.04</u>, (vi) amend the
definition of Required Lenders or (vii) release any Guarantor that constitutes a Material
Subsidiary or any substantial part of the Collateral, except for any release in connection
with a sale or other disposition of Collateral authorized by <u>Section 5.02(c)</u>, must
be in writing and signed or approved in writing by all Lenders;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any

Agent must be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof or of any other right hereunder or thereunder nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other further exercise thereof or of any
other right hereunder or thereunder. Unless otherwise specified in such waiver or consent,
a waiver or consent given hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.05.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Successors
and Assigns</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Binding
Effect</u>. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders
of the Notes and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no Loan
Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under any Credit Document
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Participations</u>.
Any Lender may, without notice to or consent of the Borrower, at any time sell to one or
more banks or other financial institutions (&quot;<u>Participants</u>&quot;) participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment
of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C
Obligations and in Swing Line Loans). In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests, such Lender&#146;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such
Lender shall remain the holder of its Notes for all purposes under this Agreement and the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender&#146;s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement pursuant to which any such sale is effected may require the selling Lender
to obtain the consent of the Participant in order for such Lender to agree in writing to
any amendment, waiver or consent of a type specified in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or
(vii) of <u>Section&nbsp;8.04(a)</u> but may not otherwise require the selling Lender to
obtain the consent of such Participant to any other amendment, waiver or consent
hereunder. The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents are not paid when due (whether upon acceleration or otherwise),
each Participant shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have the
right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this
Agreement and any other Credit Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any
other Credit Documents; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that (i)&nbsp;no Participant
shall exercise any rights under this sentence without the consent of the Administrative
Agent, (ii)&nbsp;no Participant shall have any rights under this sentence or <u>Section
2.12</u> which are greater than those of the selling Lender and (iii)&nbsp;such rights of
setoff shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to share the payment so
obtained with all of the Lenders as provided in <u>Section 2.10(b)</u>. The Borrower also
agrees that any Lender which has transferred any participating interest in its Commitment
or Loans shall, notwithstanding any such transfer, be entitled to the full benefits
accorded such Lender under <u>Sections 2.11</u>, <u>2.12</u> and <u>2.13</u>, as if such
Lender had not made such transfer.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Assignments</u>.
Any Lender may, with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld), sell and assign to any Lender or any Eligible Assignee
(individually, an &quot;<u>Assignee Lender</u>&quot;) all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including for purposes of
this subsection (c), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) (such a
sale and assignment to be referred to herein as an &quot;<u>Assignment</u>&quot;) pursuant
to an assignment agreement in substantially the form of <u>Exhibit J</u> (an &quot;<u>Assignment
Agreement</u>&quot;), executed by each Assignee Lender and such assignor Lender (an &quot;<u>Assignor
Lender</u>&quot;) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and
recording in the Register; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Assignee Lender shall provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may include
letters of credit) to the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender as each may reasonably
require with respect to any continuing obligation to purchase participation interests in
any L/C Obligations or any Swing Line Loans then outstanding;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without
the written consent of the Administrative Agent and, if no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower (which consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Lender may make any Assignment to any
Assignee Lender which is not, immediately prior to such Assignment, a Lender hereunder or
an Affiliate thereof; </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without
the written consent of the Administrative Agent and, if no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
no Lender may make any Assignment to any Assignee Lender if, after giving effect to such
Assignment, the Commitment or Loans of such Lender or such Assignee Lender would be less
than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (except that a Lender may make an Assignment which
reduces its Commitment or Loans to zero without the written consent of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent); and</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without
the written consent of the Administrative Agent and, if no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower (which consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Lender may make any Assignment which does not
assign and delegate an equal pro rata interest in such Lender&#146;s Loans, Commitments
and all other rights, duties and obligations of such Lender under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of each
Assignment Agreement, from and after the Assignment Effective Date determined pursuant to
such Assignment Agreement, (A)&nbsp;each Assignee Lender thereunder shall be a Lender
hereunder with a Commitment and Loans as set forth on Attachment 1 to such Assignment
Agreement and shall have the rights, duties and obligations of such a Lender under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and (B)&nbsp;the Assignor Lender thereunder
shall be a Lender with a Commitment and Loans as set forth on Attachment 1 to such
Assignment Agreement or, if the Commitment and Loans of the Assignor Lender have been
reduced to $0, the Assignor Lender shall cease to be a Lender and to have any obligation
to make any Loan; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that any such Assignor Lender which
ceases to be a Lender shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of any provision of
this Agreement which by its terms survives the termination of this Agreement. Each
Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to amend <u>Schedule I</u> to the extent, and only to
the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of each Assignee Lender, the deletion of
each Assignor Lender which reduces its Commitment and Loans to $0 and the resulting
adjustment of Commitment and Loans arising from the purchase by each Assignee Lender of
all or a portion of the rights and obligations of an Assignor Lender under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents. On or prior to the Assignment Effective Date determined
pursuant to each Assignment Agreement, Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, in exchange for the surrendered Revolving Loan Note,
if any, of the Assignor Lender thereunder, a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of each
Assignee Lender thereunder that requests such a note (with each new Revolving Loan Note to
be in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by such Assignee Lender) and, if the
Assignor Lender is continuing as a Lender hereunder, a new Revolving Loan Note to the
order of the Assignor Lender if so requested by such Assignor Lender (with the new
Revolving Loan Note to be in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it). Each such
new Revolving Loan Note shall be dated the Closing Date, and each such new Revolving Loan
Note shall otherwise be in the form of the Revolving Loan Note replaced thereby. The
Revolving Loan Notes surrendered by the Assignor Lender shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked &quot;Replaced&quot;. Each Assignee Lender
which was not previously a Lender hereunder and which is not incorporated under the laws
of the United States or a state thereof shall, on or prior to the date of becoming a
Lender, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-9 (or other applicable
forms or certifications), as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at
any time Wells Fargo assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to subsection (c)
above, Wells Fargo may, (i) upon 30 days&#146; notice to the Borrower and the Lenders,
resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon five Business Days&#146; notice to the Borrower,
terminate the Swing Line. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or
termination of the Swing Line, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the
Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation
of Wells Fargo as L/C Issuer or the termination of the Swing Line, as the case may be.
Wells Fargo shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation
as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require
the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund participations in Unreimbursed
Amounts pursuant to <u>Section 2.03(c)</u>). If Wells Fargo terminates the Swing Line, it
shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect
to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such
termination, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans
or fund participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to <u>Section 2.03(c)</u>.</font></p>

a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register (the &quot;<u>Register</u>&quot;)
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments or Loans
of each Lender from time to time, and no Assignment shall be effective unless entered in
the Register, in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulations section
5f.103-1. The Administrative Agent shall be the agent of the Borrower for purposes of
keeping the Register. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans recorded therein
for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the

attachment creditor of the Borrower or against anyone else claiming through or against the
Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the
fact that such right of set-off may not have been exercised by such Lender at any prior
time. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender; <u>provided</u>, that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Security
Interest</u>. As security for the Obligations, the Borrower hereby grants to the

information with respect to any Loan Party which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement
or under the other Credit Documents, except that any Lender or the Administrative Agent
may disclose any such information (a) to its own directors, officers, employees, auditors,

whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
information and instructed to keep such information confidential); (b) to any other Lender

such Lender by such Governmental Authority) for disclosure of any non-public information
prior to disclosure of such information and shall assist the Borrower, at its cost, in
obtaining such confidentiality or protective orders as the Borrower may seek; <u>provided</u>,

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Consent
to Jurisdiction</u>. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Colorado and the courts of the United States of
America located in the District of Colorado and agrees that any legal action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents may be brought against such party in any such courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment, a certified or
exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the judgment, or in any other
manner provided by law. Nothing in this <u>Section 8.12</u> shall affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to commence legal proceedings or otherwise sue any other party to
this Agreement in any other appropriate jurisdiction, or concurrently in more than one
jurisdiction, or to serve process, pleadings and other papers upon any other party to this
Agreement in any manner authorized by the laws of any such jurisdiction. Each party to

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Arbitration</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Arbitration</u>.
The parties hereto agree, upon demand by any party, to submit to binding arbitration all
claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees,
officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise
arising out of or relating to in any way (i) the Loans and related Credit Documents which
are the subject of this Agreement and its negotiation, execution, collateralization,
administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement,
enforcement, default or termination, or (ii) requests for additional credit.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Governing
Rules</u>. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in Colorado selected
by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<u>AAA</u>&quot;); (ii) be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any
conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii)
be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree
upon, in accordance with the AAA&#146;s commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless
the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest,
arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the AAA&#146;s optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the
commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex
commercial disputes to be referred to, as applicable, as the &quot;<u>Rules</u>&quot;). If
there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and
procedures set forth herein shall control. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to
arbitration following a demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses
incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections
afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. 91 or any similar applicable state law.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>No
Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure</u>. The arbitration requirement
does not limit the right of any party to (i) foreclose against real or personal property
collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of
collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary
remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver,
before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not
constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any dispute to
arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the
actions detailed in <u>clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)</u> of this <u>Section 8.13(c)</u>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Arbitrator
Qualifications and Powers</u>. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in
controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected
according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00.
Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by
majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three
arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator
will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of Colorado or a neutral retired judge of
the state or federal judiciary of Colorado, in either case with a minimum of ten years
experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be
arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will
give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration
proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the
arbitrator&#146;s discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to
dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator
shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Colorado and may
grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the
scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The
arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose
sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same
extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Colorado Rules
of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and
maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary
remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff,
to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action
for judicial relief.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Discovery</u>.
In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules.
All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being
arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date and within
180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. Any requests for an extension of the
discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by
the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the party's
presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Class
Proceedings and Consolidations</u>. The resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement shall be determined by a separate arbitration proceeding and such
dispute shall not be consolidated with other disputes or included in any class proceeding.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Payment
Of Arbitration Costs And Fees</u>. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of
the arbitration proceeding.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Miscellaneous</u>.
To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators and the parties shall take all
action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of
the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may
disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information
by a party required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or
regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the parties
potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the
Credit Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. The arbitration
provisions set forth in this <u>Section 8.13</u> shall survive termination, amendment or
expiration of any of the Credit Documents or any relationship between the parties.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Termination
of Prior Credit Agreement</u>. Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Prior Credit Agreement shall terminate save for those provisions therein which are
expressed or intended to survive the termination thereof. Immediately prior to the Closing
Date, all loans outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement shall be purchased by the
Lenders hereunder from the Prior Lenders and shall be deemed to be Revolving Loans made by
each of the Lenders under this Agreement (and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
shall begin to accrue interest at the rates set forth in this Agreement), and all Prior
Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued and outstanding under
this Agreement (and all accrued unpaid fees thereon shall begin to accrue at the rates set
forth in this Agreement). To effectuate the foregoing, immediately prior to the Closing
Date the Administrative Agent shall calculate the Proportionate Share of each Lender in
each Revolving Loan outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement. Based upon such
calculation, each Lender shall purchase from the Prior Lenders or sell to the other
Lenders such shares in the outstanding Revolving Loans as the Administrative Agent
determines is necessary to cause each Lender to hold Revolving Loans in a principal amount
equal to such Lender&#146;s Proportionate Share. On and after the Closing Date, this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall amend, restate and supercede in their
entirety and replace the Prior Credit Agreement and the Prior Credit Documents (other than
the Leasehold Mortgages, any UCC filings and any filings made with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office evidencing the Administrative Agent&#146;s continuing Lien on and
security interest in any of the Collateral); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall not (a)
operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Prior Lenders under the Prior
Credit Agreement and the other Prior Credit Documents, except to the extent expressly
waived in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or (b) extinguish, impair or
constitute a novation of any obligations of the Borrower or the Guarantors under the Prior
Credit Agreement or the Prior Credit Documents except to the extent any such obligation is
actually satisfied by a Borrower or a Guarantor thereunder. Promptly upon the closing of
this Agreement and the receipt by the Lenders of its Notes, such Lenders that were also
Prior Lenders under the Prior Credit Agreement shall return to the Borrower any Notes
delivered to such Prior Lender in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement marked
&quot;cancelled&quot;.</font></p>
