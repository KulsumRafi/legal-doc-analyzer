Borrower to:

                  (a)      Not make Capital Expenditures (exclusive of trucks

                  3.       This Agreement may be executed in one or more

event that, upon notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of
Default, has occurred and is continuing.

the purposes which given.

                  6.       This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
