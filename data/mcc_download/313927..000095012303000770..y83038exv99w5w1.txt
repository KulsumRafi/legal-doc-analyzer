                           PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

         THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
January 16, 2003, is by and among CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC., a Delaware
corporation, as the originator (the "Originator"), CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC., a
Delaware corporation, as the initial Servicer ("Church & Dwight" or "Servicer"),
and HARRISON STREET FUNDING, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
"Company").

                                   Definitions

         Unless otherwise indicated, certain terms that are capitalized and used
throughout this Agreement are defined in Exhibit I to the Receivables Purchase
Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Receivables Purchase Agreement") by
and among Church & Dwight, as Servicer, the Company, Market Street Funding
Corporation, as the Issuer (the "Issuer"), and PNC Bank, National Association,
as the Administrator (the "Administrator"). All references herein to months are
to calendar months unless otherwise expressly indicated.

                                   Background

                  (a) The Company is a special purpose limited liability
         company, all of the outstanding interests of which are owned by Church
         & Dwight Co., Inc.

                  (b) The Originator generates Receivables in the ordinary
         course of its business.

                  (c) The Originator, in order to finance its business, wishes
         to sell Receivables to the Company, and the Company is willing, on the
         terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase
         Receivables from the Originator.

                  (d) The Originator and the Company intend this transaction to
         be a true sale or capital contribution of Receivables and the Related
         Rights by the Originator to the Company, providing the Company with the
         full benefits of ownership of the Receivables and the Originator and
         the Company do not intend the transactions hereunder to be, or for any
         purpose to be characterized as, a loan from the Company to the
         Originator.

                  (e) The Company intends to sell the Purchased Interest in the
         Receivables to the Issuer pursuant to the Receivables Purchase
         Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                         AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND SELL

         1.1      Agreement To Purchase and Sell.

                  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including Article IV), the Originator agrees to sell (or deem sold
with respect to Receivables or other Assets existing on or after the Cut-off
Date but not existing and held by the Originator on the Closing Date (the "No
Longer Existing Assets")) to the Company, and the Company agrees to purchase (or
deem purchased with respect to the No Longer Existing Assets) from the
Originator, from time to time on or after the Closing Date, but before the
Purchase and Sale Termination Date, all of the Originator's right, title and
interest in and to:

                  (a) each Receivable of the Originator that existed and was
         owing to the Originator at the closing of the Originator's business on
         December 31, 2002 (the "Cut-off Date") other than Receivables
         contributed pursuant to Section 3.1 (the "Contributed Receivables");

                  (b) each Receivable created by the Originator from and
         including the Cut-off Date to and including the Purchase and Sale
         Termination Date other than the Contributed Receivables;

                  (c) all rights to, but not the obligations under, all Related
         Security;

                  (d) all monies due or to become due with respect to any of the
         foregoing;

                  (e) all books and records related to any of the foregoing; and

                  (f) all collections and other proceeds of any of the foregoing
         (as defined in the applicable UCC) that are or were received by the
         Originator on or after the Cut-off Date, including, without limitation,
         all funds which either are received by the Originator, the Company or
         the Servicer from or on behalf of the Obligors in payment of any
         amounts owed (including, without limitation, invoice price, finance
         charges, interest and all other charges) in respect of Receivables, or
         are applied to such amounts owed by the Obligors (including, without
         limitation, insurance payments that the Originator or Servicer applies
         in the ordinary course of its business to amounts owed in respect of
         any Receivable and net proceeds of sale or other disposition of
         repossessed goods or other collateral or property of the Obligors or
         any other parties directly or indirectly liable for payment of such
         Receivables) (clauses (a) through (f), collectively, the ("Assets")).

All purchases, all deemed purchases and contributions hereunder shall be made
without recourse, but shall be made pursuant to, and in reliance upon, the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Originator set forth in this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document. No obligation or liability to any
Obligor on any Receivable is intended to be assumed by the Company hereunder,
and any such assumption is expressly disclaimed. The Company's

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>
foregoing commitment to purchase Receivables and the proceeds and rights
described in clauses (c) through (f) (collectively, the "Related Rights") is
herein called the "Purchase Facility."

         1.2      Timing of Purchases.

                  (a) Closing Date Purchases. The Originator's entire right,
         title and interest in (i) each Receivable that existed and was owing to
         the Originator at the Cut-off Date (other than Contributed
         Receivables), (ii) all Receivables created by the Originator from and
         including the Cut-off Date, to and including the Closing Date (other
         than Contributed Receivables), and (iii) all Related Rights,
         automatically shall be sold or be deemed to have been sold (with
         respect to the No Longer Existing Assets) to the Company on the Closing
         Date. On the Closing Date, all proceeds of Receivables that are deemed
         to have been sold on such date and as to which proceeds were received
         by the Originator on or prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed to
         (x) have been transferred by the Originator to the Company, (y) and
         transferred by the Company to the Originator as Purchase Price on
         account of Receivables and other Assets that are sold or deemed sold to
         the Company on such date.

                  (b) Regular Purchases. After the Closing Date, until the
         Purchase and Sale Termination Date, each Receivable (and the Related
         Rights) created by the Originator shall be deemed to have been sold to
         the Company immediately (and without further action) upon the creation
         of such Receivable.

         1.3      Consideration for Purchases.

                  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company agrees to make Purchase Price payments to the Originator
and to reflect all contributions in accordance with Article III.

         1.4      Purchase and Sale Termination Date.

                  The "Purchase and Sale Termination Date" shall be the earliest
to occur of (a) the date of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2 and (b) the Payment Date immediately following the day on which the
Originator shall have given notice to the Company at or prior to 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) that the Originator desires to terminate this Agreement.

         1.5      Intention of the Parties.

                  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the
transfers of the Receivables and Related Rights by the Originator to the
Company, as contemplated by this Agreement be, and be treated as, the full and
complete transfer of ownership in the form of sales or contributions, as
applicable, and not as loans secured by the Receivables and Related Rights. If,
however, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, such transactions are deemed
to be loans, the Originator hereby grants to the Company a first priority
security interest in all of the Originator's right, title and interest in and to
the Receivables and the Related Rights now existing and hereafter created by the
Originator, all monies due or to become due and all amounts received

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>
with respect thereto, and all proceeds thereof, to secure all of the
Originator's obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE II

                          CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE

         2.1      Calculation of Purchase Price.

                  On the Closing Date and not later than 2 days prior to each
Monthly Settlement Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Company and the
Originator a report in substantially the form of Exhibit A (each such report
being herein called a "Purchase Report") with respect to the matters set forth
therein and the Company's purchases of Receivables from the Originator:

                  (a) that are to be made on the Closing Date (in the case of
         the Purchase Report to be delivered on the Closing Date (relating to
         Receivables existing or created on the Cutoff Date)); or

                  (b) that were made during the most recently completed fiscal
         month prior to each Monthly Settlement Date (in the case of each
         subsequent Purchase Report to be delivered not later than 2 days prior
         to each Monthly Settlement Date).

         The "Purchase Price" (to be paid to the Originator in accordance with
the terms of Article III) for the Receivables and the Related Rights that are
purchased hereunder from the Originator shall be determined in accordance with
the following formula:

         PP                =        OB X FMVD

         where:

         PP                =        Purchase Price for each Receivable as
                                    calculated on the relevant Payment Date.

         OB                =        The Outstanding Balance of such Receivable
                                    on the relevant Payment Date.

         FMVD              =        Fair Market Value Discount, as measured on
                                    such Payment Date, which is equal to the
                                    quotient of (a) one divided by (b) the sum
                                    of (i) one, plus (ii) the product of (A) the
                                    Prime Rate on such Payment Date plus .25%
                                    and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
                                    is the Days' Sales Outstanding (calculated
                                    as of the last day of the Settlement Period
                                    next preceding such Payment Date) and the
                                    denominator of which is 365.


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>
         "Payment Date" means (i) the Cut-off Date and (ii) each Business Day
thereafter that the Originator is open for business.

         "Prime Rate" means a per annum rate equal to the "Prime Rate" as
published in the "Money Rates" Section of The Wall Street Journal or such other
publication , which regularly publishes such rates, as determined by the
Administrator in its sole discretion.

                                   ARTICLE III

            CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES AND PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1 Contribution of Receivables and Initial Purchase Price Payment.

         (a) On the Closing Date the Originator shall, and hereby does,
contribute to the capital of the Company Receivables and Related Rights with
respect thereto consisting of each Receivable of the Originator that existed and
was owing to the Originator on the Closing Date beginning with the oldest of
such Receivables and continuing chronologically thereafter such that the
aggregate Outstanding Balance of all such Contributed Receivables shall be at
least equal to $10,000,000;

         (b) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company agrees to pay to the Originator the Purchase Price for
the purchase to be made from the Originator on the Closing Date partially in
cash (in an amount to be agreed between the Company and the Originator) and
partially by issuing a promissory note in the form of Exhibit B to the
Originator with an initial principal balance equal to the remaining Purchase
Price (the promissory note, as it may be amended, supplemented, indorsed or
otherwise modified from time to time, together with all promissory notes issued
from time to time in substitution therefor or renewal thereof in accordance with
the Transaction Documents, each being herein called a "Company Note").

         3.2      Subsequent Purchase Price Payments.

                  On each Payment Date subsequent to the Closing Date, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company
shall pay to the Originator the Purchase Price for the Receivables transferred
by the Originator on such Payment Date:

                  (a) First, the Purchase Price shall be paid in cash to the
         extent the Company has cash available therefor; and

                  (b) Second, to the extent any portion of the Purchase Price
         remains unpaid, the principal amount outstanding under the Company Note
         issued to the Originator shall be increased by an amount equal to such
         remaining Purchase Price.

         Servicer shall make all appropriate record keeping entries with respect
to the Company Note or otherwise to reflect the foregoing payments, and
Servicer's books and records shall constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of
the principal amount of, and accrued interest on,

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>
the Company Note at any time. Furthermore, Servicer shall hold the Company Note
for the benefit of the Originator. The Originator hereby irrevocably authorizes
Servicer to mark the Company Note "CANCELLED" and to return such Company Note to
the Company upon the final payment thereof after the occurrence of the Purchase
and Sale Termination Date.

         3.3      Settlement as to Specific Receivables and Dilution.

                  (a) If, on the day of purchase or contribution of any
         Receivable from the Originator hereunder, any of the representations or
         warranties set forth in Sections 5.4 and 5.12 are not true with respect
         to such Receivable or as a result of any action or inaction of the
         Originator (it is acknowledged that Information Packages with respect
         to any Receivables are due two days prior to the next succeeding
         Monthly Settlement Date after the date of purchase or contribution of
         such Receivables and may be delivered to the Administrator from time to
         time (at times other than the Settlement Dates) and therefore ,
         notwithstanding the foregoing, the representation and warranty set
         forth in Section 5.12(c) hereof is not made until the delivery of such
         Information Packages), on any day, any of such representations or
         warranties set forth in Sections 5.4, 5.12 is no longer true with
         respect to such a Receivable, then the Purchase Price (or in the case
         of a Contributed Receivable, the Outstanding Balance of such
         Receivable, (the "Contributed Value")) with respect to such Receivables
         shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Outstanding Balance of such

                  (b) If, on any day, the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable
         (including any Contributed Receivable) purchased or contributed
         hereunder is reduced or adjusted as a result of any defective,
         rejected, returned goods or services, or any discount or other
         adjustment made by the Originator, the Company or Servicer or any
         setoff or dispute between the Originator or the Servicer and an Obligor
         (with the exception of setoffs, disputes, recoupments, defenses or
         claims where the facts demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of
         the parties hereto that the Obligor's failure to make payment is the
         result of such Obligor's insolvency, bankruptcy, inability or
         unwillingness to pay its obligations as they mature due to its
         financial condition) as indicated on the books of the Company (or, for
         periods prior to the Closing Date, the books of the Originator), then

         reduction and shall be accounted to the Originator as provided in
         subsection (c) below.

                  (c) Any reduction in the Purchase Price (or Contributed Value)

         applied as a credit for the account of the Company against the Purchase
         Price of Receivables subsequently purchased by the Company from the
         Originator hereunder; provided, however, if there have been no
         purchases of Receivables from the Originator (or insufficiently large
         purchases of Receivables) to create a Purchase Price sufficient to so
         apply such credit against, the amount of such credit

         the manner and for application as described in the following proviso,
         or

                  (ii) shall be deemed to be a payment under, and shall be
         deducted from the principal amount outstanding under, the Company Note
         payable to the Originator;

provided, further, that at any time (y) when a Termination Event or Unmatured
Termination Event exists under the Receivables Purchase Agreement or (z) on or
after the Purchase and Sale Termination Date, the amount of any such credit
shall be paid by the Originator to the Company by deposit in immediately
available funds into the relevant Lock-Box Account for application by Servicer
to the same extent as if Collections of the applicable Receivable in such amount
had actually been received on such date.

                  (d) Each Purchase Report (other than the Purchase Report
         delivered on the Closing Date) shall include, in respect of the
         Receivables previously generated by the Originator (including
         Contributed Receivables), a calculation of the aggregate reductions
         described in subsection (a) or (b) relating to such Receivables since
         the last Purchase Report delivered hereunder, as indicated on the books
         of the Company (or, for such period prior to the Closing Date, the
         books of the Originator).

         3.4      Reconveyance of Receivables.

                  In the event that the Originator has paid to the Company the
full Outstanding Balance of any Receivable pursuant to Section 3.3, the Company
shall transfer such Receivable to the Originator, without representation or
warranty, but free and clear of all liens, security interests, charges, and
encumbrances created by the Company.

         remain qualified in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
         jurisdiction where the failure to preserve and maintain such existence,
         rights, franchises, privileges and qualification would be reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Receivables Reviews. (i) At any time and from time to time
         during regular business hours, as reasonably requested in advance by
         the Company provided that no Termination Event exists and is
         continuing, permit the Company or the Administrator, or their
         respective agents or representatives, (A) to examine and make copies of
         and abstracts from all books, records and documents (including, without
         limitation, computer tapes and disks) in possession or under the
         control of the Originator relating to the Receivables, including,
         without limitation, the related Contracts (subject to any
         confidentiality provisions pertaining thereto) and purchase orders and
         other agreements related thereto, and (B) to visit the offices and
         properties of the Originator for the purpose of examining such
         materials described in clause (i)(A) next above and to discuss matters
         relating to Receivables originated by it or the performance hereunder
         with any of the officers or employees of the Originator having
         knowledge of such matters, and (ii) without limiting the foregoing
         clause (i) above, annually or if a Purchase and Sale Termination Event
         or Unmatured Purchase and Sale Termination Event exist then from time
         to time on request of the Administrator, permit certified public
         accountants or other auditors acceptable to the Originator and
         Administrator to conduct, at the Originator's expense, a review of the
         Originator's books and records with respect to its Receivables.

                  (d) Keeping of Records and Books of Account. Maintain and
         implement administrative and operating procedures (including, without
         limitation, an ability to re-create records evidencing Receivables it
         generates in the event of the destruction of the originals thereof),
         and keep and maintain all documents, books, records and other
         information reasonably necessary or advisable for the collection of
         such Receivables

                                      -14-

         adjustments to each existing Receivable).

                  (e) Performance and Compliance With Receivables and Contracts.
         Timely and fully perform and comply with all material provisions,

         formation, and the offices where it keeps its records concerning or
         related to Receivables, at the address(es) and states referred to in
         Exhibit E or, upon 15 days' prior written notice to the Company and the
         Administrator, at such other locations in jurisdictions where all
         action required by Section 7.3 shall have been taken and completed.

                  (g) Credit and Collection Policies. Comply in all material
         respects with its Credit and Collection Policy in connection with the
         Receivables that it generates and all material provisions, covenants

         and all other material agreements related to the Receivables.

                  (h) Post Office Boxes. On or prior to the date hereof, deliver
         to the Servicer (on behalf of the Company) a certificate from an
         authorized officer of the Originator to the effect that (i) the name of
         the renter of all post office boxes into which Collections may from
         time to time be mailed have been changed to the name of the Company
         (unless such post office boxes are in the name of the relevant Lock-Box
         Banks) and (ii) all relevant postmasters have been notified that each
         of the Servicer and the Administrator are authorized to collect mail
         delivered to such post office boxes (unless such post office boxes are

         Sale Termination Event or each Unmatured Purchase and Sale Termination
         Event in respect of the Originator, the statement of the chief
         financial officer or chief accounting officer of the Originator

         detail;

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
         disclosed to the Company and (ii) all material adverse developments
         that have occurred with respect to any previously disclosed litigation,
         proceedings and investigations; and

                  (c) Other. Promptly, from time to time, such other
         information, documents, records or reports respecting the Receivables
         or the conditions or operations, financial or otherwise, of the
         Originator as the Company, the Issuer or the Administrator may from
         time to time reasonably request in order to protect the interests of
         the Company, the Issuer or the Administrator under or as contemplated
         by the Transaction Documents.

         6.3      Negative Covenants.

                  From the date hereof until the date following the Purchase and
Sale Termination Date, the Originator agrees that, unless the Servicer (on
behalf of the Company) and the Administrator shall otherwise consent in writing,
it shall not:

                  (a) Sales, Liens, Etc. Except as otherwise provided herein or
         in any other Transaction Document, purport to sell, assign (by
         operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or create or
         suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon or with respect to, any
         Receivable or related Contract or Related Security, or any interest
         therein, or any Collections thereon, or assign any right to receive
         income in respect thereof.

                  (b) Extension or Amendment of Receivables. Except as otherwise
         permitted in Section 4.2(a) of the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
         extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Receivable in any
         material respect generated by it, or amend, modify or waive, in any
         material respect, any term or condition of any Contract related thereto
         (which term or condition relates to payments under, or the enforcement
         of, such Contract).

                  (c) Change in Business or Credit and Collection Policy. Make
         any material change in the character of its business, materially alter
         its Credit and Collection Policy, or make any change in its Credit and
         Collection Policy that would have a Material Adverse Effect with
         respect to the Receivables. The Originator shall not make any other
         change in its Credit and Collection Policy without giving prior written
         notice thereof to the Administrator.

                  (d) Receivables Not to Be Evidenced by Promissory Notes or
         Chattel Paper. Take any action to cause or permit any Receivable
         generated by it to become evidenced by any "instrument" or "chattel
         paper" (as defined in the applicable UCC).

                  (e) Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, Etc. (i) Be a party to any
         merger or consolidation, except a merger or consolidation where the
         Originator is the surviving entity, or (ii) directly or indirectly
         sell, transfer, assign, convey or lease (A) whether in one or a series
         of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets or (B) any
         Receivables or any interest therein (other than pursuant to this
         Agreement).

                  (f) Lock-Box Banks. Make any changes in its instructions to
         Obligors regarding Collections or add or terminate any bank as a
         Lock-Box Bank unless the

<PAGE>
         requirements of paragraph 2(g) of Exhibit IV to the Receivables
         Purchase Agreement have been met.

                  (g) Accounting for Purchases. Account for or treat (whether in
         financial statements or otherwise) the transactions contemplated hereby
         in any manner other than as sales of the Receivables and Related Rights
         by the Originator to the Company, except to the extent a different
         treatment is required in connection with the filing of consolidated tax
         returns of the Originator and its Subsidiaries by applicable tax law.

                  (h) Transaction Documents. Enter into, execute, deliver or
         otherwise become bound by any agreement, instrument, document or other
         arrangement that restricts the right of the Originator to amend,
         supplement, amend and restate or otherwise modify, or to extend or
         renew, or to waive any right under, this Agreement or any other
         Transaction Documents.

         6.4      Substantive Consolidation.

                  The Originator hereby acknowledges that this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents are being entered into in reliance upon the
Company's identity as a legal entity separate from the Originator and its
Affiliates. Therefore, from and after the date hereof, the Originator shall take
all reasonable steps necessary to make it apparent to third Persons that the
Company is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from those of the
Originator and any other Person, and is not a division of the Originator, its
Affiliates or any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
and in addition to and consistent with the other covenants set forth herein, the
Originator shall take such actions as shall be required in order that:

                  (a) the Originator, in its capacity as such, shall not be
         involved in the day-to-day management of the Company except for the
         provision of accounting and other services as contemplated by this
         Agreement;

                  (b) the Originator shall maintain separate organizational
         records and books of account from the Company and otherwise will
         observe organizational formalities and have a separate area from the
         Company for its business;

                  (c) the financial statements and books and records of the
         Originator shall be prepared after the date of creation of the Company
         to reflect and shall reflect the separate existence of the Company
         except to the extent that any such books and records are required by
         any applicable tax law to be maintained on a different basis; provided,
         that the Company's assets and liabilities may be included in a
         consolidated financial statement issued by an affiliate of the Company;
         provided, however, that any such consolidated financial statement shall
         make clear that the Company's assets are not available to satisfy the
         obligations of such affiliate;

                  (d) except as permitted by the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
         (i) the Originator shall maintain its assets separately from the assets
         of the Company, (ii) and the Company's assets, and records relating
         thereto, have not been, are not, and shall not be, commingled with
         those of the Originator;

<PAGE>
                  (e) all of the Company's business correspondence and other
         communications shall be conducted in the Company's own name and on its
         own stationery;

                  (f) the Originator shall not act as an agent for the Company,
         other than Church & Dwight in its capacity as the Servicer, and in
         connection therewith, shall present itself to the public as an agent
         for the Company and a legal entity separate from the Company;

                  (g) the Originator shall not conduct any of the business of
         the Company in its own name;

                  (h) the Originator shall not pay any liabilities of the
         Company out of its own funds or assets;

                  (i) the Originator shall maintain an arm's-length relationship
         with the Company;

                  (j) the Originator shall not assume or guarantee or become
         obligated for the debts of the Company or hold out its credit as being
         available to satisfy the obligations of the Company;

                  (k) the Originator shall not acquire obligations of the
         Company after the date hereof, it being understood that the Company
         Note is outstanding on the date hereof;

                  (l) the Originator shall allocate fairly and reasonably
         overhead or other expenses that are properly shared with the Company,
         including, without limitation, shared office space;

                  (m) the Originator shall identify and hold itself out as a
         separate and distinct entity from the Company;

                  (n) the Originator shall correct any known misunderstanding
         regarding its separate identity from the Company;

                  (o) the Originator shall not enter into, or be a party to, any
         transaction with the Company, except in the ordinary course of its
         business and on terms which are intrinsically fair and not less
         favorable to it than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length
         transaction with an unrelated third party; and

                  (p) the Originator shall not pay the salaries of the Company's
         employees, if any.

                      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN
                           RESPECT OF THE RECEIVABLES

         7.1      Rights of the Company.

                  The Originator hereby authorizes the Company (who may further
authorize another Person), the Servicer, or their respective designees to take
any and all steps in the Originator's name necessary or desirable, in their
respective determination, to collect all amounts due under any and all
Receivables, including, without limitation, endorsing the name of the Originator
on checks and other instruments representing Collections and enforcing such
Receivables and the provisions of the related Contracts that concern payment
and/or enforcement of rights to payment.

         7.2      Responsibilities of the Originator.

                  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

                  (a) Collection Procedures. The Originator agrees to direct its
         respective Obligors to make payments of Receivables directly to one or
         more Lock-Box Accounts or to post office boxes to which only Lock-Box
         Banks have access. The Originator further agrees to deposit or cause to
         be deposited (for the Company's account) within three (3) Business Days
         of receipt thereof any Collections that it receives directly into one
         or more Lock-Box Accounts or to post office boxes to which only
         Lock-Box Banks have access, and agrees that all such Collections shall
         be deemed to be received in trust for the Company but shall not be
         required to be maintained segregated or separate and apart from all
         other funds and monies of the Originator until transfer of such
         Collections to such Lock-Box Accounts or post office boxes.

                  (b) The Originator shall perform its obligations hereunder,
         and the exercise by the Company or its designee of its rights hereunder
         shall not relieve the Originator from such obligations.

                  (c) None of the Company, the Servicer or the Administrator
         shall have any obligation or liability to any Obligor or any other
         third Person with respect to any Receivables, Contracts related thereto
         or any other related agreements, nor shall the Company, the Servicer,
         the Issuer or the Administrator be obligated to perform any of the
         obligations of the Originator thereunder.

                  (d) The Originator hereby grants to the Company (who may
         further grant to another Person) an irrevocable power of attorney, with
         full power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the
         name of such Originator all steps necessary or advisable to endorse,
         negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or other right of any
         kind held or transmitted by the Originator or transmitted or received
         by the Company (whether or not from the Originator) in connection with
         any Receivable.

         7.3      Further Action Evidencing Purchases.

                  The Originator agrees that from time to time, at its expense,
it will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and
take all further action that the Servicer may reasonably request in order to
perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Receivables and Related Rights
purchased by or contributed to the Company hereunder, or to enable the Company
to exercise or enforce any of its rights hereunder or under any other
Transaction Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the
request of the Servicer, the Originator will:

                  (a) execute and file such financing or continuation
         statements, or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such
         other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate; and

                  (b) mark the master data processing records that evidence or
         list (i) such Receivables and (ii) related Contracts with the legend
         set forth in Section 4. l(j).

The Originator hereby authorizes the Company or its designee to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto and assignments
thereof, relative to all or any of the Receivables and Related Rights now
existing or hereafter generated by the Originator. If the Originator fails to
perform any of its agreements or obligations under this Agreement, the Company
or its designee may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Company or
its designee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Originator
as provided in Section 9.1.

         7.4      Application of Collections.

                  Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed
by it to the Originator shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or
otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the
Company (or any other Person to whom the Company has assigned such right to
instruct), be applied as a Collection of any Receivable or Receivables of such
Obligor to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before
being applied to any other indebtedness of such Obligor.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                      PURCHASE AND SALE TERMINATION EVENTS

         8.1      Purchase and Sale Termination Events.

                  Each of the following events or occurrences described in this
Section 8.1 shall constitute a "Purchase and Sale Termination Event":

                  (a) A Termination Event (as defined in the Receivables
         Purchase Agreement) shall have occurred and, in the case of a
         Termination Event (other than one described in

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
         paragraph (f) of Exhibit V of the Receivables Purchase Agreement), the
         Administrator, shall have declared the Facility Termination Date to
         have occurred; or

                  (b) The Originator shall fail to make any payment or deposit
         to be made by it hereunder when due and such failure shall remain
         unremedied for two Business Days;

                  (c) Any representation or warranty made or deemed to be made
         by the Originator (or any of its officers) under or in connection with
         this Agreement, any other Transaction Documents, or any other
         information or report delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall prove
         to have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or
         deemed made; provided that no Purchase and Sale Termination Event shall
         occur under this clause (c) if the Receivable(s) for which such
         representation or warranty is incorrect or untrue in any material
         respect (1) represent in the aggregate no more than 1/2% of the
         Outstanding Balance of all Receivables of the Originator, and (2) have
         resulted in an adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or 3.3(b) hereof;
         or

                  (d) The Originator shall fail to perform or observe any other
         term, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on its part to
         be performed or observed and such failure shall remain unremedied for
         30 days after written notice thereof shall have been given by the
         Servicer to the Originator.

         8.2      Remedies.

                  (a) Optional Termination. Upon the occurrence of a Purchase
         and Sale Termination Event, the Company (and not the Servicer) shall
         have the option, by notice to the Originator (with a copy to the
         Administrator), to declare the Purchase and Sale Termination Date to
         have occurred.

                  (b) Remedies Cumulative. Upon any termination of the Purchase
         Facility pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the Company shall have, in
         addition to all other rights and remedies under this Agreement, all
         other rights and remedies provided under the UCC of each applicable
         jurisdiction and other applicable laws, which rights shall be
         cumulative.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1      Indemnities by the Originator.

                  Without limiting any other rights which the Company may have
hereunder or under applicable law, the Originator, hereby agrees to indemnify
the Company and each of its officers, directors, employees and agents (each of
the foregoing Persons being individually called a "Purchase and Sale Indemnified
Party"), forthwith on demand, from and against any and all damages, losses,
claims, judgments, liabilities and related costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of the foregoing being
collectively called "Purchase and Sale Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or

out of or as a result of the failure of the Originator (in its capacity as
Originator) to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, or arising out of the claims asserted against a Purchase
and Sale Indemnified Party relating to the transactions contemplated herein or
the use of proceeds thereof or therefrom, excluding, however, (i) Purchase and
Sale Indemnified Amounts to the extent resulting from gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of such Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party, (ii)
any indemnification which would have the effect of creating in favor of the
Company and against the Originator recourse for non-payment of any Receivable,
such recourse to include without limitation recourse for any setoffs, disputes,
recoupments, defenses or claims where the facts demonstrate to the reasonable
satisfaction of the parties hereto, that the Obligor's failure to make payment
is the result of such Obligor's insolvency, bankruptcy, inability or
unwillingness to pay its obligations as they mature due to its financial
condition and (iii) any tax based upon or measured by net income or gross
receipts. Without limiting the foregoing, the Originator, agrees that it shall
indemnify each Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party for Purchase and Sale
Indemnified Amounts relating to or resulting from:

                  (a) the transfer by the Originator of an interest in any
         Receivable to any Person other than the Company;

                  (b) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
         Originator (or any of its officers) under or in connection with this
         Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or any written information
         or report delivered by the Originator pursuant hereto or thereto, which
         shall have been false or incorrect in any material respect when made or
         deemed made;

                  (c) the failure by the Originator to comply with any
         applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable
         generated by the Originator or the related Contract, or the
         nonconformity of any Receivable generated by the Originator or the
         related Contract with any such applicable law, rule or regulation;

                  (d) the failure to vest and maintain vested in the Company an
         ownership interest in the Receivables transferred by the Originator
         free and clear of any Adverse Claim, other than an Adverse Claim
         arising solely as a result of an act of the Company, whether existing
         at the time of the purchase of such Receivables or at any time
         thereafter;

                  (e) the failure to file, or any delay in filing, financing
         statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of
         any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to
         any Receivables or purported Receivables generated by the Originator,
         whether at the time of any purchase or contribution or at any
         subsequent time;

                  (f) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than setoffs,
         disputes, recoupments, defenses or claims where the facts demonstrate
         to the reasonable satisfaction of the parties hereto, that the
         Obligor's failure to make payment is the result of such Obligor's
         insolvency, bankruptcy, inability or unwillingness to pay its
         obligations as they mature due to its financial condition) of the
         Obligor to the payment of any

                                      -22-
<PAGE>
         Receivable or purported Receivable generated by the Originator
         (including, without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable's or
         the related Contract's not being a legal, valid and binding obligation
         of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms),
         or any other claim resulting from the services related to any such
         Receivable or the furnishing of or failure to furnish such services;

                  (g) any product liability claim arising out of or in
         connection with services that are the subject of any Receivable
         generated by the Originator; and

                  (h) any tax or governmental fee or charge (other than any tax
         excluded pursuant to clause (iii) in the proviso to the preceding
         sentence), all interest and penalties thereon or with respect thereto,
         and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees
         and expenses of counsel in defending against the same, which may arise
         by reason of the purchase or ownership of the Receivables generated by
         the Originator or any Related Security connected with any such
         Receivables.

         If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this Section
9.1 is unavailable to a Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party or is insufficient
to hold such Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party harmless, then the Originator
agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Purchase
and Sale Indemnified Party to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.

         integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect
