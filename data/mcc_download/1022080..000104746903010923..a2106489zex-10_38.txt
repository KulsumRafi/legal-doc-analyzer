if:

          (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
     arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
     Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law
     applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not
     having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
     over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank
     refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
     Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to
     such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
     which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in
     effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any
     unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
     Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;

          (ii) the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Bank, the
     Agent or the applicable Account Party, on or prior to the Business Day
     prior to the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one
     or more of the applicable conditions contained in Article V is not then
     satisfied;

     360 days after the date of Issuance, unless the Majority Banks have
     approved such expiry date in writing;

          (iv) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is prior to the
     maturity date of any financial obligation to be supported by the requested
     Letter of Credit;

          (v) any requested Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts, or is
     not otherwise in form and substance acceptable to the Issuing Bank, or the
     Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall violate any applicable policies of the
     Issuing Bank; or

          (vi) any standby Letter of Credit is for the purpose of supporting the
     issuance of any letter of credit by any other Person.

          (vii) such Letter of Credit is denominated in a currency other than

     3.2. ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT AND RENEWAL OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

                                       -7-
<Page>

     (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable written
request of the applicable Account Party received by the Issuing Bank (with a
copy sent by the Account Party to the Agent) at least three Business Days (or
such shorter time as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its
sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of issuance. Each such request for
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be by facsimile, confirmed immediately in
an original writing, in the form of an L/C Application, and shall specify in
form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed date of
issuance of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the face
amount of the Letter of Credit; (iii) the expiry date of the Letter of Credit;
(iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be
presented by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit in case of any drawing
thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by the
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as
the Issuing Bank may require.

     (b) At least two Business Days prior to the Issuance of any Letter of
Credit (or such shorter time as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular
instance in its sole discretion), the Issuing Bank will confirm with the Agent
(by telephone or in writing) that the Agent has received a copy of the L/C
Application or L/C Amendment Application from the applicable Account Party and,
if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the
Issuing Bank has received notice on or before the Business Day immediately
preceding the date the Issuing Bank is to issue a requested Letter of Credit
from the Agent (A) directing the Issuing Bank not to issue such Letter of Credit
because such issuance is not then permitted under Section 2.1 as a result of the
limitations set forth therein; or (B) that one or more conditions specified in
Article V are not then satisfied; then, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
for the account of the applicable Account Parties in accordance with the Issuing
Bank's usual and customary business practices.

     (c) From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to
the L/C Termination Date, the Issuing Bank will, upon the written request of the
applicable Account Parties received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the
applicable Account Party to the Agent) at least five days (or such shorter time
as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion)
prior to the proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by
it. Each such request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by
facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, made in the form of an
L/C Amendment Application and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
the Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed date
of amendment of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the
nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing
Bank may require. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any
Letter of Credit if: (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time
to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms of this
Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of any such letter of Credit does not accept
the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. The Agent will promptly notify
the Banks of the receipt by it of any L/C Application or L/C Amendment
Application.

     (d) The Issuing Bank and the Banks agree that, while a Letter of Credit is
outstanding and prior to the L/C Termination Date, at the option of the
applicable Account Party and upon the written request of the applicable Account
Party received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy

                                       -8-
<Page>

sent by the applicable Account Party to the Agent) at least five days (or such
shorter time as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole
discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, the Issuing
Bank shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of any Letter of
Credit issued by it. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit shall
be made by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in the form
of an L/C Amendment Application, and shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be renewed; (ii)
the proposed date of notification of renewal of the Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (iii) the revised expiry date of the Letter of Credit;
and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. The Issuing Bank
shall be under no obligation to renew any Letter of Credit if: (A) the Issuing
Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue or amend such Letter of
Credit in its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed renewal of
the Letter of Credit. If any outstanding Letter of Credit shall provide that it
shall be automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof receives notice
from the Issuing Bank that such Letter of Credit shall not be renewed, and if at
the time of renewal the Issuing Bank would be entitled to authorize the
automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in accordance with this subsection
3.2(d) upon the request of the Account Party but the Issuing Bank shall not have
received any L/C Amendment Application from an applicable Account Party with
respect to such renewal or other written direction by the applicable Account
Party with respect thereto, the Issuing Bank shall nonetheless be permitted to
allow such Letter of Credit to renew, and the applicable Account Party and the
Banks hereby authorize such renewal, and, accordingly, the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have received an L/C Amendment Application from the applicable Account
Party requesting such renewal. Any renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be
subject to and in compliance with Section 3.1(b)(iii).

     (e) Subject to the provisions of subsection 3.1(b)(iii), the Issuing Bank
may, at its election (or as required by the Agent at the direction of the
Majority Banks), deliver any notices of termination or other communications to
any Letter of Credit beneficiary or transferee, and take any other action as
necessary or appropriate, at any time and from time to time, in order to cause
the expiry date of such Letter of Credit to be a date not later than the L/C
Termination Date.

     (f) This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with any
L/C-Related Document (other than any Letter of Credit).

     (g) The Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Agent, concurrently or
promptly following its delivery of a Letter of Credit, or amendment to or
renewal of a Letter of Credit, to an advising bank or a beneficiary, a true and
complete copy of each such Letter of Credit or amendment to or renewal of a
Letter of Credit.

     3.3. EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT; RISK PARTICIPATIONS, DRAWINGS AND
REIMBURSEMENTS.

     (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Existing Letters of Credit shall be
deemed for all purposes, including for purposes of the fees to be collected
pursuant to subsections 3.8(a) and 3.8(c), and reimbursement of costs and
expenses to the extent provided herein, Letters of Credit outstanding under this
Agreement and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other L/C
Documents, and shall be governed by the applications and agreements pertaining
thereto and

                                       -9-
<Page>

by this Agreement. Each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank on the Closing Date a
participation in each such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such Bank's Pro Rata Share times (ii) the
maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount
of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of Section 2.1, the Existing Letters
of Credit shall be deemed to utilize pro rata the Commitment of each Bank.

     (b) Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit in addition to
those described in subsection 3.3(a), each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a
participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata Share of such Bank, times (ii) the
maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount
of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of Section 2.1, each Issuance of a
Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize the Commitment of each Bank by an
amount equal to the amount of such participation.

     (c) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by
the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the
applicable Account Party, which notification will, in any event, be received by
the applicable Account Party on the same Business Day any such request is
received by the Issuing Bank before 4 p.m. and on the next Business Day, if such
request is received after 4 p.m. The applicable Account Party shall reimburse
the Issuing Bank prior to 10:30 a.m. (Applicable Time), on each date that any
amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date,
an "Honor Date"), in an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank.
In the event the applicable Account Party fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank
for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 10:30 a.m.
(Applicable Time) on the Honor Date, the Issuing Bank will direct the Agent to
liquidate (and the Agent shall and is hereby authorized to liquidate) Collateral
in an amount sufficient to reimburse in full the Issuing Bank for the amount of
such drawing and any related amounts. Upon such liquidation, the Agent shall pay
to the Issuing Bank the amount so liquidated. Any notice given by the Issuing
Bank or the Agent pursuant to this subsection 3.3(c) may be oral if immediately
confirmed in writing (including by facsimile); provided that the lack of such an
immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of
such notice.

     (d) To the extent that the Issuing Bank is not fully reimbursed for a
drawing pursuant to Section 3.3(c), it shall so notify the Agent and the Agent
shall promptly so notify each Bank. Upon such notice, each Bank not so
reimbursed to the Issuing Bank make available to the Agent for the account of
the Issuing Bank an amount in Dollars and in immediately available funds equal
to its Pro Rata Share of the amount of the drawing not so reimbursed to the
Issuing Bank. If any Bank so notified fails to make available to the Agent for
the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
amount of the unreimbursed drawing by no later than 12:00 noon (Applicable Time)
on the Honor Date, then interest shall accrue on such Bank's obligation to make
such payment, from the Honor Date to the date such Bank makes such payment, at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time
during such period. The Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the
Honor Date, but failure of the Agent to give any such notice on the Honor Date
or in sufficient time to enable any

                                      -10-
<Page>

Bank to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Bank from its
obligations under this Section 3.3.

     (e) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not fully reimbursed
by the Company pursuant to Section 3.3(c), the Company shall be deemed to have
incurred from the Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of such drawing,
which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest)
and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 4% per
annum, and each Bank's payment to the Issuing Bank pursuant to subsection 3.3(d)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing
and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Bank in satisfaction of its
participation obligation under this Section 3.3.

     (f) Each Bank's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the
L/C Advances, as contemplated by this Section 3.3, as a result of a drawing
under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute and unconditional and without
recourse to the Issuing Bank and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Bank may have against the Issuing Bank, the Account Party or any
other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a
Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

     3.4. REPAYMENT OF PARTICIPATIONS.

     (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank of immediately available funds from the applicable Account Party
(i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under the Letter of
Credit with respect to which any Bank has paid the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank for such Bank's participation therein pursuant to Section 3.3 or
(ii) in payment of interest thereon, the Agent will pay to each Bank, in the
same funds as those received by the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank,
the amount of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such funds, and the Issuing Bank
shall receive the amount of the Pro Rata Share of such funds of any Bank that
did not so pay the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank.

     (b) If the Agent or the Issuing Bank is required at any time to return to
the applicable Account Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian,
or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made
by the Company or the other applicable Account Party to the Agent for the
account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to subsection 3.4(a) in reimbursement of a
payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Bank
shall, on demand of the Agent, forthwith return to the Agent or the Issuing Bank
the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any amounts so returned by the Agent or the
Issuing Bank plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date
such amounts are returned by such Bank to the Agent or the Issuing Bank, at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.

     3.5. ROLE OF THE ISSUING BANK.

     (a) Each Bank, the Company and the other Account Parties agree that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, document and
certificates expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy (other than conformity with the draw
requirements of such Letter of Credit) of any such document or the authority of
the Person executing or delivering any such document.

     (b) No Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Bank for:
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Banks (including the Majority Banks, as applicable); (ii)
any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any L/C-Related Document.

     (c) The Company and the other Account Parties hereby assume all risks of
the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use
of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended
to, and shall not, preclude the Company's or any other Account Party's pursuing
such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at
law or under any other agreement. No Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank, shall
be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(vii) of Section 2.6; provided, however, anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, that the Company or the other Account Parties may have
a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be liable to the
Company or the other Account Parties, to the extent, but only to the extent, of
any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the
Company or the other Account Parties which were caused by the Issuing Bank's
willful misconduct or gross negligence (which shall include payment against
non-conforming draw request documentation) or the Issuing Bank's willful failure
to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft, documents and certificate(s) strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing: (i) the Issuing Bank may accept documents that
appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary; and (ii)
the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

     3.6. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligations of each Account Party under this
Agreement and any L/C-Related Document to reimburse the Issuing Bank for a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each
such other L/C-Related Document under all circumstances, including the
following:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
     L/C-Related Document;

                                      -12-
<Page>

          (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
     other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Company in respect of
     any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
     departure from all or any of the L/C-Related Documents;

          (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that
     the Company may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee
     of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any
     such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person,
     whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
     hereby or by the L/C-Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

          (iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
     any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
     otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any
     Letter of Credit;

          (v) any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit to
     any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
     assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
     representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any
     Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any Insolvency
     Proceeding;

          (vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any
     release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other
     guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the Company in respect of
     any Letter of Credit; or

          (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
     might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
     Company or a guarantor.

     3.7. CASH COLLATERAL PLEDGE. Pursuant to the L/C Account Agreement, the
Company shall cause all L/C Obligations to be at all times Cash Collateralized
in an amount equal to or greater than such L/C Obligations.

     3.8. LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

     (a) The Company shall pay to the Agent for the ratable account of each of
the Banks a letter of credit fee with respect to the Letters of Credit, such fee
to be equal to (i) in the case of each standby Letter of Credit, 3.00% per annum
on the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn on such standby Letter
of Credit, and (ii) in the case of each commercial or trade Letter of Credit,
0.30% per annum on the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn on
such commercial or trade Letter of Credit. Such fees shall be computed on a
quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
based upon Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter, as calculated by the
Agent. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during which Letters of Credit
are outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date to occur after the

                                      -13-
<Page>

Closing Date, through the L/C Termination Date (or such later date upon which
the outstanding Letters of Credit shall expire), with the final payment to be
made on the L/C Termination Date (or such later expiration date).

     (b) [Reserved].

     (c) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank from time to time on demand
the normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and
other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Bank relating to letters of
credit as from time to time in effect.

     3.9. UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE. The Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits as published by the International Chamber of Commerce most
recently at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit shall (unless otherwise
expressly provided in the Letters of Credit) apply to the Letters of Credit.

     3.10. GUARANTY OF THE COMPANY. The Company hereby unconditionally
guaranties all L/C Obligations of all Account Parties and agrees to pay or cause
each Account Party to pay to the Issuing Bank when due all L/C Obligations of
such Account Party.

     3.11. PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.

     (a) All payments to be made by the Company shall be made without set-off,
recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
payments by the Company shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks
at the Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in Dollars (in the case of a
Letter of Credit issued in Euros, each reimbursement by any Credit Party shall
be in the Dollar equivalent of the amount of a draw in Euros) and in immediately
available funds, no later than 12:00 p.m. (Applicable Time) on the date
specified herein. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its Pro Rata
Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment
in like funds as received. Any payment received by the Agent later than 12:00
p.m. (Applicable Time) shall be deemed to have been received on the following
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

     (b) Unless the Agent receives notice from the Company prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Banks that the Company will not make such
payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Company has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available
funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Company has not made such
payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent on demand such
amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon at the Federal
Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank
until the date repaid.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     4.1. TAXES

                                      -14-
<Page>

     (a) Any and all payments by the Company to each Bank or the Agent under
this Agreement and any other L/C Document shall be made free and clear of, and
without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In addition, the Company shall
pay all Other Taxes.

     (b) If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Bank or the Agent, then:

          (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after
     making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and
     withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section),
     such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, receives and retains an amount
     equal to the sum it would have received and retained had no such deductions
     or withholdings been made;

          (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and withholdings;

          (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to
     the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
     applicable law; and

          (iv) the Company shall also pay to each Bank or the Agent for the
     account of such Bank, at the time interest is paid, Further Taxes in the
     amount that the respective Bank specifies in good faith as necessary to
     preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have received if such Taxes,
     Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed.

     (c) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and the
Agent for the full amount of i) Taxes, ii) Other Taxes, and iii) Further Taxes
in the amount that the respective Bank specifies in good faith as necessary to
preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have received if such Taxes, Other
Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including
penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days after the date the Bank or the Agent makes written demand
therefor.

     (2) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of Taxes,
Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Company shall furnish to each Bank or the
Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof,
or other evidence of payment satisfactory to such Bank or the Agent.

     (3) If the Company is required to pay any amount to any Bank or the Agent
pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Section, then such Bank shall use
reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change
the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional
payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the sole
judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

     4.2. INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN.

     (a) If any Bank determines that, due to either (i) the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance by that Bank with any

                                      -15-
<Page>

guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to the Issuing Bank of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter

referred to in clause (b), clause (c) or clause (d), to the extent that the

performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement and each other
L/C Document to which such Person is party, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and do not and will not:

     (1) contravene the terms of any of that Person's Organization Documents;

                                    ARTICLE X

                                    THE AGENT

     10.1. APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION; "AGENT".

     (a) Each Bank hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 10.9) appoints,
designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other L/C Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other L/C Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other L/C Document, the Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other L/C
Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

     (b) The Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Banks with respect to any
Letters of Credit Issued by it and the documents associated therewith until such
time and except for so long as the Agent may agree at the request of the
Majority Banks to act for such Issuing Bank with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the Issuing Bank shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
provided to the Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit
Issued by it or proposed to be Issued by it and the application and agreements
for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of Credit as fully as if the
term "Agent", as used in this Article X, included the Issuing Bank with respect
to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement
with respect to the Issuing Bank.

     10.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may execute any of its duties under
this Agreement or any other L/C Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

     10.3. LIABILITY OF AGENT. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other L/C Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct),
or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or
in any other L/C

                                      -23-
<Page>

Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other L/C Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability, perfection or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other L/C Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other party to any
L/C Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or
to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements
contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other L/C Document, or to
inspect the properties, books or records of the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     10.4. RELIANCE BY AGENT.

     (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other
document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and
to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall
be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other L/C Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so
requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or
any other L/C Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required
Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

     (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in
Section 5.1, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter either sent by the Agent to such Bank for consent, approval,
acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.

     10.5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect
to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid
to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall have received
written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". The Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any such
notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as may be requested by the Required Banks in accordance with Article
IX; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until the Agent has received any such
request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.

     10.6. CREDIT DECISION. Each Bank acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Bank. Each Bank

                                      -24-
<Page>

represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company
hereunder. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other L/C Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be
furnished to the Banks by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession
of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

     10.7. INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), Pro Rata,
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion
of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank
shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other L/C Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company. The undertaking in
this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the
resignation or replacement of the Agent.

     10.8. AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of America and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the
Issuing Bank hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Bank of America shall be entitled to amend or modify any
agreements evidencing any of the foregoing transactions or take any action or
refrain from acting under any such agreements without the consent of the Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Bank. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding
the Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such Subsidiary) and
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to Obligations held by it, Bank of America
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other

                                      -25-
<Page>

Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or the Issuing
Bank. Each of the Banks shall cooperate in sharing information regarding the
Company or its Affiliates.

     10.9. SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may, and at the request of the Required
Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent
resigns under this Agreement, the Required Banks shall appoint from among the
Banks a successor agent for the Banks (which successor agent shall be subject to
the approval of the Company if no Default or Event of Default then exists,
provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If
no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the
Company, a successor agent from among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to
all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent"
shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and
duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article X and Sections 11.4 and 11.5
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted
appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's
notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Banks appoint a
successor agent as provided for above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
Bank of America may not be removed as the Agent at the request of the Banks
unless Bank of America shall also simultaneously be replaced as "Issuing Bank"
hereunder pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Bank of America.

     10.10. WITHHOLDING TAX.

     (a) If any Bank is a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust" within the
meaning of the Code and such Bank claims exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S.
withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such Bank agrees with
and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to the Agent:

          (i) if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a reduction of,
     withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, two properly completed
     and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI before the payment of any
     interest in the first calendar year and before the payment of any interest
     in each third succeeding calendar year during which interest may be paid
     under this Agreement;

          (ii) if such Bank claims that interest paid under this Agreement is
     exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively
     connected with a United States trade or business of such Bank, two properly
     completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI before the
     payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Bank and
     in each succeeding taxable year of such Bank during which interest may be
     paid under this Agreement; and

                                      -26-
<Page>

          (iii) such other form or forms (including, without limitation, Form
     W-8 or W-9) as may be required under the Code or other laws of the United
     States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States
     withholding tax.

Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

     (b) If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax
under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI and such
Bank sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or
part of the Obligations of the Company to such Bank, such Bank agrees to notify
the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner
of Obligations of the Company to such Bank. To the extent of such percentage
amount, the Agent will treat such Bank's IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI as no longer
valid.

     (c) If any Bank claiming exemption from United States withholding tax by
filing IRS Form W-8BEN or W8ECI with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the
Company to such Bank, such Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

     (d) If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding
tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Bank an amount
equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such
reduction. However, if the forms or other documentation required by subsection
(a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to such Bank not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by
Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction.

     (e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or
other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax
from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate
form was not delivered or was not properly executed, or because such Bank failed
to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason)
such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Banks under this subsection shall survive
the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

departure by the

same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Banks (or by the Agent at
the written request of the Required Banks) and the Company and acknowledged by
the Agent, and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED,

     Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 9.2);

     L/C Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
     due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or under any other L/C
     Document;

          (iii) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified

     or other action by all Banks; or

          (vi) release any Collateral.

and, PROVIDED FURTHER, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Issuing Bank in addition to the Required Banks or all
the Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank
under this Agreement or any L/C-Related Document relating to any Letter of
Credit Issued or to be Issued by it, and (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Required
Banks or all the Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the

     11.2. NOTICES.

     (a) All notices, requests, consents, approvals, waivers and other

provided that any matter transmitted by the Company by facsimile (i) shall be
immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the number
specified on SCHEDULE 11.2 to this Agreement, and (ii) shall be followed
promptly by delivery of a hard copy original thereof) to the address or

Company or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by the Agent

obligation of the Company to repay the L/C Obligations shall not be affected in
any way or to any extent by any failure by the Agent and the Banks to receive
written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the
Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms
understood by the Agent and the Banks to be contained in the telephonic or
facsimile notice.

     11.3. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege.

     11.4. COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Company shall:

     (a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
pay or reimburse Bank of America (including in its capacity as Agent and Issuing
Bank) within five Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 5.1(e)) for
all reasonably costs and expenses incurred by Bank of America (including in its

preparation, delivery, administration and execution of, and any amendment,
supplement, waiver or modification to (in each case, whether or not
consummated), this Agreement, any L/C Document and any other documents prepared
in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by
Bank of America (including in its capacity as Agent and Issuing Bank) with
respect thereto; and

hereby are consummated, the Company shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Agent-Related Persons, and each Bank and each of its respective officers,
directors, employees, and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON")
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements
(including reasonable Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may
at any time (including at any time following the termination of the Letters of
Credit and the termination, resignation or replacement of the Agent or
replacement of any Bank) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such
Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any L/C
Document, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or
omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing,
including with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including
any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of
this Agreement or Letters of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether
or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED, that the Company shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent resulting solely from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section
shall survive payment of all other Obligations.

     11.6. PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that the Company makes a payment to
the Agent or the Banks, or the Agent or the Banks exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a)
to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Bank severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its Pro Rata Share of
any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent.

not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank.

     11.8. ASSIGNMENTS, PARTICIPATIONS, etc.

     (a) Any Bank may, with the written consent of the Company at all times
other than during the existence of an Event of Default and the Agent and the
Issuing Bank, which consent of the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld,
at any time assign and delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that
no written consent of the Company, the Agent or the Issuing Bank shall be
required in connection with any assignment and delegation by a Bank to an
Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such Bank) (each an "ASSIGNEE") all,
or any ratable part of all the Commitments, the L/C Obligations and the other
rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder, in a minimum amount of
$5,000,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company and the Agent may continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the interest so
assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together
with payment

                                      -30-

instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the Assignee,
shall have been given to the Company and the Agent by such Bank and the
Assignee; (ii) such Bank and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Company
and the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of EXHIBIT A ("ASSIGNMENT
AND ACCEPTANCE"); and (iii) the Agent and, if applicable, the Company shall have
consented thereto. Bank of America hereby agrees that, as long as it is the
Agent and LaSalle Bank National Association is a Bank hereunder, after giving
effect to any assignment of its rights and obligations under this SECTION, Bank
of America's Commitment as a Bank will not be less than the Commitment of any
other Bank.

     (b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Bank that
it has received (and provided its consent with respect to) an executed
Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Bank under the L/C Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall,
to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other L/C
Documents have been assigned by it and assumed by the Assignees pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under the L/C Documents.

     (c) [Reserved].

     (d) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or other
Persons not Affiliates of the Company (a "PARTICIPANT") participating interests
in any L/C Obligations, the Commitment of that Bank and the other interests of
that Bank (the "originating Bank") hereunder and under the other L/C Documents;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the originating Bank's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Company, the
Issuing Bank and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the
originating Bank in connection with the originating Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other L/C Documents, and (iv) no Bank
shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant
has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect
to, this Agreement or any other L/C Document, except to the extent such
amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent of the Banks as
described in the FIRST PROVISO to Section 11.1. In the case of any such
participation, the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 4.1
and 11.5 as though it were also a Bank hereunder, and if amounts outstanding
under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall
have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Bank under this Agreement.

     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Bank may at
any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its
rights under and interest in this Agreement and the Obligations held by it in
favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or
U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank
may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
applicable law.

     11.9. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Bank agrees to take and to cause its Affiliates
to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the
confidentiality of all information provided to it by the Company or any
Subsidiary, or by the Agent on the Company's or such Subsidiary's behalf, under
this Agreement or any other L/C Document, and neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall use any such information OTHER than in connection with or in
enforcement of this Agreement and the other L/C Documents or in connection with
other business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with the Company or any
Subsidiary; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Bank, or
(ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Company known to the Bank; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Bank
may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement
of any Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection with
an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Agent, any
Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any
other L/C Document; (F) to such Bank's independent auditors and other
professional advisors, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such
information confidential to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder; (G)
to any Participant or Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such Person
agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the same extent
required of the Banks hereunder; (H) as to any Bank or its Affiliate, as
expressly permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding
confidentiality to which the Company or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed
party with such Bank or such Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates.

     11.10. SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the L/C Obligations have been
accelerated, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time (but only
after the Agent shall have initially resorted to the Collateral under the L/C
Account Agreement), without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being
waived by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such
Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all
Obligations owing to such Bank, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of
whether or not the Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this
Agreement or any L/C Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or
unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Bank; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

     11.11. AUTOMATIC DEBITS OF FEES. With respect to any fee, or any other cost
or expense (including Attorney Costs) due and payable to the Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Arranger, Bank of America under the L/C Documents, the Company hereby
irrevocably authorizes Bank of America to debit the deposit account of the
Company with Bank of America, number 8666302112, in an amount such that the
aggregate amount debited from all such deposit accounts does not exceed such fee
or other cost or expense. If there are insufficient funds in such deposit
accounts to cover the amount of the fee or other cost or expense then due, such

                                      -32-
<Page>

debits will be reversed (in whole or in part, in Bank of America's sole
discretion) and such amount not debited shall be deemed to be unpaid. No such
debit under this Section shall be deemed a set-off.

     11.12. NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESSES, LENDING OFFICES, Etc. Each Bank shall
notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to
the Bank should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment
instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such
other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.

     11.13. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

     11.14. SEVERABILITY. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

     11.15. NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made and entered into
for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Banks, the Agent
and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and
no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any
direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement
or any of the other L/C Documents.

     11.16. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS; PROVIDED
THAT THE AGENT, THE BANKS AND THE COMPANY SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER
FEDERAL LAW.

     (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER L/C DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OR OF
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, AND BY EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS
CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS

OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE
BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS,
WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY ILLINOIS LAW.

                                      -33-

     11.17. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH
WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER L/C
DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST
ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER
WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY, THE
BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED
BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING
WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER L/C DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF.
THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER L/C DOCUMENTS.

     11.18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the other L/C
Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company,
the Banks and the Agent, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.
