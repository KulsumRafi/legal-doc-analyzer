<P>4.2&#9;Buyer shall not assume any liability arising out of or related to a breach, which occurred prior to Closing with respect to any Assumed Liabilities.</P>

<P>5.1 &#9;<U>Purchase Price.</U>    Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate purchase price of $2,750,000 (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4 and an earn out pursuant to Section 5.7.  </P>

<P>5.2&#9;<U>Deposit</U>.  Upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer will pay a deposit in the amount of $100,000 ("Deposit") into Seller's attorney's escrow account.  The Deposit is refundable, except for the non-performance of Buyer, as set forth in Section 19.1.</P>

<P>5.3&#9;<U>Payment of Purchase Price</U>.

<P>5.4&#9;<U>Adjustments.</U>   </P>

Within 2 days of Closing, Buyer and Seller shall mutually conduct a physical inventory of all Inventory with a mutually acceptable third party (the cost of whom shall be paid equally by Buyer and Seller), who shall determine any disputes related to the calculation of Inventory.  Within 30 days of Closing, Buyer may audit Seller's calculation of Reserves for Inventory, Accounts Receivable and Notes Receivable.  If Buyer does not agree that Reserves were calculated in a manner consistent with past practice using the methodology previously disclosed to Buyer and consistent with GAAP (the "Reserve Calculation"), Buyer and Seller will mutually select an independent accountant to review the Reserve Calculation to determine whether Buyer is entitled to an additional credit, whose determination shall be binding upon the parties.  Payment shall be made by Buyer of any undisputed amounts at Closing, and disputed payments shall be paid by Buyer within 5 days of the earlier of the parties' mutual agreement, or the independent accountant's determination of such disputed payments.

<P> &#9;5.4.4&#9;Buyer shall be entitled to a credit at Closing equal to the amount of any accrued and unpaid Area Developer fees due under any Area Developer Agreement at Closing, which are assumed by Buyer that were accrued by Seller and earned by the Area Developer within 90 days prior to Closing.</P>

<P>5.4.5&#9;The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of prepaid expenditures which Seller has made prior to Closing for maintenance contracts on computer, telephone equipment and other equipment to the extent of the prorated portion of such maintenance contracts that continue after Closing, and to the extent that Buyer, at Buyer's option and in Buyer's sole discretion, determines to assume such contracts. </P>

<P>&#9; &#9;5.7.1 &#9;The 2003 Earn Out shall be payable to Seller if the gross revenue in 2003 for those U.S. franchised and company-owned Stores opened and operating for the entire 2002 calendar year (the "Base Line Stores") and open and operating for the entire 2003 calendar year exceeds their gross revenue in 2002 by 5% or more, as calculated in a manner consistent with the method used in Seller's "Monthly Franchise Sales Reports";</P>

<P>&#9; &#9;5.7.2 &#9;The 2004 Earn Out shall be payable to Seller if the gross revenue for those Base Line Stores for the 13<SUP>th</SUP> thru 24<SUP>th</SUP> calendar months following the Closing exceeds their gross revenue for the prior 12 calendar months by 5% or more;</P>

<P>6. &#9;<B><U>BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVALS, OVERBIDDING PROCEDURES AND BREAK-UP FEES</B></U>.  </P>

<P>6.1&#9;<U>Bankruptcy Covenants.</P>
</U>
<P>6.1.1&#9;Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall:</P>

<P>6.1.1.1&#9;continue to operate its business from and after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case;</P>

<P>6.1.1.2&#9;file a motion, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sections 105, 363, and 365 to approve the sale of the Assets to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, including the overbidding procedures in Section 6.2 and break-up fee in Section 6.3 (the "Approval Motion"); </P>

<P>6.1.1.3&#9;file a motion (the "Cash Collateral Motion") for emergency determination for approval of and authorizing Seller, as borrower, to use cash collateral, such motion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order (the "Cash Collateral Order") within 10 days of the date of this Agreement and a final order within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, and approval of the Approval Motion (the "Approval Order") within 45 days of the date of this Agreement, which orders shall each be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, provided that the Approval Order shall be in a form substantially in conformity with the form of order attached as Schedule 6.1.1.3 and the Cash Collateral Order shall, among other customary terms and provisions, be in form and substance acceptable to Buyer, with only such changes to such orders as shall be agreed to by all of the parties in writing.</P>

<P>6.1.2&#9;Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with drafts of all documents, motions, orders, filings or pleadings that Seller proposes to file with the Bankruptcy Court which relate to the consummation or approval of this Agreement, the Cash Collateral Motion or any other provision of this Agreement, and will provide Buyer with reasonable opportunity to review and approve such proposed filings as reasonably practical.  Seller shall also promptly (within 24&nbsp;hours) provide Buyer with facsimile copies of all pleadings received by or served by or upon Seller in connection with its Bankruptcy Case, which have not otherwise been served on Buyer.</P>

<P>6.1.3&#9;Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at its sole cost and expense, the entry of a final order authorizing Seller to assign the Franchise Agreements, Developer Agreements, Management Agreements, Kodak Supply Agreement, Agfa Supply Agreement, Trebla Supply Agreement, Leases and Assumed Contracts to Buyer (the "Assignment Order"). Except for Buyer's right to assume payments due from Seller under the Franchise Agreements, Developer Agreements, Kodak Supply Agreement, Agfa Supply Agreement, Trebla Supply Agreement and Assumed Contracts in exchange for a credit toward the Purchase Price payment as provided in Section 5.3 of this Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for the payment, at or prior to Closing of any amounts necessary to cure any defaults which exist at Closing under the Franchise Agreements, Developer Agreements, Management Agreements, Kodak Supply Agreement, Agfa Supply Agreement, Trebla Supply Agreement and Assumed Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if one or more parties to any non-supply related executory contracts asserts a claim or files an objection to Seller's assumption and assignment of their respective contract(s) to Buyer based on a claim or claims which in the aggregate exceed $50,000, which are determined to be valid after notice and hearing and which Seller is unwilling to cure, then the parties shall proceed to Closing without the affected agreement(s) with an abatement to the Purchase Price equal to the percentage reduction in actual collections over the previous 12 months, as a result of the loss of the affected agreements.  For example, if the affected agreements represent 2% of Seller's actual collections during the 12 months immediately preceding Closing, then Buyer would be entitled to a 2% reduction in the Purchase Price.  If the claims exceed $200,000, the Seller may, at its sole option, terminate this Agreement and refund the Deposit to Buyer, without further liability to Buyer.  Buyer shall receive a dollar for dollar credit to the Purchase Price for the net book value of any Account Receivable or Note Receivable associated with any affected agreement, which is not assigned to Buyer and the affected Account Receivable and/or Note Receivable shall not be assigned to Buyer.  Buyer may require, at its sole option, that Seller reject any affected contract pursuant to Section 6.1.4 of this Agreement.  Buyer shall be responsible for providing adequate assurance of its ability to perform the obligations of Seller under these agreements following Closing.  Seller's reasonable commercial efforts shall not require Seller to bear any costs associated with any time, expense or travel of Buyer, its employees, attorneys, accountants or other professionals or agents, or any other costs of Buyer.</P>

<P>6.1.4&#9;Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at its sole cost and expense, to file and obtain approval of the motion(s) to reject those executory contracts identified on Schedule 6.1.4.</P>

<P>6.1.5&#9;From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall not take any action or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, or (ii) result in (A) the reversal, avoidance, revocation, vacating or modification (in any manner which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Buyer's rights hereunder) or (B) the entry of a stay pending appeal, in the cases of each of sub-clauses (A) or (B) of this Section, with respect to the Approval Order, the Cash Collateral Order, the Assignment Order; provided, however, that nothing contained herein will in any way limit Seller's ability to provide notice of the Approval Motion and to comply with requests for information from potential competing bidders for the Assets so long as it complies with the provisions of Section 6.2 and 6.3.</P>

<P>6.2&#9;<U>Overbidding Procedures</U>.  Seller and Buyer agree that no competing bid will be accepted or approved by Seller unless it is made pursuant to terms substantially similar to those contained in this Agreement (a "Competing Bid") and provides for aggregate consideration having a value equal to at least the sum of (i) the Purchase Price, plus $40,000 and in the case of the first bid, the Break Up Fee of $55,000.  Any bidder making a Competing Bid (a "Competing Bidder") shall be required to deliver to Seller and file with the Bankruptcy Court an executed copy of a similar form of asset purchase agreement (the "Competing Bid Agreement") at least 10 calendar days prior to the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, together with evidence of the Competing Bidder's financial ability to consummate the Competing Bid Agreement; and the Competing Bidder shall be required to submit to Seller on or before the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, a certified check drawn to the order of Seller in an amount equal to 5% of the Purchase price of the Competing Bid (the "Competing Bid Deposit").  If 1 or more Competing Bid Agreements are submitted, and after an opportunity for Buyer and all parties who have submitted conforming Competing Bid Agreements to submit additional higher and better offers (each successive Competing Bid Agreement shall be in increments of not less than $40,000 in each successive round of bidding), Seller will request the Bankruptcy Court to determine the prevailing Competing Bidder; if so determined, the prevailing Competing Bidder shall execute and deliver at the Sale Hearing an instrument of irrevocable commitment with terms substantially similar to those described in this Agreement.  If closing is not timely concluded with a successful Competing Bidder, Seller shall be authorized without further bankruptcy court approval to close with the next highest bidder who has satisfied all of the former requirements.  </P>

<P>6.3&#9;<U>Break Up Fee</U>.&#9;Subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the closing of the contemplated transactions by an accepted Competing Bid, if a Competing Bid is approved by order of the Bankruptcy Court, Buyer shall be paid a break up fee of $55,000 (the "Break Up Fee").  Buyer shall be entitled to the Break Up Fee if Seller materially breaches its obligations to proceed with the contemplated transactions for any reason and Buyer terminates this Agreement.  Payment of the Break Up Fee shall (i) be in consideration of Buyer's efforts and expenses in connection with the time and expense (including professional fees, associated bidding and due diligence process and (ii) constitute liquidated and agreed damages in respect of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.  As part of the Approval Motion, Seller shall obtain an order from the Bankruptcy Court that provides that the Break Up Fee constitutes a first priority administrative expense of Seller pursuant to Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and approving its payment upon the earlier of (A) the closing on the Competing Bid, or (B) further order of the Bankruptcy Court.  In the event that the Break Up Fee is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval for the highest allowable Break Up Fee, provided however, that if the Bankruptcy Court does not approve any Break Up Fee, it shall not be a default by Seller under this Agreement.</P>

<P>7. &#9;<B><U>TAXES</U>.</B>&#9;All applicable sales, transfer, documentary use, filing and other taxes and fees, other than the escrow fees, that are due or payable as a result of the conveyance, assignment, transfer, or delivery of the Assets or the Business, levied upon Seller, shall be paid by Seller. </P>

<P>8. &#9;<B><U>CLOSING</U>.</B>  Closing ("Closing") of this transaction shall be on or before January 31, 2003, time being of the essence, or on such other date mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, at which time title and possession of the Assets shall be transferred, conveyed, and delivered to Buyer.  Closing shall be at Seller's offices, or such other location as the parties may mutually agree.  If Closing has not occurred on or before January 31, 2003, Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement and obtain a refund of the Deposit.</P>

<P>9. &#9;<B><U>BUYER'S CONDITIONS OF CLOSING.</U>  </B>Buyer's obligation to purchase the Assets shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:</P>

<P>9.1&#9; Buyer shall have received from a U.S. Bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over Seller, a final order approving this sale under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, free and clear of all liens, claims or encumbrances, including but not limited to any claims of franchisees, area developers, landlords and contracting parties under any Assumed Contracts or Assumed Liabilities, any claims for unpaid wages or any pension, profit sharing or retirement plan or collective bargaining agreement, regarding or relating to "hazardous substances" and/or "hazardous materials" as those terms are defined in any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance,  or any claims relating to any occupational safety or health or compliance with OSHA arising on or before Closing, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer.

<P>9.2&#9;All proceedings to be taken in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all documents incident to this Agreement shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Buyer and its counsel, and Buyer shall have received copies of all of such documents and other evidence as Buyer and its counsel may reasonably request in order to establish the consummation of such transactions.</P>

<P>9.3&#9;There shall have been no materially adverse change or damage to the Assets, or the Business or to Seller's franchisee or customer relationships or material supplier relationships, which has or have a materially negative impact on the Business.  By way of example, a "material change" in the Business would include (i) a material adverse change in franchisee relationships (either in number of franchised stores or in the volume of royalty and advertising fees that such relationships represent); (ii) a reduction in collections by 15% or more as against accrued royalty and advertising fees, calculated as follows: accruals for September 2002 royalty and advertising fees due October 2002, divided by the collections of such fees from October 1, 2002 through October 31, 2002, compared to the accrual for November 2002 royalty and advertising fees due December 2002 divided by the collections of such fees from December 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002; or (iii) any material degradation in the services provided by Area Developers.
