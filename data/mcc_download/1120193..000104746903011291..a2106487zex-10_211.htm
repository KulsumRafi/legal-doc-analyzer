Nasdaq or its applicable Affiliate will also make available to Amex a non-exclusive license to trade such ETF Domestically at a reasonable and usual commercial rate. </FONT></P>

addition to the $4.5&nbsp;million Domestic annual fee, Amex will pay an additional annual fee of $500K to Nasdaq for the right to trade QQQ in Foreign regions. Amex will begin paying this $500K
additional annual fee upon its registration of QQQ for listing on any market in a Foreign region. Although this annual fee will be paid quarterly by Amex on a prorated basis, Amex will adjust the
amount of its payment in the last quarter of each year to ensure that it has paid the entire $500K fee to Nasdaq on an annual basis. If Amex does not trade QQQ in any market in a foreign region, it
will no longer be liable to Nasdaq for the payment of this fee, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that if Amex lists or trades QQQ in any market in a Foreign region
for at least one day in any quarter, Amex will remain liable to pay the entire quarterly fee to Nasdaq for such listing. Amex may also be liable to Nasdaq for the payment of another $500K annual fee,
in addition to the $500K annual fee payable when QQQ becomes registered to trade on any market in a Foreign region, for the right to trade QQQ internationally. If Amex is trading QQQ in any market in
a Foreign region, Amex will be required to pay this second $500K annual fee to Nasdaq if, at the total annual fee of $5&nbsp;million for the right to trade QQQ Domestically and in any market in a
Foreign region, Nasdaq is still able to make the certification pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.03.4.1 (b)(i)&nbsp;or b(ii)&nbsp;above, as applicable. </FONT></P>

addition, Amex shall reimburse Nasdaq for all reasonable expenses incurred by Nasdaq in connection with such listing, including, but not limited to, Nasdaq's reasonable outside legal and other
professional fees related to the filing by Nasdaq of all related applications and the obtaining by Nasdaq of all licenses, permits, consents and approvals required by applicable Governmental Entities.
Nasdaq will use its best commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the Amex's right to list QQQ in any Foreign region within a reasonable time frame. Amex will also be responsible for the payment
of any incremental fees or expenses, including reasonable outside incremental legal and other professional fees, incurred by Nasdaq in addition to the normal fees and related expenses required to
obtain permission to list QQQ in any Foreign region, if Nasdaq incurred such additional fees or expenses due to Amex's failure to provide reasonable advance notice to Nasdaq of Amex's intent to obtain
the right to list QQQ in that region. If Amex reimburses Nasdaq for such costs, and then begins listing QQQ in such Foreign region, Amex will then have the exclusive right to list QQQ in that Foreign
region for a period of ****<SUP>*</SUP> from the date that Amex reimbursed Nasdaq for the costs that Nasdaq incurred in
obtaining Amex's right to list QQQ in that region. If, however, Amex reimburses Nasdaq for such costs, and then refrains from listing or trading QQQ in such Foreign region, Amex will then have the
exclusive right to list QQQ in that Foreign region for a period of ****<SUP>*</SUP> from the date that Amex reimbursed Nasdaq for the costs that Nasdaq incurred in obtaining Amex's right to list
QQQ in that Foreign region. Upon the expiration of this ****<SUP>*</SUP> period, Nasdaq may then: (i)&nbsp;reimburse Amex for the fees and expenses paid by Amex to obtain the right to list QQQ in
that Foreign region; and (ii)&nbsp;begin listing QQQ in that region. If Nasdaq obtains the right to list QQQ in such Foreign region subsequent to any exclusivity period for Amex, then the parties
will equally share the costs incurred by both parties for the right to list QQQ in that Foreign region. </FONT></P>

this assignment has become effective. This assignment will become effective for public dissemination no later than December&nbsp;31, 2001 and is made with no representations or warranties except
that neither Amex nor NASD have previously granted any license to or ownership of the Logo to any other entity. Each of NASD and Amex will use all commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)&nbsp;stop
its current use of the Logo; and (ii)&nbsp;prevent the continued or future use of the Logo in any of their respective materials after the effective date of its assignment</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>,

the American Stock Exchange corporate identity shall be featured prominently and all elements of the logotype should be clearly legible and in conformance with the guidelines for reproduction of the
American Stock Exchange logo. The American Stock Exchange name will not
appear in a manner that looks like, or is similar to, the appearance of NASD-required disclosure language in the advertisement, nor will the American Stock Exchange name be positioned in
close proximity to the NASD-required disclosure language. In advance of finalization and publication, Nasdaq will review with Amex all advertisements in the mediums itemized above (with
"Greek Text" or its substantive equivalent replacing any creative material that Nasdaq reasonably determines is inappropriate to share with Amex) that will use the Amex name, and will consult Amex on
ideas or concerns that they may have about alternate ways to display the Amex name. Nasdaq will continue to reference the American Stock Exchange in its advertising for as long as Amex's license to
trade QQQ remains in effect and Amex pays all licensing fees that are due in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.03.4 herein. Nasdaq further agrees that when referencing an
Amex-listed ETF in its domestic print advertising, domestic direct marketing materials, or on its domestic websites it will indicate that the Amex is a trading venue for the particular
ETF; unless, however, Nasdaq reasonably determines in good-faith that such information is irrelevant. Amex agrees that it will include a reference to Nasdaq, Nasdaq 100 or QQQ in all of
Amex's Family Index Share advertising. In advance of finalization and publication, Amex will review with Nasdaq all such Family Index Share Advertising (with "Greek Text" or its substantive equivalent
replacing any creative material that Amex reasonably determines is inappropriate to share with Nasdaq) that will use the Nasdaq name, and will consult Nasdaq on ideas or concerns that they may have

their obligations under this Agreement may be allocated among the Parties as they may mutually agree upon. The format of all reports and invoices will be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Each
Party will: (i)&nbsp;review each report or invoice upon its receipt of such document in order to verify that it contains the correct information and is in the format agreed upon by the Parties; and
(ii)&nbsp;pay all invoices not then in dispute within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of its receipt of such invoice. If any Party disputes the amount of any invoice or the accuracy of any report, it will
