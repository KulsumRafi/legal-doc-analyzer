                                FOURTH AMENDMENT
                                       TO
                           LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT
                           ---------------------------


         This Fourth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement is entered into as
of November 15, 2002 (the "Amendment"), by and between COMERICA BANK -
CALIFORNIA ("Bank") and PERSISTENCE SOFTWARE, INC. ("Borrower").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

         Borrower and Bank are parties to that certain Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement dated as of March 6, 2002, as amended from time to time
including, but not limited to, by that certain First Amendment to Loan and
Security Agreement dated as of May 6, 2002, that certain Second Amendment to
Loan and Security Agreement dated as of July 3, 2002 and that certain Third
Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement dated as of July 17, 2002
(collectively, the "Agreement"). The parties desire to amend the Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

         1. Section 6.9 of the Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to
read as follows:

                  6.9 TANGIBLE NET WORTH. On a consolidated basis, Borrower
         shall maintain a Tangible Net Worth of at least $4,000,000, provided
         that such required amount shall increase by 50% of Borrower's net
         income after taxes in each quarter after November 15, 2002 and by 75%
         of any proceeds received by Borrower from the sale or issuance of its
         equity or debt securities after November 15, 2002. This covenant shall
         be measured as of the last day of each quarter, provided that, at any
         time that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Advances plus the
         aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit is
         in excess of $400,000, this covenant shall be measured as of the last
         day of each month.


         2. EXHIBIT D to the Agreement is hereby amended and replaced in its
entirety by EXHIBIT D attached hereto.

         3. Bank waives failure to comply with Section 6.9 of the Agreement for
the quarter ended on September 30, 2002, as such section was in effect prior to
this Amendment. Bank does not waive any other failure by Borrower to perform its
Obligations under the Loan Documents and Bank does not waive any Obligations
Borrower may have under the Agreement after the date hereof. This waiver is not
a continuing waiver with respect to any failure to perform any Obligation after
the date of this Amendment.

         4. Unless otherwise defined herein, all initially capitalized terms in
this Amendment shall be as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement, as amended
hereby, shall be and remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
respective terms and hereby is ratified and confirmed in all respects. Except as
expressly set forth herein, the execution, delivery, and performance of this
Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of, or as an amendment of, any right,
power, or remedy of Bank under the Agreement, as in effect prior to the date
hereof. Borrower ratifies and reaffirms the continuing effectiveness of the
Agreement and all instruments, documents and agreements entered into in
connection with the Agreement.

         5. Borrower represents and warrants that: (i) the representations and
warranties contained in the Agreement are true and correct as of the date of
this Amendment, (ii) that Borrower is in compliance with the intellectual
property registration requirements set forth in Section 6.10 of the Agreement
and that Borrower has notified Bank of such required registrations in compliance
with Section 6.3 of the Agreement and (iii) that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

         6. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one instrument.

                                       1

         7. As a condition to the effectiveness of this Amendment, Bank shall
have received, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, the following:

                  (a) this Amendment, duly executed by Borrower;

                  (b) a restructure fee equal to Five Hundred Dollars ($500),
which shall be nonrefundable as of the date of this Amendment and which Bank

this Amendment, plus an amount equal to all Bank Expenses incurred through the
date of this Amendment; and

                  (c) such other documents, and completion of such other
matters, as Bank may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate.

the first date above written.
