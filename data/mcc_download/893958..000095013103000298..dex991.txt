          (c)  It is the intention of the Seller and the Issuer that the

part of the Seller's estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition
by or against the Seller under any bankruptcy law.

          (d)  The foregoing sales do not constitute and are not intended to
result in any assumption by the Issuer of any obligation of the Seller to the
Obligors, Dealers, insurers or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables, any Dealer Agreements, any insurance policies or any agreement or
instrument relating to any of them.

          (e)  Within two Business Days after the Initial Closing Date, with
respect to the Initial Receivables, and within two Business Days after each
related Additional Closing Date, with respect to the Additional Receivables,
GMAC shall cause to be deposited into the Collection Account the collections on
the Receivables described in Section 5.07 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement; provided, that so long as the Monthly Remittance Conditions are
satisfied, such collections need not be deposited until the Distribution Date
immediately following the Initial Closing Date or Additional Closing Date, as
applicable.

     Section 2.02 Custody of Receivable Files. In connection with the sale,
transfer and assignment of the Receivables to the Issuer pursuant to this
Agreement and the related Second Step Receivables Assignments, GMAC, as
Custodian under the Custodian Agreement, agrees to act as Custodian thereunder
for the benefit of the Issuer. The Issuer hereby accepts and agrees to

                                        3

<PAGE>

the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement and designates GMAC as
custodian with respect to the Receivables Files.

     Section 2.03  Acceptance by Issuer. The Issuer does hereby accept all
consideration conveyed by the Seller pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and will accept
all consideration to be conveyed pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and declares that
the Issuer shall hold such consideration upon the trust set forth in the Trust
Agreement for the benefit of Certificateholders, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Indenture and this Agreement and the related Second Step
Receivables Assignments and the rights of Noteholders with respect thereto. The
Issuer hereby agrees to and accepts the appointment and authorization of GMAC as
Servicer under Section 3.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The parties
agree that this Agreement, the Second Step Assignments, the Indenture, the Trust
Agreement, the Notes and the Certificates constitute the Further Transfer and
Servicing Agreements for purposes of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
that the rights, duties and obligations of GMAC as Servicer under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement are subject to the provisions of Sections 6.02, 6.04,
6.05, 9.01 and Article VII hereof.

     Section 2.04  Representations and Warranties as to the Receivables.
Pursuant to Section 2.01(e), the Seller assigns to the Issuer all of its right,
title and interest in, to and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Such
assigned right, title and interest includes the representations and warranties
of GMAC made to the Seller pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Issuer that the
Seller has taken no action which would cause such representations and warranties
of GMAC to be false in any material respect as of the Initial Closing Date, with
respect to the Initial Receivables, and as of the related Additional Closing
Date, with respect to the Additional Receivables. The Seller further
acknowledges that the Issuer relies on the representations and warranties of the
Seller under this Agreement and of GMAC under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement in accepting the Receivables in trust and executing and delivering the
Notes and the Certificates. The foregoing representation and warranty speaks as
of the Initial Closing Date with respect to the Initial Receivables, and as of
the related Additional Closing Date, with respect to the Additional Receivables,
but shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables to the
Issuer and the pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture.

     Section 2.05  Repurchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty. Upon
discovery by the Seller, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and warranties in Section 4.01
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in Section 2.04 or Section 3.01 of
this Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Noteholders or the Certificateholders in any Receivable, the party discovering
such breach shall give prompt written notice thereof to the others. On the
Distribution Date related to the second Monthly Period following its discovery
or its receipt of notice of breach (or, at the Seller's election, the last day
of the first Monthly Period following such discovery), unless such breach shall
have been cured in all material respects, in the event of a breach of the
representations and warranties made by the Seller in Section 2.04 or Section
3.01, the Seller shall repurchase, or in the event of a breach of a
representation and warranty under Section 4.01 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Seller and the Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to enforce
the obligation of GMAC under Section 5.04 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
to

                                        4

<PAGE>

repurchase such Receivable from the Issuer. The repurchase price to be paid by
the breaching party (the "Warranty Purchaser") shall be an amount equal to the
Warranty Payment calculated as of the last day of the related Monthly Period.
Upon repurchase and payment of such Warranty Payment, the Warranty Purchaser
shall be entitled to receive the Released Warranty Amount, if any. It is
understood and agreed that the obligation of the Warranty Purchaser to
repurchase any Receivable as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing,
and the obligation of the Seller and the Servicer to enforce GMAC's obligation
to repurchase such Receivables pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
shall, if such obligations are fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the
Seller, the Servicer or GMAC for such breach available to the Issuer, the
Financial Parties, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee. The Servicer also
acknowledges its obligations to repurchase Administrative Receivables from the
Issuer pursuant to Section 3.08 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

     Section 2.06  Realization Upon Liquidating Receivables. The Servicer shall
use all reasonable efforts, consistent with its customary servicing procedures,
to repossess or take other similar action with respect to any Financed Vehicle
that it has reasonably determined should be repossessed or such other action
taken following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed Vehicle.
The Servicer is authorized to follow such practices, policies and procedures as
it customarily follows with respect to comparable automotive receivables that it
services for itself or others, which practices, policies and procedures may
include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to Dealers, selling the
related Financed Vehicle at public or private sale and the taking of other
actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer
is hereby authorized to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary
servicing procedures and the terms of the Basic Documents, in servicing
Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize the net collection of those
Liquidating Receivables, including the discretion to choose to sell or not to
sell any of the Liquidating Receivables on behalf of the Issuer. The Servicer
shall not be liable for any such exercise of its discretion made in good faith
and in accordance with such servicing procedures. The foregoing is subject to
the provision that, in any case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have
suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any
repair or towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion and in accordance with such servicing procedures
that such repair and/or repossession shall increase the proceeds of liquidation
of the related Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses.
The Servicer shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to
each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes a Liquidating
Receivable.

certificates and other documents with respect to such interests and perform all
such other acts as may be necessary in order to perfect or to maintain the
perfection of the Indenture Trustee's security interest; and

               (ii)    make the necessary filings of financing statements or

or occurrence that would make any financing statement or amendment thereto
seriously misleading within the meaning of the UCC; and shall promptly notify
the Indenture Trustee of any such filings.

          (e)  If the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.04 determines on any
Determination Date that it is required to make a Monthly Advance and does not do
so from its own funds, the Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to
withdraw funds from the Reserve Account and deposit them in the Collection
Account to cover any shortfall. Such payment shall be deemed to

Servicer's obligation to deliver the amount of the Monthly Advances, and the

the Reserve Account.

                 COLLECTIONS, DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS; ADVANCES

     Section 5.01  Establishment of Accounts.

          (a)  (i)    The Servicer, for the benefit of the Financial Parties,
shall establish and maintain in the name of the Indenture Trustee an Eligible
Deposit Account known as the Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2003-1
Collection Account (the "Collection Account"), bearing an additional designation
clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of
the Financial Parties.

               (ii)   The Servicer, for the benefit of the Noteholders, shall
establish and maintain in the name of the Indenture Trustee an Eligible Deposit
Account known as the Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2003-1 Note
Distribution Account (the "Note Distribution Account"), bearing an additional
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the
benefit of the Noteholders.

               (iii)  If and as required pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the
Servicer, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall establish and
maintain in the name of the Issuer an Eligible Deposit Account known as the
Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2003-1 Certificate Distribution Account
(the "Certificate Distribution Account") bearing an additional designation
clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of
the Certificateholders.

               (iv)   The Servicer, for the benefit of the Obligors, shall
establish and maintain in the name of the Indenture Trustee an account known as
the Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2003-1 Payment Ahead Servicing Account
(the "Payment Ahead Servicing Account"). The Payment Ahead Servicing Account
shall not be property of the Issuer.

               (v)    The Servicer, for the benefit of the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the Indenture
Trustee an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital Auto Receivables Asset
Trust 2003-1 Accumulation Account (the "Accumulation Account"), bearing an
additional designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are
held for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Certificateholders.

          (b)  (i)    Each of the Designated Accounts and the Payment Ahead
Servicing Account shall be initially established with the Indenture Trustee and
shall be maintained with the Indenture Trustee so long as (A) the short-term
unsecured debt obligations of the Indenture Trustee have the Required Deposit
Rating or (B) each of the Designated Accounts are maintained in the corporate
trust department of the Indenture Trustee. All amounts held in such accounts
(including amounts, if any, which the Servicer is required to remit daily to the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.02) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable laws, rules and regulations, be invested, at the written direction of
the Servicer, by such bank or trust company in Eligible Investments. Such
written direction shall constitute certification by the Servicer that any such
investment is authorized by this Section 5.01. Funds deposited in the Reserve
Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments which mature prior to the next

                                       19

<PAGE>

Distribution Date, and then only to the extent, as shall be otherwise permitted
by the Rating Agencies. Investments in Eligible Investments shall be made in the
name of the Indenture Trustee or its nominee, and such investments shall not be
sold or disposed of prior to their maturity; provided, however, that Notes held
in the Reserve Account may be sold or disposed of prior to their maturity so
long as (x) the Servicer directs the Indenture Trustee to make such sale or
disposition, (y) the Indenture Trustee gives reasonable prior notice of such
disposition to the Administrator and (z) such Notes are sold at a price equal to
or greater than the unpaid principal balance thereof if, following such sale,
the amount on deposit in the Reserve Account would be less than the Specified
Reserve Account Balance. Should the short-term unsecured debt obligations of the
Indenture Trustee (or any other bank or trust company with which the Designated
Accounts or Payment Ahead Servicing Account are maintained) no longer have the
Required Deposit Rating, then the Servicer shall within 10 Business Days (or
such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which each Rating
Agency shall consent), with the Indenture Trustee's assistance as necessary,
cause the Designated Accounts and the Payment Ahead Servicing Account (A) to be
moved to a bank or trust company, the short-term unsecured debt obligations of
which shall have the Required Deposit Rating, or (B) with respect to the
Designated Accounts, to be moved to the corporate trust department of the
Indenture Trustee. Investment Earnings on funds deposited in the Designated
Accounts and the Payment Ahead Servicing Account shall be payable to the
Servicer. The Indenture Trustee or the other Person holding the Designated
Accounts as provided in this Section 5.01(b)(i) shall be the "Securities
Intermediary." If the Securities Intermediary shall be a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee, the Servicer shall obtain the express agreement of such
Person to the obligations of the Securities Intermediary set forth in this
Section 5.01 and an Opinion of Counsel that such Person can perform such
Obligations.

               (ii)   With respect to the Designated Account Property, the
Indenture Trustee agrees, by its acceptance hereof, that:

                      (A)  Any Designated Account Property that is held in
deposit accounts shall be held solely in Eligible Deposit Accounts. The
Designated Accounts are accounts to which Financial Assets will be credited.

                      (B)  All securities or other property underlying any
Financial Assets credited to the Designated Accounts shall be registered in the
name of the Securities Intermediary, indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or
in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the
Securities Intermediary and in no case will any Financial Asset credited to any
of the Designated Accounts be registered in the name of the Issuer, the Servicer
or the Seller, payable to the order of the Issuer, the Servicer or the Seller or
specially indorsed to the Issuer, the Servicer or the Seller except to the
extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the Securities Intermediary
or in blank.

                      (C)  All property delivered to the Securities Intermediary
pursuant to this Agreement will be credited upon receipt of such property to the
appropriate Designated Account.

                                       20

<PAGE>

                      (D) Each item of property (whether investments, investment
property, Financial Asset, security, instrument or cash) credited to a
Designated Account shall be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York UCC.

                      (E) If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall
receive any order from the Indenture Trustee directing transfer or redemption of
any Financial Asset relating to the Designated Accounts, the Securities
Intermediary shall comply with such order without further consent by the Trust,
the Servicer, the Seller or any other Person.

                      (F) The Designated Accounts shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New York, regardless of any provision in any other agreement.
For purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Securities
Intermediary's jurisdiction and the Designated Accounts (as well as the Security
Entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York.

                      (G) The Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and
until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with
any other Person relating to the Designated Accounts and/or any Financial Assets
or other property credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply
with entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the New York UCC)
of such other Person and the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and
until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with
the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee purporting to
limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply with
entitlement orders as set forth in Section 5.01(b)(ii)(E) hereof.

                      (H) Except for the claims and interest of the Indenture
Trustee in the Designated Accounts, the Securities Intermediary has no knowledge
of claims to, or interests in, the Designated Accounts or in any Financial Asset
credited thereto. If any other Person asserts any Lien, encumbrance or adverse
claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment,
execution or similar process) against the Designated Accounts or in any
Financial Asset carried therein, the Securities Intermediary will promptly
notify the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Issuer thereof.

                      (I) The Securities Intermediary will promptly send copies
of all statements, confirmations and other correspondence concerning the
Designated Accounts and/or any Designated Account Property simultaneously to
each of the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee, at the addresses set forth in
Appendix B to this Agreement.

                      (J) The Indenture Trustee shall maintain each item of
Designated Account Property in the particular Designated Account to which such
item originated and shall not commingle items from different Designated
Accounts.

               (iii)  The Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the
Indenture Trustee (or by the Owner Trustee with the consent of the Indenture
Trustee) to instruct the Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from
the Designated Accounts for the purpose of permitting the Servicer or the Owner
Trustee to carry out its respective duties hereunder or permitting the Indenture
Trustee to carry out its duties under the Indenture.

                                       21

<PAGE>

                     (iv) The Indenture Trustee shall possess all right, title
and interest in and to all funds on deposit from time to time in the Designated
Accounts and in all proceeds thereof (except Investment Earnings). Except as
otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, the Designated Accounts shall be
under the exclusive dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the
benefit of the Securityholders and the Indenture Trustee shall have sole
signature power and authority with respect thereto.

                     (v) The Servicer shall not direct the Indenture Trustee to
make any investment of any funds or to sell any investment held in any of the
Designated Accounts unless the security interest granted and perfected in such
account shall continue to be perfected in such investment or the proceeds of
such sale, in either case without any further action by any Person, and, in
connection with any direction to the Indenture Trustee to make any such
investment or sale, if requested by the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer shall
deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, acceptable to the
Indenture Trustee, to such effect.

              (c)    Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Issuer shall possess
all right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit from time to time
in the Certificate Distribution Account and in all proceeds thereof (except
Investment Earnings). Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Trust
Agreement, the Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion
and control of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. If,
at any time, the Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible
Deposit Account, the Owner Trustee (or the Seller on behalf of the Owner
Trustee, if the Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner
Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer
period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which each Rating Agency may
consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an Eligible Deposit
Account and shall transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new
Certificate Distribution Account.

              (d)    The Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Securities
Intermediary and each other Eligible Deposit Institution with whom a Designated
Account or the Certificate Distribution Account is maintained waives any right
of set-off, counterclaim, security interest or bankers' lien to which it might
otherwise be entitled.

              (e)    At any time that each Monthly Remittance Condition is
satisfied, then (x) Payments Ahead need not be remitted to and deposited in the
Payment Ahead Servicing Account but instead may be remitted to and held by the
Servicer and (y) the Servicer shall not be required to segregate or otherwise
hold separate any Payments Ahead, but the Servicer shall be required to remit
Applied Payments Ahead to the Collection Account in accordance with Section
4.06(b)(ii). The Servicer shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee if any
Monthly Remittance Condition ceases to be satisfied such that the Payments Ahead
will not be remitted in accordance with the prior sentence. Commencing with the
first day of the first Monthly Period that begins at least two Business Days
after the day on which any Monthly Remittance Condition ceases to be satisfied,
the Servicer shall deposit in the Payment Ahead Servicing Account the amount of
any Payments Ahead then held by it, and thereafter, for so long as a Monthly
Remittance Condition continues to be unsatisfied, the Servicer shall deposit any
additional Payments Ahead in the Payments Ahead Servicing Account within two
Business Days after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Monthly
Remittance Condition is unsatisfied the Servicer may utilize, with respect to
the Payments Ahead, an alternative remittance schedule

                                       22

<PAGE>

(which may include a remittance schedule utilized by the Servicer at a time when
the Monthly Remittance Conditions were satisfied), if the Servicer provides to
the Indenture Trustee written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that such
alternative remittance schedule will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal
by the Rating Agencies of the ratings then assigned to either the Notes or the
Certificates. Neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall be
deemed to have knowledge of any Servicer Default unless such trustee has
received notice of such event or circumstance from the other trustee, the Seller
or the Servicer in an officer's certificate or from Certificateholders whose
Certificates evidence not less than 25% of the Voting Interests as of the close
of the preceding Distribution Date or from Noteholders whose Notes evidence not
less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes as of the close of the
preceding Distribution Date or unless a Responsible Officer in the Corporate
Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee with knowledge hereof and familiarity
herewith has actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.

     Section 5.02 Collections. If a Monthly Remittance Condition is not
satisfied, commencing with the first day of the first Monthly Period that begins
at least two Business Days after the day on which any Monthly Remittance
Condition ceases to be satisfied, the Servicer shall remit to the Collection
Account all payments by or on behalf of the Obligors (including Payments Ahead
in accordance with Section 5.01(e)) on the Receivables and all Liquidation
Proceeds within two Business Days after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Monthly Remittance Condition is unsatisfied, the Servicer may
utilize an alternative remittance schedule (which may include a remittance
schedule utilized by the Servicer at a time when the Monthly Remittance
Conditions were satisfied), if the Servicer provides to the Indenture Trustee
written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that such alternative remittance
schedule will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal by the Rating Agencies
of the ratings then assigned to the Notes or the Certificates. At all times when
all Monthly Remittance Conditions are satisfied, the Servicer (i) shall not be
required to segregate or otherwise hold separate any Payments Ahead remitted to
the Servicer and (ii) shall remit collections received during a Monthly Period
to the Collection Account in immediately available funds on or before the
related Distribution Date (or in the case of amounts payable to the Swap
Counterparty pursuant to Section 4.06(c)(ii), if any, on or before the Business
Day preceding the Distribution Date).

     Section 5.03 Investment Earnings and Supplemental Servicing Fees. The
Servicer shall be entitled to receive all Investment Earnings (with the
exception of Investment Earnings on funds in the Accumulation Account) and
Supplemental Servicing Fees when and as paid without any obligation to the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Seller in respect thereof. The Servicer
will have no obligation to deposit any such amount in any account established
hereunder. To the extent that any such amount shall be held in any account held
by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, or otherwise established
hereunder, such amount will be withdrawn therefrom and paid to the Servicer upon
presentation of a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amount of such Investment Earnings or
Supplemental Servicing Fees.

     Section 5.04 Monthly Advances.

             (a) Subject to the following sentence, as of the last day of each
Monthly Period, with respect to each Scheduled Interest Receivable (other than
an Administrative

                                       23

<PAGE>

Receivable or a Warranty Receivable), if there is a shortfall in the Scheduled
Payment remaining after application of the Deferred Prepayment pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 3.11(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Servicer shall advance an amount equal to such shortfall (such amount, a
"Scheduled Interest Advance"). The Servicer shall be obligated to make a
Scheduled Interest Advance in respect of a Scheduled Interest Receivable only to
the extent that the Servicer, in its sole discretion, shall determine that such
advance shall be recoverable from subsequent collections or recoveries on any
Receivable. The Servicer shall be reimbursed for Outstanding Scheduled Interest
Advances with respect to a Receivable from the following sources with respect to
such Receivable, in each case as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement: (i) subsequent payments by or on behalf of the Obligor, (ii)
collections of Liquidation Proceeds, and (iii) the Warranty Payment. At such
time as the Servicer shall determine that any Outstanding Scheduled Interest
Advances with respect to any Scheduled Interest Receivable shall not be
recoverable from payments with respect to such Receivable, the Servicer shall be
reimbursed from any collections made on other Receivables held by the Issuer.

              (b) As of the last day of each Monthly Period, the Servicer shall
advance an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that would be due during such Monthly Period on all Simple Interest Receivables
held by the Issuer (assuming that the payment on each such Receivable was
received on its respective due date) over (ii) all payments received during such
Monthly Period on all Simple Interest Receivables held by the Issuer to the
extent allocable to interest (such excess, a "Simple Interest Advance"). In
addition, Liquidation Proceeds with respect to a Simple Interest Receivable
allocable to accrued and unpaid interest thereon (but not including interest for
the then current Monthly Period) shall be paid to the Servicer but only to the
extent of any Outstanding Simple Interest Advances. The Servicer shall not make
any advance with respect to principal of any Simple Interest Receivable. Excess
Simple Interest Collections shall be paid to the Servicer as provided in Section
3.11(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

     Section 5.05 Additional Deposits. The Servicer shall deposit in the
Collection Account the aggregate Monthly Advances pursuant to Sections 5.04(a)
and (b) and the aggregate amounts to be paid to the Issuer pursuant to Section
3.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Servicer and the Seller shall
deposit in the Collection Account the aggregate Administrative Purchase Payments
and Warranty Payments with respect to Administrative Receivables and Warranty
Receivables, respectively. All such deposits with respect to a Monthly Period
shall be made in immediately available funds on or before the Distribution Date
related to such Monthly Period (or, to the extent such funds are necessary to
make payments due, if any, under any Interest Rate Swaps for the related Monthly
Period, on or before the Business Day preceding the Distribution Date).

                       LIABILITIES OF SERVICER AND OTHERS

     Section 6.01 Liability of Servicer; Indemnities.

             (a) The Servicer shall be liable in accordance with this Agreement
and the Second Step Receivables Assignments only to the extent of the
obligations in this Agreement

                                       24

and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement specifically undertaken by the Servicer.
Such obligations shall include the following:

              (i) The Servicer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Issuer, the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims and liabilities arising out of or resulting from the use,
ownership or operation by the Servicer or any affiliate thereof of any Financed
Vehicle;

              (ii) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Issuer from and against any taxes
that may at any time be asserted against any such Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
sales, gross receipts, general corporation, tangible personal property,
privilege or license taxes (but not including any taxes asserted with respect
to, and as of the date of, the sale of the Receivables to the Issuer or the
issuance and original sale of the Notes and the Certificates, or asserted with
respect to ownership of the Receivables, or federal or other income taxes
arising out of distributions on the Notes or the Certificates, or any fees or
other compensation payable to any such Person) and costs and expenses in
defending against the same;

              (iii) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Issuer, the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims,
damages, and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim,
damage, or liability arose out of, or was imposed upon the Indenture Trustee,

the negligence, willful misfeasance or bad faith of the Servicer in the
performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement or any other Basic Document or
by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust
Agreement or any other Basic Document; and

              (iv) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, and their respective agents and
servants, from and against all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages and
liabilities arising out of or incurred in connection with (x) in the case of the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee's performance of its duties under the
Indenture or any other Basic Document, (y) in the case of the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee's performance of its duties under the Trust Agreement or (z)
the acceptance, administration or performance by, or action or inaction of, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, of the trusts and duties
contained in this Agreement, the Basic Documents, the Indenture (in the case of
the Indenture Trustee), including the administration of the Trust Estate, and
the Trust Agreement (in case of the Owner Trustee), including the administration
of the Owner Trust Estate, except in each case to the extent that such cost,
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability: (A) is due to the willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except for errors in judgment) of the
Person indemnified, (B) to the extent otherwise payable to the Indenture
Trustee, arises from the Indenture Trustee's breach of any of its
representations or warranties in Section 6.13 of the Indenture, (C) to the
extent otherwise payable to the Owner Trustee, arises from the Owner Trustee's
breach of any of its representations or

                                       25

<PAGE>

warranties set forth in Section 6.6 of the Trust Agreement, or (D) shall arise
out of or be incurred in connection with the performance by the Indenture
Trustee of the duties of successor Servicer hereunder.

             (b) Indemnification under this Section 6.01 shall include, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of external counsel and expenses of
litigation. If the Servicer has made any indemnity payments pursuant to this
Section 6.01 and the recipient thereafter collects any of such amounts from
others, the recipient shall promptly repay such amounts collected to the
Servicer, without interest.

     Section 6.02 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations
of the Servicer. Any corporation or other entity (a) into which the Servicer may
be merged or consolidated, (b) resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, (c) succeeding to the
business of the Servicer, or (d) more than 50% of the voting stock (or, if not a
corporation, other voting interests) of which is owned directly or indirectly by
General Motors and which is otherwise servicing the Seller's receivables, which
corporation in any of the foregoing cases executes an agreement of assumption to
perform every obligation of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, shall be the successor to the Servicer under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties to this
Agreement, anything in this Agreement or in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer shall provide notice of any
merger, consolidation or succession pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the Rating
Agencies.

     Section 6.03 Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.

             (a) Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or
employees or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Issuer,
the Noteholders or the Certificateholders, except as specifically provided in
this Agreement and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, for any action taken
or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement, the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the
Servicer or any such Person against any liability that would otherwise be
imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors
in judgment) in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties under this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement. The Servicer and any director,
officer or employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on the
advice of counsel or on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed
and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising under this Agreement
or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

             (b) The Servicer and any director or officer or employee or agent
of the Servicer shall be reimbursed by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Trustee, as applicable, for any contractual damages, liability or expense
(including, without limitation, any obligation of the Servicer to the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(iv)(x)
or (y)) incurred by reason of such trustee's willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence (except errors in judgment) in the performance of such
trustee's duties under

                                       26

<PAGE>

this Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement or by reason of reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

             (c) Except as provided in this Agreement or in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear
in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not incidental to its duties to
service the Receivables in accordance with this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement or
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties to
this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the interests of the
Noteholders and the Certificateholders under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the interests of the Noteholders under the Indenture and
the interests of the Certificateholders under the Trust Agreement. In such
event, the legal expenses and costs for such action and any liability resulting
therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust and the Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor.

             (d) The Applicable Trustee shall distribute out of the Collection
Account on a Distribution Date any amounts permitted for reimbursement pursuant
to Section 6.03(c) not therefor reimbursed; provided, however, that the
Applicable Trustee shall not distribute such amounts if the amount on deposit in
the Reserve Account (after giving effect to all deposits and withdrawals
pursuant to Sections 4.06(b) and (c) and Section 4.07(e), on such Distribution
Date) is greater than zero but less than the Specified Reserve Account Balance
for such Distribution Date.

     Section 6.04 Delegation of Duties. So long as GMAC acts as Servicer, the
Servicer may, at any time without notice or consent, delegate any duties under
this Agreement or under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to any corporation
or other Person more than 50% of the voting stock (or, if not a corporation,
other voting interests) of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by General
Motors. The Servicer may at any time perform specific duties as Servicer through
sub-contractors who are in the business of servicing automotive receivables;
provided, however, that no such delegation shall relieve the Servicer of its
responsibility with respect to such duties.

                                       27

     Section 6.05 Servicer Not to Resign. Subject to the provisions of Section
7.02, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties imposed on
it by this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as Servicer except
upon determination that the performance of its duties under this Agreement or
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as the case may be, is no longer
permissible under applicable law. Any such determination permitting the
resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such
effect delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee. No such
resignation shall become effective until the Indenture Trustee or a successor
Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer
in accordance with Section 7.02.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                     DEFAULT

     Section 7.01 Servicer Defaults. Each of the following shall constitute a
"Servicer Default":

             (a) any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Indenture Trustee
for deposit in any of the Designated Accounts or to the Owner Trustee for
deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account any required payment or to
direct the Indenture Trustee to make any required distributions therefrom, which
failure continues unremedied for a period of five Business Days after written
notice is received by the Servicer from the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Trustee or after discovery of such failure by an officer of the Servicer;

             (b) failure on the part of the Seller or the Servicer to duly
observe or perform in any material respect any other covenants or agreements of
the Seller or the Servicer set forth in this Agreement, the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement which failure (i)
materially and adversely affects the rights of Noteholders or
Certificateholders, and (ii) continues unremedied for a period of 90 days after
the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be
remedied, shall have been given to the Seller or the Servicer, as applicable, by
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, or to the Seller or the Servicer, as
applicable, and to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee by Noteholders
whose Notes evidence not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes as
of the close of the preceding Distribution Date or by Certificateholders whose
Certificates evidence not less than 25% of the Voting Interests as of the close
of the preceding Distribution Date;

             (c) the entry of a decree or order by a court or agency or
supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of
a conservator, receiver or liquidator for the Seller or the Servicer, in any
insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or
similar proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of their respective
affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect
for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

             (d) the consent by the Seller or the Servicer to the appointment of
a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
marshalling of assets and liabilities, or similar proceedings of or relating to
the Seller or the Servicer or of or relating to substantially all of their
respective property; or the Seller or the Servicer shall admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take

                                       28

advantage of any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of
its obligations.

     Section 7.02 Consequences of a Servicer Default. If a Servicer Default
shall occur and be continuing, either the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
whose Notes evidence not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the
Notes as of the close of the preceding Distribution Date (or, if the Notes have
been paid in full and the Indenture has been discharged in accordance with its
terms, by the Owner Trustee or Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence
not less than a majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of the
preceding Distribution Date) by notice then given in writing to the Servicer and
the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture Trustee if given by the Noteholders or
the Certificateholders) may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. On or
after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the Certificates or the
Receivables or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to and under this Section 7.02. The Indenture Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of the Receivables and related documents, or otherwise. The Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer
under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including, without
limitation, the transfer to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee for
administration by it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the
Servicer for deposit, or that shall have been deposited by the Servicer in the
Collection Account, the Note Distribution Account, the Certificate Distribution
Account or the Payment Ahead Servicing Account or thereafter received with
respect to the Receivables and all Payments Ahead that shall at that time be
held by the Servicer. In addition to any other amounts that are then payable to
the Servicer under this Agreement, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive
from the successor Servicer reimbursements for any Outstanding Monthly Advances
made during the period prior to the notice pursuant to this Section 7.02 which
terminates the obligation and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement.

     Section 7.03 Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. On and
after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section
7.02, the Indenture Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to the
Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for in this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and shall be subject to all
the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and liabilities relating thereto
placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the Collection
Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been entitled to under this
Agreement if no such notice of termination had been given including, but not
limited to, the Total Servicing Fee, Investment Earnings and Supplemental
Servicing Fees. Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee may, if it
shall be unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act,
appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a successor
(i) having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000, (ii) a long-term unsecured
debt

                                       29

<PAGE>

rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. of at least Baa3 (unless such
requirement is expressly waived by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) and (iii)
whose regular business includes the servicing of automotive receivables, as the
successor to the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties
or liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the
Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such
successor out of payments on Receivables as it and such successor shall agree;
provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
permitted the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. The Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as shall
be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

     Section 7.04 Notification to Noteholders and Certificateholders. Upon any
termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this
Article VII, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to
the Noteholders and the Rating Agencies and the Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice thereof to the Certificateholders.

     Section 7.05 Waiver of Past Defaults. Noteholders whose Notes evidence not
less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes as of the close of
the preceding Distribution Date (or, if all of the Notes have been paid in full
and the Indenture has been discharged in accordance with its terms,
Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than a majority of the
Voting Interests as of the close of the preceding Distribution Date) may, on
behalf of all Noteholders and Certificateholders, waive any default by the
Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences,
except a default in making any required deposits to or payments from any of the
accounts in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any such waiver of a past
default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No such waiver shall extend
to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

     Section 7.06 Repayment of Advances. If the identity of the Servicer shall
change, the predecessor Servicer shall be entitled to receive, to the extent of
available funds, reimbursement for Outstanding Monthly Advances pursuant to
Section 5.04 in the manner specified in Section 4.06 with respect to all Monthly
Advances made by such predecessor Servicer.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TERMINATION

     Section 8.01 Optional Purchase of All Receivables; Insolvency of Seller;
Termination of Trust.

           (a)    (i) The Servicer shall have the option to purchase the assets
of the Trust (other than the Designated Accounts and the Certificate Account) as
of any date (the "Optional Purchase Date") which is the last day of any Monthly
Period as of which the Aggregate Discounted Principal Balance is 10% or less of
the Initial Aggregate Discounted Principal Balance. To exercise such option, the
Servicer shall (A) furnish to the Issuer and the

                                       30

<PAGE>

Indenture Trustee notice of its intention to exercise such option and of the
Optional Purchase Date (such notice to be furnished not later than 25 days prior
to the Distribution Date related to such Optional Purchase Date) and (B) deposit
in the Collection Account when required pursuant to Clause (ii) below an amount
equal to the aggregate Administrative Purchase Payments for the Receivables
(including Liquidating Receivables), plus the appraised value of any other
property held by the Trust (less the Liquidation Expenses to be incurred in
connection with the recovery thereof), provided, that such amount (when added to
any funds then on deposit in the Designated Accounts and the Certificate
Distribution Account) must be at least equal to the aggregate Redemption Price
of the outstanding Notes to be redeemed and the Certificate Balance plus accrued
and unpaid interest on all Certificates to be retired early with such proceeds
plus any amount payable to the Swap Counterparty under any Interest Rate Swap,
in each case, calculated as of the date such payment is to be made. Such
appraised value shall be determined by an appraiser mutually satisfactory to the
Seller, Servicer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee.

          (ii) The Servicer shall make such deposit set forth in Clause (i)(B)
above in immediately available funds on the Distribution Date related to the
Optional Purchase Date, except that if any Monthly Remittance Condition is not
satisfied on the Optional Purchase Date, such deposit shall instead be made on
the Optional Purchase Date. Upon the making of such deposit, the Servicer shall
succeed to all interests in and to the Trust (other than the Designated Accounts
and the Certificate Account).

          (b)  Upon any sale or other disposition of the assets of the Trust
pursuant to Article V of the Indenture (an "Event of Default Sale"), the
Servicer shall instruct the Applicable Trustee to deposit into the Collection
Account from the proceeds of such disposition the amount specified in clause
SECOND of Section 5.4(b) of the Indenture (the "Event of Default Proceeds"). On
the Distribution Date on which the Event of Default Proceeds are deposited in
the Collection Account (or, if such proceeds are not so deposited on a
Distribution Date, on the Distribution Date immediately following such deposit),
the Servicer shall instruct the Applicable Trustee to make the following
deposits (after the application on such Distribution Date of the Available
Principal and the Available Interest and funds on deposit in the Reserve Account
pursuant to Sections 4.06 and 4.07) from the Event of Default Proceeds and any
funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Account (including the proceeds of any
sale of investments therein as described in the following sentence) in the
following priority:

               (i)  first, to the Swap Counterparty, the net amount, if any,
then due to the Swap Counterparty under any Interest Rate Swaps (exclusive of
payments due to the Swap Counterparty in respect of an Early Termination Date
under any Interest Rate Swaps);

               (ii) second, to (a) the Note Distribution Account in respect of
the Aggregate Noteholders' Interest Distributable Amount and (b) to the Swap
Counterparty in respect of any payments due to the Swap Counterparty in
connection with any Early Termination Date of any Interest Rate Swaps related to
the Notes, allocated between the Note Distribution Account and the Swap
Counterparty in proportion to the amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty in
connection with such Early Termination Date and in respect of the Aggregate
Noteholders' Interest Distributable Amount;

                                       31

<PAGE>

               (iii) third, to the Note Distribution Account, any portion of the
Aggregate Noteholders' Interest Distributable Amount not otherwise deposited
into the Note Distribution Account on such Distribution Date for payment of
interest on the Notes;

               (iv) fourth, to the Note Distribution Account, an amount equal to
the Aggregate Note Principal Balance of the Notes (after giving effect to the
reduction in the Aggregate Note Principal Balance to result from the deposits
made in the Note Distribution Account on such Distribution Date and on each
prior Distribution Date) for payment of principal of the Notes;

               (v) fifth, to the Certificate Distribution Account, (a) any
portion of the Certificateholders' Interest Distributable Amount not otherwise
deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account on such Distribution Date
for payment of interest on the Certificates and (b) to the Swap Counterparty in
respect of any payments due to the Swap Counterparty in connection with any
Early Termination Date of any Interest Rate Swaps related to the Certificates,

               (vi) sixth, to the Certificate Distribution Account, an amount
equal to the Certificate Balance of the Certificates (after giving effect to the
reduction therein to result from the deposits made in the Certificate
Distribution Account on such Distribution Date and on each prior Distribution
Date) for payment of the Certificate Balance on the Certificates.

Subject to Section 5.01(b), any investments on deposit in the Reserve Account
which shall not mature on or before such Distribution Date shall be sold by the
Indenture Trustee at such time as shall result in the Indenture Trustee
receiving the proceeds from such sale not later than such Distribution Date and
applied as set forth above. Any Event of Default Proceeds remaining after all
the deposits and other payments described above have been made in full shall be
paid to the Seller.

           (c) Notice of any termination of the Trust shall be given by the
Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee as soon as practicable
after the Servicer has received notice thereof.

           (d) Following the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with
respect to the Notes, and the payment in full of the principal and interest on
the Notes, the Certificateholders shall succeed to the rights of the Noteholders
hereunder and the Owner Trustee shall succeed to the rights of, and assume the
obligations (other than those under Section 7.03 which shall remain obligations
of the Indenture Trustee) of, the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Agreement
(subject to the continuing obligations of the Indenture Trustee set forth in
Section 4.4 of the Indenture).

           (e) After indefeasible payment in full to the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee, the Swap Counterparty, the Noteholders, the Certificateholders
and the Servicer of all amounts required to be paid under this Agreement, the
Indenture, any Interest Rate Swaps and the Trust Agreement (including as
contemplated by this Section 8.01), (i) any amounts on deposit in the Reserve
Account, the Payment Ahead Servicing Account and the Collection Account (after
all other distributions required to be made from such accounts have been made

                                       32

<PAGE>

and provision for the payment of all liabilities of the Trust as required by
Section 3808 of the Statutory Trust Statute) shall be paid to the Seller and
(ii) any other assets remaining in the Trust shall be distributed to the Seller.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     Section 9.01 Amendment.

Owner Trustee with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, but without the consent
of any of the Financial Parties, (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or
supplement any provision in this Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent
with any other provision in this Agreement or any other Basic Documents, (iii)
to add or supplement any credit enhancement for the benefit of the Noteholders
of any class or the Certificateholders ( provided that if any such addition
shall affect any class of Noteholders or Certificateholders differently than any
other class of Noteholders or Certificateholders, then such addition shall not,
as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect
the interests of any class of Noteholders or the Certificateholders), (iv) add
to the covenants, restrictions or obligations of the Seller, the Servicer, the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or (v) add, change or eliminate any other
provision of this Agreement in any manner that shall not, as evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of
the Financial Parties.

          (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the
Seller, the Servicer and the Owner Trustee with the consent of the Indenture
Trustee, the consent of Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less than a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date, the consent of Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence
not less than a majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of the
preceding Distribution Date, (which consent, whether given pursuant to this
Section 9.01 or pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, shall be
conclusive and binding on such Person and on all future holders of such Note or
Certificate and of any Note or Certificate issued upon the transfer thereof or
in exchange thereof or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent
is made upon the Note or Certificate) for the purpose of adding any provisions
to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Agreement, or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders or the
Certificateholders; provided, however, that no such amendment shall (i) increase
or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of,
collections of payments on Receivables or distributions that shall be required
to be made on any Note or Certificate, the Interest Rate for any class of Notes,
the Pass Through Rate or the Specified Reserve Account Balance or (ii) reduce
the aforesaid percentage required to consent to any such amendment, without the
consent of the holders of all Notes and Certificates then outstanding.

          (c) Prior to the execution of any such amendment or consent, the
Indenture Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to the Rating Agencies.

                                       33

<PAGE>

          (d) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent, the
Owner Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to each Financial Party.

          (e) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders or
Certificateholders pursuant to Section 9.01(b) to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent
shall approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and
any other consents of Noteholders or Certificateholders provided for in this
Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by
Noteholders and Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable
requirements as the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee may prescribe,
including the establishment of record dates pursuant to paragraph number 2 of
the Depository Agreements.

          (f) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to receive and
conclusively rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such
amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and the Opinion of
Counsel referred to in Section 9.02(i). The Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which
affects such trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or
otherwise.

          (g) Each of GMAC and the Seller agrees that such Person shall not
amend or agree to any amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement unless
such amendment would be permissible under the terms of this Section 9.01 as if
this Section 9.01 were contained in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

     Section 9.02 Protection of Title to Trust.

          (a) The Seller or the Servicer or both shall authorize and/or execute,
as applicable, and file such financing statements and cause to be authorized
and/or executed, as applicable, and filed such continuation and other
statements, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law
fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of the Noteholders, the
Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee under this
Agreement and the Second Step Receivables Assignments in the Receivables and in
the proceeds thereof. The Seller or the Servicer or both shall deliver (or cause
to be delivered) to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee file-stamped
copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided above, as soon
as available following such filing.

          (b) Neither the Seller nor the Servicer shall change its state of

other transferee computer tapes, records or print-outs (including any restored
from back-up archives) that, if they refer in any manner whatsoever to any
Receivable, indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by
the Issuer unless such Receivable has been paid in full or repurchased by the
Seller or purchased by the Servicer.

       (h) The Servicer shall permit the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee
and their respective agents at any time to inspect, audit and make copies of and
abstracts from the Servicer's records regarding any Receivables then or
previously included in the Owner Trust Estate.

                  Date, respectively, immediately preceding such Distribution
                  Date, and the relationships among Monthly Periods and Record
                  Dates will be correlative to the foregoing relationships.

         (d)      Number and Gender. Each defined term used in this Appendix or
                  the Basic Documents has a comparable meaning when used in its
                  plural or singular form. Each gender-specific term used in
                  this Appendix or the Basic Documents has a comparable meaning
                  whether used in a masculine, feminine or gender-neutral form.

         (e)      Including. Whenever the term "including" (whether or not that
                  term is followed by the phrase "but not limited to" or
                  "without limitation" or words of similar effect) is used in
                  this Appendix or the Basic Documents in connection with a
                  listing of items within a particular classification, that
                  listing will be interpreted to be illustrative only and will
                  not be interpreted as a limitation on, or exclusive listing
                  of, the items within that classification.

          (f)     Reference to a Class of Notes. Unless otherwise specified,
                  references to a Class of Notes, includes all the tranches
                  included in such class of Notes.
