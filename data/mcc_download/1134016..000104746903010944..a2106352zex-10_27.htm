<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
MW Gen is engaged in the business of owning or leasing and operating the following power generation facilities (collectively, the "Facilities"): (a)&nbsp;six
coal-fired generating plants consisting of 5,646 MW, which include Powerton, Joliet, Will County, Waukegan, Crawford, and Fisk; (b)&nbsp;the Collins gas and oil-fired
generating station consisting of 2,698 MW (the "Collins Station"); and (c)&nbsp;a group of on-site generating peakers consisting of 740 winter MW (467 summer MW) and off-site
generating peakers consisting of 657 winter MW (467 summer MW). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
EMMT is engaged, among other things, in the business of marketing, trading, buying and selling Energy, capacity, fossil fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related
physical and financial commodities and products, and derivatives thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties may enter into physical or financial transactions related to the purchase and sale of Energy, fossil fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related products,
and physical and financial derivatives thereof related to the Facilities (the "Products"), and MW Gen desires, under certain circumstances, to use EMMT's services to facilitate transactions with third
parties related to the purchase and sale of such Products (all transactions described in this paragraph are, collectively, the "Transactions"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties intend that all Transactions shall be based on Back-to-Back Transactions between EMMT and unrelated third parties (except for Transactions in
which EMMT acts as MW
Gen's disclosed agent with third parties ("Disclosed Agent Transactions")), and that no Transactions hereunder shall result from or relate to EMMT's proprietary trading portfolio. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties entered into an Energy Sales Agreement dated as of August&nbsp;1, 2000 and Services Agreement (Natural Gas) dated as of December&nbsp;15, 1999, which shall be
superseded in their entirety by this Agreement as of the date hereof; provided that such contracts shall survive in respect of transactions between the Parties that were entered into prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement until all Parties have fulfilled all of their obligations with respect to such Transaction(s). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties covenant and
agree as follows: </FONT></P>
