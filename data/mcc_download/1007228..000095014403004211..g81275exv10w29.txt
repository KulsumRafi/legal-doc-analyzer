         This Agreement is entered into as of January 1, 2003 by and between

Agreement are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Split-Dollar
Program"); and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Split-Dollar Agreement, the Company caused
Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Company or any successor thereto (the
"Insurance Company") to issue and deliver to the Executive Policy Number
I0001637 (the "Policy") on the life of the Executive; and

         WHEREAS, on February 6, 1998 the Executive transferred ownership of the
Policy, subject to the terms of the Split-Dollar Program, to the Trustee; and

         WHEREAS, because of recent legislation, proposed Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") regulations and other economic factors, the Board of Directors
of the Company has directed that the Split-Dollar Program be terminated; and

         WHEREAS, the Executive and the Trustee have agreed to the termination
of the Split-Dollar Program on the terms and conditions set forth below:

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the facts set forth above, the

Agreement agree as follows:

         1.       TERMINATION. The Executive agrees that, pursuant to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Split-Dollar Program, and any and all
covenants and agreements of the parties included therein, are hereby terminated
in all respects.

         2.       TRANSFER OF POLICY TO COMPANY. As soon as is practicable, the
Trustee, as owner of the Policy, agrees to execute such forms and take such
steps as are reasonably requested by the Company to transfer sole ownership of
the Policy into the name of the Company. Following such transfer, the Company

<PAGE>

         3.       TRANSFER OF POLICY TO EXECUTIVE. As soon as is practicable
subsequent to the transfer of the Policy to the Company by the Trustee and the
Company's Partial Surrender pursuant to Section 2, the Company, as owner of the
Policy, agrees to execute such forms and take such steps as are reasonably
requested by the Executive to transfer sole ownership of the Policy into the
name of the Executive.

         4.       RELEASE OF COMPANY'S INTEREST. The Company hereby releases its
rights under the Split-Dollar Agreement and the Collateral Security Agreement,
including without limitation its right to the Repayment Obligation, as defined
in Section 3(a) of the Split-Dollar Agreement, and its security interest in the
Policy as set forth in Section 4 of the Split-Dollar Agreement and as evidenced
by the Collateral Security Agreement. The Company by this Agreement does release
and forever discharge the Trustee and the Executive and his heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns from any obligation or liability of any
kind arising from or relating to all prior transactions, relationships and
dealings relating to or under the terms of the Split-Dollar Program; provided,
however, that the Company does not release any of the Executive's or the
Trustee's obligations under this Agreement.

         5.       RELEASE OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS. The Executive and the
Trustee by this Agreement do release and forever discharge the Company and its

Company shall take as a deduction, in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, an amount equal to the cash surrender value of
the Policy at the time of its transfer to the Executive pursuant to Section 3
(the "Cash Surrender Value"), net of any amounts recognized by the Executive as
income arising in connection with the Split-Dollar Program prior to the date of
this Agreement. If the IRS or any applicable state taxing authority asserts that
the amount to be reported as income by the Executive as a result of

                  (a)      The release of the Company's rights under the
Split-Dollar Agreement and the Collateral Security Agreement under Section 4;

                  (b)      The transfer of the Policy by the Company under
Section 3; and/or

                  (c)      The Executive's termination of the Policy and the
withdrawal of the full Cash Surrender Value on or before the date which is
ninety (90) days after the date of the transfer of the Policy by the Company
pursuant to Section 3, provided that the Executive makes no other changes in the
Policy except as contemplated herein;

exceeds the amount contemplated by the preceding sentence (the amount of such
excess, "Excess Income"), the Executive shall give prompt notice to the Company
of such assertion,

                                       2

and the Company shall indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless Executive
from and against any and all additional federal or state income tax, interest or
penalties to the extent arising out of such Excess Income ("Additional Taxes").
It is understood and agreed that this indemnity agreement shall not extend to
any additional taxes arising from actions taken by the Executive with respect to
the Policy after the date of this Agreement, other than the termination of the
Policy and the withdrawal of the full Cash Surrender Value as described in (iii)
above. With respect to any IRS or state claim for Additional Taxes, the Company
shall undertake the defense thereof by representatives of its own choosing
reasonably satisfactory to the Executive. The Executive shall cooperate in the
defense of any IRS or state claim for Additional Taxes, to the extent reasonably
requested by and at the expense of the Company. The Executive shall have the
right to participate at his own expense in any such defense of an IRS or state
claim for Additional Taxes with advisory counsel of his own choosing. The
Executive shall execute any settlement agreement requested by the Company with
respect to Additional Taxes, and the Executive shall not settle or compromise,
or voluntarily enter into any binding agreement to settle or compromise, or
consent to entry of any judgment arising from, any IRS or state claim for
Additional Taxes without the prior written consent of the Company, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

         7.       AUTHORIZATION. The Company represents and warrants that this
Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company in accordance
with its terms.

warrants that he has not assigned to any person the Split-Dollar Agreement or
any interest in the Split-Dollar Program (other than the transfer of the Policy
to the Trustee) and that he has full power and authority to enter into this
Agreement. The Trustee represents and warrants that he has not assigned to any
person any interest in the Policy and that he is the owner of the Policy.
