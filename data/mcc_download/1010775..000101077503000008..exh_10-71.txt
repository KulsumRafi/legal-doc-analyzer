Borrower of (x) any Notice of Borrowing if it specifies that the Borrowing is to
be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances or (y) any notice given by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.08 of the  Conversion  of Base Rate Advances to Eurodollar
Rate Advances and (ii) any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in
a Notice of Borrowing for a Borrowing that such Notice of Borrowing specifies is
to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances the applicable  conditions set forth
in Article  III,  including,  without  limitation  in each such  case,  any loss
(excluding loss of profit and/or margin), cost or expense reasonably incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such  Lender  to fund  the  Advance  to be made by such  Lender  as part of such
Borrowing or as a result of such  Conversion  when such Advance,  as a result of
such  revocation or failure,  is not made on the date specified  therefor in the
relevant  Notice of  Borrowing or when such Base Rate  Advances,  as a result of
such revocation,  are not converted to Eurodollar Rate Advances,  but excluding,
however,  any such losses, costs and expenses resulting from any such revocation
or failure  which has  occurred  more than 60 days prior to demand being made to
the Borrower by such Lender for  indemnification.  The payment of such indemnity
to a Lender  shall be made within 30 days of a demand by such  Lender  complying
with Section 8.04(d).

     (d) Unless the Agent shall have received  notice from a Lender prior to the
date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such
Lender's  ratable  portion of such  Borrowing,  the Agent may  assume  that such
Lender  has  made  such  portion  available  to the  Agent  on the  date of such
Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and the Agent may, in reliance upon
such  assumption,  make  available to the Borrower on such date a  corresponding
amount.  If and to the  extent  that  such  Lender  shall  not have so made such
ratable portion available to the Agent,  such Lender and the Borrower  severally
agree to repay to the  Agent  forthwith  on  demand  such  corresponding  amount
together with interest  thereon,  for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent,  at
(i) in the case of the  Borrower,  the interest  rate  applicable at the time to
Advances  comprising  such  Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such Lender,  the
Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such  corresponding
amount,  such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of
such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

     (e) The  failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part
of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its  obligation,  if any,
hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall
be  responsible  for the  failure of any other  Lender to make the Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

     SECTION  2.03.  Facility  Fee. The Borrower  shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender a facility fee on the  aggregate  amount of such Lender's
Commitment,  irrespective  of  usage,  from the  earlier  to occur of the  dates
referred to in clause (a) of the definition of "Funds Availability Date", in the
case of the  Initial  Lender,  and  from the  effective  date  specified  in the
Assignment and Acceptance  pursuant to which it became a Lender,  in the case of
each other  Lender,  until the  Maturity  Date at a rate per annum  equal to the
Applicable  Facility  Fee  Percentage  in effect  from time to time,  payable in
arrears on the last day of each March, June,  September and December  commencing
December 31, 1999, and on the Maturity Date.

     SECTION 2.04. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments .
The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to
the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions
of the respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial
reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

     SECTION 2.05.  Repayment of the  AdvancesSECTION  2.05 . The Borrower shall
repay to the Agent for the ratable  account of the Lenders on the Maturity  Date
the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding.

     SECTION 2.06. Interest on the AdvancesSECTION 2.06. (a) Scheduled Interest.
The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal  amount of each Advance
owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such  principal  amount
shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
<PAGE>

                    (i)  Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance
                         is a Base Rate  Advance,  a rate per annum equal at all
                         times to the sum of (x) the Base  Rate in  effect  from
                         time to time plus (y) the  Applicable  Margin in effect
                         from time to time,  payable  in arrears on the last day
                         of each March, June, September and December during such
                         periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be
                         Converted or paid in full.

                    (ii) Eurodollar  Rate Advances.  During such periods as such
                         Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance,  a rate per annum
                         equal at all times during each Interest Period for such
                         Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar  Rate for such
                         Interest   Period  for  such   Advance   plus  (y)  the
                         Applicable Margin in effect from time to time,  payable
                         in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and,
                         if such  Interest  Period has a  duration  of more than
                         three  months,  on each day  that  occurs  during  such
                         Interest  Period  every three months from the first day
                         of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar
                         Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

     (b) Default Interest.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  the Borrower shall pay interest on (i)
the unpaid  principal  amount of each Advance  owing to each Lender,  payable in
arrears on the dates  referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)  above,  at a rate
per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum  above the rate per annum  required
to be paid on such Advance  pursuant to clause  (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii)
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other
amount  payable  hereunder or under any Note that is not paid when due, from the
date such amount shall be due until such amount  shall be paid in full,  payable
in arrears  on the date such  amount  shall be paid in full and on demand,  at a
rate per  annum  equal at all  times to 2% per  annum  above  the rate per annum
required to be paid on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

     SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination (a) Each Reference Bank agrees to
furnish to the Agent,  at its  request,  timely  information  for the purpose of
determining  each  Eurodollar  Rate. If any one or more of the  Reference  Banks
shall not  furnish  such  timely  information  to the Agent for the  purpose  of
determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate
on the basis of timely information  furnished by the remaining  Reference Banks.
The Agent  shall  give  prompt  notice to the  Borrower  and the  Lenders of the
applicable  interest  rate  determined  by the Agent  for  purposes  of  Section
2.06(a)(i) or (ii),  and the rate, if any,  furnished by each Reference Bank for
the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii).

     (b) If (i) the Agent is unable for any reason to determine  the  Eurodollar
Rate for any Interest Period, (ii) if applicable, fewer than two Reference Banks
furnish timely  information to the Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for
any Interest Period  pursuant to Section  2.07(a) or (iii) the Required  Lenders
notify  the Agent by 12:00 noon  (London  time) two  Business  Days prior to the
first day of any  Interest  Period  that the  Required  Lenders  were  unable to
obtain,  at  approximately  11:00 A.M. (London time) on such Business Day and at
the applicable  Eurodollar Rate, U.S. dollar deposits for a period equal to such
Interest  Period and in amounts  substantially  equal to such Required  Lenders'
respective  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  comprising  part of the  Borrowing to be
outstanding  during such Interest  Period,  the Agent shall promptly  notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of such event, whereupon:

                    (A)  within   five   Business   Days  of   receipt  of  such
                         notification,  the Agent and the  Borrower  shall enter
                         into good  faith  negotiations  for a period of 15 days
                         (or such shorter  period as is required to agree to the
                         alternative  basis referred to in this clause (A)) with
                         a  view  to  agreeing  on  an  alternative   basis  for
                         determining  the rate of  interest  applicable  to such
                         Eurodollar Rate Advances;

                    (B)  any  alternative  basis  agreed  under clause (A) above
                         with  the  approval  of the  Required  Lenders  and any
                         interest  rate  determined  pursuant  thereto  will  be
                         binding  on  all  the   parties   hereto  and  will  be
                         retroactive  to, and take effect from, the first day of
                         the applicable Interest Period;
<PAGE>

                    (C)  if no  alternative  basis is agreed  under  clause  (A)
                         above  within the 15-day  period there  specified,  the
                         Agent,  upon  instructions  of  the  Required  Lenders,
                         shall,  on behalf of each of the Lenders,  set forth an
                         alternative  basis for determining the rate of interest
                         applicable  to  such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  on or
                         before the last day of the Interest Period to which the
                         notification  relates or, if  earlier,  within ten days
                         after the  expiration of the 15-day period set forth in
                         clause  (A) above.  Each  Lender  shall  certify to the
                         Agent and to the Borrower such Lender's  actual cost of
                         funds  for  funding  its  applicable   Eurodollar  Rate
                         Advances, and the Required Lenders shall certify to the
                         Agent  and  the  Borrower  in  reasonable   detail  the
                         alternative  basis for determining the rate of interest
                         to be applicable to such  Eurodollar  Rate Advances and
                         such interest rate as so determined;

                    (D)  any  interest  rate  determined  pursuant to clause (C)
                         above shall not, in any event,  exceed (x) the Required
                         Lenders'  reasonable  determination  of the cost to the
                         Lenders,  as certified  by them  pursuant to clause (C)
                         above,  of funding  their  applicable  Eurodollar  Rate
                         Advances plus (y) the Applicable Margin;

                    (E)  each  alternative  basis so certified and each interest
                         rate  determined  pursuant  thereto shall be binding on
                         the Borrower  and the Lenders and shall be  retroactive
                         to,  and  take  effect  from,  the  first  day  of  the
                         applicable Interest Period; and

                    (F)  so long as any  alternative  basis referred to above is
                         in force, the Agent, in consultation  with the Borrower
                         and the Required Lenders,  shall from time to time, but
                         not less frequently than monthly, review whether or not
                         the  circumstances  referred to in this Section 2.07(b)
                         still  prevail  with a view to  returning to the normal
                         provisions of this  Agreement in relation to the method
                         of   determining   interest  as  soon  as   practicably
                         possible.

     (c) If the  Borrower  shall fail to select  the  duration  of any  Interest
Period for any  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  in  accordance  with the  provisions
contained in the  definition of "Interest  Period" in Section 1.01,  then on the
last day of the then  existing  Interest  Period  therefor the longest  Interest
Period not longer than three  months that the Borrower  could have  selected for
such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances in  accordance  with such  provisions  shall be
applicable to such  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or, if the Borrower could not have
selected any Interest  Period for such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances in accordance
with such provisions, such Eurodollar Rate Advances will automatically,  on such
last day,  Convert into Base Rate Advances,  and the Agent shall promptly notify
the Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

     (d) On  the  date  on  which  the  aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount  of
Eurodollar Rate Advances  comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced,  by payment
or prepayment  or  otherwise,  to less than  $10,000,000,  such  Advances  shall
automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

     (e) Upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of any Event of Default
(i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert  Eurodollar Rate Advances into,
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  shall be suspended  until all Events of Default have
been cured or waived.

     SECTION 2.08. Optional Conversion of the Advances . The Borrower may on any
Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City  time)  on the  third  Business  Day  prior  to the  date  of the  proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.11,  Convert all
Advances of one Type  comprising  the same  Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type;  provided,  however,  that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into
Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest  Period for
such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  and any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than  $10,000,000.  Each
such notice of a Conversion  shall,  within the  restrictions  specified  above,
specify (i) the date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Advances to be Converted and
(iii) if such Conversion is into  Eurodollar Rate Advances,  the duration of the
initial Interest Period for each such Advance.

     SECTION 2.09. Optional Prepayments of the Advances . The Borrower may, upon
at least three Business  Days' notice (in the case of Eurodollar  Rate Advances)
<PAGE>


or one Business  Day's  notice (in the case of Base Rate  Advances) to the Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment,  and
if such notice is given the Borrower  shall,  prepay the  outstanding  principal
amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably
in part,  together with accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment on the
principal amount prepaid;  provided,  however,  that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  the Borrower  shall be  obligated  to reimburse  the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

     SECTION  2.10.  Increased  Costs . The Borrower  agrees to  indemnify  each
Lender for its actual and  documented  increased  costs that are the result of a
change of Law or in the official  interpretation  thereof or compliance with any
guideline  or request  from any  central  bank or other  governmental  authority
having  jurisdiction  over such Lender  (whether or not having the force of law)
adopted or made (i) in the case of the  Initial  Lender,  after the date of this
Agreement and (ii) in the case of any other  Lender,  after the date such Lender
shall have become a party to this  Agreement  by  executing  and  delivering  an
Assignment and  Acceptance,  which costs are reasonably  incurred by such Lender
and are the result of (x) such  Lender  agreeing  to make or making,  funding or
maintaining  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or (y) any  increase  in the  amount of
capital required to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation  controlling
such  Lender,  based upon the  existence  of such  Lender's  commitment  to lend
hereunder  and other  commitments  of this type,  to the extent that such Lender
reasonably  determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of such Lender's  commitment to lend hereunder).  The foregoing  indemnity shall
not apply to (A) any such  change of Law or  interpretation  or any  adoption or
making of any such  guideline or request that is  anticipated  on the applicable
date set forth above,  (B) any period or periods ending more than 120 days prior
to  demand  for  indemnification  being  made or (C) any  such  increased  costs
resulting  from (a) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.13 shall govern)
or (b) changes in the basis of  taxation of overall net income or overall  gross
income by the United  States or by the foreign  jurisdiction  or state under the
laws of which such Lender is organized or has its  Applicable  Lending Office or
any political  subdivision thereof. The Borrower shall from time to time, within
30 days following  demand by such Lender  complying with Section 8.04(d) (with a
copy of such  demand to the  Agent),  pay to the Agent for the  account  of such
Lender  additional  amounts  sufficient  to  compensate  such  Lender  for  such
increased costs.

     SECTION  2.11.  Illegality.  If as a result  of a  change  in Law or in the
official interpretation thereof (i) in the case of the Initial Lender, after the
date of this Agreement and (ii) in the case of any other Lender,  after the date
such  Lender  shall  have  become a party to this  Agreement  by  executing  and
delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,  it shall have become  unlawful,  or if
after the applicable date set forth above any central bank or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction over such Lender asserts that it is unlawful,  for
such Lender to (i) allow all or part of its Commitment to make  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances to remain outstanding or (ii) make, fund or allow to remain outstanding
all or part of its Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Lender may notify the Borrower
and  the  Agent  thereof  in  reasonable   detail   (together  with   supporting
documentation) of such event, whereupon:

     (x) such Lender's Commitment shall be suspended and, 45 days following such
notification,  shall be canceled if such unlawfulness  shall then be continuing;
and

     (y) the Borrower  will prepay such  Lender's  Advances at the time or times
and to the extent  necessary to avoid such  unlawfulness,  together  with unpaid
accrued  interest  thereon,  unpaid  accrued fees and any other  amounts due and
payable to such Lender,  unless,  in either case,  prior  thereto,  the Borrower
shall have given  notice to such  Lender that the  Borrower  will  require  such
Lender to assign and transfer all of its interests in this Agreement pursuant to
Section  8.07(b)  and shall have  caused  such  Lender to have so  assigned  and
transferred such interests.

     SECTION 2.12.  Payments and Computations . (a) The Borrower shall make each
payment  hereunder  and under the Notes not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the Agent's Account in
same day funds. The Agent will promptly  thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds  relating to the payment of principal or interest or facility fees ratably
(other than amounts payable  pursuant to Section  2.02(c),  2.03,  2.10, 2.13 or
8.04) to the  Lenders  for the account of their  respective  Applicable  Lending
Offices,  and like funds  relating to the payment of any other amount payable to

<PAGE>

any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable  Lending Office,  in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance  of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  and recording of the  information
contained  therein in the Register  pursuant to Section 8.07(d),  from and after
the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance,  the Agent shall
make all  payments  hereunder  and under the Notes in  respect  of the  interest
assigned  thereby to the Lender  assignee  thereunder,  and the  parties to such
Assignment  and  Acceptance  shall  make  all  appropriate  adjustments  in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

     (b) All  computations  of interest  based on the Base Rate shall be made by
the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all
computations  of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate
and of  facility  fees  shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360
days,  in each case for the actual number of days  (including  the first day but
excluding  the last day)  occurring  in the period for which  such  interest  or
facility fees are payable.  Each  determination by the Agent of an interest rate
hereunder  shall be  conclusive  and binding for all purposes,  absent  manifest
error.

     (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business  Day,  such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day; provided,  however, that, if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances to be made in
the  next  following  calendar  month,  such  payment  shall be made on the next
preceding  Business  Day.  Any such  extension  or  reduction  of time  shall be
included in the  computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case
may be.

     (d) Unless the Agent shall have received  notice from the Borrower prior to
the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders  hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such  payment in full,  the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made  such  payment  in full to the Agent on such  date and the  Agent  may,  in
reliance upon such  assumption,  cause to be  distributed to each Lender on such
due date an  amount  equal to the  amount  then due such  Lender.  If and to the
extent the  Borrower  shall not have so made such  payment in full to the Agent,
each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest  thereon,  for each day from the date such
amount is  distributed  to such Lender  until the date such  Lender  repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     SECTION 2.13. Taxes . (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or
under  the  Notes  shall be made,  in  accordance  with  Section  2.12,  without
deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes (each as defined below).

     "Taxes"  means  any and all  present  or  future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,
deductions,  charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower
pursuant  to this  Agreement  or any  Note,  and all  liabilities  with  respect
thereto,  excluding (i) in the case of each Lender and the Agent,  taxes imposed
on its  income,  net worth or gross  receipts  and  franchise  or similar  taxes
imposed on it by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal  executive office is
located or any political  subdivision thereof or, in the case of each Lender, in
which its  Applicable  Lending  Office is located or any  political  subdivision
thereof and (ii) in the case of each Lender any United  States  withholding  tax
imposed on such  payments  except to the extent  that such  Lender is subject to
United States withholding tax by reason of a U.S. Tax Law Change.

     "Other  Taxes" means any present or future stamp or  documentary  taxes and
any other excise or property taxes,  or similar  charges or levies,  which arise
from any payment made  pursuant to this  Agreement or under any Note or from the
execution or delivery of, or  otherwise  with respect to, this  Agreement or any
Note.

     "U.S.  Tax Law Change" means with respect to any Lender the  occurrence (x)
in the case of the Initial  Lender,  after the date of this Agreement and (y) in
the case of any other  Lender,  after the date such  Lender  shall have become a
party  to  this   Agreement  by  executing  and  delivering  an  Assignment  and
Acceptance,  of the  adoption of any  applicable  United  States  federal law or
regulation  relating  to  taxation,  or any change  therein  or in the  official
interpretation  thereof, or the entry into force,  modification or revocation of
any income tax  convention or treaty to which the United  States is a party.

     If the Borrower shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable  hereunder or under any Note to any Lender
or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional  sums payable  under this Section  2.13) such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had
no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) the Borrower  shall make such  deductions,
(iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount  deducted to the relevant  taxation
authority or other  authority in  accordance  with  applicable  law and (iv) the
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full
amount  of  actual  and  documented  Taxes or Other  Taxes  (including,  without
limitation,  taxes of any kind imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable
under this  Section  2.13) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
as the result of any U.S. Tax Law Change and any actual and documented liability
(including  penalties,  interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto  paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be),  but  excluding,
however,  any Taxes or Other Taxes so paid by such Lender or the Agent more than
120 days prior to demand  being made to the Borrower by such Lender or the Agent
for indemnification.  The payment of such indemnity shall be made within 30 days
from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand
therefor complying with Section 8.04(d).

     (c) Each  Lender  organized  under the laws of a  jurisdiction  outside the
United  States,  on or prior to the date of its  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement  in the case of the Initial  Lender and on the date of the  Assignment
and  Acceptance  pursuant  to which it becomes a Lender in the case of any other
Lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower
or the Agent (but only so long as such Lender  remains  lawfully able to do so),
shall  provide each of the Agent and the Borrower  with two  completed  and duly
executed  original  Internal  Revenue  Service  forms 1001,  4224 or W-8BEN,  as
appropriate,  or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal  Revenue
Service,  or other  documentation  reasonably  requested  by the Borrower or the
Agent,  certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate
of United States  withholding tax on payments  pursuant to this Agreement or the
Notes.  If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a
party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest  withholding tax rate
in excess of zero,  withholding  tax at such rate shall be  considered  excluded
from  Taxes  unless  and  until  such  Lender  provides  the  appropriate  forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered  excluded from Taxes for periods  governed by such
form. If any form or document  referred to in this  subsection  (c) requires the
disclosure of information,  other than information  necessary to compute the tax
payable and information  required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service
form  1001,  4224  or  W-8BEN,  that  the  Lender  reasonably  considers  to  be
confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not
be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

     (d) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate form or document (or information  required by such
form or document)  described in Section  2.13(c)  (other than if such failure is
due to a U.S.  Tax Law  Change),  such Lender  shall not be entitled to payments
without deduction and indemnification  under Section 2.13(a) or (b) with respect
to any Taxes or Other Taxes  which would not have been  payable had such form or
document (or information required thereby) been so provided;  provided, however,
that  should a Lender,  which is  otherwise  exempt from or subject to a reduced
rate of  withholding  tax,  become  subject to Taxes  because of its  failure to
deliver  a  form  or  document  (or  information  required  thereby),   required
hereunder,  the Borrower  shall take such  reasonable  steps as the Lender shall
request  to  assist  the  Lender to  recover  such  Taxes (it being  understood,
however,  that the Borrower shall have no liability to such Lender in respect of
such Taxes).

     (e) If the Borrower is required to indemnify or pay additional
amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13, then
such Lender will take such action (including changing the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office) as in the reasonable judgment of such Lender (i) will
eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and
(ii) is not otherwise commercially unreasonable.

     (f) Each Lender and the Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain in
a timely  fashion any refund,  deduction  or credit of any Taxes and Other Taxes
paid or reimbursed by the Borrower  pursuant to this Section 2.13. If any Lender
or the Agent  receives a benefit in the nature of a refund,  deduction or credit
(including a refund in the form of a deduction from or credit against taxes that

<PAGE>

are  otherwise  payable by the Lender or the Agent) of any Taxes or Other  Taxes
with respect to which the Borrower has made a payment under  Section  2.13(a) or
(b),  such  Lender  or the Agent (as the case may be)  agrees to  reimburse  the
Borrower  to the  extent of the  benefit  of such  refund,  deduction  or credit
promptly after the Agent or such Lender  reasonably  determines that such refund
deduction or credit has become final; provided,  however, that nothing contained
in this paragraph (f) shall require any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
to make  available  its tax  returns (or any other  information  relating to its
taxes  which it deems to be  confidential)  or to  attempt  to  obtain  any such
refund,  deduction  or credit,  which  attempt  would be  inconsistent  with any
reporting position otherwise taken by the Agent or such Lender on its applicable
tax returns.

     SECTION  2.14.  Sharing of  Payments,  Etc. If any Lender  shall obtain any
payment (whether  voluntary,  involuntary,  through the exercise of any right of
set-off,  or  otherwise)  on account  of the  Advances  owing to it (other  than
pursuant  to Section  2.02(c),  2.03,  2.10,  2.13 or  8.04(c)) in excess of its
ratable  share of  payments  on  account  of the  Advances  obtained  by all the
Lenders,  such Lender  shall  forthwith  purchase  from the other  Lenders  such
participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing  Lender  to share  the  excess  payment  ratably  with  each of them;
provided,  however,  that  if all or any  portion  of  such  excess  payment  is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be  rescinded  and such Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the
purchase  price to the extent of such recovery  together with an amount equal to
such Lender's  ratable share  (according to the  proportion of (i) the amount of
such Lender's required  repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing  Lender)  of any  interest  or other  amount  paid or  payable by the
purchasing  Lender in respect of the total  amount so  recovered.  The  Borrower
agrees  that any  Lender so  purchasing  a  participation  from  another  Lender
pursuant  to this  Section  2.14 may, to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     SECTION  2.15.  Use of  Proceeds . The  proceeds of the  Advances  shall be
available for working capital requirements of the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     SECTION  4.01.  Representations  and  Warranties  of  the  Borrower.  . The

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

     (b) Power and Authority.  The Borrower has the corporate  power to execute,
deliver and perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement and the Notes and to
take all action  necessary to consummate the  transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement and the Notes.

     (c) Due  Authorization.  The  execution,  delivery and  performance  by the
Borrower  of this  Agreement  and the Notes  have been  duly  authorized  by all
necessary  corporate  action  and do  not  (i)  contravene  its  certificate  of
incorporation  or bylaws or (ii) conflict with or contravene any Law to which it
is subject  which has had or would  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     (d) Governmental Approval. No authorization or approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental  authority is required for the
due  execution,  delivery and  performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and
the Notes,  except for those  which have been duly  obtained  or made and are in
full force and effect.

     (e) Binding and  Enforceable.  This Agreement and the Notes  constitute the
legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of the Borrower  enforceable  against the
Borrower  in  accordance  with  their  terms,  subject  to  laws  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.

     (f) No Violation.  The execution,  delivery and performance by the Borrower
of this  Agreement  and the Notes do not  violate,  in a manner which has had or
would  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect,  any agreement
binding on it.

     (g) No  Default.  No  Default  or  Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing  under this  Agreement,  other  than any  Default or Event of Default
which has been waived.

     (h) Litigation. No litigation,  arbitration or administrative proceeding is
currently pending or, to the Borrower's knowledge,  threatened against it (i) to
restrain the entry by the Borrower into, the enforcement of, or exercise of, any
rights by the Lenders or the Agent under,  or the  performance  or compliance by
the Borrower with any obligations  under,  this Agreement and the Notes, or (ii)
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (i) Financial  Condition.  The unaudited  consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower  as at June 30,  1999 and the Pro Forma June 30,  1999  Balance  Sheet,
previously furnished to the Lenders,  present fairly the unaudited  consolidated
financial  condition of the Borrower and the  unaudited  consolidated  pro forma
financial  condition of the Borrower giving effect to the Pro Forma  Adjustments
as at said date, all in accordance with GAAP.

<PAGE>

     (j)  Material  Adverse  Change.  There has been no change in the  business,
condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  or results of  operations of the Borrower
since June 30,  1999 which has had or would  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (k) Taxes.  There has been no event with respect to the tax  obligations of
the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  which has had or would  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (l)  Investment  Company Act. The Borrower is not an  "investment  company"
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     (m)  Environmental  Matters.  There  has  been no  event  with  respect  to
environmental  compliance obligations of the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (n)  Year  2000.  The  cost  to  the  Borrower  and  its   Subsidiaries  of
reprogramming  required to permit the proper  functioning,  in and following the
year 2000, of (i) the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' computer systems and (ii)
equipment  containing  embedded  microchips  (including  systems  and  equipment
supplied by others) and of the testing of all such systems and equipment,  as so
reprogrammed, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of year 2000 to the
Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except for such of the reprogramming referred to in the
preceding sentence as may be necessary,  the computer and management information
systems of the Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  are and,  with  ordinary  course
upgrading  and  maintenance,  will  continue  to be,  sufficient  to permit  the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries to conduct their business without Material Adverse
Effect.

     (o)  Accuracy of  Information.  To the  Borrower's  knowledge  (i) the Bank
Syndication  Memorandum  (other than projections  included therein) was complete
and correct in all  material  respects  at the date  thereof for the purpose for
which  the Bank  Syndication  Memorandum  was  prepared  and (ii) all  financial
projections  contained in the Bank Syndication  Memorandum were prepared in good
faith and based upon assumptions which management of the Borrower believed to be
not  unreasonable at the time the projections were prepared (it being understood
that  (w)  such  projections  are  subject  to  significant   uncertainties  and
contingencies, many of which are beyond the Borrower's control, (x) no assurance
can be given that the projections will be realized and (y) no  representation or
warranty can be made as to the accuracy of such projections).


                                    ARTICLE V

                            COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER

     SECTION 5.01. Financial Covenants of the Borrower..  So long as any Advance
shall  remain  unpaid or any Lender  shall have any  Commitment  hereunder,  the
Borrower will:

     (a)  Ratio of Cash  Available  for  Corporate  Debt  Service  to  Corporate
Interest.  Cause the ratio of Cash  Available  for  Corporate  Debt  Service  to
Corporate  Interest to be at least  1.75:1.00 at the end of each fiscal  quarter
(including  the fourth  fiscal  quarter)  of the  Borrower  for which  financial
statements  have most  recently  been  delivered to the Agent,  calculated  on a
rolling  four  fiscal  quarter  basis  ending  on the  date  of  such  financial
statements  and with  effect from the date of such  delivery  of such  financial
statements  (or, if at such time less than four fiscal quarters have ended since
the date of this Agreement, the immediately preceding fiscal quarters commencing
with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 1999).

<PAGE>

     (b) Ratio of  Recourse  Debt to  Recourse  Capital.  (i) Cause the ratio of
Recourse  Debt to Recourse  Capital to be not more than (A) if the  Borrower has
never been rated Investment Grade, (x) 0.625:1.00 through March 31, 2000 and (y)
0.60:1.00  after March 31, 2000 and (B) 0.65:1.00 at any time after the Borrower
has been rated Investment  Grade, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter
(including  the fourth  fiscal  quarter)  of the  Borrower  for which  financial
statements have most recently been delivered to the Agent,  calculated as of the
date of such financial statements and with effect from the date of such delivery
of such financial  statements.  Cash received by the Borrower after the end of a
fiscal  quarter and before the sixth day following  delivery to the Agent of the
Borrower's  financial statements for such fiscal quarter in respect of issuances
of equity or of capital  contributions  or on account of  issuances of Affiliate
Subordinated  Debt (under the Parent  Support  Agreement or  otherwise),  net of
distributions  made by the  Borrower  after the end of such  fiscal  quarter and
before  such sixth day,  shall be taken into  account in  determining  "Recourse
Capital" at the end of such fiscal quarter.

                    (ii) If the  Borrower  has been rated  Investment  Grade and
                         subsequently  ceases to be rated Investment  Grade, the
                         Borrower  will, on at least three Business Days' notice
                         to  the  Agent  and  on or  before  (x)  the  70th  day
                         following  the  end of each  of the  Borrower's  first,
                         second and third fiscal  quarters and (y) the 130th day
                         following  the  end of each  of the  Borrower's  fourth
                         fiscal  quarters,  and if no  amounts  are  outstanding
                         under  the  Facility  A  Credit  Agreement,  repay  the
                         Advances  and/or the  "Advances"  under the  Facility B
                         Credit  Agreement  in an  amount  equal  to 50% of Cash
                         Available for  Distribution  to  Shareholders  for such
                         fiscal quarter minus the prepayment  made under Section
                         5.01(b)(ii)  of the  Facility  A  Credit  Agreement  in
                         respect  of  Cash   Available   for   Distribution   to
                         Shareholders   for  such  fiscal   quarter  unless  the
                         Borrower  is rated  Investment  Grade  on such  70th or
                         130th day, as the case may be, or the Borrower's  ratio
                         of Recourse Debt to Recourse Capital, as measured above
                         on the last  day of such  fiscal  quarter,  is not more
                         than  0.625:1.00  until  March 31,  2000 and  0.60:1.00
                         thereafter. Any such repayment of the Advances shall be
                         accompanied by a reduction of the Commitments hereunder
                         in the amount of such payment.

                    (iii)If the  Borrower  has been rated  Investment  Grade and
                         subsequently  ceases to be rated Investment  Grade, the
                         Borrower  shall,  within six months  after the date the
                         Borrower   has  most   recently   ceased  to  be  rated
                         Investment  Grade,  cause (x) itself  again to be rated
                         Investment   Grade  or  (y)  the  Borrower's  ratio  of
                         Recourse Debt to Recourse  Capital,  as measured above,
                         to be not more than 0.625:1.00 until March 31, 2000 and
                         0.60:1.00 thereafter.

     SECTION  5.02.  Affirmative  Covenants  of the  Borrower  . So  long as any

the Borrower will:

     (a)  Compliance  with  Law.  Comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Laws

a corporation,  except that the Borrower may be merged or  consolidated  with or
into another  corporation  if the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  is the

States of America and expressly  assumes all of the  obligations of the Borrower
under  this  Agreement  and  the  Notes  and  if  (i)  immediately   before  the
consummation  of such  transaction  there is no Default or Event of Default  and
(ii) such consummation shall not result in a Default or Event of Default.

GAAP.  Such financial  statements  shall be accompanied by  certificates  of the
chief  financial  officer,  treasurer  or  comptroller  of  the  Borrower  as to

     (e)  Other  Information.  Deliver  to  the  Agent  as  soon  as  reasonably
practicable  such other  information  relating  to the then  existing  financial

provision or except such  information  the  disclosure of which is prohibited by
Law.

with its  independent  certified  public  accountants  from time to time  during
normal  business hours upon reasonable  notice.  The Lenders and the Agent agree
that the Agent shall coordinate and consolidate  visits by the Lenders and their
Representatives  (including the  examination of records and books and the making
of copies and abstracts of records and books) at mutually  convenient  times and
in such a manner so as to  minimize  the  disruption  to the  operations  of the

     (h)  Notice of Change of Credit  Rating.  Promptly  after the  Borrower  is
notified  thereof in writing by Moody's or S&P or the Borrower  becomes aware of
the public  announcement  thereof  by  Moody's  or S&P,  notify the Agent of any
change in the Credit Rating by Moody's or S&P, as the case may be.

     (i)  Investment  of  Proceeds.  Within  18 months  of the  Borrower's  or a
Subsidiary's receipt of the proceeds of any sale (including, without limitation,
by way of  Sale/Leaseback)  of any Asset,  other than Exempt Asset Sale Proceeds
and other  than  proceeds  of such sale  which are  applied  to repay  Debt of a
Subsidiary   incurred  in   connection   with  the   acquisition,   improvement,
development, ownership or operation of such Asset, as to which Debt the Borrower
is not directly or indirectly  liable, (i) the Borrower or such Subsidiary shall
invest such  proceeds  in assets in similar or related  lines of business of the
Borrower or the Borrower's  Subsidiaries  and/or (ii) the Borrower  shall, on at
least three Business  Days' notice to the Agent,  apply such proceeds which have

Commitments hereunder in the amount of such payment.

     (j) Clean-Up.  The Borrower  shall  exercise its rights under Sections 2.01

<PAGE>

     SECTION 5.03.  Negative  Covenants of the Borrower.  So long as any Advance
shall  remain  unpaid or any Lender  shall have any  Commitment  hereunder,  the
Borrower will:

     (a)  Incurrence  of Recourse  Debt,  Etc. (i) Not incur any  Recourse  Debt
(other than (A) Recourse Debt pursuant to the Facility Credit  Agreements or (B)
Recourse Debt the proceeds of which are applied to the  concurrent  repayment of
Recourse  Debt  other than  Recourse  Debt  pursuant  to this  Agreement  or the
Facility B Credit Agreement unless the "Commitments" hereunder or thereunder are
concurrently reduced by the amount of such repayment;  provided,  however,  that
the Borrower  may incur  Recourse  Debt if (x) at the end of the fiscal  quarter
(including  the fourth  fiscal  quarter)  of the  Borrower  for which  financial
statements have been delivered to the Agent, most recently preceding the date on
which the Borrower is to incur such Recourse  Debt,  the ratio of Cash Available
for Corporate Debt Service (calculated without giving effect to clauses (ix) and
(x) of the definition of such term) to Corporate Interest was at least 2.75:1.00
(if at the time such  Recourse  Debt is to be incurred the Borrower is not rated
Investment Grade) or 2.25:1:00 (if at such time the Borrower is rated Investment
Grade),  calculated on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis ending on the date of
such financial  statements  (or, if at such time less than four fiscal  quarters
have ended since the date of signing this Agreement,  the immediately  preceding
fiscal quarters  commencing  with the fiscal quarter ending  September 30, 1999)
and with effect from the date of such delivery of such financial  statements and
(y)(A) if, on the date the Borrower is to incur such  Recourse Debt the Borrower
is not  rated  Investment  Grade,  the  projected  ratio of Cash  Available  for
Corporate  Debt Service (as so  calculated)  to Corporate  Interest  shall be at
least 2.75:1.00 over the life of the Facility Credit Agreement having the latest
maturity  date or (B) if at such time the  Borrower is rated  Investment  Grade,
Moody's and S&P shall reaffirm their Investment Grade ratings at such time.

     (ii) The Borrower's compliance with clause (y)(A) above shall be determined
          on the basis of  projections  which are  prepared by the  Borrower but
          which are based upon  electricity  prices,  capacity  factors and fuel
          prices set forth in a report of the Independent  Market  Consultant (a
          "Market  Forecast").  If the  Recourse  Debt is to be  incurred by the
          Borrower  with  respect  to a  generating  facility  in a market  with
          respect to which the  Independent  Market  Consultant  has  previously
          provided a report, including a market forecast, the Market Forecast to
          be delivered by the Independent  Market  Consultant shall be an update
          of the market  forecast  contained  in the most  recent  report of the
          Independent  Market  Consultant  with respect to such  market.  If the
          Recourse  Debt is to be incurred  by the  Borrower  with  respect to a
          generating  facility in a market with respect to which the Independent
          Market  Consultant has not previously  provided a report,  including a
          market   forecast,   the  Market  Forecast  to  be  delivered  by  the
          Independent  Market  Consultant  shall be contained in a new report of
          the Independent  Market Consultant with respect to such market. To the
          extent that a Market  Forecast is updated for a  particular  market or
          region,  as provided above, (1) a previously  prepared market forecast
          need not be updated  for any other  region and (2) in the  projections
          prepared by the Borrower,  the Borrower shall apply the assumptions in
          the updated Market  Forecast to each  generating  facility  within the
          region  for  which  the  updated   Market   Forecast   was   obtained.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the projections in clause (y)(A) above
          need not be prepared on the basis of an updated Market Forecast by the
          Independent  Market  Consultant  (but may be  prepared on the basis of
          market forecasts made by the Borrower at such time) for incurrences of
          Recourse  Debt  which  do  not  exceed  either  (1)  $100,000,000  per
          incurrence or (2) $150,000,000 within any 12-month period.

     (b) Payment of  Dividends,  Etc.  (A) Not (i) declare or make any  dividend
payment or other distribution of assets,  properties,  cash, rights, obligations
or  securities  on account  of any  shares of any class of capital  stock of the
Borrower (except for any dividend payment or other  distributions from insurance
proceeds for  casualties  which have been restored  prior to September 1, 1999),
(ii) make any payments with respect to Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt or make any
redemption  or repurchase  of any  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt (except for any
payment,  redemption or repurchase of Affiliate Subordinated Debt from insurance
proceeds  for  casualties  which have been  restored  with the  proceeds of such
Affiliate Subordinated Debt) or (iii) purchase,  redeem or otherwise acquire for

<PAGE>

value any shares of any class of capital  stock of the Borrower or any warrants,
rights or options to acquire any such shares, now or hereafter  outstanding,  or
reduce  the  Borrower's   capital  (except  for  any  purchase,   redemption  or
acquisition  of such shares held by SEI or any  reduction  of capital paid to an
Affiliate of the Borrower from insurance proceeds for casualties which have been
restored with the proceeds of such shares or such capital,  as the case may be);
provided,  however,  that the  Borrower  may (w) declare  and make any  dividend
payment or other  distribution  payable  in common  stock of the  Borrower,  (x)
purchase,  redeem or otherwise  acquire  shares of its common stock or warrants,
rights or options to acquire any such shares with the proceeds received from the
substantially  concurrent contribution to the Borrower's capital or the issue of
new shares of the Borrower's common stock and (y) make any payments with respect
to Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt, make any redemption or repurchase of Affiliate
Subordinated  Debt and take any other action  specified in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) above if, at the end of the fiscal  quarter  (including  the fourth fiscal
quarter) of the Borrower for which  financial  statements have been delivered to
the Agent,  most recently  preceding  the date on which the Borrower  takes such
action,  the ratio of Cash  Available  for  Corporate  Debt Service to Corporate
Interest was at least  2.25:1.00  (if at the time such action is to be taken the
Borrower  is not  rated  Investment  Grade)  or  2.00:1.00  (if at such time the
Borrower is rated Investment Grade), calculated on a rolling four fiscal quarter
basis ending on the date of such financial  statements (or, if at such time less
than four fiscal  quarters have ended since the date of signing this  Agreement,
the immediately  preceding  fiscal  quarters  commencing with the fiscal quarter
ending  September  30,  1999) and with effect from the date of such  delivery of
such financial statements.

                    (B)  Notwithstanding  paragraph (A) above,  the Borrower may
                         declare  dividends,   make  payments  with  respect  to
                         Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt and take any other action
                         specified in clauses  (i),  (ii) and (iii) of paragraph
                         (A)  above  prior to the  delivery  to the Agent of the
                         financial  statements  of the  Borrower  for the fiscal
                         quarter ended  September 30, 1999. If the ratio of Cash
                         Available  for  Corporate  Debt  Service  to  Corporate
                         Interest for the fiscal  quarter  ended  September  30,
                         1999 is  insufficient to permit the Borrower to declare
                         any  dividends,  make  any  payments  with  respect  to
                         Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt and take any other action
                         specified  in  clauses  (i),  (ii) and  (iii)  above in
                         compliance with clause (y) of paragraph (A) above, then
                         within 30 days after the  delivery  to the Agent of the
                         financial  statements  of the  Borrower  for the fiscal
                         quarter  ended  September  30, 1999 the Borrower  shall
                         either (A) receive  cash (i) in respect of issuances of
                         equity or of capital  contributions  or (ii) in respect
                         of  issuances  of  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt or (B)
                         cause to be delivered to the Agent an Excess Restricted
                         Payments Agreement,  in each case in an amount equal to
                         the amount by which the sum of the dividends,  payments
                         with respect to Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt and other
                         amounts paid in  connection  with actions  specified in
                         clauses  (i),  (ii) and  (iii) of  paragraph  (A) above
                         exceeds the amounts of the initial  "Borrowings"  under
                         the  Facility  A Credit  Agreement  and this  Agreement
                         (such  excess  being the  "Excess  Restricted  Payments
                         Amount").  The  Excess  Restricted  Payments  Agreement
                         shall be accompanied by an opinion of Troutman  Sanders
                         LLP,  counsel for SEI or the relevant  Affiliate of the
                         Borrower, as the case may be, substantially in the form
                         of Exhibit F hereto  except  that it shall refer to the
                         Excess Restricted  Payments Agreement instead of to the
                         Parent Support Agreement.

     (c) Debt of the Generating  Companies.  (i) Cause the Generating  Companies
not to incur any Debt  (other  than Debt the  proceeds  of which are  applied to
repay  existing  Debt)  or to enter  into any  Sale/Leaseback  with  respect  to
Existing  Assets unless at the time of such  transaction  (A) the sum of (I) the
principal  amount of such Debt and all other  Debt of the  Generating  Companies
then  outstanding and (II) the net book value of such Existing Assets and of the
other  Existing  Assets  then  subject  to   Sale/Leasebacks   does  not  exceed
$500,000,000  and (B) the Borrower would be in compliance  with Section  5.03(a)
hereof  taking  into  account  the  incurrence  of such  Debt by the  Generating
Companies and the investment or use of such proceeds.

                    (ii) Cause the  Generating  Companies  not to incur any Debt
                         (other  than by way of  Sale/Leaseback  and other  than
                         Debt  the  proceeds  of  which  are  applied  to  repay
                         existing  Debt)  unless at the time of such  incurrence
                         (A) the sum of the  principal  amount  of such Debt and
                         all  other  Debt  of  the  Generating   Companies  then
                         outstanding  does not  exceed  $100,000,000  (if at the
                         time of  such  incurrence  the  Borrower  is not  rated
                         Investment  Grade) or $200,000,000 (if at such time the
                         Borrower  is  rated  Investment   Grade)  and  (B)  the
                         Borrower  would be in compliance  with Section  5.03(a)
                         taking into account the  incurrence of such Debt by the
                         Generating  Companies and the investment or use of such
                         proceeds.
<PAGE>

                    (iii)Within 18 months of a Generating  Company's  receipt of
                         the  proceeds of any Debt (other than Debt the proceeds
                         of which are  applied to repay  existing  Debt),  cause
                         such Generating  Company to (A) invest such proceeds in
                         assets  in lines  of  business  which  are  similar  or
                         related to the lines of  business of the  Borrower  and
                         the  Generating  Companies  and (B) apply such proceeds
                         which have not been so invested to repay the Advances.

secure the payment of Debt except for:

                    (i)  Liens arising solely by operation of law or by order of
                         a court or tribunal or other governmental authority (or
                         by an agreement of similar effect);

                    (ii) Liens  arising in the  ordinary  course of  business or

                         (A) have not been  overdue for more than 30 days or (B)
                         are being contested in good faith;

                    (iii)Liens created for the sole purpose of  refinancing  all

                         Person  described  in the  preceding  clause (i) or (y)
                         another  Person  described in this clause  (ii),  which
                         Liens secure such Project Finance Debt;

                    (vi) Liens on  deposits  to  secure,  or any Lien  otherwise

evidences  any such Debt any  creditor  in respect of such Debt will  obtain any
benefit (including collateral security, a guarantee or other third-party support
and improved  financial terms),  the Borrower will offer to the Lenders the same
benefit (including  ratable  collateral  security and guarantees and third-party
support and comparably  improved terms) and, upon the acceptance by the Required
Lenders  of such  offer,  will cause such  benefit to be made  available  to the
Lenders  concurrently with making such benefit  available,  and on substantially
the same terms as it is made available, to such other creditor.

payable,  or be required  to be prepaid or  redeemed  (other than by a regularly
scheduled required prepayment or redemption), purchased or defeased, or an offer

                                   ARTICLE VII

                         THE AGENT AND THE LEAD ARRANGER

     SECTION 7.01.  Authorization  and Action . Each Lender hereby  appoints and
authorizes  the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms  hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are  reasonably
incidental  thereto.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  each
Lender authorizes the Agent to execute the Parent Support  Agreement.  As to any
matters  not  expressly  provided  for by  this  Agreement  (including,  without
limitation,  enforcement  or  collection  of the Notes),  the Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain  from  acting  (and shall be fully  protected  in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders,  and such
instructions  shall be  binding  upon all  Lenders  and all  holders  of  Notes;
provided,  however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that
exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or
applicable  law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender  prompt  notice of each
notice  given to it by the  Borrower  pursuant  to the terms of this  Agreement.
Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,  the
Agent shall not have any duty or  responsibility,  except  those  expressly  set
forth herein,  or any  fiduciary  relationship  with any Lender,  and no implied
covenant,  function responsibility,  duty, obligation or liability shall be read
into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

     SECTION  7.02.  Agent's  Reliance,  Etc..  The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact. The Agent
shall not be  responsible  for the  negligence  or  misconduct  of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors,  officers, agents, employees,  attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
shall be liable for any action  taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under
or in  connection  with  this  Agreement,  except  for its or  their  own  gross
negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without  limitation of the generality of the
foregoing,  the Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment  and Acceptance  entered into
by the  Lender  that is the payee of such Note,  as  assignor,  and an  Eligible
Assignee,  as assignee, as provided in Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal
counsel (including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and
other  experts  selected  by it and shall not be liable for any action  taken or
omitted  to be taken in good faith by it in  accordance  with the advice of such
counsel,  accountants or experts;  (iii) makes no warranty or  representation to
any  Lender  and shall not be  responsible  to any  Lender  for any  statements,
warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection
with this Agreement;  (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as
to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property (including
the books and  records) of the  Borrower;  (v) shall not be  responsible  to any
Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency  or value of this  Agreement  or any other  instrument  or  document
furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect
of this  Agreement  by acting upon any  notice,  consent,  certificate  or other
instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,  telegram or telex)  believed
by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

     SECTION 7.03.  LCPI and  Affiliates . With respect to its  Commitment,  the
Advances  made by it and the Note  issued to it, LCPI shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"  shall,  unless
otherwise expressly indicated, include LCPI in its individual capacity. LCPI and
its Affiliates may lend money to, accept  investment  banking  engagements from,
and generally  engage in any kind of business  with,  the  Borrower,  any of its
Subsidiaries  and any Person who may do business with, or own securities of, the
Borrower or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if LCPI were not the Agent and without
any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
<PAGE>

     SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently  and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also  acknowledges  that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem  appropriate  at the
time,  continue to make its own credit  decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

     SECTION  7.05.  Indemnification  . The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent
(to the  extent  not  reimbursed  by the  Borrower),  ratably  according  to the
respective  principal  amounts  of the Notes then held by each of them (or if no
Notes are at the time  outstanding  or if any Notes are held by Persons that are
not Lenders,  ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),
from  and  against  any  and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature  whatsoever  that may be imposed  on,  incurred  by, or  asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
action  taken or omitted by the Agent under this  Agreement  (collectively,  the
"Indemnified Costs"); provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
the  Indemnified  Costs  resulting from the Agent's gross  negligence or willful
misconduct;  and provided further, that no Designated Lender shall be liable for
any payment  under this  Section  7.05 so long as, and to the extent  that,  its
Designating Lender makes such payment. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent  promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any out-of-pocket  expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in
connection   with  the   preparation,   execution,   delivery,   administration,
modification,  amendment or enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal
proceedings  or  otherwise)  of,  or  legal  advice  in  respect  of  rights  or
responsibilities  under,  this  Agreement,  to the extent  that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.  In the case of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05
applies whether any such  investigation,  litigation or proceeding is brought by
the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

     SECTION 7.06.  Successor  AgentSECTION 7.06.  Successor  AgentSECTION 7.06.
Successor  Agent.  The Agent may  resign  at any time by giving  written  notice
thereof to the Lenders and the  Borrower  and may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Borrower  shall  have the right to  appoint a  successor  Agent,  subject to the
approval of the Required Lenders,  such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.  If no successor  Agent shall have been so appointed by the Borrower
and approved by the Required Lenders,  and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor Agent subject to the approval of the
Borrower and the Required Lenders, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.  Upon the  acceptance  of any  appointment  as Agent  hereunder by a
successor  Agent,  such successor  Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become
vested with all the rights,  powers,  discretion,  privileges  and duties of the
retiring  Agent,  and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations  under this  Agreement.  After any retiring  Agent's  resignation or
removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall continue to
inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Agreement.

     SECTION  7.07.  The Lead Arranger . The Lead  Arranger,  in its capacity as
such,  has no duty or  responsibility  , and  incurs no  liability,  under  this
Agreement.

     SECTION 8.01.  Amendments,  Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this  Agreement  or the Notes,  nor  consent to any  departure  by the  Borrower
therefrom,  shall in any event be effective  unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by or on behalf of the Borrower and the  Required  Lenders,  and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific  instance and for

<PAGE>

the specific  purpose for which given;  provided,  however,  that no  amendment,
waiver or consent  shall,  unless in  writing  and signed by or on behalf of the
Borrower  and all the  Lenders,  do any of the  following:  (a) waive any of the
conditions  specified  in Section  3.01,  (b) increase  the  Commitments  of the
Lenders or subject the  Lenders to any  additional  obligations,  (c) reduce the
principal  of, or interest  on, the Notes or any fees or other  amounts  payable

interest  on,  the Notes or any fees or other  amounts  payable  hereunder,  (e)
change the place or the currency of the payments to be made on the Advances, (f)
change the percentage of the  Commitments or of the aggregate  unpaid  principal
amount of the Notes,  or the number of Lenders,  that shall be required  for the
Lenders or any of them to take any action  hereunder  or (g) amend this  Section
8.01; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by or on behalf of the Agent or the Lead Arranger in addition
to the Persons  required above to take such action,  affect the rights or duties
of the  Agent or the Lead  Arranger  under  this  Agreement  or any  Note.  Each
Designating  Lender may act on behalf of its  Designated  Lender with respect to
any rights of its Designated  Lender to grant or withhold any amendment,  waiver
or consent hereunder or with respect to the Notes.

     SECTION 8.02. Notices, Etc . All notices and other communications  provided

     SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses, Etc. (a) The Borrower agrees
to pay, upon demand and presentation to the Borrower of a statement of account,
(i) all reasonable and documented third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses

     (b) (i) The Borrower  agrees to indemnify  each of the Lead  Arranger,  the
Agent,  the Lenders and any Person who may control the Lead Arranger,  the Agent
or any Lender and their  respective  officers,  directors,  employees and agents
(each, an "Indemnified Party") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any
and all losses,  claims,  damages and liabilities to which any Indemnified Party
may become subject  arising out of, or in connection  with, the entering into of
this Agreement,  the issuance of the Notes and the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Advances and the consummation of any matter contemplated by this
Agreement;   provided  that  the  foregoing  indemnity,  will  not,  as  to  any
Indemnified  Party, apply to losses,  claims,  damages or liabilities that arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.

                    (ii) The Borrower  shall be entitled to  participate  in any
                         action or  proceeding  of which it has been notified by
                         any  Indemnified  Party except any action or proceeding
                         brought by or for the  benefit of the  Borrower  or any
                         Subsidiary  of  the  Borrower  against  an  Indemnified
                         Party.

                    (iii)Promptly  after  receipt  by an  Indemnified  Party  of
                         written notice of any loss, liability, claim, damage or
                         expense in respect of which  indemnity may be sought by
                         it hereunder,  such Indemnified  Party will, if a claim
                         is to be made against the Borrower, notify the Borrower
                         thereof in writing,  but the  omission so to notify the
                         Borrower  will not  relieve the  Borrower  from (i) any
                         liability  under this Section which it may have to such
                         Indemnified Party except to the extent the Borrower was
                         prejudiced by such omission or (ii) any liability other
                         than  under  this  Section  8.04(b).   Thereafter,  the
                         Indemnified  Party and the Borrower shall  consult,  to
                         the extent  appropriate,  with a view to minimizing the
                         cost to the Borrower of its obligations  hereunder.  In
                         case any Indemnified  Party receives  written notice of
                         any  liability,  loss,  claim,  damage  or  expense  in
                         respect  of  which   indemnity  may  be  sought  by  it
                         hereunder  and it notifies  the Borrower  thereof,  the
                         Borrower will be entitled to participate  therein,  and
                         to the  extent  that it may  elect  by  written  notice
                         delivered  to  the  Indemnified  Party  promptly  after
                         receiving  the  aforesaid  notice from the  Indemnified
                         Party,  to assume  the  defense  thereof  with  counsel
                         reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Indemnified  Parties
                         (and,  if the  Agent  or one or  more  Lenders  are the
                         Indemnified  Parties,  the Agent and such Lenders shall
                         be  entitled  jointly  to direct  the  conduct of their
                         defense);   provided,  however,  that  if  the  parties
                         against  which  any loss,  claim,  damage,  expense  or
                         liability arises include both an Indemnified  Party and
                         the  Borrower  and such  Indemnified  Party  shall have
                         reasonably  concluded  that  (i)  there  may  be  legal
                         defenses  available to it or other Indemnified  Parties
                         which  are  different   from  or  additional  to  those
                         available  to the  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary  of the
                         Borrower  and  may  conflict  therewith  or (ii) if any
                         liability, loss, claim, damage or expense arises out of
                         actions  brought by or for the benefit of the  Borrower
                         or any  Subsidiary  of the  Borrower,  the  Indemnified
                         Parties collectively shall have the right to select one
                         separate  counsel  to assume  such legal  defenses  and
                         otherwise to  participate  in the defense of such loss,
                         claim, damage or liability on behalf of the Indemnified
                         Parties.  Upon  receipt  by the  Indemnified  Party  of
                         notice from the  Borrower of its election to assume the
                         defense  of such  liability,  loss,  claim,  damage  or
                         expense  and  approval  by  the  Indemnified  Party  of
                         counsel,  the  Borrower  shall  not  be  liable  to the
                         Indemnified  Party  for any  legal  or  other  expenses
                         subsequently  incurred  by  the  Indemnified  Party  in
                         connection  with the  defense  thereof  unless  (i) the
                         Indemnified  Party shall have  employed such counsel in
                         connection  with the  assumption  of legal  defenses in
                         accordance  with  the  proviso  to the  next  preceding
                         sentence, (ii) the Borrower shall not have employed and
                         continued to employ counsel reasonably  satisfactory to
                         the  Indemnified  Party to  represent  the  Indemnified
                         Party  within  a   reasonable   time  after  notice  of
                         commencement  of the action or (iii) the Borrower shall
                         have  authorized in writing the  employment of separate
                         counsel for the Indemnified Party at the expense of the
                         Borrower.  At the  Borrower's  request,  an Indemnified
                         Party will settle,  compromise  or consent to the entry
                         of any order adjudicating or otherwise disposing of any
                         loss, claim, damage or liability for which the Borrower
                         is liable hereunder if such  settlement,  compromise or
                         consent to entry of any order (A)  includes a provision
                         unconditionally  releasing each Indemnified  Party from
                         and holding each Indemnified Party harmless against all
                         liability in respect of claims by any  releasing  party
                         relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes
                         and the  matters  contemplated  herein,  (B)  does  not
                         require any admission or  acknowledgment of culpability
                         or  wrongdoing by such  Indemnified  Party and (C) does
                         not  involve  performance  by, or the  payment of money
                         damages by, such Indemnified  Party. The Borrower shall
                         not be liable for any settlement, compromise or consent
                         to the entry of any  order  adjudicating  or  otherwise
                         disposing  of any  loss,  claim,  damage  or  liability
                         effected without its consent.
<PAGE>

     (c) The  Borrower  agrees to  indemnify  each  Lender  for its  actual  and
documented  losses  (excluding  any loss of  profit  and/or  margin),  costs and
expenses  reasonably  incurred by it resulting from any payment or prepayment of
principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Advance under this Agreement
or the Notes,  which  payment or prepayment is made on a day other than the last
day of the relevant Interest Period, excluding,  however, any such losses, costs
and expenses resulting from a payment or prepayment made more than 60 days prior
to demand  being made to the  Borrower by such Lender for  indemnification.  The
payment of such  indemnity  to a Lender shall be made within 30 days of a demand
by such Lender complying with Section 8.04(d).

     (d) Any demand by a Lender for payment under Section  2.02(c),  2.10, 2.13,
8.04(b) or 8.04(c) or under any other  indemnity made by the Borrower under this
Agreement  shall be made in writing to the  Borrower  (with a copy to the Agent)
and shall be  accompanied  by a  certificate  of an  officer of the Agent or the
relevant Lender,  as may be appropriate,  setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of the amount demanded.

     (e) To the extent  permitted  by law, if any Lender  notifies  the Borrower
that additional amounts will be due under Section 2.10 or that any of the events
outlined in Section 2.11 have  occurred,  such Lender will change its Applicable
Lending Office if as a result thereof such increased costs would not be required
to be so paid or it would  not be  illegal  for  such  Lender  to make,  fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances,  and provided such Lender determines that
such change is not commercially  unreasonable.  The Borrower will reimburse such
Lender for all  reasonable  expenses it may incur as a result of complying  with
this Section 8.04(e).

     (f) If any  circumstances  arise which result, or such Lender becomes aware
of any  circumstances  which might result,  in the Borrower  having to make such
compensation  or  indemnification  or in it becoming  illegal for such Lender to
make, fund or maintain such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Advances,  such Lender will
promptly  notify the Borrower  thereof and, in  consultation  with the Borrower,
such Lender shall take all such steps,  if any, as it determines  are reasonable
and the  Borrower  determines  are  acceptable  to mitigate  the effect of those
circumstances.

     (g)  Without  prejudice  to the  survival  of any  other  agreement  of the
Borrower or of the Lenders  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations of the
Borrower  contained in Sections 2.10,  2.13 and 8.04 and the  obligations of the
Lenders  contained in Sections  2.13,  8.04,  8.07(g) and 8.08 shall survive the
payment in full of principal,  interest and all other amounts payable  hereunder
and under the Notes.

     (h) The Borrower  shall pay to the Agent for the account each Lender and to
the Agent and the Lead Arranger for their own  respective  accounts such fees as
may from  time to time be  agreed  between  the  Borrower  and the  Agent or the
Borrower and the Lead Arranger.

     SECTION  8.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon  declaration  by the Agent that the
Advances and the Notes are due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section
6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  to set off and apply  any and all  deposits
(general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time held by
such Lender to, or for the credit or the account  of, the  Borrower  against any
and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter  existing under this
Agreement  and the Notes held by such  Lender,  whether or not such Lender shall
have made any  demand  under this  Agreement  or such  Notes and  although  such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower
after any such set-off and  application,  provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Lender  under this  Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including,  without  limitation,  other rights of set-off) that such Lender may
have.

     SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become effective (other
than Section 2.01,  which shall only become  effective upon  satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed
by the Borrower and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by the
Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter  shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender
and their respective successors and assigns,  except that the Borrower shall not
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Lenders.
<PAGE>

     SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may assign to
(i) one or more  Eligible  Assignees  with the approval of the Agent and, in the
case of any  Eligible  Assignee  not listed in clause (i) of the  definition  of
"Eligible Assignee",  the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or  delayed)  and (ii) one or more  other  entities  with  the  approval  of the
Borrower  and the Agent,  all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under
this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  all  or  a  portion  of  its
Commitment,  the  Advances  owing  to it and  the  Note  or  Notes  held by it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not
a varying,  percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement,  (ii)
except in the case of an assignment to a Person that,  immediately prior to such
assignment,  was a Lender  or an  assignment  of all of a  Lender's  rights  and
obligations under this Agreement,  the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender being  assigned  pursuant to each such  assignment  (determined as of the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment)  shall be
$5,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (iii) the parties to
each such assignment  shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance
and recording in the  Register,  and, if the relevant  Eligible  Assignee is not
listed in clause (i) of the definition of "Eligible  Assignee",  to the Borrower
for its acceptance, an appropriate Assignment and Acceptance,  together with any
Note subject to such assignment and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
not entered into to effect the General Syndication, a processing and recordation
fee of $3,000. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in each  Assignment and  Acceptance,  (x) the
assignee  thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such  Assignment and
Acceptance,  have the rights and  obligations of a Lender  hereunder and (y) the
Lender  assignor  thereunder  shall,  to the extent that rights and  obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such  Assignment and  Acceptance,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations  under this Agreement
(other than under  Sections  2.13(f),  8.07(g) and 8.08) (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto).

     (b) If any Lender (i) shall make a demand under Section 8.04(d) for payment
in respect of a claim under  Section 2.10 or shall give a notice  under  Section
2.11 of any  unlawfulness  or assertion  of  unlawfulness  contemplated  by such
Section or any demand  shall be made or any amount shall be payable with respect
to any Lender under Section 2.13,  the Borrower may, by written  notice given to
such  Lender  within 45 days of the making by such  Lender of such  demand,  the
giving by such Lender of such notice or such  Lender  becoming a  Non-Consenting
Lender,  require by written  notice to such Lender that such Lender  assign,  by
executing and  delivering an Acceptance  and  Assignment,  within 15 days of the
giving by the  Borrower  of such  notice but on at least  three  Business  Days'
notice to one or more Persons in accordance  with Section  8.07(a) such Lender's
Commitment  and its  Advances  against  payment  to such  Lender in  immediately
available funds of the principal  amount of such Advances,  all interest accrued
thereon to the date of payment,  all fees  accrued by such Lender to the date of
payment,  any amounts payable to such Lender under Section 8.04(c) and all other
amounts payable hereunder to such Lender.

     (c) By executing and  delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,  the Lender
assignor  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty  and  assumes  no  responsibility   with  respect  to  any  statements,
warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto;  (ii) such  assigning  Lender  makes no  representation  or warranty and
assumes  no  responsibility  with  respect  to the  financial  condition  of the
Borrower  or  the  performance  or  observance  by  the  Borrower  of any of its
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement,  together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section  4.01  and  such  other  documents  and  information  as it  has  deemed
appropriate  to make its own credit  analysis  and  decision  to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance;  (iv) such assignee will,  independently  and without
reliance upon the Agent,  such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such  documents  and  information  as it shall  deem  appropriate  at the  time,
continue to make its own credit  decisions in taking or not taking  action under
this Agreement;  (v) such assignee  confirms that it is an Eligible  Assignee or
that it is an entity that has been  approved by the Borrower and the Agent under
Section  8.07(a);  (vi) such assignee  appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such  action as agent on its behalf and to exercise  such powers and  discretion
under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together
with such powers and discretion as are reasonably  incidental thereto; and (vii)
such assignee  agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of
the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed
by it as a Lender.
<PAGE>

     (d) The Agent shall  maintain at its address  referred to in Section 8.02 a
copy of each  Assignment  and  Acceptance  delivered to and accepted by it and a
register for the  recordation  of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
Commitment  of, and principal  amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from
time to time (the  "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person  whose name is recorded in the Register as
a Lender  hereunder for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The Register  shall be
available for  inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any  reasonable  time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e) Upon  its  receipt  of an  Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed  by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee or
that it is an entity that has been  approved by the Borrower and the Agent under
Section 8.07(a), together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the
Agent shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has been completed and is in
substantially  the form of Exhibit C hereto,  (i)  accept  such  Assignment  and
Acceptance,  (ii) record the information  contained  therein in the Register and
(iii)  promptly  give  notice and a copy  thereof to the  Borrower.  Within five
Business  Days  after its  receipt  of such  notice,  the  Borrower,  at its own
expense,  shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered
Note a new Note to such Eligible  Assignee or other entity in an amount equal to
the Commitment  assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if
the  assigning  Lender has  retained a Commitment  hereunder,  a new Note to the
assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment  retained by it hereunder.
Such new Note or Notes shall be in an  aggregate  principal  amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the
effective  date of such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  and shall  otherwise be in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

     (f) Each  Lender  may  sell  participations  to one or more  banks or other
entities  (other than the Borrower or any of its  Affiliates)  in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including,  without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  its  Commitment to the
Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender  shall  remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this  Agreement,  (iv) the  Borrower,  the  Agent and the  other  Lenders  shall
continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender in  connection  with such
Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement and (v) no  participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or
waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by the Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent  would reduce the  principal  of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such  participation,  or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in
each case to the  extent  subject to such  participation.  Each  Lender  selling
participations shall provide prompt notice to the Borrower and the Agent of such
participations and the purchasers of such participations.

     (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or  participation  or
proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to
the  assignee  or  participant  or  proposed   assignee  or   participant,   any
Confidential  Information;  provided  that,  prior to any such  disclosure,  the
assignee or participant or proposed  assignee or participant shall have executed
and   delivered  to  such  Lender  and  to  the   Borrower  a  duly   authorized
confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2.

     (h)  Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in this Agreement,  any
Lender may at any time  create a security  interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the Advances owing
to it and  the  Note  held  by it) in  favor  of any  Federal  Reserve  Bank  in
accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve
System.
<PAGE>

     (i) Any Lender may at any time designate with the prior written  consent of
the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed) not more
than one Designated Lender to fund Advances on behalf of such Designating Lender
subject to the terms of this  Section  8.07(i)  and the  provisions  of Sections
8.07(a) through (h) shall not apply to such designation. No Lender may have more
than one Designated Lender at any time. Such designation may occur either by the
execution  before  the  Funds  Availability  Date of the  signature  pages of an
Assignment  and  Acceptance  by such  Lender and  Designated  Lender next to the
appropriate  "Designating  Lender"  and  "Designated  Lender"  captions,  or  by
execution  by such  parties  of a  Designation  Agreement  on or after the Funds
Availability Date; provided, that any Lender and its Designated Lender executing
the signature pages of any Assignment and Acceptance as "Designating Lender" and
"Designated Lender",  respectively,  before the Funds Availability Date shall be
deemed  to have  executed  a  Designation  Agreement,  and shall be bound by the
respective  representations,  warranties and covenants  contained  therein.  The
parties to each such  designation  occurring on or after the Funds  Availability
Date  shall  execute  and  deliver  to the  Agent  and the  Borrower  for  their
acceptance  a  Designation  Agreement.  Upon such  receipt  of an  appropriately
completed  Designation Agreement executed by a Designating Lender and a designee
representing  that it is a Designated  Lender and  consented to by the Borrower,
the Agent will accept such  Designation  Agreement  and will give prompt  notice
thereof to the Borrower and the other Lenders,  whereupon (i) the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Designating  Lender a Designated  Lender Note payable
to the order of the  Designated  Lender,  (ii) from and after the effective date
specified in the  Designation  Agreement,  the Designated  Lender shall become a
party  to  this  Agreement  with a right  to  make  Advances  on  behalf  of its
Designating  Lender pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and (iii) the Designated  Lender
shall not be required to make payments with respect to any  obligations  in this
Agreement  except to the extent of excess  cash flow of such  Designated  Lender
which is not otherwise  required to repay  obligations of such Designated Lender
which are then due and  payable;  provided,  however,  that  regardless  of such
designation  and assumption by the Designated  Lender,  the  Designating  Lender
shall be and remain  obligated  to the  Borrower,  the Agent and the Lenders for
each and every of the  obligations  of the  Designating  Lender and its  related
Designated Lender with respect to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any  indemnification  obligations  under  Section  7.05  hereof,  and  any  sums
otherwise  payable to the Borrower by the Designated  Lender.  Each  Designating
Lender,  or  specified  branch  or  affiliate   thereof,   shall  serve  as  the
administrative  agent  of its  Designated  Lender  and  shall on  behalf  of its
Designated Lender: (i) receive any and all payments made for the benefit of such
Designated Lender and (ii) give and receive all  communications  and notices and
take all actions hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  votes,  approvals,
waivers, consents and amendments under or relating to this Credit Agreement. Any
such notice,  communication,  vote, approval, waiver, consent or amendment shall
be signed by a Designating  Lender, or specified branch or affiliate thereof, as
administrative  agent for its  Designated  Lender and need not be signed by such
Designated Lender on its own behalf. The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may
rely  thereon  without  any  requirement  that  the  Designated  Lender  sign or
acknowledge  the same.  No  Designated  Lender may assign or transfer all or any
portion  of  its  interest  hereunder,  other  than  via  an  assignment  to its
Designating  Lender or Liquidity Lender, if any, or otherwise in accordance with
the provisions of Section 8.07(a) through (h) hereof.

     SECTION 8.08.  Confidentiality  . (a) Neither the Agent,  the Lead Arranger
nor any Lender  shall,  without the prior written  consent of the Borrower,  (i)
disclose  the  Confidential  Information  to any Person  except as  permitted by
Section 8.07(g) or this Section 8.08 or (ii) use, either directly or indirectly,
any of the Confidential  Information  except in concert with the Borrower and in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (b) The Agent and each Lender may disclose the Confidential Information (i)
to  their  respective   Representatives   who  need  to  know  the  Confidential
Information for the purpose of administering this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  hereby or for the discharge of their  duties,  who are informed by
the  Agent  or  such  Lender  of the  confidential  nature  of the  Confidential
Information,  and who  agree to be bound by the  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement  to the same  extent as the Agent or such Lender and (ii) to any party
hereto.

     (c) Each of the Agent and each Lender agrees that,  without the  Borrower's
prior written consent,  it shall not disclose to any person (except as otherwise
expressly permitted herein) the fact that the Confidential  Information has been
made  available or any of the terms,  conditions  or other facts with respect to
the Confidential Information.
<PAGE>

     (d) The  provisions  contained in this Section 8.08 shall be inoperative as
to any portion of the Confidential  Information that (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public on a nonconfidential basis through no fault or action by
the Agent, the Lead Arranger, any Lender or their respective Representatives, or
(ii) is or becomes  available to the Agent, the Lead Arranger or any Lender on a
nonconfidential  basis from a source other than the Borrower,  its Affiliates or
Representatives  or the  Agent or the Lead  Arranger  or their  Representatives,
which  source,  to the best  knowledge  of the Agent,  the Lead  Arranger or any
Lender,  as  may  be  appropriate,   is  not  prohibited  from  disclosing  such
Confidential  Information  to the Agent,  the Lead  Arranger or such Lender by a
contractual,  legal or fiduciary obligation to the Borrower, the Agent, the Lead
Arranger or any Lender.

     (e) The Agent and each Lender may disclose the Confidential  Information at
the request of any regulatory or supervisory  authority having jurisdiction over
it or to the extent necessary for purposes of enforcing this Agreement.

     (f) In the event that the Agent or any Lender becomes legally  compelled to
disclose any of the Confidential  Information  otherwise than as contemplated by
Section 8.08(e), the Agent or such Lender shall provide the Borrower with notice
of such event promptly upon its obtaining knowledge thereof (provided that it is
not  otherwise  prohibited  by Law from giving such notice) so that the Borrower
may seek a protective order or other appropriate  remedy. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Agent or such Lender shall
furnish only that  portion of the  Confidential  Information  that it is legally
required to furnish and shall  cooperate with the  Borrower's  counsel to enable
the  Borrower to obtain a  protective  order or other  reliable  assurance  that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

     (g) In the event of any breach of this Section 8.08,  the Borrower shall be
entitled to equitable relief (including  injunction and specific performance) in
addition to all other remedies available to it at law or in equity.

     (h) Except as otherwise  agreed between the Lead Arranger and the Borrower,
none of the Agent or any Lender shall make a public announcement, advertisement,
statement,  or  communication  regarding  the Borrower,  its  Affiliates or this
Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  without the prior  written
consent of the Borrower.

     (i) Any Designated Lender may disclose any Confidential
Information to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or Liquidity Lender to
such Designated Lender; provided, however, that each of such Persons is informed
by the Designated Lender of the confidential nature of the Confidential
Information and each such commercial paper dealer and Liquidity Lender agrees to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Section 8.08 to the same extent as
the Designated Lender.

     (j) The  obligations  of the Agent and each Lender  under this Section 8.08
shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.09. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

     SECTION 8.10. Execution in Counterparts.. This Agreement may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed  shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken  together shall  constitute  one and the same  agreement.
Delivery of an executed  counterpart  of a signature  page to this  Agreement by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart of
this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.11.  Jurisdiction,  Etc..  (a) Each of the parties  hereto hereby
irrevocably and  unconditionally  submits,  for itself and its property,  to the
nonexclusive  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, New York County,  United States
District Court for the Southern  District of New York,  and any appellate  court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Notes, or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and
each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that
all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and

<PAGE>

determined  in such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted by law, in
such federal  court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.
Nothing in this  Agreement  shall affect any right that any party may  otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or the Notes
in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  waives, to
the fullest  extent it may legally and  effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or  hereafter  have to the  laying  of  venue  of any  suit,  action  or
proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal  court.  Each of the  parties  hereto  hereby  irrevocably
waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     SECTION 8.12. No Bankruptcy Proceedings . Each of the Borrower, the Lenders
and the Agent agrees that it will not institute against any Designated Lender or
join  any  other  Person  in  instituting  against  any  Designated  Lender  any
bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency or liquidation proceeding
under any federal or state  bankruptcy  or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by
such Designated Lender.

     SECTION 8.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders  hereby  irrevocably  waives  all right to trial by jury in any  action,
proceeding  or  counterclaim  (whether  based on  contract,  tort or  otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the Notes or the actions of the
Agent  or  any  Lender  in  the  negotiation,  administration,   performance  or
enforcement thereof.

                           FACILITY C CREDIT AGREEMENT


              TERMS OF SUBORDINATION OF AFFILIATE SUBORDINATED DEBT


     Terms defined in the Credit Agreements  referred to below are used in these
Terms of Subordination  with their defined meanings except as otherwise  defined
herein.

     SECTION 1. "Affiliate  Subordinated Debt" Defined.  "Affiliate Subordinated
Debt" means,  for purposes of these Terms of Subordination  (this  "Agreement"),
[describe the specific  Affiliate  Subordinated Debt that is being  subordinated
hereby--to  include  all  amounts  payable  in  connection   therewith],   which
constitutes  Debt of the  Borrower  originally  issued  to a  Person  that is an
Affiliate of the Borrower, other than a Subsidiary of the Borrower, and which is
subordinated on the terms set forth below.  Debt of the Borrower  payable to any
entity that is formed by the  Borrower or an  Affiliate  of the Borrower for the
purpose of issuing securities in the public or capital markets,  or in a private
placement,  shall not constitute "Affiliate  Subordinated Debt" for all purposes
hereof.

     SECTION 2. Agreement to Subordinate.  The holder hereof (the  "Subordinated
Creditor") and the Borrower each agree that the Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt is
and shall be subordinate, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth,
to the prior payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing  under (a) the  Facility  A Credit  Agreement,  the  Facility  B Credit
Agreement and the Facility C Credit Agreement, each dated as of August 31, 1999,
as from time to time in effect (the "Credit  Agreements"),  among the  Borrower,
the financial  institution(s) party thereto and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as
Agent for such financial  institution(s),  and the Notes issued pursuant thereto
and (b) such  documents as may be listed on Schedule I hereto on the date hereof
or from  time to time  added  to said  Schedule  I by a  writing  signed  by the
Borrower and the  Subordinated  Creditor (such  instruments  and documents being
referred to herein  collectively  as the "Senior Debt  Documents",  which phrase
"Senior Debt Documents" shall not include any such instruments  and/or documents
as may be deleted from said Schedule I from time to time by a writing  signed by
the Borrower and the  Subordinated  Creditor,  which deletion or deletions shall
require  the  consent  of no other  Person or  Persons  except to the extent the
Borrower has otherwise agreed in writing with, or for the benefit of, such other
Person  or  Persons,   whether  for  principal,   interest   (including  without
limitation,  interest as provided in the Notes and in the Senior Debt  Documents
accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding referred to in
Section  3(a),  whether or not such  interest  accrues  after the filing of such
petition for purposes of the Federal  Bankruptcy  code or is an allowed claim in
such proceeding),  fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations of the Borrower
under  the  Credit   Agreements  and  the  Senior  Debt   Documents   being  the
"Obligations"). For the purposes of this Agreement, the Obligations shall not be
deemed to have been paid in full  until (i) with  respect  to the  Lenders,  the
Termination  Date under the Facility A Credit  Agreement  and the Maturity  Date
under the Facility B Credit  Agreement and the Facility C Credit Agreement shall
have occurred and (ii) with respect to each Senior  Creditor (as defined below),
the  obligation  under each of its  respective  Senior Debt  Documents to extend
credit,  disburse funds or acquire a debt  instrument  shall have terminated and
unless the  Lenders and the  creditors  under the Senior  Debt  Documents  (such
creditors being referred to collectively herein as the "Senior Creditors") shall
have  received  payment of their  respective  Obligations  in full in cash.  The
Borrower  and  the  Subordinated   Creditor  shall  endorse  on  any  instrument
evidencing  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt a  statement  to the effect that it is
subject to these terms of subordination.

     SECTION 3. Events of  Subordination.  (a) In the event of any  dissolution,
winding up, liquidation,  arrangement,  reorganization,  adjustment, protection,
relief or  composition  of the  Borrower  or its  debts,  whether  voluntary  or
involuntary,  in  any  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   arrangement,   reorganization,
receivership,  relief or other similar case or  proceeding  under any Federal or
State  bankruptcy  or  similar  law or upon an  assignment  for the  benefit  of
creditors or any other  marshaling of the assets and liabilities of the Borrower
or otherwise,  the Lenders and the Senior Creditors shall be entitled to receive
payment in full of their respective Obligations before the Subordinated Creditor

<PAGE>

is entitled to receive any payment of all or any of the  Affiliate  Subordinated
Debt, and any payment or distribution of any kind (whether in cash,  property or
securities)  that otherwise would be payable or deliverable upon or with respect
to the Affiliate Subordinated Debt in any such case,  proceeding,  assignment or
marshaling  (including  any  payment  that may be payable by reason of any other
Debt of the Borrower being subordinated to payment of the Affiliate Subordinated
Debt) shall be paid or delivered  directly to Lehman  Commercial  Paper Inc., as
Agent under the Credit  Agreements,  for the account of the Lenders,  and to the
Senior  Creditors or to a trustee or other agent for the Senior Creditors or for
any group of the Senior  Creditors  (any such trustee or agent being referred to
herein as a "Representative") which may be listed on Schedule I hereto, pro rata
according to the principal  amount of the Obligations  then owed by the Borrower
to each of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, for application (in the case of
cash) to, or as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities) for,
the payment or prepayment of the Obligations  until the  Obligations  shall have
been paid in full.

     (b) In the event  that (i) any  Default or Event of  Default  described  in
Section  6.01(a) of a Credit  Agreement  or any payment  default by the Borrower
under a Senior Debt  Document  shall have occurred and be  continuing,  (ii) any
Event of Default or any "event of  default"  under a Senior Debt  Document  that
would  entitle the creditors  under such Senior Debt Document to accelerate  the
maturity of indebtedness evidenced by such Senior Debt Document (a "Senior Event
of Default")  (other than as referred to in the preceding clause (i)) shall have
occurred and be  continuing  or (iii) any judicial  proceeding  shall be pending
with respect to any Event of Default or Senior Event of Default, then no payment
(including  any  payment  that may be payable by reason of any other Debt of the
Borrower being  subordinated to payment of the Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt) or
distribution of any kind, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be made
by or on behalf of the Borrower for or on account of any Affiliate  Subordinated
Debt, and the Subordinated Creditor shall not take or receive from the Borrower,
directly  or  indirectly,  in cash or other  property or by set-off in any other
manner, including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral,  payment of
all or any of the Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt until the Obligations shall have
been paid in full.

     (c) Until the Termination Date under the Facility A Credit Agreement or the
Maturity  Date under the Facility B Credit  Agreement  and the Facility C Credit
Agreement  shall have occurred and the  Obligations  thereunder then owed by the
Borrower  to the  Lenders  shall  have  been  paid in full in cash,  no  payment
(including  any  payment  that may be payable by reason of any other Debt of the
Borrower being  subordinated to the payment of the Affiliate  Subordinated Debt)
or distribution of any kind, whether in cash,  property or securities,  shall be
made  by or on  behalf  of the  Borrower  for  or on  account  of any  Affiliate
Subordinated Debt, and the Subordinated  Creditor shall not take or receive from
the  Borrower,  directly or  indirectly,  in cash,  property or securities or by
set-off or in any other manner, including, without limitation, from or by way of
collateral, payment of all or any of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt at any time
unless at the end of the fiscal quarter (including the fourth fiscal quarter) of
the Borrower for which financial  statements have been delivered to the Agent by
the Borrower  pursuant to Section  5.02(c) or (d) of the Credit  Agreements most
recently  preceding the date on which the Borrower takes such action,  the ratio
of Cash Available for Corporate Debt Service to Corporate  Interest was at least
2.25:1.00  (if at the time such action is to be taken the  Borrower is not rated
Investment Grade) or 2.00:1.00 (if at such time the Borrower is rated Investment
Grade),  calculated for the period  comprised of the four fiscal quarters ending
on the date of such  financial  statements  (or,  if at such time less than four
fiscal  quarters  have  ended  since the date of signing  the Credit  Agreement,
calculated for the immediately  preceding  fiscal  quarters  commencing with the
fiscal  quarter  ending  September  30,  1999) and with  effect from the date of
delivery of such financial statements.

     SECTION 4. In  Furtherance  of  Subordination.  The  Subordinated  Creditor
agrees as follows:

     (a) If any proceeding  referred to in Section 3(a) above is commenced by or
against the Borrower,

                    (i)  Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent for the Lenders,
                         and the Senior  Creditors,  acting  directly or through
                         one or more  Representatives,  are  hereby  irrevocably
                         authorized  and empowered (in their own names or in the
                         name of the  Subordinated  Creditor or otherwise),  but
                         shall have no obligation,  to demand,  sue for, collect
                         and receive every payment or  distribution  referred to
                         in Section 3(a) to which they are  entitled  thereunder
                         and give  acquittance  therefor  and to file claims and
                         proofs of claim and take such other action  (including,
                         without limitation,  voting the Affiliate  Subordinated


                         Debt pro rata according  to the principal amount of the
                         Obligations  then owed by the  Borrower  to each of the
                         Lenders  and the  Senior  Creditors  or  enforcing  any
                         security interest or other lien securing payment of the
<PAGE>

                         Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt) as it may deem necessary
                         or advisable for the exercise or  enforcement of any of
                         the rights or interests of the Agent, the Lenders,  the
                         Representatives and the Senior Creditors hereunder; and

                    (ii) the Subordinated  Creditor shall duly and promptly take

                         collect   and   receive   any  and  all   payments   or
                         distributions  which may be payable or deliverable upon
                         or  with  respect  to  the  Subordinated   Debt,  which
                         payments and  distributions  shall be  distributed  pro
                         rata   according  to  the   principal   amount  of  the
                         Obligations  then owed by the  Borrower  to each of the
                         Lenders and the Senior Creditors.

     (b) All payments or  distributions  upon or with  respect to the  Affiliate
Subordinated  Debt which are received by the Subordinated  Creditor  contrary to
the provisions of this  Agreement  shall be received in trust for the benefit of
the Lenders and the Senior  Creditors pro rata according to the principal amount
of the  Obligations  then owed by the  Borrower  to each of the  Lenders and the
Senior Creditors,  shall be segregated from other funds and property held by the
Subordinated  Creditor  and shall be  forthwith  paid over to Lehman  Commercial
Paper Inc., as Agent for the Lenders, for the account of the Lenders, and to the
Senior  Creditors or their  Representatives  pro rata according to the principal
amount of the  Obligations  then owed by the Borrower to each of the Lenders and
the  Senior  Creditors,  in the same form as so  received  (with  any  necessary
indorsement)  to be applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral  (in
the case of non-cash  property or securities)  for, the payment or prepayment of
the  Obligations in accordance  with the terms of the Credit  Agreements and the
Senior Debt Documents.  Any portion of a payment or  distribution  received by a
Lender or Senior  Creditor  (or by the  Agent or a  Representative)  which is in
excess of its pro rata portion of such payment or distribution  shall be held in
trust by such Lender or Senior  Creditor  (or Agent or  Representative)  for the
benefit of the other  Lenders and Senior  Creditors  to be paid  promptly to the
other Lenders and Senior Creditors (or to the Agent and the  Representatives  on
behalf of such Lenders and Senior Creditors) pro rata according to the principal
amount of the Obligations  then owed by the Borrower to each of such Lenders and
Senior Creditors.

     (c) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent for the Lenders,  and the Senior
Creditors  or their  Representatives  are  hereby  authorized  to seek  specific
performance of this  Agreement,  whether or not the Borrower shall have complied
with  any of the  provisions  hereof  applicable  to it,  at any  time  when the
Subordinated  Creditor shall have failed to comply with any of the provisions of
this Agreement applicable to it.

     SECTION 5. No  Commencement of Any Proceeding.  The  Subordinated  Creditor
agrees  that,  so long as the  Obligations  shall  not have been paid in full in
cash,  the  Subordinated  Creditor will not sue for payment of all or any of the
Affiliate  Subordinated Debt, or commence,  or join with any creditor other than
the Lenders,  Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent for the Lenders, the Senior
Creditors and their Representatives, in commencing any proceeding referred to in
Section 3(a); provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prevent
the Subordinated Creditor from commencing and prosecuting to judgment any action
necessary  to  enforce  such  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt  during  the  period
commencing one year prior to the expiration of the limitation  period  governing
such Affiliate Subordinated Debt under any applicable statute of limitations.

     SECTION 6. Rights of Subrogation.  The Subordinated Creditor agrees that no
payment  or  distribution  to Lehman  Commercial  Paper  Inc.,  as Agent for the
Lenders, the Lenders, the Senior Creditors or their Representatives  pursuant to
the  provisions of this  Agreement  shall entitle the  Subordinated  Creditor to
exercise any right of subrogation in respect thereof until the Obligations shall
have been paid in full.  From and after the payment in full of the  Obligations,
the  Subordinated  Creditor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Agent,  the
Lenders,  the Senior  Creditors and the  Representatives  to receive any further
payments or  distributions  applicable  to the  Obligations  until the Affiliate
Subordinated  Debt shall have been paid in full, in addition to all other rights
of subrogation that the Subordinated Creditor may have. For purposes of any such
subrogation,  no payments or distributions  on the Obligations  pursuant to this
Agreement  shall, as between the Borrower,  its creditors other than the Lenders
and the  Senior  Creditors,  and the  Subordinated  Creditor,  be deemed to be a
payment by the Borrower to or on account of the Obligations,  and no payments or
distributions  to  the  Subordinated   Creditor  of  assets  by  virtue  of  the
subrogation  herein provided for shall,  as between the Borrower,  its creditors
other than the Lenders and the Senior Creditors,  and the Subordinated Creditor,
be deemed to be a payment to or on account of the Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt.
The provisions of this Agreement are and are intended  solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of the Subordinated  Creditor, on the one hand, and
the Lenders,  the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, the Senior Creditors and
the Representatives,  on the other hand, and nothing contained in this Agreement
is  intended  to or  shall  impair  the  obligation  of the  Borrower,  which is
unconditional  and absolute,  to pay the principal of (and premium,  if any) and
interest on the  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt as and when the same shall become
due and payable in accordance with its terms,  or, except as provided in Section
10 below,  to affect the relative  rights of the  Subordinated  Creditor and the
creditors of the Borrower other than the Lenders and the Senior  Creditors,  nor
shall anything  herein  prevent the  Subordinated  Creditor from  exercising all
remedies otherwise  permitted by applicable law upon default under the Affiliate
Subordinated Debt,  subject to the rights, if any, under this Agreement,  of the
Lenders, the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, the Senior Creditors and the
Representatives  in respect of cash,  property  or  securities  of the  Borrower
otherwise payable or delivered to the Subordinated Creditor upon the exercise of
any such remedy.

     SECTION 7.  Agreements  in  Respect of  Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt.  The
Subordinated  Creditor  will not sell,  assign,  pledge,  encumber or  otherwise
dispose of any of the Affiliate  Subordinated Debt unless such sale, assignment,
pledge,  encumbrance or disposition  (i) is to a person or entity other than the
Borrower and (ii) is made expressly subject to this Agreement.

     SECTION 8. Obligations  Hereunder Not Affected.  All rights and interest of
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent for
the  Lenders,   the  Lenders,  the  Senior  Creditors  and  the  Representatives
hereunder,  and all agreements and obligations of the Subordinated  Creditor and
the  Borrower  under  this  Agreement,  shall  remain in full  force and  effect
irrespective of:

                    (i)  any  lack of  validity  or  enforceability  of a Credit
                         Agreement,  a Note, a Senior Debt Document or any other
                         agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                    (ii) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment of,
                         or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations,
                         or any other  amendment  or waiver of or any consent to
                         any  departure  from a  Credit  Agreement,  a Note or a
                         Senior Debt Document,  including,  without  limitation,
                         any  increase  in the  Obligations  resulting  from the
                         extension  of  additional  credit  to the  Borrower  or
                         otherwise;

                    (iii)any taking, exchange,  release or non-perfection of any
                         other collateral,  or any taking,  release or amendment
                         or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty,
                         for all or any of the Obligations;

                    (iv) any manner of application  of  collateral,  or proceeds
                         thereof,  to all or  any  of  the  Obligations,  or any
                         manner of sale or other  disposition  of any collateral
                         for all or any of the  Obligations  or any other assets
                         of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

                    (v)  any  change,   restructuring   or  termination  of  the
                         corporate structure or existence of the Borrower; or

                    (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute
                         a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower
                         or a subordinated creditor.

     This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the  Obligations  is  rescinded  or
must  otherwise be returned by Lehman  Commercial  Paper Inc.,  as Agent for the
Lenders,  any  Lender,  any  Senior  Creditor  or any  Representative  upon  the
insolvency,  bankruptcy or reorganization  of the Borrower or otherwise,  all as
though such payment had not been made.

     SECTION 9. Waiver.  The Subordinated  Creditor and the Borrower each hereby
waives  promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance  and any other notice with
respect to any of the Obligations  and this Agreement and any  requirement  that
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent for the Lenders,  any Lender,  any Senior
Creditor or any Representative  protect,  secure, perfect or insure any security
interest or lien or any  property  subject  thereto or exhaust any right or take
any action against the Borrower or any other person or entity or any collateral.

     SECTION 10. Extension of  Subordination.  The Borrower and the Subordinated
Creditor shall not subordinate the Affiliate  Subordinated  Debt for the benefit
of any one or more other creditors of the Borrower,  now or hereafter  existing,
upon any terms other than those set forth in this  Agreement.  The  Borrower and
the  Subordinated  Creditor  shall have the right to  subordinate  the Affiliate
Subordinated  Debt for the  benefit  of any one or more other  creditors  of the
Borrower,  now or  hereafter  existing,  upon the same terms as are set forth in
this Agreement.

                 SOUTHERN ENERGY NORTH AMERICA GENERATING, INC.
                           FACILITY C CREDIT AGREEMENT


                        FORM OF PARENT SUPPORT AGREEMENT


     PARENT SUPPORT AGREEMENT dated as of _______________, 1999 between SOUTHERN
ENERGY,  INC., a Delaware  corporation ("SEI"), and LEHMAN COMMERCIAL PAPER INC.
("LCPI"),  as administrative agent for the Lenders --- (as defined in the Credit
Agreements referred to below).

     PRELIMINARY  STATEMENT.  Southern  Energy North  America,  Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Borrower") and a wholly owned subsidiary of SEI, is party to a
Facility A Credit  Agreement,  a Facility  B Credit  Agreement  and a Facility C
Credit  Agreement,  each  dated as of August  31,  1999 (as  amended,  restated,
supplemented or otherwise  modified from time to time, the "Credit  Agreements";
the  capitalized  terms defined  therein and not otherwise  defined herein being
used herein as therein  defined)  with  certain  Lenders  and Lehman  Commercial
Paper,  Inc.,  as Agent for the  Lenders.  It is a  condition  precedent  to the
effectiveness  of Section 2.01 of each Credit  Agreement  that SEI have executed
and delivered this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises,  SEI and LCPI, as Agent,
hereby agrees as follows:

     Section 1. Guaranty. SEI hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the punctual  payment when due and payable of all  obligations of the
Borrower in respect of interest  accrued on the  Advances  through  December 31,
2002 up to a maximum of $50,000,000  (such obligations of the Borrower being the
"Guaranteed  Obligations").  Without  limiting the  generality of the foregoing,
SEI's  liability  shall  extend  to all  amounts  that  constitute  part  of the
Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower to a Lender but for the
fact that they are  unenforceable  or not  allowable  due to the  existence of a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Borrower.

     Section  2.  Guaranty   Absolute.   SEI  guarantees   that  the  Guaranteed
Obligations  will be paid  strictly in  accordance  with the terms of the Credit
Agreements,  regardless  of any law,  regulation  or order now or  hereafter  in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of any
Lender with respect thereto.  The obligations of SEI under or in respect of this
Agreement are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and a separate action or
actions may be brought and  prosecuted  against SEI to enforce  this  Agreement,
irrespective  of whether any action is brought  against the  Borrower or whether
the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of SEI under
this Agreement shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of,
and hereby  irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire
in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

     (a) any lack of validity or  enforceability  of any Credit Agreement or any
agreement or instrument relating thereto;

     (b) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment of, or in any other
term of, all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any other  amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from any Credit Agreement or any agreement
or instrument relating thereto;

     (c) any change,  restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or
existence of the Borrower; or

     (d) any other circumstance (including,  without limitation,  any statute of
limitations)  or any  existence  of or  reliance  on any  representation  by the
Borrower that might otherwise  constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
of, SEI.

     This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be,  if at any time any  payment  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  is
rescinded  or must  otherwise be returned by any Lender or any other Person upon
the insolvency,  bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise,  all
as though such payment had not been made.  This Agreement  shall not confer upon
the  Agent  and the  Lenders  or any  other  Person  any  right  of  payment  or
enforcement  with respect to the Borrower  under the Credit  Agreements  and the
Notes that is in any manner broader or more expansive than such Person's  rights
of payment and  enforcement,  if any,  with  respect to the  Borrower  under the
Credit Agreements and the Notes.

     Section 3. Waivers and Acknowledgments.  (a) SEI hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives  promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance,  presentment,
demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest
or  dishonor  and  any  other  notice  with  respect  to any  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations and this Agreement and any  requirement  that any Lender exhaust any
right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person.

     (b) SEI hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably waives any right to revoke
this Agreement and acknowledges  that this Agreement is continuing in nature and
applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

     (c) SEI hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part
of any Lender or the Agent to disclose to SEI any matter, fact or thing relating
to the business,  condition (financial or otherwise),  operations,  performance,
properties  or  prospects  of the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  now or
hereafter known by such Lender or the Agent.

     (d) The Guarantor  acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect  benefits from the financing  arrangements  contemplated  by the Credit
Agreements  and that the waivers  set forth in Section 2 and this  Section 3 are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

     Section 4. Subrogation.  SEI hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
not  to  exercise  any  rights  of  subrogation,   reimbursement,   exoneration,
contribution  or  indemnification  that it may now  have  or  hereafter  acquire
against the Borrower that arise from the payment,  performance or enforcement of
SEI's  obligations  under or in  respect  of this  Agreement,  and any  right to
participate in any claim or remedy of any Lender  against the Borrower,  whether
or not such claim,  remedy or right arises in equity or under contract,  statute
or common law, including,  without limitation, the right to take or receive from
the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or
in any other  manner,  payment or security  on account of such claim,  remedy or
right,  unless  and until (a) all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other
amounts  payable under this  Agreement  shall have been paid in full in cash and
(b) either (i) the  Commitments  shall have been terminated and all Advances and
interest  thereon shall have been paid in full in cash or (ii) December 31, 2002
shall have passed.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of
the immediately  preceding  sentence,  such amount shall be received and held in
trust for the benefit of the Lenders,  shall be segregated  from other  property
and funds of SEI and shall  forthwith  be paid or  delivered to the Agent in the
same form as so received  (with any necessary  endorsement  or assignment) to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed  Obligations in accordance with the terms
of the Credit Agreements and all other amounts payable under this Agreement,  or
to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable
under this Agreement  thereafter  arising.  If (w) SEI shall make payment to any
Lender  of  all or  any  part  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  (x)  all of the
Guaranteed  Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement shall
have been paid in full in cash and (y)  either  (i) the  Commitments  shall have
been  terminated  and all Advances and interest  thereon shall have been paid in
full in cash or (ii)  December 31, 2002 shall have passed,  the Lenders will, at
SEI's  request and expense,  execute and deliver to SEI  appropriate  documents,
without recourse and without  representation or warranty,  necessary to evidence
the transfer by subrogation to SEI of an interest in the Guaranteed  Obligations
resulting from such payment made by SEI pursuant to this Agreement.

     Section 5. Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by SEI hereunder shall be made,
in accordance  with the Credit  Agreements,  without  deduction for any Taxes or
Other Taxes (each as defined below).

     "Taxes"  means  any and all  present  or  future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,
deductions,  charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by SEI pursuant
to this Agreement,  and all liabilities with respect  thereto,  excluding (i) in
the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, net worth or
gross  receipts and franchise or similar  taxes imposed on it by a  jurisdiction
under  the  laws of  which  such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case may be) is
organized or in which its principal executive office is located or any political
subdivision  thereof or in which its Applicable Lending Office is located or any
political  subdivision  thereof and (ii) in the case of each Lender,  any United
States  withholding  tax imposed on such payments except to the extent that such
Lender is subject to United States  withholding  tax by reason of a U.S. Tax Law
Change.

     "Other  Taxes" means any present or future stamp or  documentary  taxes and
any other excise or property taxes,  or similar  charges or levies,  which arise
from any  payment  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  or from the  execution  or
delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement.

     "U.S.  Tax Law Change" means with respect to any Lender the  occurrence (x)
in the case of the Initial Lender,  after the date of the Credit  Agreements and
(y) in the case of any  other  Lender,  after the date such  Lender  shall  have
become a party to a Credit  Agreement by executing and  delivering an Assignment
and Acceptance,  of the adoption of any applicable  United States federal law or
regulation  relating  to  taxation,  or any change  therein  or in the  official
interpretation  thereof, or the entry into force,  modification or revocation of
any income tax convention or treaty to which the United States is a party.

     If SEI shall be  required by Law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable  hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions  (including  deductions  applicable to additional  sums payable under
this Section 5) such Lender or the Agent  receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such  deductions  been made, (ii) SEI shall make such
deductions,  (iii)  SEI  shall  pay the full  amount  deducted  to the  relevant
taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv)
SEI shall  furnish to the Agent,  at its address  referred to in Section 8.02 of
the Credit Agreements,  the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof.

     (b) SEI agrees to  indemnify  each Lender and the Agent for the full amount
of actual and documented Taxes or Other Taxes  (including,  without  limitation,
taxes of any kind  imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable  under this
Section 5) paid by such Lender as the result of any U.S.  Tax Law Change and any
actual and documented  liability  (including  penalties,  interest and expenses)
arising  therefrom or with respect  thereto paid by such Lender,  but excluding,
however,  any  Taxes or Other  Taxes so paid by such  Lender  more than 120 days
prior  to  demand   being  made  to  SEI  by  such   Lender  or  the  Agent  for
indemnification. The payment of such indemnity shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender or the Agent makes written demand  therefor  complying with
Section 8.04(d) of the Credit Agreements.

     (c) Each  Lender  organized  under the laws of a  jurisdiction  outside the
United  States,  on or prior to the date of its  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement  in the case of the Initial  Lender and on the date of the  Assignment
and  Acceptance  pursuant  to which it becomes a Lender in the case of any other
Lender,  and from time to time  thereafter as requested in writing by SEI or the
Agent (but only so long as such Lender  remains  lawfully able to do so),  shall
provide each of the Agent and SEI with two completed and duly executed  original
Internal  Revenue  Service forms 1001, 4224 or W-8BEN,  as  appropriate,  or any
successor or other form  prescribed by the Internal  Revenue  Service,  or other
documentation  reasonably  requested by SEI or the Agent,  certifying  that such
Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding
tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement.  If the form provided by a Lender at
the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement  indicates a United
States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding tax at such
rate  shall be  considered  excluded  from Taxes  unless  and until such  Lender
provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods  governed by such form. If any form or document  referred to in this
Section 5(c) requires the  disclosure  of  information,  other than  information
necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof
by  Internal  Revenue  Service  form  1001,  4224 or  W-8BEN,  that  the  Lender
reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to
SEI and  shall  not be  obligated  to  include  in such  form or  document  such
confidential information.

     (d) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide SEI
with the appropriate  form or document (or information  required by such form or
document) described in Section 5(c) (other than if such failure is due to a U.S.
Tax Law Change), such Lender shall not be entitled to payments without deduction
and indemnification under Section 5(a) or (b) with respect to any Taxes or Other
Taxes  which  would  not  have  been  payable  had  such  form or  document  (or
information required thereby) been so provided; provided, however, that should a
Lender,  which  is  otherwise  exempt  from  or  subject  to a  reduced  rate of
withholding  tax,  become  subject to Taxes  because of its failure to deliver a
form or document (or information  required  thereby),  required  hereunder,  SEI
shall  take such  reasonable  steps as the  Lender  shall  request to assist the
Lender to recover such Taxes (it being understood,  however, that SEI shall have
no liability to such Lender in respect of such Taxes).

     (e) If SEI is required to indemnify or pay additional amounts to or for the
account of any Lender  pursuant  to this  Section 5, then such  Lender will take
such action  (including  changing the  jurisdiction  of its  Applicable  Lending
Office) as in the  reasonable  judgment  of such  Lender (i) will  eliminate  or
reduce any such additional  payment which may thereafter  accrue and (ii) is not
otherwise commercially unreasonable.

     (f) Each Lender and the Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain in
a timely  fashion any refund,  deduction  or credit of any Taxes and Other Taxes
paid or reimbursed by SEI pursuant to this Section 5. If any Lender or the Agent
receives a benefit in the nature of a refund,  deduction or credit  (including a
refund  in the  form of a  deduction  from or  credit  against  taxes  that  are
otherwise  payable by the Lender or the Agent) of any Taxes or Other  Taxes with
respect to which SEI has made a payment  under  Section 5(a) or (b), such Lender
or the Agent  agrees to  reimburse  SEI to the  extent  of the  benefit  of such
refund,  deduction or credit promptly after such Lender or the Agent  reasonably
determines  that such refund  deduction  or credit has become  final;  provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 5(f) shall require any Lender or
the Agent to make available its tax returns (or any other  information  relating
to its taxes which it deems to be confidential) or to attempt to obtain any such
refund,  deduction  or credit,  which  attempt  would be  inconsistent  with any
reporting position otherwise taken by such Lender or the Agent on its applicable
tax returns.

     Section  6.  Representations  and  Warranties.  SEI hereby  represents  and
warrants as follows:


     (a) Organization. SEI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

     (b) Power and Authority.  SEI has the corporate  power to execute,  deliver
and  perform  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and to take  all  action
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (c) Due  Authorization.  The execution,  delivery and performance by SEI of
this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate  action and
do not (i)  contravene  its  certificate  of  incorporation  or  bylaws  or (ii)
conflict  with or  contravene  any Law to which it is  subject  which has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) Governmental Approval. No authorization or approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental  authority is required for the
due execution,  delivery and  performance by SEI of this  Agreement,  except for
those which have been duly obtained or made and are in full force and effect.

     (e) Binding and Enforceable.  This Agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid
and binding  obligation of SEI  enforceable  against SEI in accordance  with its
terms,  subject to laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and to general principles of equity.

     (f) No Violation.  The execution,  delivery and  performance by SEI of this
Agreement  do not  violate,  in a manner  which has had or would  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, any agreement binding on it.

     (g) Litigation. No litigation,  arbitration or administrative proceeding is
currently pending or, to SEI's knowledge,  threatened against it (i) to restrain
the entry by SEI into, the enforcement of, or the exercise of, any rights by the
Lenders  under,  or the  performance  or compliance by SEI with any  obligations
under, this Agreement,  or (ii) which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (h)  Financial  Condition.  The  consolidated  balance  sheet  of SEI as at
December 31, 1998 and the related  consolidated  statements of income,  retained
earnings and cash flow, previously furnished to the Lenders,  present fairly the
consolidated  financial  condition  of SEI as at said date and the  consolidated
results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with GAAP.

     (i)  Material  Adverse  Change.  There has been no change in the  business,
condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  or  results  of  operations  of SEI since
December  31,  1998  which has had or would  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (j)  Taxes.  With  respect to SEI and its  Subsidiaries,  there has been no
matter with respect to the payment of taxes which has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (k) Environmental Matters. With respect to SEI and its Subsidiaries,  there
has been no matter with  respect to  environmental  compliance  which has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (l)  Year  2000.  The  cost to SEI and its  Subsidiaries  of  reprogramming
required to permit the proper  functioning,  in and  following the year 2000, of
(i) the Borrower's  and its  Subsidiaries'  computer  systems and (ii) equipment
containing  embedded  microchips  (including  systems and equipment  supplied by
others) and the testing of all such systems and equipment,  as so  reprogrammed,
and of the  reasonably  foreseeable  consequences  of  year  2000 to SEI and its
Subsidiaries would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except for such of the  reprogramming  referred to in the preceding  sentence as
may be necessary, the computer and management information systems of SEI and its
Subsidiaries  are and, with ordinary  course  upgrading  and  maintenance,  will
continue to be,  sufficient to permit SEI and its  Subsidiaries to conduct their
business without Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.  Entire  Agreement;  Amendments,  Etc.  This  Agreement  and any
agreement,  document  or  instrument  attached  hereto  or  referred  to  herein
integrate all terms and  conditions  mentioned  herein or incidental  hereto and
supersede all oral  negotiations  and prior writings with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  In the event of any conflict  between the terms,  conditions and
provisions of this  Agreement and any terms,  conditions  and  provisions of any
such agreement,  document or instrument, the terms, conditions and provisions of
this Agreement  shall  prevail.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement  and no consent to any departure by any party  therefrom  shall in any
event be effective as to the Lenders  under a Credit  Agreement  unless the same
shall be in  writing  and  signed by SEI and the Agent  with the  consent of the
Required  Lenders under such Credit  Agreement,  and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific  purpose
for which given; provided,  however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Agent with the consent of all of the Lenders
under a Credit  Agreement (a) reduce or limit the  obligations of SEI hereunder,
release SEI  hereunder or otherwise  limit SEI's  liability  with respect to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  in  each  case  as to or  arising  under  such  Credit
Agreement,  (b)  postpone  any date fixed for  payment  hereunder  in respect of
Guaranteed  Obligations  arising  under such Credit  Agreement or (c) change the
number  of  Lenders  under  such  Credit  Agreement  or  the  percentage  of the
Commitments  under such Credit  Agreement that, in each case,  shall be required
for the such Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder.

     Section 8. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier communication)

telecopied, be effective when deposited in the mails or telecopied,
respectively. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart hereof or of any
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

     Section  9. No  Waiver;  Remedies.  No failure on the part of any Lender to
exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any right  hereunder  shall operate as a
waiver thereof;  nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right.  The remedies  herein  provided are  cumulative  and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

     Section 10. Continuing  Guaranty;  Assignments under the Credit Agreements.
This  Agreement is a continuing  guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and
effect until (i) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and
all  other  amounts  payable  under  this  Agreement  and  (ii)  either  (x) the
termination of the  Commitments  and the payment in full in cash of all Advances
and interest  thereon or (y) the passing of December 31, 2002 and (b) be binding
upon and  inure to the  benefit  of SEI and the  Lenders  and  their  respective
successors  and assigns.  Without  limiting the  generality of clause (b) of the
immediately preceding sentence,  any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all
or any  portion  of its  rights  and  obligations  under a Credit  Agreement  in
accordance therewith (including,  without limitation,  all or any portion of its
Commitments  thereunder,  the  Advances  thereunder  owing to it and the Note or
Notes  thereunder  held by it) to another  Person,  and such other  Person shall
thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such
Lender  herein or  otherwise,  in each  case as and to the  extent  provided  in
Section  8.07 of such Credit  Agreement.  SEI shall not have the right to assign
its rights  hereunder  or any interest  herein in respect of a Credit  Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders thereunder.

     Section  11.  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed  by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

     Section 12.  Execution in  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed  shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken  together shall  constitute  one and the same  agreement.
Delivery of an executed  counterpart  of a signature  page to this  Agreement by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart of
this Agreement.

     Section  13.  Jurisdiction,  Etc.  (a) Each of the  parties  hereto  hereby
irrevocably and  unconditionally  submits,  for itself and its property,  to the
nonexclusive  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, New York County,  United States
District Court for the Southern  District of New York,  and any appellate  court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement,  or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each
of the  parties  hereto  agrees  that a final  judgment  in any such  action  or
proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the  judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this
Agreement  shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any
action  or  proceeding   relating  to  this  Agreement  in  the  courts  of  any
jurisdiction.

     (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  waives, to
the fullest  extent it may legally and  effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or  hereafter  have to the  laying  of  venue  of any  suit,  action  or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York State or
federal court.  Each of the parties  hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     Section 14. No Recourse to Affiliates. Any obligations created herein shall
be the sole  obligations of SEI, unless and to the extent that such  obligations
are  assigned or  delegated  by SEI  pursuant to Section 10. The Lenders and the
Agent shall not have recourse to any  shareholder,  subsidiary,  partner,  joint
venturer,  Affiliate,  director  or officer of SEI for the  performance  of such
obligations  unless the obligations are assumed in writing by the Person against
whom recourse is sought.

     Section  15.  Costs and  Expenses.  SEI  agrees  to pay,  upon  demand  and
presentation  to it of a statement of account,  all  reasonable  and  documented
third-party  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders,  if
any (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), in
connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings
or otherwise) of this Agreement.

     Section 16. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of SEI and the Lenders and the Agent
hereby irrevocably  waives all right to trial by jury in any action,  proceeding
or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating  to this  Agreement  or the  actions  of the Agent or any Lender in the
negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties  have caused  this  Agreement  to be duly
executed by their respective  officers  thereunto duly authorized as of the date
first above written.

                           FACILITY C CREDIT AGREEMENT


                   FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER


                                _______ __, 1999

     To the financial institution party to

     the Credit Agreement

     referred to below and to

     Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as

     Agent for such financial institution

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as counsel to Southern Energy North America Generating,  Inc.
(the  "Company"),  a  corporation  organized  under  the  laws of the  State  of
Delaware, in connection with the Facility C Credit Agreement, dated as of August
31,  1999 (the  "Credit  Agreement")  among the  Company  and each of you.  This
opinion  letter is rendered  to you  pursuant  to Section  3.01(d)(viii)  of the
Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein
shall  have  the  respective  meanings  assigned  to such  terms  in the  Credit
Agreement.

     In the capacity  described  above, we have examined  originals or copies of
each  of  the  Credit   Agreement  and  the  Note  issued  on  the  date  hereof
(collectively, the "Loan Documents").

     We have also been  furnished  with, and with your consent have relied upon,
certificates  of officers of the Company  with  respect to factual  matters.  In
addition, we have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from
public  officials  as we have  deemed  necessary.  In our  examination,  we have
assumed the  genuineness  of all  signatures,  the legal capacity of all natural
persons executing  documents,  the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies.

     We have made such legal and factual  inquiries for the purpose of rendering
this opinion as we have deemed necessary  (except where a statement is qualified
as to knowledge or awareness in which case we have made such limited  inquiry as
is indicated  below).  The partners of the firm that are rendering  this opinion
are  admitted  to practice in the State of Georgia  only,  and we are  rendering
opinions  as  indicated  herein  only to the effect of the  federal  laws of the
United  States of  America,  the  internal  laws of the State of Georgia and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; however, we express no opinion
with  respect to the  applicability  or the effect of federal laws of the United
States of America governing health, safety or the environment, and we express no
opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other  jurisdiction or municipal law
or the  laws  of  any  local  agencies  within  any  state,  including,  without
limitation, Georgia.

     Whenever a statement herein is qualified by "to our knowledge" or a similar
phrase, it means, among other things,  that those attorneys in the firm who have
devoted  substantive  attention to the transaction  described herein do not have
current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as
otherwise   expressly   indicated,   we  have  not  undertaken  any  independent
investigation to determine the accuracy of such statement, and no inference that
we have any  knowledge of any matters  pertaining  to such  statement  should be
drawn  from  our  representation  of the  Company.  No  actual  or  constructive
knowledge of any attorneys in the firm shall be imputed to the firm as to any of
the matters set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
we have  not made any  examination  of any  accounting,  financial  or  economic
matters,  and express no opinion  with  respect  thereto or with  respect to the
ability of any party to perform under any documents.  All assumptions made by us
herein  have been  made,  with  your  approval,  without  any  investigation  or
verification by us.

     In  rendering  the  opinions  set forth  herein,  no opinion  is  expressed
regarding compliance with the laws relating to interest or usury, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended,  or the Georgia  Securities  Act of 1973,  as
amended, or the effect of the failure to comply therewith.

     On the basis of the foregoing,  and in reliance thereon, and subject to the
limitations, qualifications, assumptions, exceptions and other matters set forth
herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:

     1. The Company is a corporation  duly  incorporated and validly existing in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,  with corporate power and
authority  under such laws to own,  lease and operate its properties and conduct
its business.

     2.  Each of the Loan  Documents  has been  duly  authorized,  executed  and
delivered by the Company.

     3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan  Documents do not,
as of the date hereof,  (a) violate the Certificate of  Incorporation or By-Laws
of the Company, (b) result in a material breach or violation of any of the terms
and  provisions  of, or  constitute  a default  under,  any  material  published
statute,  rule or  regulation  of any  court,  regulatory  body,  administrative
agency,  government  or  governmental  body of the United States or the State of
Georgia,  applicable to the Company, (c) to our knowledge,  constitute a default
under any material written agreement of the Company or result in the creation of
any Lien (other than in favor of the Lenders)  upon the property of the Company,
or (d)  require  any  authorization,  approval,  consent or other  action by, or
notice to or filing with, any  governmental  authority or regulatory body of the
United  States  or of the  State of  Georgia  other  than  those  that have been
obtained or made.

     We assume for purposes of this opinion  that:  all parties  (other than the
Company) to the documents and agreements  discussed  herein are duly  organized,
validly  existing  and in good  standing  under  the  laws of  their  respective
jurisdictions of organization;  all such parties to the documents and agreements
discussed  herein have the requisite  power and authority to execute and deliver
the documents and agreements  discussed  herein and to perform their  respective
obligations  under the documents and agreements  discussed  herein to which they
are a party; and the agreements and documents discussed herein to which any such
party is a party have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such party
and constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations,  enforceable against it
in  accordance  with their terms.  We have also assumed that the term  "material
written  agreements"  used in paragraph 3 above means any  indenture,  mortgage,
deed of  trust,  sale/leaseback  agreement,  loan  agreement  or  other  similar
financing  agreement or instrument by which the Company is bound or to which any
of the  properties  or assets of the  Company are subject of which we are aware;
guarantees are specifically excluded from the term "material written agreements"
as used in  paragraph  3 above.  We express no opinion as to  compliance  by any
parties other than the Company to the documents and agreements  discussed herein
with  any  state  or  federal  laws or  regulations  applicable  to the  subject
transactions because of the nature of their business.

     The opinions expressed herein represent the judgment of this law firm as to
certain legal matters,  but they are not guarantees or warranties and should not
be construed as such. Further, the opinions expressed above are given only as of
the date  hereof,  and we do not  assume  (and we shall  not  have)  any duty or
obligation to update such opinions.

     A copy of this  opinion  letter may be  delivered by you to any Person that
becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.  Any
such Lender may rely on the opinions  expressed  above as if this opinion letter
were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof.

     This opinion letter is provided to you for your exclusive use
solely in connection with the matters contemplated by the Loan Documents. Except
as expressly set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, this opinion may
not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted or
relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without
our prior written consent in each instance.

                        FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO SEI


                                _______ __, 1999

     To the financial institution party to

     the Credit Agreement

     referred to below and to

     Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as

     Agent for such financial institution

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as counsel to Southern Energy,  Inc.  ("SEI"),  a corporation
organized  under  the laws of the  State of  Delaware,  in  connection  with the
Facility  C  Credit  Agreement,  dated  as  of  August  31,  1999  (the  "Credit
Agreement") among Southern Energy North America Generating, Inc. and each of you
and the Parent  Support  Agreement  dated as of  ______,  1999 among SEI and the
Lenders  under the Credit  Agreement.  This  opinion  letter is  rendered to you
pursuant  to Section  3.01(d)(ix)  of the  Credit  Agreement.  Unless  otherwise
defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings
assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

     In the capacity  described  above, we have examined  originals or copies of
the Parent Support Agreement.

     We have also been  furnished  with, and with your consent have relied upon,
certificates of officers of SEI with respect to factual matters. In addition, we
have  obtained  and relied upon such  certificates  and  assurances  from public
officials as we have deemed necessary.  In our examination,  we have assumed the
genuineness  of all  signatures,  the  legal  capacity  of all  natural  persons
executing  documents,  the  authenticity  of all  documents  submitted  to us as
originals and the  conformity to authentic  original  documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies.

     We have made such legal and factual  inquiries for the purpose of rendering
this opinion as we have deemed necessary  (except where a statement is qualified
as to knowledge or awareness in which case we have made such limited  inquiry as
is indicated  below).  The partners of the firm that are rendering  this opinion
are  admitted  to practice in the State of Georgia  only,  and we are  rendering
opinions  as  indicated  herein  only to the effect of the  federal  laws of the
United  States of  America,  the  internal  laws of the State of Georgia and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; however, we express no opinion
with  respect to the  applicability  or the effect of federal laws of the United
States of America governing health, safety or the environment, and we express no
opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other  jurisdiction or municipal law
or the  laws  of  any  local  agencies  within  any  state,  including,  without
limitation, Georgia.

     Whenever a statement herein is qualified by "to our knowledge" or a similar
phrase, it means, among other things,  that those attorneys in the firm who have
devoted  substantive  attention to the transaction  described herein do not have
current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as
otherwise   expressly   indicated,   we  have  not  undertaken  any  independent
investigation to determine the accuracy of such statement, and no inference that
we have any  knowledge of any matters  pertaining  to such  statement  should be
drawn from our representation of SEI. No actual or constructive knowledge of any
attorneys  in the firm shall be imputed to the firm as to any of the matters set
forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have not made
any examination of any accounting, financial or economic matters, and express no
opinion  with  respect  thereto or with  respect to the  ability of any party to
perform under any documents.  All assumptions  made by us herein have been made,
with your approval, without any investigation or verification by us.

     In rendering the opinions set forth herein, no opinion is
expressed regarding compliance with the laws relating to interest or usury, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Georgia Securities Act of
1973, as amended, or the effect of the failure to comply therewith.

     On the basis of the foregoing,  and in reliance thereon, and subject to the
limitations, qualifications, assumptions, exceptions and other matters set forth
herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:

     1. SEI is a  corporation  duly  incorporated  and validly  existing in good
standing  under  the laws of the State of  Delaware,  with  corporate  power and
authority  under such laws to own,  lease and operate its properties and conduct
its business.

     2. The Parent  Support  Agreement  has been duly  authorized,  executed and
delivered by SEI.

     3. The  execution  and delivery by SEI of the Parent  Support  Agreement do
not, as of the date hereof,  (a) violate the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  or
By-Laws of SEI, (b) result in a material breach or violation of any of the terms
and  provisions  of, or  constitute  a default  under,  any  material  published
statute,  rule or  regulation  of any  court,  regulatory  body,  administrative
agency,  government  or  governmental  body of the United States or the State of
Georgia, applicable to SEI, (c) to our knowledge, constitute a default under any
material  written  agreement of SEI or result in the creation of any Lien (other
than in favor of the  Lenders)  upon the  property  of SEI,  or (d)  require any
authorization,  approval,  consent  or other  action  by, or notice to or filing
with, any  governmental  authority or regulatory body of the United States or of
the State of Georgia other than those that have been obtained or made.

     We assume for purposes of this opinion that:  all parties  (other than SEI)
to the documents and agreements  discussed  herein are duly  organized,  validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of their  respective  jurisdictions
of  organization;  all such parties to the  documents and  agreements  discussed
herein  have the  requisite  power and  authority  to execute  and  deliver  the
documents  and  agreements  discussed  herein  and to perform  their  respective
obligations  under the documents and agreements  discussed  herein to which they
are a party; and the agreements and documents discussed herein to which any such
party is a party have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such party
and constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations,  enforceable against it
in  accordance  with their terms.  We have also assumed that the term  "material
written  agreements"  used in paragraph 3 above means any  indenture,  mortgage,
deed of  trust,  sale/leaseback  agreement,  loan  agreement  or  other  similar
financing  agreement or  instrument by which SEI is bound or to which any of the
properties  or assets of SEI are subject of which we are aware;  guarantees  are
specifically  excluded from the term  "material  written  agreements" as used in
paragraph 3 above.  We express no opinion as to  compliance by any parties other
than SEI to the  documents  and  agreements  discussed  herein with any state or
federal laws or regulations  applicable to the subject  transactions  because of
the nature of their business.

     The opinions expressed herein represent the judgment of this law firm as to
certain legal matters,  but they are not guarantees or warranties and should not
be construed as such. Further, the opinions expressed above are given only as of
the date  hereof,  and we do not  assume  (and we shall  not  have)  any duty or
obligation to update such opinions.

     A copy of this  opinion  letter may be  delivered by you to any Person that
becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.  Any
such Lender may rely on the opinions  expressed  above as if this opinion letter
were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof.

     This  opinion  letter is provided to you for your  exclusive  use solely in
connection  with the  matters  contemplated  by the Loan  Documents.  Except  as
expressly set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, this opinion may not
be relied upon by you for any other  purpose,  or furnished to, quoted or relied
upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without our prior
written consent in each instance.

                                                     Very truly yours,

                           FACILITY C CREDIT AGREEMENT

                    FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE AGENT


                                __________, 1999




     To the financial institution

     party to the Credit Agreement

     referred to below and to

     Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Agent

     for such financial institution

     Southern Energy North America Generating, Inc. Facility C Credit Agreement

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special New York counsel to Lehman  Commercial Paper Inc.,
as Agent (the  "Agent"),  in  connection  with the Facility C Credit  Agreement,
dated as of August 31, 1999 (the "Credit Agreement") among Southern Energy North
America Generating,  Inc. (the "Borrower"), a Delaware corporation,  and each of
you.  This opinion is being  delivered to you pursuant to Section  3.01(d)(x) of
the Credit  Agreement.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as
therein defined.

     In that connection, we have examined executed originals or copies certified
or otherwise  identified to our satisfaction of each of the following (the "Loan
Documents"):

     (1) the Credit Agreement;

     (2) the Note issued on the date hereof; and

     (3) the Parent Support Agreement.

     In  our  examination  of the  Loan  Documents,  we  have  assumed,  without
independent  investigation,  (a) the due  execution  and  delivery  of each Loan
Document by each of the parties  thereto,  (b) the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals,  (c) the  genuineness  of all  signatures  and the
legal capacity of all natural persons and (d) the conformity to the originals of
all documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of all originals of
such copies.

     With your  permission,  in rendering  the opinion set forth below,  we have
also assumed,  without independent  investigation,  that (a) each the parties to
the Loan Documents (the "Loan  Parties") is a corporation,  partnership or other
entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization,  (b) each Loan Party has full power and authority  (corporate,
partnership and otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to
which it is a party,  (c) the execution,  delivery and  performance by each Loan
Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly  authorized by
all  necessary  action  (corporate,  partnership  or  otherwise)  and do not (i)
contravene  the  certificate  of  incorporation,   bylaws,  general  partnership
agreement or other constituent  documents of any of such Loan Party, (ii) except
with respect to Generally  Applicable  Law (as defined  below and as to which we
make no assumption),  violate any law, rule, regulation,  order, writ, judgment,
injunction,  decree,  determination  or award  applicable to such Loan Party, or
(iii)  conflict  with or result  in the  breach of any  document  or  instrument
binding on any such Loan Party, (d) except with respect to Generally  Applicable
Law (as to which we make no assumption), no authorization,  approval, consent or
other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental  authority or
regulatory  body or any other  third party is  required  for the due  execution,
delivery or performance by any Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a
party,  or, if any such  authorization,  approval,  consent,  action,  notice or
filing is  required  thereof,  it has been duly  obtained or made and is in full
force and effect,  and (e) the Lenders and the Agent will  perform and  exercise
their rights under the Loan  Documents to which they are a party  reasonably and
in good  faith  and will act  reasonably  and in good  faith in  taking  action,
exercising  discretion  and  making  determinations  thereunder.  As used in the
preceding  sentence,  Generally  Applicable Law" means federal law of the United
States  of  America  and the  law of the  State  of New  York  and  any  rule or
regulation   promulgated  thereunder  or  pursuant  thereto  applicable  to  the
execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents and which are generally
applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of documents with terms and
provisions of the type contained in the Loan Documents;  provided, however, that
Generally  Applicable Law shall not include any law, rule or regulation which is
applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of any Loan Document by any
Loan Party thereto  because of the specific  nature of the assets or business of
such Loan Party or any of its affiliates.

     Based upon the foregoing we advise you that, in our opinion:

     1. The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.

     2. The Note  issued on the date  hereof  constitutes  the legal,  valid and
binding  obligation  of  the  Borrower,  enforceable  against  the  Borrower  in
accordance with its terms.

     3. The Parent Support  Agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid and binding
obligation of SEI enforceable against SEI in accordance with its terms.

     Our opinions above are subject to the following qualifications:

     (a) Our  opinions  expressed  above are  subject  to the  effect of general
principles of equity,  including,  without limitation,  concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in
a  proceeding  in equity or at law).  Such  principles  of equity are of general
application,  and in applying such principles a court, among other things, might
not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of
a default  deemed  immaterial  or might decline to order the Borrower to perform
covenants.  Such principles  applied by a court might include a requirement that
the creditors act with  reasonableness  and good faith. Such a requirement might
be applied, for example, to the provisions of the Credit Agreement purporting to
authorize conclusive determinations by the Agent or any Lender.

     (b) Our  opinions  expressed  above are also  subject  to the effect of any
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency  (including,  without  limitation,  all laws
relating to  fraudulent  transfers),  reorganization,  moratorium or similar law
affecting  creditors'  rights  generally and to possible  judicial action giving
effect to governmental actions affecting creditors' rights.

     (c) We  express no opinion  as to any  provisions  of the Credit  Agreement
insofar as it provides that (i) any Person  purchasing a participation  from any
Lender pursuant  thereto may exercise  set-off or similar rights with respect to
such  participation  or that any Lender or any other Person may exercise set-off
or similar  rights other than in  accordance  with law or (ii) any party thereto
shall make payments without set-off, defense or counterclaim.

     (d) The  ability  of one  party  to any of the  Loan  Documents  to bring a
dispute  against any other party to any of the Loan Documents in a Federal court
of the United States  sitting in the Borough of  Manhattan,  City of New York is
subject  to  the  applicable   requirements  of  subject  matter  and  diversity
jurisdiction.

     (e) With  respect to any  provision  of the Credit  Agreement or the Parent
Support  Agreement  that  provides that the  obligations  thereunder of any Loan
Party shall be absolute  and  unconditional  irrespective  of any changes to, or
amendments  of,  any other  Loan  Documents  to which  such  Loan  Party has not
consented,  such  provision  may be  enforceable  only to the  extent  that such
changes or amendments were not so material as to constitute a new contract among
the parties.

     (f)  We  express  no  opinion  as  to  the  effect  of  any  public  policy
considerations  or court  decisions  which may limit the  rights of any party to
obtain  indemnification  under the Credit  Agreement  or as to the effect of any
provision of the Credit Agreement  relating to indemnification or exculpation in
connection  with willful,  reckless or criminal acts or gross  negligence of the
indemnified or exculpated Person.

     (g) The  enforceability  of any  provision  of the Credit  Agreement or the
Parent Support  Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified
except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.

     (h) We express no opinion as to any waiver of  subject-matter  jurisdiction
in respect of, or any right based on improper  venue or forum non  conveniens in
any proceeding in, the Federal courts of the United States.

     Our  opinions  expressed  above are  limited to the law of the State of New
York and the Federal law of the United States, and we do not express any opinion
herein  concerning  any  other  law.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the
foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any jurisdiction
other  than the State of New York  wherein  any Lender may be located or wherein
enforcement of any Loan Document may be sought that limits the rates of interest
legally chargeable or collectible.

     A copy of this opinion  letter may be delivered by any of you to any Person
that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
Any such  Lender  may rely on the  opinion  expressed  above as if this  opinion
letter were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof.

     This  opinion  letter  speaks  only as of the  date  hereof.  We  expressly
disclaim any  responsibility to advise you or any other Lender that is permitted
to rely on the  opinion  expressed  herein as  specified  in the next  preceding
paragraph of any development or  circumstance of any kind,  including any change
of law or fact that may occur after the date of this opinion  letter even though
such development,  circumstance or change may affect the legal analysis, a legal
conclusion or any other matter set forth in or relating to this opinion  letter.
Accordingly,  any Lender  relying on this  opinion  letter at any time after the
date hereof  should seek advice of its counsel as to the proper  application  of
this opinion letter at such time.

                                                Very truly yours,

                                   ----------


     Reference is made to that certain  Facility C Credit  Agreement dated as of

defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meaning.

     [NAME OF DESIGNATING LENDER] (the "Designating Lender"), [NAME OF DESIGNEE]
(the "Designee"), the Agent and Borrower agree as follows:

     1. Pursuant to Section  8.07(i) of the Credit  Agreement,  the  Designating
Lender hereby  designates  the Designee,  and the Designee  hereby  accepts such
designation,  to have a right to make  Advances  pursuant  to  Article II of the
Credit Agreement. Any delegation by Designating Lender to Designee of its rights
to make an Advance pursuant to such Article II shall be effective at the time of
the funding of such Advance and not before such time.

     2. Except as set forth in Section 7 below, the Designating  Lender makes no
representation  or  warranty  and  assumes no  responsibility  pursuant  to this
Designation  Agreement  with  respect  to  (a)  any  statements,  warranties  or
representations  made in or in  connection  with  the  Credit  Agreement  or any
document related thereto (each, a "Loan  Document") or the execution,  legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document
or any other  instrument  and document  furnished  pursuant  thereto and (b) the
financial  condition of the Borrower or the  performance  or  observance  by the
Borrower  of any  of its  obligations  under  any  Loan  Document  or any  other

Document,  together  with  copies of the  financial  statements  referred  to in
writing  Article  IV of the  Credit  Agreement  and  such  other  documents  and
information  as it has deemed  appropriate  to make its own credit  analysis and
decision  to enter into this  Designation  Agreement;  (b)  agrees  that it will
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Designating Lender or any
other  Lender and,  based on such  documents  and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under any Loan Document;  (c) confirms that it is a Designated
Lender;  (d) appoints and  authorizes  the Agent to take such action as Agent on

discretion as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (e) agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms
of any Loan Document are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

     4. The Designee hereby appoints  [Designating  Lender or a specified branch
or affiliate of Designating Lender] as Designee's agent and attorney in fact and

communications  and notices under the Credit  Agreement and other Loan Documents
and to  exercise on  Designee's  behalf all rights to vote and to grant and make
approvals,  waivers,  consents of amendments to or under the Credit Agreement or
other Loan Documents. Designee shall not have any right to approve any waiver or
amendment  of the  Credit  Agreement  or of any  Note,  or  any  consent  to any
departure  by the  Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such  waiver,
amendment or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or any other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement or postpone any
date fixed for any payment of  principal  of, or  interest  on, the Notes or any
fees or any other  amounts  payable  under the Credit  Agreement.  Any  document
executed by such agent on the  Designee's  behalf in connection  with the Credit
Agreement  or  other  Loan  Documents  shall be  binding  on the  Designee.  The
Borrower, the Agent and each of the Lenders may rely on and are beneficiaries of
the preceding provisions.

     5. Following the execution of this Designation Agreement by the Designating
Lender,  its  Designee and the  Borrower,  it will be delivered to the Agent for
acceptance and recording by the Agent.  The effective date for this  Designation
Agreement (the "Effective  Date") shall be the date of acceptance  hereof by the
Agent, unless otherwise specified on the signature page thereto.

     6. Each of the Borrower,  the  Designating  Lender and the Agent hereby (i)
acknowledges  that the  Designee is relying on the  non-petition  provisions  of
Section 8.12 of the Credit Agreement as agreed to by all signatories thereto and
(ii) reaffirms that it will not institute against the Designee or join any other
Person in  instituting  against the  Designee  any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,
arrangement,  insolvency or liquidation  proceedings  under any federal or state
bankruptcy  or similar law for one year and one day after the payment in full of
the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by the Designee.

     7. The Designating  Lender  unconditionally  agrees to pay or reimburse the
Designee and save the Designee  harmless against all  liabilities,  obligations,
losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,  expenses, or
disbursements of any kind or nature  whatsoever which may be imposed or asserted
by any of the  parties  to the  Loan  Documents  against  the  Designee,  in its
capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Designee hereunder or
thereunder,  provided  that the  Designating  Lender shall not be liable for any
portion of such liabilities,  obligations,  losses, damages, penalties, actions,
