<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to employ the Executive as the President
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the Executive desires to serve in that capacity; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Employment Period.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall employ the Executive, and the Executive shall serve the Company, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on March&nbsp;31, 2006 (the "Employment Period"). The Employment Period shall automatically
renew beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2006, for periods of one year unless one party gives written notice to the other at least 60&nbsp;days prior to the end of any one-year renewal period,
that the Agreement shall not be further extended. Otherwise, the Agreement may be terminated as specifically provided below. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
than as provided in Section&nbsp;3(h)(iv)&nbsp;below, this Agreement supercedes in its entirety that certain Executive Employment Agreement ("Prior Agreement") by and between
Executive and the Company dated November&nbsp;1, 2001. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Position and Duties.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the Employment Period, the Executive shall be employed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and, when applicable, the Company shall
recommend that the Executive be reelected as a member of the Board. In his executive capacities, the Executive shall report to the Board as appropriate to the duties assigned by the Board. During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall have such reasonable and customary powers as are generally associated with the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive shall devote such attention and time
during normal business hours to the business and affairs of the Company to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive under this Agreement and Executive shall use
reasonable efforts to carry out such responsibilities faithfully and efficiently. It shall not be considered a violation of the foregoing for the Executive to (A)&nbsp;serve on corporate, civic or
charitable boards or committees (excluding those which could create a conflict of interest), (B)&nbsp;deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions, and
(C)&nbsp;manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with
this Agreement. </FONT></P>

the Employment Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary ("Annual Base Salary") of $1,000,000, payable in accordance with the regular payroll
practices of the Company; provided, however, that the portion of such Annual Base Salary during any taxable year of the Company which, when added to any otherwise deductible compensation and benefits
paid or provided to the Executive by the Company during such taxable year, would not be deductible by the Company in the taxable year such Annual Base Salary is paid or accrued because of the
applicable limitations under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall be deferred and paid to the Executive, in a lump sum, on that date (the

amount of any Annual Bonus shall be set at 100% of Annual Base Salary depending upon Company and individual performance and shall be subject to the discretion of the Board. The Executive will be
eligible for additional special bonus awards if and when determined by the Board in its sole discretion. At the Executive's election, the Annual Bonus may be deferred, in whole or in part, on the same
basis as it if it were deferred Annual Base Salary under Section&nbsp;3(a) above and paid to the Executive on the Deferral Date. </FONT></P>

policy, Executive shall have the right to transfer such policy to his own name or the name of a beneficiary thereof, provided Executive shall pay all premiums for such policy as shall accrue
thereafter. </FONT></P>

counsel in respect of this Agreement, and, (ii)&nbsp;that the Executive has had full opportunity, prior to execution of this Agreement, to review thoroughly this Agreement with the Executive's

Nevada, (ii)&nbsp;consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding, and (iii)&nbsp;waives any objection which the Executive may have
to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court. The Executive also irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of any process, pleadings, notices or other
