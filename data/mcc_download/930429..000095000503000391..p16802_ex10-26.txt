                      FORM OF SALARY CONTINUATION AGREEMENT


         THIS AGREEMENT is adopted this first day of January, 2003, by and among
Monterey Bay Bancorp, Inc. (the "Parent Company"), a corporation organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware, located in Watsonville,  California; Monterey
Bay Bank (the  "Company"),  a federally  chartered  savings and loan association
organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,   located  in
Watsonville, California; and * (the "Executive").


                                  INTRODUCTION

         The Company is willing to provide salary  continuation  benefits to the
Executive and the Parent Company is willing to guarantee the  performance of the
Company in  providing  such salary  continuation  benefits to the  Executive  in
recognition of Executive's  importance to the success of the Company. The salary
continuation  benefits  described  herein are not  intended  to be  provided  in
accordance  with any tax qualified  plan,  and are thus commonly  referred to as
"non-qualified benefits".

         This Agreement provides for Executive to be 100% vested in his right to
receive  salary  continuation  benefits  as of  the  proper  execution  of  this
Agreement.   Executive's  right  to  receive  salary  continuation  benefits  is
forfeitable only in the event of specific  limited  circumstances as defined and
described herein.

         The Company will pay the salary continuation  benefits from its general
assets.  Nothing in this  Agreement  is intended to provide  Executive  with any
lien, claim, or encumbrance upon any specific Company assets,  revenues, or cash
flows.  In regards to benefits  receivable  under this  Agreement,  Executive is
intended to be a general creditor of the Company.


                                    AGREEMENT

         The Parent Company and the Company  (collectively  the "Companies") and
the Executive agree as follows:

         2.3 Disability Benefit. If the Executive  terminates  employment due to
Disability prior to Normal  Retirement Age and following the Company's  purchase
of an initial  disability policy prior to March 31, 2003 covering Executive with
a lump  sum  benefit  of at  least  $1,000,000,  the  Company  shall  pay to the
Executive  the benefit  described  in this  Section  2.3, in lieu of any benefit
under any other Section of Article 2 of this Agreement. The Company shall not be
obligated  at any time to  maintain  a  disability  policy  covering  Executive.
However,  the absence of such a disability  policy shall not relieve the Company
of its financial  obligation to Executive  under this Section of this  Agreement
once the initial  disability  policy  covering  Executive  is  purchased  by the
Company prior to March 31, 2003.

         2.3.1 Amount of Benefit. The benefit under this Section 2.3 is ***.

2.4,  in lieu of any  benefit  under  any  other  Section  of  Article 2 of this
Agreement. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the "Change of Control
Benefit" is identical to the "Normal Retirement  Benefit" provided under Section

         2.4.4 Excess Parachute Payment.  Notwithstanding  any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary,  if, in the opinion of independent tax accountants or
counsel  selected,  retained,  and  paid  for by the  Companies  and  reasonably
acceptable to the Executive ("Tax Counsel"), any of the compensation or benefits
payable,  or to be provided,  to Executive by the Companies under this Agreement
would be treated as an excess parachute payment ("Excess Payment") as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code (whether alone or in conjunction with payments or
benefits by the Companies outside of this Agreement), the Companies shall direct
Tax  Counsel  to  determine  and  compare  (i)   Executive's  net  income  after
Executive's payment of all federal,  state, and local taxes assuming that all of
the  compensation and benefits payable by the Companies under this Agreement and
all such other arrangements are paid to Executive and Executive pays the "Excise
Tax" (as imposed under Code Section 4999); and (ii) Executive's net income after
payment of all federal,  state and local taxes assuming that the total amount of
compensation  and benefits payable by the Companies under this Agreement and all
such other  arrangements  is reduced such that no Excess Payment results and the
Excise Tax is not triggered.  If the amount  calculated under (ii) above is less
than the amount  calculated  under (i) above,  then the full amount due from the
Companies  under all such  arrangements  shall be payable to  Executive.  If the
amount  calculated under (ii) above is not less than the amount calculated under
(i) above,  then the total amount of compensation and benefits payable under all
such arrangements shall be reduced, as provided below, such that Executive shall
receive no Excess  Payment and shall have no personal  liability for Excise Tax.
In the event that the amount of any  payments,  including  any  benefits,  which
would be payable to or for the benefit of Executive under this Agreement must be
modified or reduced to comply with this Section  2.4.4,  Executive  shall direct
which  payments  are to be  modified  or reduced.  This  Section  2.4.4 shall be
interpreted  so as to maximize the net after-tax  dollar value to Executive.  In
determining whether any Excess Payment exists and the most advantageous  outcome
for  Executive,  the  parties  shall take into  account all  provisions  of Code
Section 280G,  and the  Regulations  thereunder,  including  making  appropriate
adjustments  to such  calculations  for amounts  established  to be  "Reasonable
Compensation"  as provided in Section  280G(b)(4) of the Code. The Companies and
Executive  shall  cooperate  fully with Tax Counsel and provide Tax Counsel with
all  compensation  and benefit  amounts,  personal  tax  information,  and other
information  necessary or helpful in calculation of such net after-tax  amounts.
In the  event of any  Internal  Revenue  Service  examination,  audit,  or other
inquiry,  the Companies and  Executive  agree to take action to provide,  and to
cooperate  in  providing,  evidence to the Internal  Revenue  Service  (and,  if
applicable, the state revenue department) to achieve this goal.

         2.4.5  Correction  of Excess  Parachute  Payment  Adjustment.  If it is
established  pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue
Service   proceeding,   or  pursuant  to  an  opinion  of  Tax   Counsel,   that
notwithstanding  the good faith of the  Companies  and Executive in applying the
terms of Section 2.4.4, either (i) the amounts paid to Executive unintentionally
constituted  Excess  Payment  and  triggered  the Excise  Tax,  even  though the
payments to Executive  were  reduced in an effort to avoid such result;  or (ii)
the amounts paid to Executive  were reduced by more than was  necessary to avoid
triggering the Excise Tax, then the parties shall make the applicable correction
that will achieve the goal  described in Section  2.4.4.  In the event the error
referred to in clause (i) hereof occurs,  Executive is hereby  required to repay
to the  Companies,  within 15 days  after the error is  discovered,  the  amount
necessary to avoid the Excise Tax; provided,  however, that if Executive,  based
on advice from Tax Counsel and Executive's own tax advisor,  determines that the
return of such amounts will not serve to  eliminate  the Excess  Payment and the
Excise Tax, the Companies then shall be obligated to pay to Executive, within 15
days after Executive  notifies the Companies of Executive's  determination,  the
total  amount  by which the  original  amount of  Executive's  compensation  and
benefits were reduced  pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4.4.  In the event the
error  referred  to in clause  (ii)  hereof  occurs,  the  Companies  are hereby
required to repay to  Executive,  within 30 days after the error is  discovered,
the maximum amount of the  compensation  and benefits that were reduced pursuant
to the terms of Section 2.4.4 that Executive may receive without  triggering the
Excise Tax.


                                    Article 3
                                 Death Benefits

         3.1 Death During Active Service.  Upon the  Executive's  death while in
the active  service of the  Company,  the Company  shall pay to the  Executive's
beneficiary  the benefit  described  in the Split Dollar  Agreement  between the
Company and the Executive of even date herewith (the "Split Dollar  Agreement"),
subject  to Article 5 and  Article 7 hereof,  and no  benefits  shall be payable
under Article 2 of this Agreement.

         3.2 Death During Payment of a Lifetime  Benefit.  If the Executive dies
after  receiving any Lifetime  Benefit  payments  pursuant to Article 2 Sections
2.1, 2.2, or 2.4 of this  Agreement,  the payments  under Article 2 shall cease,
and the Executive's beneficiary shall receive the benefit described in the Split
Dollar Agreement, subject to Article 5 and Article 7 hereof.

         3.3 Death  After  Termination  of  Employment  But Before  Payment of a
Lifetime  Benefit  Commences.  If the Executive has a Termination  of Employment
that would entitle him to a Lifetime  Benefit under Article 2 of this Agreement,
but dies prior to the commencement of said benefit  payments,  the Company shall
pay to the  Executive's  beneficiary  the benefit  described in the Split Dollar
Agreement,  subject to Article 5 and Article 7 hereof,  and no benefits shall be
payable under Article 2 of this Agreement.

                                    Article 4
                                  Beneficiaries

         4.1   Beneficiary   Designations.   The  Executive  shall  designate  a
beneficiary by filing a written designation with the Company.  The Executive may
revoke  or  modify  the  designation  at any time by  filing a new  designation.
However,  designations  will be effective  only if signed by the  Executive  and
received  by the  Company  during  the  Executive's  lifetime.  The  Executive's
beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the beneficiary
predeceases  the Executive,  or if the Executive names his spouse as beneficiary
and the marriage is  subsequently  dissolved,  or if the Executive names someone
other  than his  spouse  as  beneficiary  and he  subsequently  marries.  If the
Executive dies without a valid  beneficiary  designation,  all payments shall be
made to the Executive's estate.

         4.2  Facility  of  Payment.  If a benefit is  payable to a minor,  to a
person  declared  incompetent,   or  to  a  person  incapable  of  handling  the
disposition  of his or her  property,  the Company  may pay such  benefit to the
guardian,  legal  representative,  or person  having the care or custody of such
minor, incompetent person, or incapable person. The Company may require proof of
incompetence,  minority,  or guardianship,  as it may deem appropriate  prior to
distribution of the benefit.  Such distribution  shall completely  discharge the
Company from all liability with respect to such benefit.

                               General Limitations

         5.1  Termination  for  Cause.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this
Agreement  to the  contrary,  the Company  shall not pay any benefit  under this
Agreement if the Company  terminates the  Executive's  employment for any one or
more of the following reasons ("Termination for Cause"):

            (a)   Gross  negligence or gross neglect of duties to the Company in
                  connection with the Executive's employment that has a material
                  adverse effect on the Company; or

            (b)   Conviction of a criminal felony; or

            (c)   Any breach of fiduciary duty to the Company involving personal

                  or significant Company policy committed in connection with the
                  Executive's  employment that has a material  adverse effect on
                  the Company.

         5.2  Suicide  or  Misstatement.  The  Company  shall  not pay any death
benefit under Article 3 of this Agreement if the Executive commits suicide after
the date of this Agreement, if such suicide prevents the Company from collecting
the full amount of proceeds from any and all life insurance  policies  issued in
connection with the Split Dollar  Agreement of even date herewith.  In addition,
the Company shall not pay any death benefit under Article 3 of this Agreement if
the Executive has made any material  misstatement of fact on any application for
a life  insurance  policy issued in connection  with the Split Dollar  Agreement
that prevents the Company from  collecting the full amount of proceeds from such
policy.

                           Claims and Review Procedure

       6.1 Claims  Procedure.  An Executive or beneficiary  ("Claimant") who has
not received  benefits under this  Agreement  that he or she believes  should be
paid shall make a claim for such benefits as follows:

              6.1.1 Initiation - Written Claim.  The Claimant  initiates a claim
       by submitting to the Company a written claim for the benefits.

              6.1.2 Timing of Company  Response.  The Company  shall  respond to
       such claimant  within a 90-day period after  receiving the claim.  If the
       Company determines that special circumstances require additional time for
       processing  the claim,  the Company can extend the response  period by an
       additional 90 days by notifying the claimant in writing, prior to the end
       of the initial 90-day period, that an additional period is required.  The
       notice of extension must set forth the special circumstances and the date
       by which the Company expects to render its decision.

              6.1.3 Notice of Decision. If the Company denies all or any part of
       the claim,  the  Company  shall  notify the  Claimant  in writing of such
       denial.  The Company shall write the notification in a manner  calculated
       to be understood by the Claimant. The notification shall set forth:

              (a)   The specific reasons for the denial,

              (b)   A reference to the specific  provisions of this Agreement on
                    which the denial is based;

              (c)   A  description  of any  additional  information  or material
                    necessary  for the  Claimant  to  perfect  the  claim and an
                    explanation of why it is needed;

              (d)   An explanation of this Agreement's review procedures and the
                    time limits applicable to such procedures; and

              (e)   A statement of the Claimant's  right to bring a civil action
                    under ERISA  Section  502(a)  following  an adverse  benefit

claim, the Claimant shall have the opportunity for a full and fair review by the
Company of the denial, as follows:

              6.2.1  Initiation - Written Request.  To initiate the review,  the
       Claimant,  within 60 days after receiving the Company's notice of denial,
       must file with the Company a written request for review.

              6.2.2 Additional  Submissions - Information  Access.  The Claimant
       shall then have the  opportunity to submit written  comments,  documents,
       records,  and other information  relating to the claim. The Company shall
       also provide the  Claimant,  upon request and free of charge,  reasonable
       access to, and copies of, all documents,  records,  and other information
       relevant to the Claimant's claim for benefits.

              6.2.3  Considerations  on Review.  In considering the review,  the
       Company  shall  take into  account  all  materials  and  information  the
       Claimant  submits  relating to the claim,  without regard to whether such
       information   was  submitted  or   considered  in  the  initial   benefit
       determination.

              6.2.4 Timing of Company  Response.  The Company  shall  respond in
       writing to such  Claimant  within a 60-day  period  after  receiving  the
       request for review. If the Company determines that special  circumstances
       require  additional time for processing the claim, the Company can extend
       the response period by an additional 60 days by notifying the Claimant in
       writing,  prior  to  the  end of  the  initial  60-day  period,  that  an
       additional period is required. The notice of extension must set forth the
       special circumstances and the date by which the Company expects to render
       its decision.

              6.2.5 Notice of Decision. The Company shall notify the Claimant in

              (b)   A reference to the specific  provisions of this Agreement on
                    which the denial is based;

              (c)   A statement  that the Claimant is entitled to receive,  upon
                    request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies
                    of, all documents, records and other information relevant to
                    the Claimant's claim for benefits; and

              (d)   A statement of the Claimant's  right to bring a civil action
                    under ERISA Section 502(a).

                           Claims and Review Procedure

       5.1 Claims  Procedure.  An Executive or beneficiary  ("Claimant") who has
not received  benefits under this  Agreement  that he or she believes  should be
paid shall make a claim for such benefits as follows:

              5.1.1 Initiation - Written Claim.  The Claimant  initiates a claim
       by submitting to the Company a written claim for the benefits.

              5.1.2 Timing of Company  Response.  The Company  shall  respond to
       such Claimant  within a 90-day period after  receiving the claim.  If the
       Company determines that special circumstances require additional time for
       processing  the claim,  the Company can extend the response  period by an
       additional 90 days by notifying the Claimant in writing, prior to the end
       of the initial 90-day period, that an additional period is required.  The
       notice of extension must set forth the special circumstances and the date
       by which the Company expects to render its decision.

              5.1.3 Notice of Decision. If the Company denies all or any part of
       the claim,  the  Company  shall  notify the  Claimant  in writing of such
       denial.  The Company shall write the notification in a manner  calculated
       to be understood by the Claimant. The notification shall set forth:

              (a)   The specific reasons for the denial;

              (b)   A reference to the specific  provisions of this Agreement on
                    which the denial is based;

              (c)   A  description  of any  additional  information  or material
                    necessary  for the  Claimant  to  perfect  the  claim and an
                    explanation of why it is needed;

              (d)   An explanation of this Agreement's review procedures and the
                    time limits applicable to such procedures; and

              (e)   A statement of the Claimant's  right to bring a civil action
                    under ERISA  Section  502(a)  following  an adverse  benefit
                    determination on review.

         5.2  Review  Procedure.  If the  Company  denies all or any part of the
claim, the Claimant shall have the opportunity for a full and fair review by the
Company of the denial, as follows:

                  5.2.1  Initiation - Written  Request.  To initiate the review,
         the Claimant,  within 60 days after  receiving the Company's  notice of
         denial, must file with the Company a written request for review.

                  5.2.2  Additional   Submissions  -  Information   Access.  The
         Claimant shall then have the  opportunity  to submit written  comments,
         documents,  records,  and other information  relating to the claim. The
         Company  shall also  provide  the  Claimant,  upon  request and free of
         charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and
         other information relevant to the Claimant's claim for benefits.

                  5.2.3 Considerations on Review. In considering the review, the
         Company  shall take into  account all  materials  and  information  the
         Claimant submits relating to the claim,  without regard to whether such
         information   was  submitted  or  considered  in  the  initial  benefit
         determination.

                  5.2.4 Timing of Company Response. The Company shall respond in
         writing to such  Claimant  within a 60-day  period after  receiving the
         request  for   review.   If  the  Company   determines   that   special
         circumstances  require  additional  time for processing the claim,  the
         Company  can extend the  response  period by an  additional  60 days by
         notifying  the  Claimant  in  writing,  prior to the end of the initial
         60-day  period,  that an additional  period is required.  The notice of
         extension  must set forth  the  special  circumstances  and the date by
         which the Company expects to render its decision.

                  5.2.5  Notice  of  Decision.  The  Company  shall  notify  the
         Claimant in writing of its decision on review.  The Company shall write
         the  notification  in a  manner  calculated  to be  understood  by  the
         Claimant. The notification shall set forth:

                  (a) The specific reasons for the denial;

                  (b) A reference to the specific  provisions of this  Agreement
                      on which the denial is based;

                  (c) A statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon
                      request  and free of  charge,  reasonable  access  to, and
                      copies of, all  documents,  records and other  information
                      relevant to the Claimant's claim for benefits; and

                  (d) A  statement  of the  Claimant's  right  to  bring a civil
                      action under ERISA Section 502(a).

administrators, and transferees.

         6.2 No Guarantee of  Employment.  This  Agreement is not an  employment
policy  or  contract.  It does not give the  Executive  the  right to  remain an
employee of the  Company,  nor does it  interfere  with the  Company's  right to
discharge  the  Executive.  It also does not require the  Executive to remain an
employee nor interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any
time.

         6.3  Applicable  Law. The Agreement and all rights  hereunder  shall be
governed by the laws of the State of California,  except to the extent preempted
by the laws of the United States of America.

Agreement.

         6.6 Reorganization. In the event that the Parent Company or the Company
shall merge or consolidate into or with another entity,  or reorganize,  or sell

the Company shall obtain the agreement of such  succeeding or continuing  entity
to assume and discharge the  obligations of the Companies  under this Agreement.

"Companies" as used in this Agreement  shall be deemed to refer to the successor

benefit.
