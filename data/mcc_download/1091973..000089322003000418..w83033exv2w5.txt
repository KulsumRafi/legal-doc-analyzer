                              A G R E E M E N T S:

do hereby agree as follows:

      1. HSR Filing. Section 6.2(c) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended
by deleting such Section in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

            "HSR Filing. Within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of written
      notice by Buyer to Seller in accordance with Section 11.3 of this
      Agreement requesting that the parties make, or cause to be made, any and
      all filings which are required under the HSR Act in connection with the
      transactions contemplated hereby, which notice shall in no event be given
      later than March 31, 2003, the parties shall make, or cause to be made,
      any and all filings which are required under the HSR Act (the "HSR
      APPROVAL") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
      party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
      assistance as any other party may request in connection with its
      preparation of necessary filings or submissions pursuant to the provisions
      of the HSR Act. If the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
      Justice requests additional information from the parties or imposes any
      condition upon the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties will
      cooperate with each other, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department
      of Justice; provided, however, that nothing herein shall compel either
      party or any Affiliate of such party to comply with any condition imposed
      upon such party or such Affiliate that is adverse to the interests of such
      party or its Affiliates as

      determined by such party in the exercise of its reasonable business
      judgment. Buyer shall pay all filing fees, if any, required under the HSR
      Act."

      2. Representations and Warranties. Each party hereto hereby makes the
following representations and warranties to the other party hereto:

            (a) Such party has full power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by such party have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary

valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable against it in accordance
with its respective terms, except for the effect thereon of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally, and general principles of equity.

            (b) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance with
or fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof will result in a
Default under: (1) any note, indenture, instrument, agreement, contract,
mortgage, lease, license, franchise, permit or other authorization, rights

      3. Miscellaneous. The Purchase Agreement, as amended pursuant to this
Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms,
and all references in the Purchase Agreement to "this Agreement" and words of
similar import shall be deemed to mean the Purchase Agreement as so amended. All
of the provisions of Article 11 of the Purchase Agreement shall apply to, and
govern, this Agreement as if such provisions were set forth in and as part of
this Agreement, and they are hereby deemed restated in full herein mutatis
mutandis.
