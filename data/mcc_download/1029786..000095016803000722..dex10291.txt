agree that the Employment Agreement is amended as follows:

          entirety.

     2.   Section 2.3(b)(vi) is hereby amended to revise the last two sentences
          to read as follows:

     The benefits under this subsection (vi) shall be paid in the same forms and
     at the same times as Executive's benefits under the applicable Plans
     described above are paid (or would have been paid had Executive's interest
     in the applicable Plans been fully vested). The benefits payable under this
     subsection (vi) and subsection (vii) below shall not result in any
     duplication of benefits.

     3.   Section 2.3(b)(vii) is amended by revising the last sentence to read
          as follows:

     The benefits under this subsection (vii) shall be paid in the same forms
     and at the same times as Executive's benefits under the applicable
     Nationwide Plans are paid (or would have been paid had Executive's
     interests in the applicable Plans been fully vested).

     4.   Section 2.3(b) is amended by adding a new subsection (xvi) to the end
          to read as follows:

     retirement benefit under this Agreement in the amount of $105,000 per year,

     monthly installments commencing at your termination date. This benefit
     shall be paid in the same form and at the same time as Executive's
     retirement benefit under the Nationwide Retirement Plan is paid. The
     Company shall convert the single life annuity into the form of benefit paid
     under the Nationwide Retirement Plan based on the assumptions, interest
