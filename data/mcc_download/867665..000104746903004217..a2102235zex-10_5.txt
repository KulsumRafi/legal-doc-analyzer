                                Canada that are located in the continental

                                priority perfected Lien in such Oil and Gas

                         (iii)  10% of the PV-10 of the Proved Undeveloped
                                Reserves of Borrower and Newco Canada that are
                                located in the continental United States or
                                Canada

                                      -30-
<Page>

                                and subject to a Mortgage and UCC financing
                                statements (and PPSA registration statements in
                                the case of Newco Canada), that in each case
                                create a first priority perfected Lien in such
                                Oil and Gas Properties in favor of Agent for the
                                ratable benefit of the Lenders, MINUS

                    (y)  the Applicable Reduction, MINUS

                    (z)  the sum of (i) the Bank Products Reserve, and (ii) the
                    aggregate amount of Agent Reserves, if any, established by
                    Agent under SECTION 2.1(b).

               (b)  Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,
Agent may, and, at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, create reserves
against the Borrowing Base (without declaring an Event of Default) as Agent
determines, in its Permitted Discretion (in each case, an "AGENT RESERVE", and
collectively, the "AGENT RESERVES"). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Agent Reserves may include (but are not limited to) reserves based
upon, without duplication, (A) past due or accrued taxes or other charges by a
Governmental Authority, including ad valorem, personal property and other taxes
which may have priority over the Liens of Agent in the Collateral; (B) Liens
(whether inchoate or otherwise) in favor of third Persons, including, without
limitation, any Governmental Authority (whether or not such Liens are Permitted
Liens); (C) estimates of present and future costs, expenses, deposits and
liabilities related to the plugging and abandonment of the Oil and Gas
Properties (net of the amount thereof which has been taken into account in the
most recent Reserve Report or is fully secured by an escrow or surety
arrangement acceptable to Agent in its Permitted Discretion); (D) without
duplication of the foregoing, amounts owing by Borrower or any Guarantor to any
Person, including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority, to the extent
secured by a Lien (whether or not such Lien is a Permitted Lien) on, or trust
(constructive or otherwise) over, any of the Collateral (including proceeds
thereof or collections from the sale of Hydrocarbons which may from time to time
come into the possession of any of the Lenders or their agents), which Lien or
trust, in Agent's Permitted Discretion has a reasonable possibility of having a
priority superior to Agent's Liens (such as landlord liens, ad valorem taxes,
production taxes, severance taxes, sales taxes, collections attributable to sale
of Hydrocarbons of Persons other than the Loan Parties) in and to such item of
Collateral, proceeds or collection; (E) to the extent not taken into account in
the most recent Reserve Report delivered to Agent, amounts which Agent
determines are appropriate to account for minority interests and other interests
of Persons other than Borrower or Newco Canada and any natural gas imbalances of
Borrower or Newco Canada and for sales of Oil and Gas Properties; (F) unrealized
losses related to Commodities Hedging Agreements; (G) any reserves that Agent
may impose as a result of the non-compliance with SECTION 6.5 by any owner or
operator of the Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower or Newco Canada; and (H) an
amount equal to three months' rent on the Loan Parties' chief executive offices
in the United States and Canada to the extent any such location is not subject
to a Collateral Access Agreement within 30 days after the Closing Date. Borrower
and Agent understand and agree that any amount of Agent Reserves shall not be
considered a disbursement bearing interest hereunder, but rather shall be an
amount that is not available for borrowing by Borrower.

                                      -31-
<Page>

               (c)  The Revolving Loan Lenders shall have no obligation to make
additional Advances hereunder to the extent such additional Advances would cause
the Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.

               (d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Revolving Loan Lenders
shall have no obligation to make Advances if, either immediately before or after
giving effect to such Advances, the Revolver Usage PLUS the outstanding Term
Loan exceeds or will exceed the amount of Indebtedness permitted under the New
Notes Indenture (the amount of any such excess is hereafter referred to as the
"INDENTURE DEFICIT").

               (e)  Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section may be repaid and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at any time
during the term of this Agreement.

          2.2  TERM LOAN. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, each Term Loan Lender agrees (severally, not jointly or
jointly and severally) to make term loans (collectively, the "TERM LOAN") to
Borrower in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan
Amount. The Term Loan shall not be prepaid without the prior written consent of
the Revolving Loan Lenders and shall be repaid on the Maturity Date. The
outstanding unpaid principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest under
the Term Loan shall be due and payable on the date of termination of this
Agreement, whether by its terms or by acceleration. All amounts outstanding
under the Term Loan shall constitute Obligations.

          2.3  BORROWING PROCEDURES AND SETTLEMENTS.

               (a)  PROCEDURE FOR BORROWING. Each Borrowing shall be made by an
irrevocable written request by an Authorized Person delivered to Agent (which
notice must be received by Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on
the Business Day prior to the date that is the requested Funding Date in the
case of a request for an Advance or the Term Loan specifying (i) the amount of
such Borrowing, and (ii) the requested Funding Date, which shall be a Business
Day and, for the Term Loan, which must be the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in the case of a request for Swing Loan in an amount of $5,000,000, or
less, such notice will be timely received if it is received by Agent no later
than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the Business Day that is the requested
Funding Date) specifying (i) the amount of such Borrowing, and (ii) the
requested Funding Date, which shall be a Business Day. At Agent's election, in
lieu of delivering the above-described written request, any Authorized Person
may give Agent telephonic notice of such request by the required time, with such
telephonic notice to be confirmed in writing within 24 hours of the giving of
such notice.

               (b)  AGENT'S ELECTION. Promptly after receipt of a request for a
Borrowing pursuant to SECTION 2.3(a), Agent shall elect, in its discretion, (i)
to have the terms of SECTION 2.3(c) apply to such requested Borrowing, or (ii)
if the Borrowing is for an Advance, to request Swing Lender to make a Swing Loan
pursuant to the terms of SECTION 2.3(d) in the amount of the requested
Borrowing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Swing Lender declines in its sole
discretion to make a Swing Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.3(d), Agent shall elect to
have the terms of SECTION 2.3(c) apply to such requested Borrowing.

                                      -32-
<Page>

               (c)  MAKING OF ADVANCES.

                    (i)    In the event that Agent shall elect to have the terms
     of this SECTION 2.3(c) apply to a requested Borrowing as described in
     SECTION 2.3(b), then promptly after receipt of a request for a Borrowing
     pursuant to SECTION 2.3(a), Agent shall notify the Lenders, not later than
     1:00 p.m. (California time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the
     Funding Date applicable thereto, by telecopy, telephone, or other similar
     form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing. Each Lender shall make
     the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing
     available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent's Account, not
     later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the Funding Date applicable
     thereto. After Agent's receipt of the proceeds of such Advances, (or the
     Term Loan, as applicable), upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
     precedent set forth in SECTION 3 hereof, Agent shall make the proceeds
     thereof available to Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by
     transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by
     Agent to Borrower's Designated Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, subject to
     the provisions of SECTION 2.3(i), Agent shall not request any Lender to
     make, and no Lender shall make, any Advance (or its portion of the Term
     Loan) if Agent shall have actual knowledge that (1) one or more of the
     applicable conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 3 will not be
     satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless
     such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would exceed
     the Availability on such Funding Date.

                    (ii)   Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender on or
     prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the
     Closing Date, at least 1 Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing,
     that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to
     Agent for the account of Borrower the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata
     Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will
     make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the
     Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon
     such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a corresponding
     amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount
     available to Agent in immediately available funds and Agent in such
     circumstances has made available to Borrower such amount, that Lender shall
     on the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount available
     to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day
     during such period. A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect
     to amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest
     error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to Agent shall
     constitute such Lender's Advance on the date of Borrowing for all purposes
     of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Agent on the
     Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Borrower of such
     failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrower shall pay such amount
     to Agent for Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day
     elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the
     interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances composing such
     Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make any Advance on any Funding
     Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make
     an Advance on such Funding Date, but

                                      -33-
<Page>

     no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
     the Advance to be made by such other Lender on any Funding Date.

                    (iii)  Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a
     Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrower to Agent for the Defaulting
     Lender's benefit, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting
     Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments to each other non-Defaulting
     Lender member of the Lender Group ratably in accordance with their Revolver
     Commitments (but only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's Advance
     was funded by the other members of the Lender Group) or, if so directed by
     Borrower and if no Default or Event of Default had occurred and is
     continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender's Advance was not
     funded by the Lender Group), retain same to be re-advanced to Borrower as
     if such Defaulting Lender had made Advances to Borrower. Subject to the
     foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion, re-lend to
     Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such
     payments received and retained by it for the account of such Defaulting
     Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with
     respect to the Loan Documents, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not
     to be a "Lender" and such Lender's Revolver Commitment shall be deemed to
     be zero. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender
     until (x) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or
     shall have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting
     Lenders, Agent, and Borrower shall have waived such Defaulting Lender's
     default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting Lender makes its Pro Rata Share
     of the applicable Advance and pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting
     Lender in respect thereof. The operation of this Section shall not be
     construed to increase or otherwise affect the Revolver Commitment of any
     Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or
     any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or
     excuse the performance by Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder
     to Agent or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any such
     failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall constitute a material breach
     by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrower at
     its option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute
     Lender to assume the Revolver Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such
     substitute Lender to be acceptable to Agent. In connection with the
     arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have
     no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and
     deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance Agreement in favor of
     the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed
     and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being
     repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product
     Obligations) (including an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of the Risk
     Participation Liability) without any premium or penalty of any kind
     whatsoever; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that any such assumption of the
     Revolver Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to
     constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups' or Borrower's rights or
     remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation
     to such failure to fund.

               (d)  MAKING OF SWING LOANS.

                    (i)    In the event Agent shall elect, with the consent of
     Swing Lender, as a Lender, to have the terms of this SECTION 2.3(d) apply
     to a requested Borrowing as described in SECTION 2.3(b), Swing Lender as a
     Lender shall make such Advance in the amount of such Borrowing (any such
     Advance made solely by Swing Lender as a Lender pursuant to this SECTION
     2.3(d) being referred to as a "SWING LOAN" and such Advances being referred
     to collectively as "SWING LOANS") available to Borrower on the Funding Date
     applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds to
     Borrower's Designated Account. Each Swing Loan is an Advance hereunder and
     shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to other
     Advances, except that all payments on any Swing Loan shall be payable to
     Swing Lender as a Lender solely for its own account (and for the account of
     the holder of any participation interest with respect to such Swing Loan).
     Subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.3(i), Agent shall not request Swing
     Lender as a Lender to make, and Swing Lender as a Lender shall not make,
     any Swing Loan if Agent has actual knowledge that (i) one or more of the
     applicable conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 3 will not be
     satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless
     such condition has been waived, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would
     exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. Swing Lender as a Lender
     shall not otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable
     conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 3 have been satisfied on the
     Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making, in its sole discretion,
     any Swing Loan.

                    (ii)   The Swing Loans shall be secured by the Agent's
     Liens, shall constitute Advances and Obligations hereunder, and shall bear
     interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base
     Rate Loans.

               (e)  AGENT ADVANCES.

                    (i)    Agent hereby is authorized by Borrower and the
     Lenders, from time to time in Agent's sole discretion, (1) after the
     occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default,
     or (2) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent
     set forth in SECTION 3 have not been satisfied, to make Advances to
     Borrower on behalf of the Lenders that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion
     deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or
     any portion thereof, (B) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the
     Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations), or (C) to pay any other
     amount chargeable to Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
     including Lender Group Expenses and the costs, fees, and expenses described
     in SECTION 10 (any of the Advances described in this SECTION 2.3(e) shall
     be referred to as "AGENT ADVANCES"); PROVIDED, that notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary contained in this SECTION 2.3(e), the aggregate
     principal amount of Agent Advances outstanding at any time, when taken
     together with the aggregate principal amount of Overadvances made in
     accordance with Section 2.3(i) hereof outstanding at any time, shall not
     exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (x) 10% of the Borrowing Base then
     in effect and (y) $5,000,000. Each Agent Advance is an Advance hereunder
     and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to other
     Advances, and all

                                      -35-
<Page>

     payments thereon shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account (and
     for the account of the holder of any participation interest with respect to
     such Agent Advance).

                    (ii)   The Agent Advances shall be repayable by Borrower on
     demand and secured by the Agent's Liens granted to Agent under the Loan
     Documents, shall constitute Advances and Obligations hereunder, and shall
     bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are
     Base Rate Loans.

               (f)  SETTLEMENT. It is agreed that each Lender's funded portion
of the Advances is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Advances. Such agreement notwithstanding,
Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be
for the benefit of or enforceable by Borrower) that in order to facilitate the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among
them as to the Advances, the Swing Loans, and the Agent Advances shall take
place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:

                    (i)    Agent shall request settlement ("SETTLEMENT") with
     the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined
     by Agent, (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to each outstanding
     Swing Loan, (2) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance, and (3)
     with respect to Collections received, as to each by notifying the Lenders
     by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such
     requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. (California time) on the
     Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement
     (the date of such requested Settlement being the "SETTLEMENT DATE"). Such
     notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount
     of outstanding Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances for the period
     since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions
     contained herein (including SECTION 2.3(c)(iii)): (y) if a Lender's balance
     of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances exceeds such Lender's Pro
     Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances as of a
     Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. (California
     time) on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to
     the account of such Lender as such Lender may designate, an amount such
     that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the
     Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent
     Advances, and (z) if a Lender's balance of the Advances, Swing Loans, and
     Agent Advances is less than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances,
     Swing Loans, and Agent Advances as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall
     no later than 12:00 p.m. (California time) on the Settlement Date transfer
     in immediately available funds to the Agent's Account, an amount such that
     each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the
     Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent
     Advances. Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (z) of the
     immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the
     applicable Swing Loan or Agent Advance and, together with the portion of
     such Swing Loan or Agent Advance representing Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share
     thereof, shall constitute Advances of such Lenders. If any such amount is
     not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable
     thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled
     to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together
     with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.

                                      -36-
<Page>

                    (ii)   In determining whether a Lender's balance of the
     Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances is less than, equal to, or
     greater than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and
     Agent Advances as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the
     relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually
     received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest and
     fees payable by Borrower and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and
     proceeds of Collateral. To the extent that a net amount is owed to any such
     Lender after such application, such net amount shall be distributed by
     Agent to that Lender as part of such next Settlement.

                    (iii)  Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no
     Agent Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender
     any payments received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Advances, for
     application to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances. If, as of any
     Settlement Date, Collections received since the then immediately preceding
     Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     Advances other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous
     sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders,
     and Agent shall pay to the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding
     Advances of such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall, upon
     receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata
     Share of the Advances. During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing
     Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Agent Advances,
     and each Lender (subject to the effect of letter agreements between Agent
     and individual Lenders) with respect to the Advances other than Swing Loans
     and Agent Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or
     rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by
     Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable.

               (g)  NOTATION. Agent shall record on its books the principal
amount of the Advances owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to
Swing Lender, and Agent Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of
each Lender, from time to time. In addition, each Lender is authorized, at such
Lender's option, to note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of
principal of such Lender's Advances in its books and records, including computer
records, such books and records constituting conclusive evidence, absent
manifest error, of the accuracy of the information contained therein.

               (h)  LENDERS' FAILURE TO PERFORM. All Advances (other than Swing
Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall
be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to
make any Advance (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any
Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by
any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by
any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender
from its obligations hereunder.

               (i)  OPTIONAL OVERADVANCES. (i) Any contrary provision of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, SECTION 2.3(i)(ii)) notwithstanding,
the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and Agent or
Swing Lender, as applicable, may,

                                      -37-
<Page>

but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Advances
(including Swing Loans) to Borrower notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists
or thereby would be created, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Advances
(including a Swing Loan), the outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the
Borrowing Base by more than an amount equal to the lesser of (x) 10% of the
Borrowing Base then in effect and (y) $5,000,000, (B) after giving effect to
such Advances (including a Swing Loan), the outstanding Revolver Usage (except
for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or
Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount, (C) the
aggregate principal amount of Overadvances made pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(i)
when taken together with the aggregate principal amount of Agent Advances made
pursuant to SECTION 2.3(e) does not exceed at any time an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) 10% of the Borrowing Base then in effect and (y) $5,000,000 and
(D) at the time of the making of any such Advance (including any Swing Loan),
Agent does not believe, in good faith, that the Overadvance created by such
Advance will be outstanding for more than 90 days. The foregoing provisions are
for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Revolving Loan Lenders
and are not intended to benefit Borrower or the Term Loan Lenders in any way.
The Advances and Swing Loans, as applicable, that are made pursuant to this
SECTION 2.3(i) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as any other
Advance or Swing Loan, as applicable, and the rate of interest applicable
thereto shall be the rate applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans under
SECTION 2.6(c) hereof without regard to the presence or absence of a Default or
Event of Default.

                    (ii)   In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the
     Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by the preceding paragraph,
     regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify
     Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional)
     intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the
     Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses of Agent and the
     Revolving Loan Lenders) unless Agent determines that prior notice would
     result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value), and the Revolving
     Loan Lenders thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the
     terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrower intended to
     reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the
     Advances to Borrower to an amount permitted by the preceding paragraph. In
     the event Agent or any Revolving Loan Lender disagrees over the terms of
     reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or
     repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of
     the Required Lenders.

                    (iii)  Each Revolving Loan Lender shall be obligated to
     settle with Agent as provided in SECTION 2.3(f) for the amount of such
     Lender's Pro Rata Share of any unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported
     to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this
     SECTION 2.3(i), and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the
     Loan Account of interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses.

          2.4  PAYMENTS.

                                      -38-
<Page>

               (a)  PAYMENTS BY BORROWER.

                    (i)    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
     payments by Borrower shall be made to Agent's Account for the account of
     the Lender Group and shall be made in immediately available funds, no later
     than 11:00 a.m. (California time) on the date specified herein. Any payment
     received by Agent later than 11:00 a.m. (California time) shall be deemed
     to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable
     interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day.

                    (ii)   Unless Agent receives notice from Borrower prior to
     the date on which any payment is due to the Revolving Loan Lenders that
     Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent may
     assume that Borrower has made (or will make) such payment in full to Agent
     on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be
     so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each
     Revolving Loan Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then
     due such Lender. If and to the extent Borrower does not make such payment
     in full to Agent on the date when due, each Revolving Loan Lender severally
     shall repay to Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Revolving
     Loan Lender, together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate
     for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until
     the date repaid.

               (b)  APPORTIONMENT AND APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.

                    (i)    Except as otherwise provided with respect to
     Defaulting Lenders and except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents
     (including letter agreements between Agent and individual Revolving Loan
     Lenders), aggregate principal and interest payments shall be apportioned
     ratably among the Revolving Loan Lenders (according to the unpaid principal
     balance of the Revolving Loan Obligations held by each Revolving Loan
     Lender) and payments of fees and expenses (other than fees or expenses that
     are for Agent's separate account, after giving effect to any letter
     agreements between Agent and individual Revolving Loan Lenders) shall be
     apportioned ratably among the Revolving Loan Lenders having a Pro Rata
     Share of the Revolver Commitment or Revolving Loan Obligations (other than
     payments received while no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
     and which relate to the payment of principal or interest of specific
     Obligations other than the Term Loan Obligations or which relate to the
     payment of specific fees other than those payable to the Term Loan
     Lenders), and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral received by
     Agent, shall be applied as follows:

                           (A)  FIRST, to pay any Lender Group Expenses then due
          to Agent under the Loan Documents, until paid in full,

                           (B)  SECOND, to pay any Lender Group Expenses then
          due to the Revolving Loan Lenders under the Loan Documents, on a
          ratable basis, until paid in full,

                                      -39-
<Page>

                           (C)  THIRD, to pay any fees then due to Agent (for
          its separate accounts, after giving effect to any letter agreements
          between Agent and individual Revolving Loan Lenders) under the Loan
          Documents until paid in full,

                           (D)  FOURTH, to pay any fees then due to any or all
          of the Revolving Loan Lenders (after giving effect to any letter
          agreements between Agent and individual Revolving Loan Lenders) under
          the Loan Documents, on a ratable basis, until paid in full,

                           (E)  FIFTH, to pay interest due in respect of all
          Agent Advances, until paid in full,

                           (F)  SIXTH, ratably to pay interest due in respect
          of the Advances (other than Agent Advances) and the Swing Loans until
          paid in full,

                           (G)  SEVENTH, to pay the principal of all Agent
          Advances until paid in full,

                           (H)  EIGHTH, to pay the principal of all Swing Loans
          until paid in full,

                           (I)  NINTH, so long as no Event of Default has
          occurred and is continuing, and at Agent's election (which election
          Agent agrees will not be made if an Overadvance would be created
          thereby) to pay amounts then due and owing by Borrower or its
          Subsidiaries in respect of Bank Products, until paid in full,

                           (J)  TENTH, so long as no Event of Default has
          occurred and is continuing, to pay the principal of all Advances until
          paid in full,

                           (K)  ELEVENTH, if an Event of Default has occurred
          and is continuing, ratably (i) to pay the principal of all Advances
          until paid in full, and (ii) to Agent, to be held by Agent, for the
          benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, as applicable, as cash
          collateral in an amount up to the amount of the Bank Products Reserve
          established prior to the occurrence of, and not in contemplation of,
          the subject Event of Default until Borrower's and its Subsidiaries'
          obligations in respect of the then extant Bank Products have been paid
          in full or the cash collateral amount has been exhausted,

                           (L)  TWELFTH, if an Event of Default has occurred and
          is continuing, to Agent, to be held by Agent, for the ratable benefit
          of Issuing Lender and those Revolving Loan Lenders having a Revolver
          Commitment, as cash collateral in an amount up to 105% of the then
          extant Letter of Credit Usage until paid in full,

                           (M)  THIRTEENTH, to pay any other Revolving Loan
          Obligations (including Bank Product Obligations) until paid in full,

                                      -40-
<Page>

                           (N)  FOURTEENTH, after all of the Revolving Loan
          Obligations have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit have either
          been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver Commitments
          have been terminated, to pay the Lender Group Expenses then due to the
          Term Loan Lenders, on a ratable basis, until paid in full,

                           (O)  FIFTEENTH, after all of the Revolving Loan
          Obligations have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit have either
          been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver Commitments
          have been terminated, to pay interest due in respect of the Term Loan
          until paid in full,

                           (P)  SIXTEENTH, after all of the Revolving Loan
          Obligations have been paid in full, the Letters of Credit have either
          been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver Commitments
          have been terminated, to pay the outstanding principal balance of the
          Term Loan until the Term Loan is paid in full,

                           (Q)  SEVENTEENTH, after all of the Revolving Loan
          Obligations have been paid in full, the Letters of Credit have either
          been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver Commitments
          have been terminated, to pay any other Term Loan Obligations until
          paid in full, and

                           (R)  EIGHTEENTH, to Borrower (to be wired to the
          Designated Account) or such other Person entitled thereto under
          applicable law.

                    (ii)   Agent promptly shall distribute to each Lender,
     pursuant to the applicable wire instructions received from each Lender in
     writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive, subject to a
     Settlement delay as provided in SECTION 2.3(h).

                    (iii)  In each instance, so long as no Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, SECTION 2.4(b)(i) shall not be deemed to apply
     to any payment by Borrower specified by Borrower to be for the payment of
     specific Obligations other than the Term Loan Obligations then due and
     payable (or prepayable) under any provision of this Agreement.

                    (iv)   For purposes of the foregoing, "paid in full" means
     payment of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the
     terms thereof, including loan fees, service fees, professional fees,
     interest (and specifically including interest accrued after the
     commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default interest, interest on
     interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not the same would be or
     is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding.

                    (v)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement,
     Borrower shall not repay any Term Loan Obligations unless and until all of
     the Revolving Loan Obligations have been paid in full, all Letters of
     Credit have been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver
     Commitments have been terminated.

                    (vi)   In the event of a direct conflict between the
     priority provisions of this SECTION 2.4 and other provisions contained in
     any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that
     such priority provisions in such documents shall be read together and
     construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each
     other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be
     resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this SECTION 2.4 shall
     control and govern.

               (c)  EXCESS CASH. If, on the day immediately prior to the end of
any fiscal quarter of Borrower, the aggregate amount of cash and Cash
Equivalents of Borrower and its Subsidiaries exceeds $2,000,000, Borrower shall
immediately pay to Agent an amount equal to such excess to be applied to the
outstanding principal of the Advances.

               (d)  INDENTURE DEFICIT. If on any day an Indenture Deficit
exists, Borrower shall immediately pay to Agent an amount equal to such
Indenture Deficit to be applied to the outstanding principal of the Advances.

          2.5  OVERADVANCES. If, at any time or for any reason, the amount of
the Revolving Loan Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations and Related
Indebtedness) owed by Borrower to the Lender Group pursuant to SECTIONS 2.1 and
2.12 is greater than either the Dollar or percentage limitations set forth in
SECTIONS 2.1 or 2.12, (an "OVERADVANCE"), Borrower immediately shall pay to
Agent (unless an Overadvance is created pursuant to SECTION 2.3(i) in which case
such payment shall be on demand), in cash, the amount of such excess, which
amount shall be used by Agent to reduce the Revolving Loan Obligations in
accordance with the priorities set forth in SECTION 2.4(b). In addition,
Borrower hereby promises to pay the Obligations (including principal, interest,
fees, costs, and expenses) in Dollars in full to the Lender Group as and when
due and payable under the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

          2.6  INTEREST RATES AND LETTER OF CREDIT FEE: RATES, PAYMENTS, AND
CALCULATIONS.

               (a)  INTEREST RATES. Except as provided in clause (c) below, all
Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit and except for Bank Product
Obligations) whether or not charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms
hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof at a per annum rate
equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin; PROVIDED that, all interest on
the Term Loan shall be capitalized on the date such interest is payable. For
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the amounts so
capitalized hereunder shall bear interest in accordance with this SECTION
2.6(a).

          The foregoing notwithstanding, at no time shall any portion of the
Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations) bear interest on the Daily
Balance thereof at a per annum rate less than 9.0%. To the extent that interest
accrued hereunder at the rate set forth herein would be less than the foregoing
minimum daily rate, the interest rate chargeable hereunder for such day
automatically shall be deemed increased to the minimum rate.

               (b)  LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. Borrower shall pay Agent (for the
ratable benefit of the Lenders, with a Revolver Commitment subject to any letter
agreement between

                                      -42-
<Page>

Agent and individual Lenders), a Letter of Credit fee (in addition to the
charges, commissions, fees, and costs set forth in SECTION 2.12(e)) which shall
accrue at a rate equal to 4.0% per annum TIMES the Daily Balance of the undrawn
amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit.

               (c)  DEFAULT RATE. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default (and at the election of Agent or the
Required Lenders),

                    (i)    all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit
     and except for Bank Product Obligations) whether or not charged to the Loan
     Account pursuant to the terms hereof shall bear interest on the Daily
     Balance thereof at a per annum rate equal to 4 percentage points above the
     per annum rate otherwise applicable hereunder, and

                    (ii)   the Letter of Credit fee provided for above shall be
     increased to 4 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise
     applicable hereunder.

               (d)  PAYMENT. Interest, shall be due and payable, in arrears, on
the first day of each month at any time that Obligations or Revolver Commitments
are outstanding. Letter of Credit fees and all other fees payable hereunder
shall be due and payable on the date upon which such fees are due and payable
hereunder. Borrower hereby authorizes Agent, from time to time without prior
notice to Borrower, to, and Agent agrees that it will, charge such interest and
fees, all Lender Group Expenses (as and when incurred), the charges,
commissions, fees, and costs provided for in SECTION 2.12(e) (as and when
accrued or incurred), the fees and costs provided for in SECTION 2.11 (as and
when accrued or incurred), and all other payments as and when due and payable
under any Loan Document excluding any interest, fees, charges, commission costs
and any other payments due and payable in respect of the Term Loan or to the
Term Loan Lenders, but including any amounts due and payable to Wells Fargo or
its Affiliates in respect of Bank Products (up to the amount of the then extant
Bank Products Reserve) to Borrower's Loan Account, which amounts thereafter
shall constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the rate then
applicable to Advances hereunder. Any interest not paid when due shall be
compounded by being charged to Borrower's Loan Account and shall thereafter
constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the rate then
applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans hereunder.

               (e)  COMPUTATION. All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan
Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number
of days elapsed. In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time
hereafter, the rates of interest hereunder based upon the Base Rate
automatically and immediately shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal
to such change in the Base Rate.

               (f)  INTENT TO LIMIT CHARGES TO MAXIMUM LAWFUL RATE. In no event
shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other
amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under
any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination,
deem applicable. Borrower and the Lender Group, in executing and delivering this
Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner
of payment stated within it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, anything contained herein
to

                                      -43-
<Page>

the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of
payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, IPSO FACTO, as
of the date of this Agreement, Borrower is and shall be liable only for the
payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and payment received from Borrower in
excess of such legal maximum, whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the
principal balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.

          2.7  CASH MANAGEMENT.

               (a)  Borrower shall (i) establish and maintain cash management
services of a type and on terms satisfactory to Agent at one or more of the
banks set forth on Schedule 2.7(a) (each a "CASH MANAGEMENT BANK"), and shall
request in writing and otherwise take such reasonable steps to ensure that all
of its Account Debtors forward payment of the amounts owed by them directly to
such Cash Management Bank, and (ii) deposit or cause to be deposited promptly,
and in any event no later than the first Business Day after the date of receipt
thereof, all Collections (including those sent directly by Account Debtors to a
Cash Management Bank) into a bank account in Agent's name (a "CASH MANAGEMENT
ACCOUNT") at one of the Cash Management Banks. Borrower shall establish and
maintain a concentration account in its name (the "CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT") at
the bank or banks which shall be designated as the concentration account bank
for Borrower on Schedule 2.7(a) (the "CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT BANK") which bank
shall be satisfactory to Agent.

               (b)  Each Cash Management Bank and the Concentration Account Bank
shall establish and maintain Cash Management Agreements with Agent and Borrower
or any Guarantor, in form and substance acceptable to Agent. Each such Cash
Management Agreement shall provide, among other things, that (i) all items of
payment deposited in such Cash Management Account and the Concentration Account
and proceeds thereof are held by such Cash Management Bank or the Concentration
Account Bank, as the case may be, as agent or bailee-in-possession for Agent,
(ii) the Cash Management Bank and the Concentration Account Bank have no rights
of setoff or recoupment or any other claim against the applicable Cash
Management Account or Concentration Account, other than for payment of its
service fees and other charges directly related to the administration of such
Cash Management Account or Concentration Account and for returned checks or
other items of payment, (iii) (A) with respect to each Cash Management Bank,
such bank agrees, to forward immediately all amounts in each Cash Management
Account to the Concentration Account Bank and to cause daily sweeps from such
Cash Management Account into the Concentration Account, and (B) with respect to
the Concentration Account Bank, such bank agrees from and after a receipt of a
notice (an "ACTIVATION NOTICE") from Agent (which Activation Notice may be given
by Agent at any time at which an Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing), to immediately forward all amounts received in the Concentration
Account to the Agent's Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Agent reserves the right
in its sole discretion, to require that Collections representing amounts
attributable to trust fund taxes or Hydrocarbon interests of third Persons be
segregated by the Cash Management Banks and held in a separate account (it being
the intent of Agent, to the extent it has sufficient information to do so, to so
segregate trust fund taxes or Hydrocarbon interests of third Persons, and avoid
the deposit of such funds into the Agent's Account), and (iv) prior to the
receipt by the Concentration Account Bank of an Activation Notice, all amounts
in the Concentration Account may be transferred to and used by Borrower in the
ordinary course of business. From and after the date Agent has delivered an
Activation Notice to any Cash

                                      -44-
<Page>

Management Bank with respect to any Cash Management Account(s), Borrower shall
not accumulate or maintain cash in disbursement or payroll accounts as of any
date of determination in excess of checks outstanding against such accounts as
of that date and amounts necessary to meet minimum balance requirements.

               (c)  So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Borrower may amend Schedule 2.7(a) to add or replace a Cash
Management Bank, Cash Management Account, Concentration Account Bank or
Concentration Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such prospective Cash
Management Bank or Concentration Account Bank shall be satisfactory to Agent and
Agent shall have consented in writing in advance to the opening of such Cash
Management Account or Concentration Account with the prospective Cash Management
Bank or Concentration Account Bank, and (ii) prior to the time of the opening of
such Cash Management Account or Concentration Account, Borrower and Guarantors
and such prospective Cash Management Bank or Concentration Account Bank shall
have executed and delivered to Agent a Cash Management Agreement. Borrower shall
close any of its Cash Management Accounts or Concentration Account (and
establish replacement cash management accounts in accordance with the foregoing
sentence) promptly and in any event within 30 days of notice from Agent that the
creditworthiness of any Cash Management Bank or Concentration Account Bank is no
longer acceptable in Agent's reasonable judgment, or as promptly as practicable
and in any event within 60 days of notice from Agent that the operating
performance, funds transfer, or availability procedures or performance of the
Cash Management Bank with respect to Cash Management Accounts, Concentration
Account Bank with respect to the Concentration Account or Agent's liability
under any Cash Management Agreement with such Cash Management Bank or the
Concentration Account Bank is no longer acceptable in Agent's reasonable
judgment.

               (d)  The Cash Management Accounts and the Concentration Account
shall be cash collateral accounts, with all Collections in such accounts
securing payment of the Obligations, and in which Borrower and each Guarantor is
hereby deemed to have granted a Lien to Agent.

               (e)  Within 15 days after the Closing Date, Newco Canada shall
(i) establish and maintain one or more depository accounts, under the dominion
and control of Agent pursuant to a lockbox agreement among Agent, Newco Canada
and the applicable Canadian financial institution, in form and substance
satisfactory to Agent, in respect of its Collections and (ii) instruct all of
its Account Debtors to remit all such Collections to such depository accounts.
Newco Canada shall at all times deposit all Collections into such accounts that
are received by it from any source promptly, and in any event no later than the
first Business Day, after the date of receipt thereof.

               (f)  So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Newco Canada may use the funds on deposit in its foreign bank
accounts for its working capital purposes. During the continuance of an Event of
Default, Agent shall have the right to convert all non-Dollar denominated
balances in Newco Canada's foreign bank accounts into Dollars (at Borrower's
sole expense) and cause all amounts in such accounts to be wired into a DDA or
other account subject to a Control Agreement and then wired from such DDA to a
Cash Management Account. The arrangements contemplated in SECTION 2.7(e) and
this SECTION

                                      -45-
<Page>

2.7(f) shall not be modified by Borrower, Newco Canada or any other Subsidiaries
of Borrower without the prior written consent of Agent.

          2.8  CREDITING PAYMENTS; FLOAT CHARGE. The receipt of any payment item
by Agent (whether from transfers to Agent by the Cash Management Banks pursuant
to the Cash Management Agreements or otherwise) shall not be considered a
payment on account unless such payment item is a wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds made to the Agent's Account or unless and until such
payment item is honored when presented for payment. Should any payment item not
be honored when presented for payment, then Borrower shall be deemed not to have
made such payment and interest shall be calculated accordingly. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall be deemed
received by Agent only if it is received into the Agent's Account on a Business
Day on or before 11:00 a.m. (California time). If any payment item is received
into the Agent's Account on a non-Business Day or after 11:00 a.m. (California
time) on a Business Day, it shall be deemed to have been received by Agent as of
the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day. From and
after the Closing Date, Agent shall be entitled to charge Borrower for 2
Business Days of 'clearance' or 'float' at the rate applicable to Base Rate
Loans under SECTION 2.6 on all Collections that are received by Borrower
(regardless of whether forwarded by the Cash Management Banks to Agent). This
across-the-board 2 Business Days clearance or float charge on all Collections is
acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect of the pricing of
the financing of Borrower and shall apply irrespective of whether or not there
are any outstanding monetary Obligations; the effect of such clearance or float
charge being the equivalent of charging 2 Business Days of interest on such
Collections. The parties acknowledge and agree that the economic benefit of the
foregoing provisions of this SECTION 2.8 shall be for the exclusive benefit of
Agent.

          2.9  DESIGNATED ACCOUNT. Agent is authorized to make the Advances and
the Term Loan, and Issuing Lender is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit,
under this Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from
anyone purporting to be an Authorized Person, or without instructions if
pursuant to SECTION 2.6(d). Borrower agrees to establish and maintain the
Designated Account with the Designated Account Bank for the purpose of receiving
the proceeds of the Advances requested by Borrower and made by Agent or the
Lenders hereunder. Unless otherwise agreed by Agent and Borrower, any Advance,
Agent Advance, or Swing Loan requested by Borrower and made by Agent or the
Lenders hereunder shall be made to the Designated Account.

          2.10 MAINTENANCE OF LOAN ACCOUNT; STATEMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS. Agent
shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrower (the "LOAN
ACCOUNT") on which Borrower will be charged with all Advances (including Agent
Advances and Swing Loans) made by Agent, Swing Lender, or the Lenders to
Borrower or for Borrower's account, the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing
Lender for Borrower's account, and with all other payment Obligations hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents (including Bank Product Obligations up to the
amount of the then extant Bank Products Reserve but excluding the Term Loan
Obligations), including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender Group
Expenses. In accordance with SECTION 2.8, the Loan Account will be credited with
all payments received by Agent from Borrower or for Borrower's account,
including all amounts received in the Agent's Account from any Cash Management
Bank. Agent shall render statements regarding the Loan Account to Borrower,
including principal, interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges
and

                                      -46-
<Page>

expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses owing, and such statements shall be
conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account
stated between Borrower and the Lender Group unless, within 30 days after
receipt thereof by Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Agent written objection
thereto describing the error or errors contained in any such statements.

          2.11 FEES. Borrower shall pay to Agent the following fees and charges,
which fees and charges shall be non-refundable when paid (irrespective of
whether this Agreement is terminated thereafter) and shall be apportioned among
the Revolving Loan Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share (as
determined by clause (a) of the definition thereof):

               (a)  UNUSED LINE FEE. On the first day of each month during the
term of this Agreement, an unused line fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum
TIMES the result of (a) the Maximum Revolver Amount, LESS (b) the sum of (i) the
average Daily Balance of Advances that were outstanding during the immediately
preceding month, PLUS (ii) the average Daily Balance of the Letter of Credit
Usage during the immediately preceding month,

               (b)  FEE LETTER FEES. As and when due and payable under the terms
of the Fee Letter, Borrower shall pay to Agent the fees set forth in the Fee
Letter, and

               (c)  AUDIT, APPRAISAL, AND VALUATION CHARGES. For the separate
account of Agent, audit, appraisal, and valuation fees and charges as follows,
(i) a fee of $850 per day, per auditor (such fees for all auditors for any
single financial audit not to exceed $5,000 in the aggregate), plus
out-of-pocket expenses for each financial audit of a Loan Party performed by
personnel employed by Agent, (ii) a fee of $1,500 per day per appraiser, plus
out-of-pocket expenses, for each appraisal of the Collateral performed by
personnel employed by Agent, and (iii) the actual charges paid or incurred by
Agent if it elects to employ the services of one or more third Persons to
perform financial audits of any Loan Party, to appraise the Collateral, or any
portion thereof, to review or examine the Oil and Gas Properties of any Loan
Party or to assess any Loan Party's business valuation, PROVIDED that, (x) with
respect of clause (i) above, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay for more than four (4)
financial audits during any calendar year and (y) with respect to any Reserve
Report requested by Borrower or Agent (in addition to the Reserve Reports
required to be delivered semi-annually by Borrower to Agent pursuant to SECTION
6.2(e)), the party requesting the issuance of such Reserve Report shall pay the
costs and expenses associated therewith in the absence of a continuing Default
or Event of Default (and during a continuing Default or Event of Default, such
Reserve Report shall be at Borrower's sole cost and expense).

          2.12 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

               (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Issuing Lender agrees to issue letters of credit for the account of Borrower
(each, an "L/C") or to purchase participations or execute indemnities or
reimbursement obligations (each such undertaking, an "L/C UNDERTAKING") with
respect to letters of credit issued by an Underlying Issuer (as of the Closing
Date, the prospective Underlying Issuer is to be Wells Fargo) for the account of
Borrower. To request the issuance of an L/C or an L/C Undertaking (or the
amendment, renewal, or extension of an outstanding L/C or L/C Undertaking),
Borrower shall

                                      -47-
<Page>

hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Lender) to the
Issuing Lender and Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of
issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of
an L/C or L/C Undertaking, or identifying the L/C or L/C Undertaking to be
amended, renewed, or extended, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or
extension, the date on which such L/C or L/C Undertaking is to expire, the
amount of such L/C or L/C Undertaking, the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof (or the beneficiary of the Underlying Letter of Credit, as applicable),
and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or
extend such L/C or L/C Undertaking. If requested by the Issuing Lender, Borrower
also shall be an applicant under the application with respect to any Underlying
Letter of Credit that is to be the subject of an L/C Undertaking. The Issuing
Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any of the
following would result after giving effect to the requested Letter of Credit:

                    (i)    the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing
     Base LESS the amount of outstanding Advances, or

                    (ii)   the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $10,000,000,

     or

                    (iii)  the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum
     Revolver Amount LESS the then extant amount of outstanding Advances, or

                    (iv)   an Indenture Deficit would exist.

          Borrower and the Lender Group acknowledge and agree that certain
Underlying Letters of Credit may be issued to support letters of credit that
already are outstanding as of the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit (and
corresponding Underlying Letter of Credit) shall be in form and substance
acceptable to the Issuing Lender (in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion),
including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in
Dollars. If Issuing Lender is obligated to advance funds under a Letter of
Credit, Borrower immediately shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement to Issuing
Lender by paying to Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later
than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the date that such L/C Disbursement is
made, if Borrower shall have received written or telephonic notice of such L/C
Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., California time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by Borrower prior to such time on such date, then
not later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the Business Day that Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., California
time, on the date of receipt, and, in the absence of such reimbursement, the L/C
Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be an Advance
hereunder and, thereafter, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to
Advances that are Base Rate Loans under SECTION 2.6. To the extent an L/C
Disbursement is deemed to be an Advance hereunder, Borrower's obligation to
reimburse such L/C Disbursement shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting Advance. Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment to the
Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Revolving Loan Lenders have made payments
pursuant to SECTION 2.12(c) to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such
Revolving Loan Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interest may appear.

                                      -48-
<Page>

               (b)  Promptly following receipt of a notice of L/C Disbursement
pursuant to SECTION 2.12(a), each Revolving Loan Lender agrees to fund its Pro
Rata Share of any Advance deemed made pursuant to the foregoing subsection on
the same terms and conditions as if Borrower had requested such Advance and
Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from
the Revolving Loan Lenders. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Revolving Loan Lenders,
the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Loan
Lender, and each Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a
participation in each Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share
of the Risk Participation Liability of such Letter of Credit, and each such
Revolving Loan Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of the Issuing
Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments made by the Issuing Lender
under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Loan Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Revolving
Loan Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender
and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided in clause (a) of this
Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to Borrower for
any reason. Each Revolving Loan Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, an amount
equal to its respective Pro Rata Share pursuant to this SECTION 2.12(b) shall be
absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the
occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in SECTION 3 hereof. If any such Revolving Loan
Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Revolving Loan
Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments made by the Issuing Lender in respect of
such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section, Agent (for the account of the
Issuing Lender) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
Revolving Loan Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender
Rate until paid in full.

               (c)  Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and hold
the Lender Group harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Lender Group arising out of or in
connection with any Letter of Credit; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Borrower shall not
be obligated hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability
that is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing
Lender or any other member of the Lender Group. Borrower agrees to be bound by
the Underlying Issuer's regulations and interpretations of any Underlying Letter
of Credit or by Issuing Lender's interpretations of any L/C issued by Issuing
Lender to or for Borrower's account, even though this interpretation may be
different from Borrower's own, and Borrower understands and agrees that the
Lender Group shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether
of omission or commission, in following Borrower's instructions or those
contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or
supplements thereto. Borrower understands that the L/C Undertakings may require
Issuing Lender to indemnify the Underlying Issuer for certain costs or
liabilities arising out of claims by Borrower against such Underlying Issuer.
Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and hold the Lender Group
harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense (including reasonable attorneys
fees), or liability incurred by the Lender Group under any L/C Undertaking as a
result of the Lender Group's indemnification of any Underlying Issuer; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Borrower shall not be obligated hereunder to

                                      -49-
<Page>

indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that is caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender or any other member of
the Lender Group.

               (d)  Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any Underlying Issuer
to deliver to the Issuing Lender all instruments, documents, and other writings
and property received by such Underlying Issuer pursuant to such Underlying
Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon the Issuing Lender's instructions
with respect to all matters arising in connection with such Underlying Letter of
Credit and the related application.

               (e)  Any and all charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred
by the Issuing Lender relating to Underlying Letters of Credit shall be Lender
Group Expenses for purposes of this Agreement and immediately shall be
reimbursable by Borrower to Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender; it
being acknowledged and agreed by Borrower that, as of the Closing Date, the
issuance charge imposed by the prospective Underlying Issuer is .825% per annum
times the face amount of each Underlying Letter of Credit, that such issuance
charge may be changed from time to time, and that the Underlying Issuer also
imposes a schedule of charges for amendments, extensions, drawings, and
renewals.

               (f)  If by reason of (i) any change in any applicable law,
treaty, rule, or regulation or any change in the interpretation or application
thereof by any Governmental Authority, or (ii) compliance by the Underlying
Issuer or the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement
(irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority
or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as
from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):

                    (i)    any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or
     shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued
     hereunder, or

                    (ii)   there shall be imposed on the Underlying Issuer or
     the Lender Group any other condition regarding any Underlying Letter of
     Credit or any Letter of Credit issued pursuant hereto,

and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost
to the Lender Group of issuing, making, guaranteeing, or maintaining any Letter
of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof by the Lender
Group, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable
period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced,
notify Borrower, and Borrower shall pay on demand such amounts as Agent may
specify to be necessary to compensate the Lender Group for such additional cost
or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such
demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate
Loans hereunder. The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this
Section, as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in
reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be
final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

          2.13 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If, after the date hereof, any Lender
determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or
guideline regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or
any change in the interpretation or

                                      -50-
<Page>

application thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration thereof, or (ii) compliance by such Lender or its parent bank
holding company with any guideline, request, or directive of any such entity
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law), the effect
of reducing the return on such Lender's or such holding company's capital as a
consequence of such Lender's Commitments hereunder to a level below that which
such Lender or such holding company could have achieved but for such adoption,
change, or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such holding
company's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming
the full utilization of such entity's capital) by any amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then such Lender may notify Borrower and Agent thereof.
Following receipt of such notice, Borrower agrees to pay such Lender on demand
the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is
determined, payable within 90 days after presentation by such Lender of a
statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail such Lender's
calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based
 (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error). In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

          2.14 REGISTERED NOTES. Borrower agrees to record the Term Loan and
each Advance on the Register referred to in SECTION 14.1(h). The Term Loan and
each Advance recorded on the Register (the "REGISTERED LOAN") may not be
evidenced by promissory notes other than Registered Notes (as defined below).
Upon the registration of the Term Loan or any Advance, Borrower agrees, at the
request of any Lender, to execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note,
in conformity with the terms of this Agreement, in registered form to evidence
such Registered Loan, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent and
such Lender, and registered as provided in SECTION 14.1(h) (a "REGISTERED
NOTE"), payable to the order of such Lender and otherwise duly completed,
provided that any Registered Note issued to evidence Advances shall be issued in
the principal amount of the applicable Lender's Revolver Commitment. Once
recorded on the Register, the Term Loan and each Advance may not be removed from
the Register so long as it or they remain outstanding, and a Registered Note may
not be exchanged for a promissory note that is not a Registered Note.

          3.2  CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL EXTENSION OF CREDIT. The
obligation of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to continue to make
Advances (or otherwise extend credit hereunder) is subject to the fulfillment,
on or before the date applicable thereto, of each of the conditions subsequent
set forth below (the failure by Borrower to so perform or cause to be performed
constituting an Event of Default):

               (a)  within 30 days of the Closing Date, deliver to Agent
certified copies of the policies of insurance, together with the endorsements

such evidence); (B) Borrower is being paid 100% of the oil and gas production

satisfactory form of such evidence), and (C) the owners of the oil and gas
leasehold estate are being paid on the interests shown in such Opinion (it being

          3.3  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ALL EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT. The obligation
of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to make all Advances (or to extend
any other credit hereunder) shall be subject to the following conditions
precedent:

               (a)  the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as though made on
and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and
warranties relate solely to an earlier date),

               (b)  no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from
the making thereof,

               (c)  no injunction, writ, restraining order, or other order of
any nature prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the extending of such credit
shall have been issued and remain in force by any Governmental Authority against

          3.4  TERM. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution
and delivery hereof by Borrower, Agent, and the Lenders and shall continue in
full force and effect for a term ending on January 22, 2006 (the "MATURITY
DATE"). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Lender Group, upon the election of
the Required Lenders, shall have the right to terminate its obligations under
this Agreement immediately and without notice upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default.

          3.5  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. On the date of termination of this
Agreement, all Obligations (including contingent reimbursement obligations of
Borrower with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit and including all Bank
Products Obligations) immediately shall become due and payable without notice or
demand (including (a) either (i) providing cash collateral to be held by Agent
in an amount equal to 105% of the then extant Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii)
causing the original Letters of Credit to be returned to Lender and (b)
providing cash

                                      -57-
<Page>

collateral, in such amounts as Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, as applicable,
requires from its customers generally with respect to such products, to be held
by Agent for the benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates with respect to the
then extant Bank Products Obligations). No termination of this Agreement,
however, shall relieve or discharge Borrower of its duties, Obligations, or
covenants hereunder and Agent's Liens in the Collateral shall remain in effect
until all Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and Lenders'
obligations to provide additional credit hereunder have been terminated. When
this Agreement has been terminated and all of the Obligations have been fully
and finally discharged and Lenders' obligations to provide additional credit
under the Loan Documents have been terminated irrevocably, Agent will, at
Borrower's sole expense, execute and deliver any UCC termination statements,
lien releases, mortgage releases, re-assignments of trademarks, discharges of
security interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if
applicable, in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary to release, as of
record, Agent's Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously
filed by Lender with respect to the Obligations.

          3.6  EARLY TERMINATION BY BORROWER. Borrower has the option, at any
time upon 90 days' prior written notice to Lender, to terminate this Agreement
by paying to Agent, in cash, the Obligations (including (a) either (i) providing
cash collateral to be held by Agent in an amount equal to 105% of the then
extant Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original Letters of Credit to
be returned to Agent, and (b) providing cash collateral, in such amounts as
Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, as applicable, requires from its customers
generally with respect to such products, to be held by Agent for the benefit of
Wells Fargo or its Affiliates with respect to the then extant Bank Products
Obligations), in full, together with the Applicable Prepayment Premium. If
Borrower has sent a notice of termination pursuant to the provisions of this
Section, then Lenders' obligations to extend credit hereunder shall terminate
and Borrower shall be obligated to repay the Obligations (including (a) either
(i) providing cash collateral to be held by Agent (in an interest-bearing
account) in an amount equal to 105% of the then extant Letter of Credit Usage,
or (ii) causing the original Letters of Credit to be returned to Agent, and (b)
providing cash collateral, in such amounts as Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, as
applicable, requires from its customers generally with respect to such products,
to be held by Agent for the benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates with
respect to the then extant Bank Products Obligations), in full, together with
the Applicable Prepayment Premium, on the date set forth as the date of
termination of this Agreement in such notice. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement and repayment of the Revolving Loan Obligations at any time prior
to the Maturity Date, for any other reason, including (a) termination upon the
election of the Required Lenders to terminate after the occurrence of an Event
of Default, (b) foreclosure and sale of Collateral, (c) sale of the Collateral
in any Insolvency Proceeding, or (d) restructure, reorganization, or compromise
of the Obligations by the confirmation of a plan of reorganization or any other
plan of compromise, restructure, or arrangement in any Insolvency Proceeding,
then, in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining the
actual amount of damages to Lenders or profits lost by the Revolving Loan
Lenders as a result of such early termination, and by mutual agreement of the
parties as to a reasonable estimation and calculation of the lost profits or
damages of the Revolving Loan Lenders, Borrower shall pay the Applicable
Prepayment Premium to the Revolving Loan Lenders, measured as of the date of
such termination, provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall
not be obligated to pay the Applicable Prepayment Premium if the termination of
this Agreement and repayment of the Revolving Loan Obligations at any time prior
to the Maturity Date is from the proceeds received by Borrower pursuant to (x) a
public or private placement of

                                      -58-
<Page>

stock (including a placement in the form of a merger) or subordinated
indebtedness of any Loan Party, (y) a sale of assets of any Loan Party or (z) a
financing facility provided by Wells Fargo. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement, Borrower shall not repay any Term Loan Obligation unless and
until all of the Revolving Loan Obligations have been paid in full, all Letters
of Credit have been terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver
Commitments have been terminated.

     4.   CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

          4.1  GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. Each Domestic Loan Party hereby
grants to Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group, a continuing security
interest in all of its right, title, and interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Personal Property Collateral in order to secure
prompt repayment of any and all of the Obligations or the Guaranteed Obligations
(as the case may be) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Loan
Documents and in order to secure prompt performance by each such Domestic Loan
Party of each of its covenants and duties under the Loan Documents. The Agent's
Liens in and to the Personal Property Collateral shall attach to all Personal
Property Collateral without further act on the part of Agent or any Domestic
Loan Party. Anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to
the contrary notwithstanding, except for Permitted Dispositions, no Domestic
Loan Party shall have authority, express or implied, to dispose of any item or
portion of the Collateral.

          4.2  NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any Collateral,
including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable Collateral, and if
and to the extent that perfection or priority of Agent's security interest is
dependent on or enhanced by possession, each Domestic Loan Party, immediately
upon the request of Agent, shall endorse and deliver physical possession of such
Negotiable Collateral to Agent.

          4.3  COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND NEGOTIABLE
COLLATERAL. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Agent or Agent's designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of
any Loan Party that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles have
been assigned to Agent or that Agent has a security interest therein, or (b)
collect the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly and charge
the collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account. Each Domestic Loan Party

Collections that it receives and immediately will deliver said Collections to
Agent or a Cash Management Bank in their original form as received by Borrower.

claims after the date hereof, such Domestic Loan Party shall promptly deliver to
Agent a written description of such commercial tort claim and, upon request of
Agent, shall deliver a written agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent, pursuant to which such Domestic Loan Party shall pledge
and collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such
commercial tort claim to Agent as security for the Obligations or the Guaranteed
Obligations, as the case may be (each, a "COMMERCIAL TORT CLAIM ASSIGNMENT").

               (c)  At any time upon the request of Agent, each Domestic Loan
Party shall execute and deliver to Agent, and cause its Subsidiaries to execute
and deliver to Agent, any and all financing statements, original financing
statements in lieu of continuation statements, amendments to financing
statements, fixture filings, security agreements, pledges, assignments,
Commercial Tort Claim Assignments, endorsements of certificates of title, and
all other documents (collectively, the "ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS") that Agent may
request in its Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent, to create and perfect and continue perfected or better
perfect the Agent's Liens in the Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter
acquitted, tangible or intangible, real or personal), and in order to fully
consummate all of the transactions contemplated hereby and under the other Loan
Documents, including any Mortgages.

               (d)  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each

any such Additional Documents without the signature of such Domestic Loan Party
in any appropriate filing office. Agent will promptly provide Borrower with a
copy of any Additional Documents. In addition, on such periodic basis as Agent
shall require and to the extent any Domestic Loan Party acquires or generates
any Collateral described in the following clauses (i) and (ii), such Domestic
Loan Party shall (i) provide Agent with a report of all new patentable,
copyrightable, or trademarkable materials acquired or generated by such Domestic
Loan Party during the prior period, (ii) cause all patents, copyrights, and
trademarks acquired or generated by such Domestic Loan Party that are not
already the subject of a registration with the appropriate filing office (or an
application therefor diligently prosecuted) to be registered with such
appropriate filing office in a manner sufficient to impart constructive notice
of such Domestic Loan Party's ownership thereof, and (iii) cause to be prepared,
executed, and delivered to Agent supplemental schedules to the applicable Loan
Documents to identify such patents, copyrights, and trademarks as being subject
to the security interests created thereunder.

          4.5  POWER OF ATTORNEY. Each Domestic Loan Party hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Agent (and any of Agent's officers, employees,
or agents designated by Agent) as such Domestic Loan Party's true and lawful
attorney, with power to (a) if such Domestic Loan Party refuses to, or fails
timely to execute and deliver any of the documents described in SECTION 4.4,
sign the name of such Domestic Loan Party on any of the documents described in

continuing, sign such Domestic Loan Party's name on any invoice or bill of
lading relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or notices to
Account Debtors, (c) send requests for verification of

                                      -60-

adjust disputes and claims respecting the Accounts, chattel paper, or General
Intangibles directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and upon terms that Agent
determines to be reasonable, and Agent may cause to be executed and delivered
any documents and releases that Agent determines to be necessary. The
appointment of Agent as such Domestic Loan Party's attorney, and each and every
one of its rights and powers, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable
until all of the Obligations have been fully and finally repaid and performed
and the Lender Group's obligations to extend credit hereunder are terminated.

          4.6  RIGHT TO INSPECT. Agent and each Lender (through any of their
respective officers, employees, or agents) shall have the right, upon notice to
Borrower, which notice shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, from time to time hereafter to inspect the
Books and to check, test, and appraise the Collateral and review and examine the
Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower in order to verify Borrower's or any
Guarantor's financial condition or the amount, quality, value, condition of, or
any other matter relating to, the Collateral.

          4.7  CONTROL AGREEMENTS. Each Domestic Loan Party agrees that it will
not transfer assets out of any Securities Accounts other than as permitted under
SECTION 7.19 and, if to another securities intermediary, unless each such
Domestic Loan Party, Agent, and the substitute securities intermediary have
entered into a Control Agreement. Each Domestic Loan Party hereby agrees to take
any and all action that Agent requests in order for Agent to obtain control in
accordance with Sections 9-104, 9-105, 9-106 and 9-107 of the Code with respect
to any Securities Accounts, DDA's, chattel paper, Investment Property and
letter-of-credit rights. No arrangement contemplated hereby or by any Control
Agreement in respect of any Securities Accounts or other Investment Property or
any DDA, electronic chattel paper or letter-of-credit rights shall be modified
by any Domestic Loan Party without the prior written consent of Agent. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, Agent
may notify any securities intermediary or depository to liquidate the applicable
Securities Account or any related Investment Property maintained or held thereby
and remit the proceeds thereof to the Agent's Account.

<Page>

with respect to Borrower (or Guarantor, as applicable) since the date of the

          5.10 FRAUDULENT TRANSFER.

               (a)  After giving effect to the Restructuring and the initial

individually is, and the Loan Parties taken as a whole are, Solvent.

               (b)  No transfer of property is being made by any Loan Party and

Loan Party and each ERISA Affiliate has satisfied the minimum funding standards

other federal, provincial or state governmental agency concerning any action or
omission by Borrower resulting in the releasing or disposing of Hazardous
Materials into the environment.

          5.13 BROKERAGE FEES. Other than Jefferies & Company, Inc., no Loan
Party has utilized the services of any broker or finder in connection with

by any Loan Party in connection herewith.

Loan Party is the owner or is an exclusive licensee.

          5.15 LEASES. Each Loan Party enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all leases material to the business of such Loan Party and to
which it is a party or under which it is operating. All of such leases are valid
and subsisting and no material default by such Loan Party exists under any of
them. There are no leases, subleases, contracts or other operating agreements
that allocate operating expenses to Borrower or any Guarantor in excess of
Borrower's or any Guarantor's working interest of record in the particular Oil
and Gas Property subject to such lease, the sublease, contract or other
operating agreement.

          5.16 DDAs. Set forth on Schedule 5.16 are all of each Loan Party's
DDAs, including, with respect to each depository (i) the name and address of
such depository, and (ii) the account numbers of the accounts maintained with
such depository.

          5.17 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. No Loan Party has violated any laws or
failed to obtain any material license, permit, franchise or other authorization
from any Governmental Authority necessary for the ownership of any of its Oil
and Gas Properties or the conduct of its business. The Oil and Gas Properties of
each Loan Party (and assets and properties utilized therewith) have been
maintained, operated and developed in a good and workmanlike manner and in
substantial conformity with all applicable laws and all rules, regulations and
orders of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction and in substantial
conformity with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts
comprising a part of the Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and
agreements forming a part of such Oil and Gas Properties; specifically in this
connection, (i) except as set forth on Schedule 5.17, after the Closing Date, no
Oil and Gas Property of any Loan Party is subject to having allowable production
reduced below the full and regular allowable production (including the maximum
permissible tolerance) because of any overproduction (whether or not the same
was permissible at the time) prior to the Closing Date and (ii) none of the
wells comprising a part of such Oil and Gas Properties (or assets and properties
utilized therewith) is deviated from the vertical by more than the maximum
permitted by applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders of any Governmental
Authority, and such wells are, in fact, bottomed under and are producing from,
and the well bores are wholly within, such Oil and Gas Properties (or in the
case of wells located on Real Property utilized therewith, such utilized Real
Property) covered by the leases that are the subject of the title opinions
delivered pursuant to SECTION 3.1(u).

          5.18 COMPLETE DISCLOSURE. All factual information (taken as a whole)

(including all information contained in the Schedules hereto or in the other
Loan Documents) for purposes of or in connection with the Restructuring or this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any transaction contemplated herein or
therein is, and all other such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter
furnished by or on behalf of Borrower in writing to Agent or any Lender will be,
true and accurate, in all material respects, on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any
fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any
material respect at such time in light of the circumstances under which such
information was provided. On the Closing Date, the Closing Date Projections
represent, and as of the date on which

                                      -66-
<Page>

any other Projections are delivered to Agent, such additional Projections
represent Borrower's good faith best estimate of its future performance for the
periods covered thereby.

          5.19 INDEBTEDNESS. Set forth on Schedule 5.19 is a true and complete
list of all Indebtedness of each Loan Party outstanding on or immediately prior
to the Closing Date that is to remain outstanding after the Closing Date and
such Schedule accurately reflects the aggregate principal amount of such
Indebtedness and the principal terms thereof.

          5.20 OIL AND GAS IMBALANCES. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.20 or
on the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to SECTION 6.2(e), on a net
basis there are not gas imbalances, take-or-pay oil and gas or other prepayments
with respect to Borrower's and Guarantors' Oil and Gas Properties which would
require such Person either to make cash settlements for such production or
deliver Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties at some future
time without then or thereafter receiving full payments therefor exceeding two
percent (2%) of the current monthly production of oil and gas from the Oil and
Gas Properties of Borrower and Guarantors in the aggregate.

          5.21 HEDGING AGREEMENTS. Schedule 5.21 (which schedule, so long as a
Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is not continuing, shall be
deemed to be amended by the most recent certificate delivered by Borrower
pursuant to SECTION 6.2(d)) sets forth, as of the Closing Date, a true and
complete list of all Hedging Agreements (including commodity price swap
agreements, forward agreements or contracts of sale which provide for prepayment
for deferred shipment or delivery of Hydrocarbons or other commodities) of
Borrower and Guarantors, the material terms thereof (including the type, term,
effective date, termination date and notional amounts or volumes), all credit
support agreements relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied),
and the counterparty to each such agreement.

          5.22 LOCATION OF REAL PROPERTY AND LEASED PREMISES.

               (a)  (i) Part A of Schedule 5.22 lists completely and correctly
as of the Closing Date all Real Property (other than Oil and Gas Properties)
owned in fee by each Loan Party and the addresses thereof, (ii) Part B of
Schedule 5.22 lists completely and correctly as of the Closing Date all Real
Property (other than Oil and Gas Properties) leased by each Loan Party and the
respective addresses thereof and (iii) Part C of Schedule 5.22 lists completely
and correctly as of the Closing Date all Oil and Gas Properties that are Real
Property whether leased or owned by any Loan Party and the respective addresses
(if any), counties and states thereof.

               (b)  As of the Closing Date, each Loan Party has valid leasehold
interests in the leases described on Schedule 5.22 and such schedule sets forth
with respect to each such lease, the commencement date, termination date,
renewal options (if any) and annual base rents. Each such lease is valid and
enforceable in accordance with its terms in all material respects and is in full
force and effect. No consent or approval of any landlord or other third party in
connection with any such lease is necessary for any Loan Party to enter into and
execute the Loan Documents to which it is a party, except as set forth on
Schedule 5.22. To the knowledge of any Loan Party, no other party to any such
lease is in default of its obligations thereunder, and no Loan Party (or any
other party to any such lease) has at any time delivered or received any notice
of default which remains uncured under any such lease and, as of the Closing

                                      -67-
<Page>

Date, no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of
time or both, would constitute a default under any such lease.

               (c)  Each Loan Party has good and defensible title to all of its
Oil and Gas Properties set forth on Schedule 5.22 which constitute Real Property
and good and indefeasible title to all of its Oil and Gas Properties which
constitute personal property, except for (i) such imperfections of title which
do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value thereof to, or the use
thereof in, the business of such Loan Party and (ii) Permitted Liens. The
quantum and nature of the interest of such Loan Party in and to the Oil and Gas
Properties as set forth in the Initial Reserve Report or the most recent Reserve
Report, as the case may be, includes the entire interest of such Loan Party in
such Oil and Gas Properties as of the date of the Initial Reserve Report or such
applicable Reserve Report delivered by Borrower to Agent pursuant to SECTION
6.2(e), as the case may be, and are complete and accurate in all material
respects as of the date of the Initial Reserve Report or such applicable Reserve
Report, as the case may be; and there are no "back-in" or "reversionary"
interests held by third parties which could materially reduce the interest of
such Loan Party in such Oil and Gas Properties except as expressly set forth in
the Initial Reserve Report or the most recent Reserve Report, as the case may
be. The ownership of the Oil and Gas Properties by each Loan Party shall not in
any material respect obligate any such Loan Party to bear the costs and expenses
relating to the maintenance, development or operations of each such Oil and Gas
Property in an amount in excess of the working interest of record of such Loan
Party in each Oil and Gas Property set forth in the Initial Reserve Report or
the most recent Reserve Report, as the case may be.

               (d)  Each Loan Party's marketing, gathering, transportation,
processing and treating facilities and equipment, together with any marketing,
gathering, transportation, processing and treating contracts in effect between

and the Term Loan made by the Lenders on and after the Closing Date and (ii) the
issuance of Letters of Credit, in each case, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, does not conflict with or result in a default under any
New Notes Document.

               (b)  Other than Borrower's Indebtedness which may be incurred
under the Loan Documents, the Loan Parties have not created, incurred, assumed,

terms, (ii) has not

                                      -68-

licenses, authorizations, approvals, entitlements and accreditations the absence
of which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change. No condition exists or event has occurred which, in itself or with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would result in the suspension,
revocation, impairment, forfeiture or non-renewal of any such permit, license,
authorization, approval, entitlement or accreditation, and to Borrower's

provincial law, which remains unpaid or unsatisfied. The hours worked and
payments made to employees of each Loan Party have not been in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, the applicable Canadian provincial employment
standards legislation or any other applicable legal requirements. All material
payments due from any Loan Party on account of workers compensation, wages and
employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been paid or
accrued as a liability on the books of such Loan Party.

          5.27 BONDS AND INSURANCE. Schedule 5.27 attached hereto contains an
accurate and complete description of all performance bonds related to operations

Schedule 5.27, all such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums with
respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the Closing Date have
been paid, and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with
respect to any such policy. Such bonds and policies are sufficient for
compliance with all requirements of law and of all agreements to which Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; are valid, outstanding and enforceable
policies; provide adequate coverage in at least such amounts and against at
least such risks (but including in any event public liability) as are required

and will not in any way be affected by, or terminate or lapse by reason of, the
transactions contemplated by this agreement. Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been refused any bonds or insurance with respect

                                      -69-

customary bond or policy limits, by any bonding company or insurance carrier to
which it has applied for any such bond or insurance or with which it has carried
insurance during the last three years.

          5.28 NATURE OF BUSINESS. Neither Borrower nor Newco Canada is engaged
in any business other than the Oil and Gas Business within the continental
United States, in the case of Borrower, and Canada, in the case of Newco Canada.
Except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.28, no other Loan Party (x) owns any
assets or properties used by Borrower or Newco Canada in its Oil and Gas
Business, and (y) has any liabilities or conducts any business.

<Page>

material properties to be operated on a continuous basis for the production of
Hydrocarbons and in a careful and efficient manner in accordance with the usual
and customary practices of the industry and in substantial compliance with all
applicable contracts and agreements and in compliance in all material respects
with all material laws.

               (e)  Operate and produce, as a reasonably prudent operator, the
Oil and Gas Properties of the Loan Parties in accordance with good engineering
practices and the following requirements: (i) the amount of Hydrocarbons

except to the extent that the validity of such Tax Payment shall be the subject
of a Permitted Protest. Each Loan Party will make timely payment or deposit of
all Tax Payments required of it by applicable laws, including those laws
concerning F.I.C.A., F.U.T.A., state disability, and local, state, and federal
income taxes, and will, upon request, furnish Agent with proof satisfactory to
Agent indicating that each such Loan Party has made such Tax Payments or
deposits. Borrower shall deliver satisfactory evidence of payment of applicable

such excise tax.

          6.7  INSURANCE.

criminal misappropriation to the extent Borrower maintains such insurance on the
Closing Date or is otherwise required by Agent, in its reasonable discretion, to
maintain such insurance after the Closing Date to the extent the premiums

of insurance shall be in such amounts and

                                      -76-
<Page>

with such insurance companies as are reasonably satisfactory to Agent. Borrower
shall deliver copies of all such policies to Agent with a satisfactory lender's
loss payable endorsement naming Agent as sole loss payee or additional insured,
as appropriate. Each policy of insurance or endorsement shall contain a clause
requiring the insurer to give not less than 30 days' prior written notice to

                    (iv)   (A) if during any calendar quarter the amount of
     Capital Expenditures of Borrower and its Subsidiaries exceeds the amounts
     permitted by clause (i) or (ii) above (such excess amount hereinafter
     referred to as the "EXCESS AMOUNT"), the aggregate Capital Expenditures for
     the two succeeding calendar quarters thereafter shall be decreased by an
     aggregate amount equal to such Excess Amount, and (B) if during any
     calendar quarter the amount of Capital Expenditures of Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries permitted by clause (i) or (ii) above is not utilized during
     the applicable calendar quarter (such unutilized amount hereinafter
     referred to as the "UNUSED AMOUNT"), the aggregate Capital Expenditures for
     the two succeeding calendar quarters thereafter shall be increased by an
     aggregate amount equal to such Unused Amount, PROVIDED that in any such
     subsequent calendar quarters, actual Capital Expenditures made from time to
     time in such calendar quarters shall be deemed to be made (and utilized)
     from the amount permitted above for such calendar quarters (without giving
     effect to any Unused

                                      -85-

     Amount), and then to be made (and utilized) from the remaining (if any)
     portion of the Unused Amount.

                    (v)    Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in no event
     shall the amount of Capital Expenditures of Borrower and its Subsidiaries
     during any period exceed the amount of Capital Expenditures permitted to be
     made by Borrower and its Subsidiaries under the New Notes Indenture.

               (c)  NET CASH INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. Permit the Net Cash
Interest Coverage Ratio of Borrower and its Subsidiaries to be less than the

Lien, whether choate or otherwise, upon any of Borrower's or any of its

          8.8  If a judgment or other claim in excess of $50,000 (to the extent

     9.   THE LENDER GROUP'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

          9.1  RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence, and during the
continuation, of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders (at their election
but without notice of their election and without demand) may authorize and
instruct Agent to do any one or more of the following on

                                      -88-
<Page>

behalf of the Lender Group (and Agent, acting upon the instructions of the
Required Lenders, shall do the same on behalf of the Lender Group), all of which
are authorized by Borrower:

               (a)  Declare all Obligations, whether evidenced by this
Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due and
payable;

               (b)  Cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the
benefit of Borrower under this Agreement, under any of the Loan Documents, or
under any other agreement between Borrower and the Lender Group;

               (c)  Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents
as to any future liability or obligation of the Lender Group, but without
affecting any of the Agent's Liens in the Collateral and without affecting the
Obligations;

               (d)  Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with Account
Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Agent considers advisable, and in such
cases, Agent will credit Borrower's Loan Account with only the net amounts
received by Agent in payment of such disputed Accounts after deducting all
Lender Group Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

               (e)  Without notice to or demand upon Borrower or Guarantor, make
such payments and do such acts as Agent considers necessary or reasonable to
protect its security interests in the Collateral. Borrower agrees to assemble
the Personal Property Collateral if Agent so requires, and to make the Personal
Property Collateral available to Agent at a place that Agent may designate which
is reasonably convenient to both parties. Borrower authorizes Agent to enter the
premises where the Personal Property Collateral is located, to take and maintain
possession of the Personal Property Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay,
purchase, contest, or compromise any Lien that in Agent's determination appears
to conflict with the Agent's Liens and to pay all reasonable expenses incurred
in connection therewith and to charge Borrower's Loan Account therefor. With
respect to any of Borrower's owned or leased premises, Borrower hereby grants
Agent a license to enter into possession of such premises and to occupy the
same, without charge, in order to exercise any of the Lender Group's rights or
remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

               (f)  Without notice to Borrower (such notice being expressly
waived), and without constituting a retention of any collateral in satisfaction
of an obligation (within the meaning of the Code), set off and apply to the
Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of Borrower held by the Lender
Group (including any amounts received in the Cash Management Accounts), or (ii)
Indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit or the account of Borrower
held by the Lender Group;

               (g)  Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits
of Borrower held by the Lender Group, and any amounts received in the Cash
Management Accounts or the Concentration Account, to secure the full and final
repayment of all of the Obligations and apply, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, such cash collateral to repay the Obligations;

                                      -89-
<Page>

               (h)  Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair,
prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided for
herein) the Personal Property Collateral. Borrower hereby grants to Agent a
license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower's labels, patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and
advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the
Personal Property Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale,
and selling any Personal Property Collateral and Borrower's rights under all
licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Lender Group's benefit;

               (i)  Sell the Personal Property Collateral at either a public or
private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash
or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including Borrower's premises)
as Agent determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the
Personal Property Collateral be present at any such sale;

               (j)  Agent shall give notice of the disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as follows:

                    (i)    Agent shall give Borrower a notice in writing of the
     time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale or some
     other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the Personal
     Property Collateral, the time on or after which the private sale or other
     disposition is to be made; and

                    (ii)   The notice shall be personally delivered or mailed,
     postage prepaid, to Borrower as provided in SECTION 12, at least 10 days
     before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no notice
     needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the Personal
     Property Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in
     value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

               (k)  Agent, on behalf of the Lender Group, may credit bid and
purchase at any public sale;

               (l)  Agent may seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to
take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate same and,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of such a
receiver without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

               (m)  Agent, on behalf of the Lender Group, may foreclose any or
all of the Mortgages and sell the Real Property or cause the Real Property to be
sold in accordance with the provisions of the Mortgages and applicable law, and
exercise any and all other rights or remedies available to Agent, on behalf of
the Lender Group, under the Mortgages, any of the other Loan Documents, at law
or in equity with respect to the Collateral encumbered by the Mortgages;

               (n)  The Lender Group shall have all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document; and

                                      -90-
<Page>

               (o)  Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by Borrower. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Agent to Borrower.

          9.2  REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. The rights and remedies of the Lender Group
under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall
be cumulative. The Lender Group shall have all other rights and remedies not
inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No
exercise by the Lender Group of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election,
and no waiver by the Lender Group of any Event of Default shall be deemed a
continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender Group shall constitute a waiver,
election, or acquiescence by it.

     10.  TAXES AND EXPENSES.

          If any Loan Party fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, assessments,
remittances, source deductions, insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased
properties or assets, rents or other amounts payable under such leases) due to
third Persons, or fails to make any deposits or furnish any required proof of
payment or deposit, all as required under the terms of this Agreement, then,
Agent, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to any Loan Party, may do
any or all of the following: (a) make payment of the same or any part thereof,
(b) set up such reserves in Borrower's Loan Account as Agent deems necessary to
protect the Lender Group from the exposure created by such failure, or (c) in
the case of the failure to comply with SECTION 6.7 hereof, obtain and maintain
insurance policies of the type described in SECTION 6.7 and take any action with
respect to such policies as Agent deems prudent. Any such amounts paid by Agent
shall constitute Lender Group Expenses and any such payments shall not
constitute an agreement by the Lender Group to make similar payments in the
future or a waiver by the Lender Group of any Event of Default under this
Agreement. Agent need not inquire as to, or contest the validity of, any such
expense, tax, or Lien and the receipt of the usual official notice for the
payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the same was validly due and
owing.

     11.  WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

          11.1 DEMAND; PROTEST; ETC. Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of
protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment,
nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal
of documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by the
Lender Group on which Borrower may in any way be liable.

          11.2 THE LENDER GROUP'S LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. Borrower hereby
agrees that: (a) so long as Agent complies with its obligations, if any, under
the Code, the Lender Group shall not in any way or manner be liable or
responsible for: (i) the safekeeping of the Collateral, (ii) any loss or damage
thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause, (iii) any
diminution in the value thereof, or (iv) any act or default of any carrier,
warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and (b) all risk of
loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by Borrower.

                                      -91-
<Page>

          11.3 INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower shall pay, indemnify, defend, and hold
the Agent-Related Persons, the Lender-Related Persons with respect to each
Lender, each Participant (subject to SECTION 14.1(e)(v)), and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact (each,
an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from
and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations,
proceedings, and damages, and all reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements
and other costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith (as and
when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time
asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection
with or as a result of or related to the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance, or administration of this Agreement, any of the other Loan
Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (b) with
respect to any investigation, litigation, or proceeding related to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the use of the proceeds of the credit
provided hereunder (irrespective of whether any Indemnified Person is a party
thereto), or any act, omission, event, or circumstance in any manner related
thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"). The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower shall have no obligation to
any Indemnified Person under this SECTION 11.3 with respect to any Indemnified
Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment of the Obligations. If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any
other Indemnified Person with respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which
Borrower was required to indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such
payment, the Indemnified Person making such payment is entitled to be
indemnified and reimbursed by Borrower with respect thereto. WITHOUT LIMITATION,
THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO
INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY
NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

     12.  NOTICES.

          Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices or demands by
Borrower or Agent to the other relating to this Agreement or any other Loan

     14.  ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS; SUCCESSORS.

          14.1 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

               (a)  Any Lender may, with the written consent of Agent (provided
that no written consent of Agent shall be required in connection with any
assignment and delegation by a Lender to an Eligible Transferee), assign and
delegate to one or more assignees (each an "ASSIGNEE") all, or any part of all,
of the Obligations, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations of such
Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, in a minimum amount of
$5,000,000 (except such minimum amount shall not apply to any Term Loan Lender
or any Affiliate of a Lender or to a Related Fund or account managed by a
Lender); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Borrower and Agent may continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an
Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with payment
instructions, addresses, and related information with respect to the Assignee,
have been given to Borrower and Agent by such Lender and the Assignee, (ii) such
Lender and its Assignee have delivered to Borrower and Agent a fully executed
Assignment and Acceptance, and (iii) the assignor Lender or Assignee has paid to
Agent for Agent's separate account a processing fee in the amount of $5,000.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the consent of Agent
shall not be required (and payment of any fees shall not be required) if (x)
such assignment is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer,
or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan
portfolio of such Lender or (y) the assignee is an Affiliate of a Lender or a
Related Fund.

                                      -94-

               (b)  From and after the date that Agent notifies the assignor
Lender (with a copy to Borrower) that it has received a fully executed
Assignment and Acceptance and payment (if applicable) of the above-referenced
processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish
its rights (except with respect to SECTION 11.3 hereof) and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto), and such assignment shall affect
a novation between Borrower and the Assignee.

               (c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (1) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished
pursuant hereto, (2) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of
Borrower or the performance or observance by Borrower of any of its obligations
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto, (3)
such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together
with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Acceptance, (4) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, (5)
such Assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such actions and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to Agent, by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (6) such
Assignee agrees that it will perform all of the obligations which by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

               (d)  Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee
payment under the Assignment and Acceptance and receipt and acknowledgment by
Agent of such fully executed Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect
the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments
arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Lender PRO TANTO.

               (e)  Any Lender may at any time, with the written consent of
Agent, sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other
Persons not Affiliates of such Lender (a "PARTICIPANT") participating interests
in its Obligations owing to such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender, and the
other rights and interests of that Lender (the "ORIGINATING

                                      -95-
<Page>

LENDER") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (provided that no written
consent of Agent shall be required in connection with any sale of any such
participating interests by a Lender to an Eligible Transferee); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (i) the Originating Lender shall remain a "Lender" for all
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Participant
receiving the participating interest in the Obligations, the Commitments, and
the other rights and interests of the Originating Lender hereunder shall not
constitute a "Lender" hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the
Originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Agent, and the Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender in connection with the
Originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, (iv) no originating Lender shall transfer or grant any
participating interest under which the Participant has the right to approve any
amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment to, or consent or
waiver with respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan Document would (A)
extend the final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder in which such
Participant is participating, (B) reduce the interest rate applicable to the
Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (C) release
all or a material portion of the Collateral or guaranties (except to the extent
expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents) supporting the
Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (D) postpone
the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the interest or fees payable to such
Participant, (E) change the amount or due dates of scheduled principal
repayments or prepayments or premiums in respect of the Obligations hereunder in
which such Participant is participating, or (F) subordinate Agent's Liens to the
Liens of any other creditor of Borrower, and (v) all amounts payable by Borrower
hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation,
except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or
shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the
right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement. The rights of any
Participant only shall be derivative through the Originating Lender with whom
such Participant participates and no Participant shall have any rights under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any direct rights as to the other
Lenders, Agent, Borrower, the Collections, the Collateral, or otherwise in
respect of the Obligations. No Participant shall have the right to participate
directly in the making of decisions by the Lenders among themselves. The
provisions of this SECTION 14.1(e) are solely for the benefit of the Lender
Group, and Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of
such provisions.

               (f)  In connection with any such assignment or participation or
proposed assignment or participation, a Lender may disclose to a third party all
documents and information which it now or hereafter may have relating to
Borrower or Borrower's business.

               (g)  Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any
Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any
portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank
or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14, and

                                      -96-
<Page>

such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any
manner permitted under applicable law.

               (h)  Borrower shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a
register (the "REGISTER") on which it enters the name of a Lender as the
registered owner of the Term Loan and each Advance, as the case may be, held by
such Lender. A Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the
same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such
assignment or sale on the Register (and each Registered Note shall expressly so
provide). Any assignment or sale of all or part of such Registered Loan (and the
Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by
registration of such assignment or sale on the Register, together with the
surrender of the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by
(or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by)
the holder of such Registered Note, whereupon, at the request of the designated
assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new Registered Notes in the same
aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or
transferee(s). Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered
Loan (and the Registered Note, if any evidencing the same), Borrower shall treat
the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any,
evidencing the same) is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary. In the case of an assignment or delegation covered by
SECTION 14.1(a)(y), the assigning Lender shall maintain a comparable Register on
behalf of Borrower.

               (i)  In the event that a Lender sells participations in the
Registered Loan, such Lender shall maintain a register on which it enters the
name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it (the "PARTICIPANT
REGISTER"). A Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the
same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such
participation on the Participant Register (and each Registered Note shall
expressly so provide). Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the
Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the
registration of such participation on the Participant Register.

          14.2 SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the respective successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Borrower may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties
hereunder without the Lenders' prior written consent and any prohibited
assignment shall be absolutely void AB INITIO. No consent to assignment by the
Lenders shall release Borrower from its Obligations. A Lender may assign this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and
thereunder pursuant to SECTION 14.1 hereof and, except as expressly required
pursuant to SECTION 14.1 hereof, no consent or approval by Borrower is required
in connection with any such assignment.

     15.  AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.

          15.1 REVOLVING LOAN LENDERS' AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no
consent with respect to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by
Agent at the written request of the Required Lenders) and Borrower and then any
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific

                                      -97-

2.1(a), 2.3(e), 2.3(i), 2.4(b), or 16 (or change any definition of a term used
in such Section in a manner adverse to any Revolving Loan Lender).

          and, PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing Lender,
as applicable, affect the rights or duties of Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing
Lender, as applicable, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The
foregoing notwithstanding, any amendment, modification, waiver, consent,
termination, or release of, or with respect to, any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document that relates only to the relationship of the Lender
Group among themselves, and that does not affect the rights or obligations of
Borrower, shall not require consent by or the agreement of Borrower.

          15.2 TERM LOAN LENDERS' AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No waiver or amendment
of, or consent to any departure from, any of the following provisions nor any

               (b)  reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest on, the

hereunder,

               (c)  amend, modify or waive SECTION 2.4(b) to eliminate from such

               (d)  amend, modify or waive SECTION 2.2, this SECTION 15.2 or

Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, any Guarantor, whether

adverse to the Term Loan Lenders, or (ii) clause (c) or (d) of the definition of

               (h)  change, modify or waive the definition of "Maximum Revolver

principal amount of

                                      -99-
<Page>

the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents (excluding Indebtedness constituting

          Except as otherwise provided in this SECTION 15.2, the Required
Lenders or the Revolving Loan Lenders, as applicable, may change, modify or
waive any term or provision of the Loan Documents without the consent of the
Term Loan Lenders, and the effectiveness of any such amendment, modification, or
waiver shall not require any action by any Term Loan Lender.

          15.3 OTHER TERM LOAN LENDER PROVISIONS. (a) If any Loan Party shall
become subject to an Insolvency Proceeding, and if Agent and the Required
Lenders shall desire to permit the use of cash collateral or to provide
post-petition financing to such Loan Party, the Term Loan Lenders agrees as
follows: (i) adequate notice to the Term Loan Lenders shall be deemed to have
been provided for such use of cash collateral or post-petition financing if the
Term Loan Lenders receive notice thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior
to any hearing on a request to approve such use of cash collateral or
post-petition financing, and (ii) no objection will be raised by the Term Loan
Lenders to any such use of cash collateral or such post-petition financing by
Agent and the Required Lenders, provided that (x) the Term Loan Lenders are
granted the same Liens on the post-petition Collateral that may be granted to or
for the benefit of Agent and the Revolving Loan Lenders, junior and subordinated
only to the Liens of Agent and the Revolving Loan Lenders therein and (y) the
aggregate principal amount of pre-petition secured indebtedness together with
the aggregate principal amount of financing in such Insolvency Proceeding will
not exceed the Maximum Senior Debt (which shall exclude any Indebtedness
constituting Bank Product Obligations or Related Indebtedness) less the
outstanding Term Loan. No objection will be raised by the Term Loan Lenders to
Agent's motion for relief from the automatic stay in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code to foreclose on and sell the Collateral.

               (b)  During any Insolvency Proceeding involving any Loan Party,
the Revolving Loan Lenders shall be entitled to vote the claim of the Term Loan
Lenders with respect to any matters arising from or relating to the Collateral
(including permitting the use of cash collateral, debtor-in-possession financing
or post-petition financing), including, without limitation, enforcing the Liens
on the Collateral, in each case as the Required Lenders may reasonably deem
necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or
interests of the Revolving Loan Lenders hereunder, or the treatment of any
Collateral in any proposed plan of reorganization so long as the rights of the
Term Loan Lenders in the Collateral shall be the same as they existed before the
commencement of such Insolvency Proceeding.

               (c)  Any waiver, amendment or consent described in SECTION 15.1
and SECTION 15.2 shall apply equally to all of the Term Loan Lenders and shall
be binding upon them, upon each future Term Loan Lender, whether or not any
promissory note evidencing a Term Loan issued to any Term Loan Lender shall have
been marked to indicate such waiver, amendment or consent. No such amendment or
waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived, amended or
consented to or impair any right consequent thereon.

               (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if there is an
amendment, restatement, modification, renewal, refunding, refinancing or other
replacement of the Revolving Loan Obligations or this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, such

                                      -100-
<Page>

amendment, restatement, modification, renewal, refunding, refinancing or other
replacement shall not constitute a satisfaction or payment in full of the
Revolving Loan Obligations hereunder or a termination of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the Revolving Loan Obligations shall be deemed to
remain outstanding and each of the Term Loan Lenders agree to enter into with
any successor Revolving Loan Lender that amends, restates, modifies, renews,
refunds, refinances or otherwise replaces the Revolving Loan Obligations, an
intercreditor and subordination agreement or arrangement on the same terms and
with the same priorities set forth in this Agreement.

               (e)  Halcyon Fund, L.P. ("HALCYON") and each of its Affiliates
(collectively, the "HALCYON LENDERS") that is a Term Loan Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints Halcyon as its representative agent (the "Halcyon
Representative") which appointment shall remain in full force and effect so long
as such Person is a Term Loan Lender. Each Halcyon Lender hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Halcyon Representative to provide Agent, the
Revolving Loan Lenders or the Loan Parties with all notices or other
communications under the Loan Documents, and to receive from Agent, the
Revolving Loan Lenders or the Loan Parties all notices and instructions and
payments under the Loan Documents. Each of Agent, the Revolving Loan Lenders and
the Loan Parties may rely on any notice or instruction of the Halcyon
Representative related to any Halcyon Lender or any other action taken by the
Halcyon Representative on behalf of any Halcyon Lender. Each Halcyon Lender
agrees that Halcyon shall incur no liability to any other Halcyon Lender
relating to the performance of its duties hereunder. Each of the Halcyon Lenders
agree that Halcyon Lenders who hold at least 51% of the aggregate principal
amount of Term Loans held by all Halcyon Lenders may appoint another Halcyon
Lender to serve as the Halcyon Representative. Each Halcyon Lender consents to
the taking by the Halcyon Representative of any and all actions and the making
of any decisions required or permitted to be made or taken by it and agrees to
be bound by all actions taken by the Halcyon Representative taken in its
capacity as its representative. Borrower hereby indemnifies the Halcyon
Representative in its capacity as such and releases and holds harmless the
Halcyon Representative from and against any and all losses that the Halcyon
Representative may incur as a result of its acting as the Halcyon Representative
under any Loan Document or in connection with the performance of any of its
duties hereunder or under any related agreement to the fullest extent permitted
by law, except to the extent that such losses are caused by actions of the
Halcyon Representative that were taken in bad faith, in a grossly negligent
manner or due to willful misconduct.

     15.4 REPLACEMENT OF HOLDOUT LENDER.

               (a)  If any action to be taken by the Lender Group or Agent
hereunder requires the unanimous consent, authorization, or agreement of all
Revolving Loan Lenders, and a Revolving Loan Lender ("HOLDOUT LENDER") fails to
give its consent, authorization, or agreement, then Agent, upon at least 5
Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender, may permanently
replace the Holdout Lender with one or more substitute Revolving Loan Lenders
(each, a "REPLACEMENT LENDER"), and the Holdout Lender shall have no right to
refuse to be replaced hereunder. Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender shall
specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later
than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is given.

                                      -101-
<Page>

               (b)  Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout
Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, subject only to the Holdout Lender being repaid its share
of the outstanding Revolving Loan Obligations (including an assumption of its
Pro Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability) without any premium or
penalty of any kind whatsoever. If the Holdout Lender shall refuse or fail to
execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement prior to the
effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender shall be deemed to have
executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. The replacement
of any Holdout Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of SECTION
14.1. Until such time as the Replacement Lenders shall have acquired all of the
Revolving Loan Obligations, the Revolver Commitments, and the other rights and
obligations of the Holdout Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
the Holdout Lender shall remain obligated to make the Holdout Lender's Pro Rata
Share of Advances and to purchased a participation in each Letter of Credit, in
an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability of
such Letter of Credit.

          15.5 NO WAIVERS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by Agent or any
Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising the same,
will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by Agent or any Lender will be
effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically
stated. No waiver by Agent or any Lender on any occasion shall affect or
diminish Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict
performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement. Agent's and each
Lender's rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that Agent or any
Lender may have.

     16.  AGENT; THE LENDER GROUP.

          16.1 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF AGENT. Each Lender hereby
designates and appoints Foothill as its representative under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each
other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent
agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this SECTION 16.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in SECTIONS 16.12 and 16.17, the
provisions of this SECTION 16 are solely for the benefit of Agent, and the
Lenders, and Borrower shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any
of the provisions contained herein. Any provision to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against Agent; it being expressly understood and
agreed that the use of the word "Agent" is for convenience only, that Foothill
is merely the representative of the Lenders, and only has the contractual duties

to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides
rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the right to
exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect: (a)
maintain, in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and
records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, the
Collections, and related matters, (b) execute or file any and all financing or
similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents,
instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with respect
to the Loan Documents, (c) make Advances, for itself or on behalf of Revolving
Loan Lenders as provided in the Loan Documents, (d) exclusively receive, apply,
and distribute the Collections as provided in the Loan Documents, (e) open and
maintain such bank accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems
necessary and appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the
foregoing purposes with respect to the Collateral and the Collections, (f)

Collections, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan
Documents, (g) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent may deem
necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions
and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents, and (h) enter into and perform its
duties under the Intercreditor Agreement.

          16.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Agent may execute any of its duties under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects as
long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          16.3 LIABILITY OF AGENT. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i)
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct),
or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Borrower, or any officer or director thereof, contained in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrower or any
other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the Books or properties of Borrower or the books or
records or properties of any of Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

          16.4 RELIANCE BY AGENT. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrower

                                      -103-
<Page>

or counsel to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts selected by
Agent. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive
such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and until such
instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems
advisable. If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          16.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT. Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest,
fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders,
except with respect to Defaults and Events of Default of which Agent has actual
knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default, and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." Agent promptly
will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of
Default of which Agent has actual knowledge. If any Lender obtains actual
knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other
Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default. Each Lender shall be solely
responsible for giving any notices to its Participants, if any. Subject to
SECTION 16.4, Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with
SECTION 9; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until Agent has received any such
request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable.

          16.6 CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Borrower
and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each
Lender represents to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of Borrower and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrower. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of Borrower and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to a Loan Document. Except for notices, reports, and other documents
expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of

                                      -104-
<Page>

Borrower and any other Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the
possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

          16.7 COSTS AND EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. Agent may incur and pay
Lender Group Expenses to the extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and
obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, costs of collection by outside collection agencies
and auctioneer fees and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to
maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrower is obligated to reimburse Agent
or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to the Loan Agreement or otherwise. Agent
is authorized and directed to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from
Collections received by Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs
and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders. In the event
Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses from Collections received by
Agent, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to or
reimburse Agent for the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. Whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall
indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by
or on behalf of Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do
so), according to their Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for
the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting
Lender in failing to make an Advance or other extension of credit hereunder.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Agent upon
demand for such Lender's ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein,
to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Agent.

          16.8 AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Foothill and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in, and generally engage in any kind of banking,
lending, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person (other than
the Lender Group) party to any Loan Documents as though Foothill were not Agent
hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other members
of the Lender Group. The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Foothill or its Affiliates may receive information
regarding Borrower or its Affiliates and any other Person (other than the Lender
Group) party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit the
disclosure of such information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that,
in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver Agent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain),
Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them. The
terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Foothill in its individual capacity.

                                      -105-
<Page>

         16.9  SUCCESSOR AGENT. (a) Agent may resign as Agent upon 45 days'
notice to the Revolving Loan Lenders. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the
Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders. If no
successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of
Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Revolving Loan Lenders, a
successor Agent. If Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any
material provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders
may agree in writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from
among the Revolving Loan Lenders. (b) After all of the Revolving Loan
Obligations have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit have either been
terminated or cash collateralized and the Revolver Commitments have been
terminated, Agent agrees to resign and, immediately upon such resignation, the
Term Loan Lenders (or their designee) shall automatically and without further
action be appointed the successor Agent. (c) Nothing contained in this SECTION
16.9 shall be construed to limit or eliminate Agent's right to resign as an
Agent in accordance with this SECTION 16.9. In any such event, upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent
shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and
the term "Agent" shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent's
appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this SECTION 16 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted
appointment as Agent by the date which is 45 days following a retiring Agent's
notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Revolving Loan Lenders shall perform all of
the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Revolving Loan
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.

         16.10 LENDER IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Any Lender and its respective
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrower
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person (other than the Lender
Group) party to any Loan Documents as though such Lender were not a Lender
hereunder without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group.
The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, such Lender and its respective Affiliates may receive information
regarding Borrower or its Affiliates and any other Person (other than the Lender
Group) party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit the
disclosure of such information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that,
in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver such Lender will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain), such Lender not shall be under any obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to the Swing Loans and Agent Advances, Swing
Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the sub-agent of Agent.

         16.11 WITHHOLDING TAXES.

               (a)  If any Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership or
trust" within the meaning of the IRC and such Lender claims exemption from, or a
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the IRC, such
Lender agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrower, to deliver to Agent and
Borrower:

                                      -106-
<Page>

                    (i)    if such Lender claims an exemption from withholding
     tax pursuant to its portfolio interest exception, (a) a statement of the
     Lender, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is not a (I) a "bank" as
     described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder
     (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a
     controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the
     IRC, and (B) a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN, before the first payment
     of any interest under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably
     requested by Agent or Borrower;

                    (ii)   if such Lender claims an exemption from, or a
     reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly
     completed IRS Form W-8BEN before the first payment of any interest under
     this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by Agent or
     Borrower;

                    (iii)  if such Lender claims that interest paid under this
     Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is
     effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such
     Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI
     before the first payment of any interest is due under this Agreement and at
     any other time reasonably requested by Agent or Borrower;

                    (iv)   such other form or forms as may be required under the
     IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or
     reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Lender agrees promptly to notify Agent and Borrower of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.

               (b)  If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN
and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise
transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrower to such Lender, such Lender
agrees to notify Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrower to such Lender. To the extent of
such percentage amount, Agent will treat such Lender's IRS Form W-8BEN as no
longer valid.

               (c)  If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a)
of this Section are not delivered to Agent, then Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other documentation
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

               (d)  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other
reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless for all amounts
paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and

                                      -107-
<Page>

including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent
under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses). The obligation of the Lenders under this subsection shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of
Agent.

               (e)  All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under any note
will be made without setoff, counterclaim, or other defense, except as required
by applicable law other than for Taxes (as defined below). All such payments
will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction (other
than the United States) or by any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein (other than of the United States) with respect to such
payments (but excluding, any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (i) measured by or based on
the net income or net profits of a Lender, or (ii) to the extent that such tax
results from a change in the circumstances of the Lender, including a change in
the residence, place of organization, or principal place of business of the
Lender, or a change in the branch or lending office of the Lender participating
in the transactions set forth herein) and all interest, penalties or similar
liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as
"TAXES"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, Borrower agrees to pay the full
amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that
every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any note,
including any amount paid pursuant to this SECTION 16.11(e) after withholding or
deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount
provided for herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Borrower shall not be required to
increase any such amounts payable to Agent or any Lender (i) that is not
organized under the laws of the United States, if such Person fails to comply
with the other requirements of this SECTION 16.11, or (ii) if the increase in
such amount payable results from Agent's or such Lender's own willful misconduct
or gross negligence. Borrower will furnish to Agent as promptly as possible
after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by Borrower.

         16.12 COLLATERAL MATTERS.

               (a)  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its
option and in its sole discretion, to release any Lien on any Collateral (i)
upon the termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by
Borrower of all Obligations, (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed
of if a release is required or desirable in connection therewith and if Borrower
certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is permitted under SECTION 7.4
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and Agent may rely conclusively
on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii) constituting property
in which Borrower owned no interest at the time the security interest was
granted or at any time thereafter, or (iv) constituting property leased to
Borrower under a lease that has expired or is terminated in a transaction
permitted under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent shall, for the benefit
and at the request of Borrower, release its Lien on Collateral in a transaction
constituting a Permitted Disposition. Except as provided above, Agent will not
execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any Collateral without the prior
written authorization of (y) if the release is of all or a material

                                      -108-
<Page>

portion of the Collateral, all of the Revolving Loan Lenders or (z) otherwise,
the Required Lenders. Upon request by Agent or Borrower at any time, the Lenders
will confirm in writing Agent's authority to release any such Liens on
particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this SECTION 16.12;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (1) Agent shall not be required to execute any document
necessary to evidence such release on terms that, in Agent's opinion, would
expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence
other than the release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or
warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or
impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released)
upon (or obligations of Borrower in respect of) all interests retained by
Borrower, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to
constitute part of the Collateral. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the
Term Loan Lenders waive any right to assert that any release, sale, transfer or
other disposition of any Collateral by Agent was not made on commercially
reasonable terms.

               (b)  Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the
Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or is cared
for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's Liens
have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or
enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in
any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to
continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or
available to Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood
and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event
related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Agent may
act in any manner it may deem appropriate, absent Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
in its sole discretion given Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its
capacity as one of the Lenders and that Agent shall have no other duty or
liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing, except as
otherwise provided herein.

         16.13 RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIONS BY LENDERS; SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

               (a) Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the
express consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully
entitled to do so, upon the request of Agent, set off against the Obligations,
any amounts owing by such Lender to Borrower or any deposit accounts of Borrower
now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the Lenders further agrees
that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by Agent, take or
cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any legal or
equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any
security interest in, any of the Collateral the purpose of which is, or could
be, to give such Lender any preference or priority against the other Lenders
with respect to the Collateral.

               (b)  If, at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by
payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any
payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such proceeds or payments
received by such Lender from Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or
(ii) payments from Agent in excess of such Lender's Pro Rata Share portion of
all such distributions by Agent, such Lender promptly shall (1) turn the same
over to Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to
negotiate the same to Agent, or in

                                      -109-
<Page>

immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the
Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other
Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among
the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is
thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be
rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the
purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but
without interest except to the extent that such purchasing party is required to
pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment.

         16.14 AGENCY FOR PERFECTION. Agent hereby appoints each other Lender
as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts such appointment) for the purpose
of perfecting the Agent's Liens in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of
the Code can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender obtain
possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and,
promptly upon Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to Agent or
in accordance with Agent's instructions.

         16.15 PAYMENTS BY AGENT TO THE LENDERS. All payments to be made by
Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer instructions as each
party may designate for itself by written notice to Agent. Concurrently with
each such payment, Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion
thereof) represents principal, premium, or interest of the Obligations.

         16.16 CONCERNING THE COLLATERAL AND RELATED LOAN DOCUMENTS. Each
member of the Lender Group authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral, for the
benefit of the Lender Group. Each member of the Lender Group agrees that any
action taken by Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent of its
powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

         16.17 FIELD AUDITS AND EXAMINATION REPORTS; CONFIDENTIALITY;
DISCLAIMERS BY LENDERS; OTHER REPORTS AND INFORMATION. By becoming a party to
this Agreement, each Lender:

               (a)  is deemed to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender,
promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each field audit or examination
report (each a "REPORT" and collectively, "REPORTS") prepared by or at the
request of Agent, and Agent shall so furnish each Lender with such Reports,

               (b)  expressly agrees and acknowledges that Agent does not (i)
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii)
shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report,

               (c)  expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not
comprehensive audits or examinations, that Agent or other party performing any
audit or

                                      -110-
<Page>

examination will inspect only specific information regarding Borrower and will
rely significantly upon the Books, as well as on representations of Borrower's
personnel,

               (d)  agrees, for the benefit of the Lender Group and,
notwithstanding SECTION 16.1, the Loan Parties, to keep all Reports and other
material, non-public information regarding Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated business plans in a
confidential manner; it being understood and agreed by Borrower that in any
event such Lender may make disclosures (a) to counsel for and other advisors,
accountants, and auditors to such Lender, (b) reasonably required by any bona
fide potential or actual Assignee or Participant in connection with any
contemplated or actual assignment or transfer by such Lender of an interest
herein or any participation interest in such Lender's rights hereunder, (c) of
information that has become public by disclosures made by Persons other than
such Lender, its Affiliates, assignees, transferees, or Participants, or (d) as
required or requested by any court, governmental or administrative agency,
pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process, or by any law, statute,
regulation, or court order; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, unless prohibited by
applicable law, statute, regulation, or court order, such Lender shall notify
Borrower of any request by any court, governmental or administrative agency, or
pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process for disclosure of any such
non-public material information concurrent with, or where practicable, prior to
the disclosure thereof, and

               (e)  without limiting the generality of any other indemnification
provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold Agent and any other
Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may
take or conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in
connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying
Lender has made or may make to Borrower, or the indemnifying Lender's
participation in, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a loan or loans of
Borrower, and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold Agent, and
any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims,
actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including,
attorneys fees and costs) incurred by Agent and any such other Lender preparing
a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might obtain
all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.

          In addition to the foregoing: (x) any Revolving Loan Lender may from
time to time request of Agent in writing that Agent provide to such Revolving
Loan Lender a copy of any report or document provided by Borrower to Agent that
has not been contemporaneously provided by Borrower to such Revolving Loan
Lender, and, upon receipt of such request, Agent promptly shall provide a copy
of same to such Revolving Loan Lender, (y) to the extent that Agent is entitled,
under any provision of the Loan Documents, to request additional reports or
information from Borrower, any Revolving Loan Lender may, from time to time,
reasonably request Agent to exercise such right as specified in such Revolving
Loan Lender's notice to Agent, whereupon Agent promptly shall request of
Borrower the additional reports or information reasonably specified by such
Revolving Loan Lender, and, upon receipt thereof from Borrower, Agent promptly
shall provide a copy of same to such Revolving Loan Lender, and (z) any time
that Agent renders to Borrower a statement regarding the Loan Account, Agent
shall send a copy of such statement to each Revolving Loan Lender.

          16.18 SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS; NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding that certain
of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have been or will be executed only by
or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor of the
Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of the Lenders to make any credit
available hereunder shall constitute the several (and not joint) obligations of
the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their respective
Commitments, to make an amount of such credit not to exceed, in principal
amount, at any one time outstanding, the amount of their respective Commitments.
Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Lender any interest in, or
subject any Lender to any liability for, or in respect of, the business, assets,
profits, losses, or liabilities of any other Lender. Each Lender shall be solely
responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters relating to the Loan
Documents to the extent any such notice may be required, and no Lender shall
have any obligation, duty, or liability to any Participant of any other Lender.
Except as provided in SECTION 16.7, no member of the Lender Group shall have any
liability for the acts or any other member of the Lender Group. No Lender shall
be responsible to Borrower or any other Person for any failure by any other
Lender to fulfill its obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor to
advance for it or on its behalf in connection with its Commitment, nor to take
any other action on its behalf hereunder or in connection with the financing
contemplated herein.

     17.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

          17.1 EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall be binding and deemed
effective when executed by Borrower, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is
provided for on the signature pages hereof.

          17.2 SECTION HEADINGS. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein
for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context,
everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.

          17.3 INTERPRETATION. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or
ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender Group or Borrower,
whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this
Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and
interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to
accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.

          17.4 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Each provision of this Agreement
shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose
of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

          17.5 AMENDMENTS IN WRITING. This Agreement only can be amended by a
writing signed by Agent (on behalf of the requisite Lenders) and Borrower.

          17.6 COUNTERPARTS; TELEFACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate
counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be
an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and
the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of

                                      -112-
<Page>

this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed
counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of
this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis
mutandis.

          17.7 REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. If the incurrence or
payment of the Obligations by Borrower or Guarantor or the transfer to the
Lender Group of any property should for any reason subsequently be declared to
be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors'
rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent
conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or
transfers of property (collectively, a "VOIDABLE TRANSFER"), and if the Lender
Group is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable
Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as
to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that the Lender Group is
required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs,
expenses, and attorneys fees of the Lender Group related thereto, the liability
of Borrower or Guarantor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and
restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

          17.8 INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by
any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.

     18.  GUARANTY

          18.1 GUARANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Each Guarantor (other than
Newco Canada) hereby, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees the punctual
payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
all Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under any Loan Document,
whether for principal, interest (including, without limitation, all interest
that accrues after the commencement of any case, proceeding or other action
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Borrower), fees,
expenses or otherwise (such obligations, to the extent not paid by Borrower,
being the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Lender Group in
enforcing any rights under the guaranty set forth in this SECTION 18. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each such Guarantor's liability shall
extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and
would be owed by Borrower to any member of the Lender Group under any Loan
Document but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to
the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
Borrower.

          18.2 GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada)
guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance
with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order
now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or
the rights of Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto. The obligations of such
Guarantor under this SECTION 18 are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations,
and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such
Guarantor to enforce such obligations, irrespective of whether any action is
brought against

                                      -113-
<Page>

Borrower or whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The
liability of such Guarantor under this SECTION 18 shall be irrevocable, absolute
and unconditional irrespective of, and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any way relating to, any or all of
the following:

               (a)  any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document
or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

               (b)  any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document,
including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations
resulting from the extension of additional credit to Borrower or otherwise;

               (c)  any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
Collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

               (d)  any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate,
limited liability company or partnership structure or existence of Borrower; or

               (e)  any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by
Agent or the Lenders that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
a discharge of, Guarantor, Borrower or any other guarantor or surety.

          This SECTION 18 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as
the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by a Lender or any other Person upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

          18.3 WAIVER. Each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada) hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this SECTION 18 and any requirement that
Agent or the Lenders exhaust any right or take any action against Borrower or
any other Person or any Collateral. Each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada)
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated herein and that the waiver set forth in this
SECTION 18.3 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Each Guarantor
(other than Newco Canada) hereby waives any right to revoke this SECTION 18, and
acknowledges that this SECTION 18 is continuing in nature and applies to all
Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

          18.4 CONTINUING GUARANTY; ASSIGNMENTS. This SECTION 18 is a continuing
guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the later of (i)
the cash payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than
indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been made) and all other
amounts payable under this SECTION 18 and (ii) the Maturity Date, (b) be binding
upon each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada), its successors and assigns and
(c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Agent and the Lenders and
their successors, pledgees,

                                      -114-
<Page>

transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause
(c), any Lender may pledge, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
all or any portion of its Revolver Commitments owing to it) to any other Person,
and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof granted such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as
provided in SECTION 14.1.

          18.5 SUBROGATION. Each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada) will not
exercise any rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against Borrower or any
other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under this SECTION 18, including,
without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or
remedy of Agent and the Lenders against Borrower or any other insider guarantor
or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity
or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the
right to take or receive from Borrower or any other insider guarantor, directly
or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and
until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
SECTION 18 shall have been paid in full in cash and the Maturity Date or earlier
termination of this Agreement shall have occurred. If any amount shall be paid
to each Guarantor (other than Newco Canada) in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full in cash
of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this SECTION
18 and the earlier of the Maturity Date and the early termination of this
Agreement, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent and the
Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to Agent and the Lenders to be credited and
applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
SECTION 18, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other
amounts payable under this SECTION 18 thereafter arising. If (i) any Guarantor
(other than Newco Canada) shall make payment to Agent and the Lenders of all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all other amounts payable under this SECTION 18 shall be paid in full in
cash and (iii) the Maturity Date or earlier termination of this Agreement shall
have occurred, Agent and the Lenders will, at such Guarantor's request and
expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without
recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the
transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed
Obligations resulting from such payment by such Guarantor.
