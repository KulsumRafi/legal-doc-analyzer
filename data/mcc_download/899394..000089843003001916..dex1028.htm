hereunder in shares of Common Stock or cash shall be at the discretion of the Company. Not less than 20 Trading Days (as defined in Section 5) prior to each regularly scheduled Interest Payment Date, within two Trading Days after receipt of a
Conversion Notice if such Interest Payment Date arises due to delivery of a Conversion Notice by the Holder to the Company, the Company shall provide the Holder with written notice of its election to pay interest hereunder either in cash or shares

basis of a 360-day year and shall accrue daily commencing on the Original Issue Date (as defined in Section 5) until payment in full of the principal sum, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts which may become due
