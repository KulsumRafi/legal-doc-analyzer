void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate or to any person or entity in
connection with a merger, spin-off, divestiture, reorganization or sale of
substantially all or all of the business, or part of the business; provided,

of choice-of-law rules or principles. This Agreement and any addenda hereto
shall constitute the entire agreement between Akamai and Customer with respect
to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, representations, and
statements with respect to such subject matter are superceded hereby, including
without limitation any non disclosure agreement previously executed between the
parties. These Terms & Conditions shall control in the event of any
inconsistency with the terms of the Order Forms or other schedules or exhibits
attached hereto. These Terms & Conditions may be changed only by written
agreement signed by both Akamai and Customer. No failure of either party to
exercise or enforce any of its rights under these Terms & Conditions shall act
as a waiver of subsequent breaches; and the waiver of any breach shall not act
as a waiver of subsequent breaches. In the event any provision of these Terms &
Conditions is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
under applicable law, and the other provisions of these Terms & Conditions will
remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree that in the event
such provision is an essential part of these Terms & Conditions, they will begin
negotiations for a replacement provision. If either party is prevented from

the party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, an act of God,
fire, flood, explosion, war, strike, embargo, government regulation, civil or
military authority, acts or omissions of carriers, transmitters, providers, or

the Microsoft Affiliate. Akamai hereby grants any such Microsoft Affiliate the
right to use the FreeFlow Services and associated Software in accordance with
the Agreement (including the licensing restrictions and confidentiality
provisions thereof); provided that, so long as Microsoft and Akamai have
accepted the order with respect to a given Microsoft Affiliate as provided for
above, all other rights and obligations under the Agreement shall remain with

Agreement by its Affiliates. With respect to any order relating to a given
Microsoft Affiliate Microsoft and Akamai have accepted under the terms hereof,
Akamai shall bill Microsoft and Microsoft shall pay for the FreeFlow Services
used by Microsoft and any such Microsoft Affiliates. Support will be provided

interest and retained at least 10% ownership of the equity or beneficial
interest of such entity and (ii) has management or operational responsibility
(including the authority to act on behalf of and legally bind such entity)
(collectively "Management or Operational Responsibility") provided that such
entity shall be deemed to be an Affiliate only so long as such "control" exists
or party has Management or Operational Responsibility for such entity. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not apply to any affiliates of
Microsoft Affiliates.

METHODS FOR BILLING CIR:

     -    Committed Information Rate fees are billed in advance using the 95th
          Percentile Method.

     -    For purposes of this Agreement, the "95th Percentile Method" shall
          mean the process of (i) measuring actual data transmission in Mbps
          over 5 minute intervals, (ii) ranking such measurements from largest
          to smallest, (iii) discarding the largest 5% of the measurements; and
          (iv) billing based on the measurement at the 95th percentile.

     -    Bandwidth usage in excess of two (2) times the actual 95th percentile
          usage in a month, as defined above, during the remaining 5% period of
          a month, as defined above, will be billed at a rate of $.[**] per
          megabyte transferred (the "Additional Fees"). These Additional Fees
          will be in addition to the fees billed for the 95th percentile
          bandwidth usage during the month. [**] during the month, [**] the 95th
          percentile bandwidth usage [**]. Additionally, if the 5% period
          bandwidth usage in any given month, is consistent with following month
          95th percentile usage, Akamai may, in its sole discretion, waive the
          Additional Fees for any given month.

     -    Changes to the types of services, amount or frequency of services, and
          other similar factors may result in overages or surcharges.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:

     *This Agreement will serve as a global purchase agreement for Microsoft and
     subsidiaries.

     This Order Form will cover the Free Flow services only; Customer shall be
     required to execute a separate Order Form for any other products and
     services provided by Akamai.

     Commencing on and until termination of the Agreement, the base minimum
     Committed Information Rate ("CIR") with which Customer agrees to maintain
     with Akamai is [**]. Customer has the discretion to increase CIR at any
     time, but cannot decrease below its monthly scheduled CIR. Akamai Account
     Management and the Customer contract administrator will reconcile billing
     on a monthly and quarterly basis.

     Customer's bill will be reviewed monthly in arrears and if Customer exceeds
     this bandwidth threshold in any given month, Customer's bill will be
     reconciled in accordance with the actual usage based on the payment
     schedule set forth in Schedule B1 and credited for the difference. Such
     credits [**] at the end of this Agreement.

     Schedule B1 prices are set at [**] increments. If actual exceeds the [**]
     increments based on the 95th percentile model sustained bandwidth, customer
     will qualify for the next level of pricing.

     * Customer will be assigned a dedicated account team to serve as a
     centralized point of contact for all Properties to address all issues with
     respect to billing and customer care. In addition, based on the level the
     of Customer's issue, Customer shall receive support from Akamai's Customer
     Care team, [**], and the Network Operations Center (the "NOC"). Akamai`s
     Customer Care and the NOC will provide customer support to Customer 24
     hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

                        STANDARD SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT

I.       SERVICE LEVELS AND CREDITS

         Akamai agrees to provide a level of service demonstrating:

         (a)      Measurable Performance Enhancement: The Akamai FreeFlow
                  service will deliver content measurably faster than the
                  Customer's web site.

         (b)      100% Uptime: The Akamai FreeFlow service will serve content
                  100% of the time.

         (c)      Credits: If the Akamai FreeFlow service fails to meet either
                  of the above service levels, the Customer will receive a
                  credit equal to fees for the day in which the failure occurs.

II.      SLA MONITORING METHODOLOGY

         The following methodology will be employed to measure FreeFlow service
         availability and performance enhancement:

         Agents and Polling Frequency

         (a)      From six (6) geographically and network-diverse locations in
                  major metropolitan areas, Akamai will simultaneously poll a
                  test file residing on the Customer's production servers and on
                  Akamai's network

         (b)      The polling mechanism will perform two (2) simultaneous http
                  GET operations:

                           one GET operation will be performed on a test file
                           residing on the appropriate customer server (e.g.,
                           http://www.customerxyz.com/images/test/gif.com

                           the other GET operation will be performed from the
                           Akamai Free Flow Servicegif http://
                           a564.g.akamaitech.net/7/564/24/2c1db485/
                           www.customerxyz.com/images/test gif.

         (c)      The Akamaized test GIF must be of typecode 7 to ensure that it
                  is a live object.

         (d)      The test GIF will be a file of 20 Kbytes or greater in size.

         (e)      Polling will occur at approximately 12-minute intervals.

         (f)      Based on the http GET operations described in II(b) above, the
                  response times received from the two sources, (a) the Customer
                  server, and (b) the Akamai network, will be compared for the
                  purpose of measuring performance metrics and Outages.

III.     PERFORMANCE METRIC

         The performance metric will be based on a daily average of performance
         for the FreeFlow service and the Customer's production web server,
         computed from data captured across all regions and hits. Each time will
         be weighted to reflect peak traffic conditions or "primetime" usage.
         The primetime period is 10 AM to 8 PM EST. All times recorded during
         this period will be weighted by a factor of three. If on a given day
         the Akamai weighted daily average time exceeds the Customer's weighted
         daily average time, then the Customer will receive a credit equivalent
         to fees for that day of service.

IV.      OUTAGES

         An "Outage" is defined as a 12-minute period of consecutive failed
         attempts by a single agent to "get" a file from the FreeFlow network
         while succeeding to "get" the test file from the Customer web site. If
         an Outage is identified by this method, the customer will receive a
         credit equivalent to the fees for the day in which the failure
         occurred.
