                    (a)  U.S. REVOLVER. Each Lender (except the U.K. Lender and
     Canadian Lender) agrees, severally and not jointly, for so long as no
     Default or Event of Default exists, to make Revolving Credit Loans to U.S.
     Borrowers (each such loan or extension of credit, a "U.S. Revolving Credit
     Loan") from time to time during the period from the date hereof to but not
     including the last day of the Term, as requested by Borrower
     Representative, on behalf of U.S. Borrowers, in the manner set forth in
     SUBSECTION 3.1.1 hereof, up to a maximum principal amount in Dollar
     Equivalents at any time outstanding equal to the lesser of (i) the product
     of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and the U.S. Revolving Loan
     Commitment MINUS the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and
     the U.S. LC Obligations MINUS the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan
     Percentage and the reserves imposed on U.S. Borrowers, if any, pursuant to
     this Section and (ii) the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan
     Percentage and an amount equal to the U.S. Borrowing Base at such time
     MINUS the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and any amount
     equal to the U.S. LC Obligations MINUS the product of such Lender's

     pursuant to this Section. The U.S. Revolving Credit Loans made by the
     Lenders for the benefit of U.S. Borrowers shall be denominated in Dollars
     or Euros. Agent shall have the right to establish reserves in such amounts,
     and with respect to such matters, as Agent shall reasonably deem necessary
     or appropriate in its reasonable credit judgment exercised in good faith,
     against the amount of Revolving Credit Loans which U.S. Borrowers may
     otherwise request under this SUBSECTION 1.1.1 including without limitation
     with respect to (i) price adjustments, damages, unearned discounts or other
     matters for which credit memoranda are issued in the ordinary course of
     U.S. Borrowers' business; (ii) potential dilution related to Accounts;
     (iii) other sums chargeable against U.S. Borrowers' Loan Account as a
     Revolving Credit Loan under any section of this Agreement; (iv) amounts

     reserves should be established from time to time hereunder. Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, Agent shall not establish any reserves in respect of any
     matters relating to any items of Collateral that have been taken into
     account in determining Eligible Accounts. The U.S. Revolving Credit Loans
     shall be repayable in accordance with the terms of the U.S. Revolving Notes
     and shall be secured by all of the U.S. Collateral.

                    (b)  U.K. REVOLVING LOANS. As of the U.K. Effective Date,

     "U.K. Revolving Credit Loan") from time to time during the period from the
     date hereof to but not including the last day of the Term, as requested by

     made by U.K. Lender to U.K. Borrower shall be denominated in Sterling or
     Euros. Agent and U.K. Agent shall have the right to establish reserves in
     such amounts, and with respect to such matters, as Agent and U.K. Agent
     shall reasonably deem necessary or appropriate in its reasonable credit
     judgment exercised in good faith, against the amount of U.K. Revolving
     Credit Loans which U.K. Borrower may otherwise request under this
     SUBSECTION 1.1.1 including without limitation with respect to (i) price

     specific events, conditions or contingencies with respect to the U.K.
     Borrower as to which Agent and U.K. Agent, in their reasonable credit
     judgment exercised in good faith, determine reserves should be established
     from time to time hereunder. The U.K. Revolving Credit Loans shall be
     repayable in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Notes and shall be
     secured by all of the U.K. Collateral and Canadian Collateral.

                    (c)  CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Canadian Lender
     agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to make
     Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrowers (each such loan or extension
     of credit, a "CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN") from time to time during the
     period from the date hereof to but not including the last day of the Term,

     Equivalent of reserves imposed on Canadian Borrowers, if any, pursuant to
     this Section. The Canadian Revolving Credit Loans made by Canadian Lender

     1.1.1 including without limitation with respect to (i) price adjustments,
     damages, unearned discounts, returned products or other matters for which

     Revolving Notes and shall be secured by all of the Collateral.

                    (d)  AGGREGATE REVOLVING LOANS. Notwithstanding anything in
     SECTION 1.1.1(a), (b), and (c) to the contrary, no Lender shall make
     Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers if the Dollar Equivalent of the
     Revolving Credit Loans outstanding advanced by that Lender after taking
     into account the Dollar Equivalent of the contemplated Revolving Credit
     Loan would exceed the lesser of (i) such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment
     MINUS the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and the LC
     Obligations MINUS the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage
     and the Dollar Equivalent of the reserves, if any, in effect pursuant to
     this Section and (ii) except as provided in SUBSECTIONS 1.1.2 and 1.1.5 the

     the Dollar Equivalent of the Aggregate Borrowing Base at such time MINUS
     the Dollar Equivalent of the LC Amount MINUS the Dollar Equivalent of the

                    (e)  CANADIAN AND U.K. SUBLIMIT. Although Canadian Revolving
     Credit Loans will be funded in Canadian Dollars and U.K. Revolving Credit
     Loans will be funded in Sterling or Euros, the Canadian Sublimit and U.K.

             Canadian Sublimit             $ 15,000,000
             U.K. Sublimit                 $ 10,000,000
</Table>

                    (f)  EURO SUBLIMIT. U.S. Lenders shall not be required to
     fund U.S. Revolving Credit Loans in Euros or issue or cause to be issued
     U.S. Letters of Credit denominated in Euros if the Dollar Equivalent of the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the U.S. Revolving Credit Loans
     funded or to be funded in Euros and the undrawn available amount of all
     outstanding U.S. Letters of Credit issued or to be issued and denominated
     in Euros exceeds $15,000,000. U.K. Lender shall not be required to fund
     U.K. Revolving Credit Loans in Euros or issue or cause to be issued U.K.

     Lender shall be required to fund U.S. or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans in
     Euros or issued or caused to be issued U.S. or U.K. Letters of Credit in
     Euros, if the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding principal amount of the
     U.S. and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans in Euros and the undrawn available
     amount of outstanding U.S. or U.K. Letters of Credit issued or to be issued
     and denominated in Euros exceeds $15,000,000.

             1.1.2  OVERADVANCES. Insofar as Borrower Representative may request
and Agent or Majority Lenders (as provided below) may be willing in their sole
and absolute discretion to make Revolving Credit Loans to the respective
Borrowers as to which they have Revolving Loan Commitments at a time when the
unpaid balance of Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the sum of the LC Amount PLUS the
amount of LC Obligations that have not been reimbursed by Borrowers or funded
with a Revolving Credit Loan, PLUS reserves, exceeds, or would exceed with the
making of any such Revolving Credit Loan or the incurrence of any LC Obligation,
the Aggregate Borrowing Base (any such Loan or Loans being herein referred to
individually as an "Overadvance" and collectively, as "Overadvances"), Agents
shall enter such Overadvances as debits in the applicable Loan Account. All
Overadvances shall be repaid on demand, shall be secured by the Collateral
(provided that Overadvances to U.S. Borrowers shall only be secured by the U.S.
Collateral) and shall bear interest at Default Rate as provided in this
Agreement for Base Rate Portions of Revolving Credit Loans (for the applicable
Borrower) generally. Any Overadvance made pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
made to the respective Borrowers: (i) with respect to Overadvances to U.S.
Borrowers, by all Lenders (except the U.K. Lender and the Canadian Lender)
ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Loan Percentages, (ii)
with respect to Overadvances to U.K. Borrower, by the U.K. Lender, ratably with
respect to the U.K. Lender and, following a refunding under SECTION 3.14, the
U.K. Participants and (iii) with respect to Overadvances to the Canadian
Borrowers, by the Canadian Lender, ratably with respect to the Canadian Lender
and, following a refunding under SECTION 3.13, the Canadian Participants.
Overadvances in the aggregate amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000 or
less may, unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
be made in the sole and absolute discretion of Agent. Overadvances in an
aggregate amount of more than the Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000 but less than
the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 may, unless a Default or an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, be made in the sole and absolute discretion of
the Majority Lenders. Overadvances in an aggregate amount of the Dollar
Equivalent of $5,000,000 or more and Overadvances to be made after the
occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default shall
require the consent of all Lenders. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no event,
unless otherwise consented to by all Lenders, (w) shall any Overadvances be
outstanding for more than 90 consecutive days, (x) after all outstanding
Overadvances have been repaid, shall Agents or Lenders make any additional
Overadvances unless 30 days or more have expired since the last date on which
any Overadvances were outstanding, (y) shall Overadvances be outstanding on more
than 120 days within any one 180 day period or (z) shall Agents make Revolving
Credit Loans on behalf of Lenders under this SUBSECTION 1.1.2 to the extent such
Revolving Credit Loans would cause a Lender's share of the Revolving Credit
Loans to exceed such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment MINUS such Lender's
Revolving Loan Percentage of the LC Amount.

             1.1.3  USE OF PROCEEDS. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be used
solely for (i) the satisfaction of existing Indebtedness of Borrowers and their
Affiliates to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and Borrowers' other existing
senior secured lenders, (ii) Borrowers'

                                        5
<Page>

ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes in a manner
consistent with this Agreement and all applicable laws, and (iii) other purposes
permitted under this Agreement.

             1.1.4  AGENT LOANS. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, each Agent, in its sole discretion, may make Revolving
Credit Loans to the Borrowers to which it has a Revolving Loan Commitment on
behalf of the applicable Lender(s) (to (i) U.S. Borrowers, in Dollars or Euros,
(ii) U.K. Borrower, in Sterling or Euros and (iii) Canadian Borrowers, in
Canadian Dollars), so long as the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit
Loans shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000, if Agents, in their
reasonable business judgment, deem that such Revolving Credit Loans are
necessary or desirable (i) to protect all or any portion of the Collateral, (ii)
to enhance the likelihood, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and
the other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to any
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation costs, fees
and expenses as described in SECTIONS 2.9 and 2.10 (such Revolving Credit Loans,
hereinafter, "Agent Loans"); PROVIDED, that (a) in no event shall the maximum
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the LC Obligations exceed the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments, (b) Majority Lenders may at any time
revoke Agents' authorization to make Agent Loans (any such revocation must be in
writing and shall become effective prospectively upon Agent's receipt thereof),
and (c) any Revolving Credit Loans made to protect all or any portion of the
Canadian Collateral or the U.K. Collateral shall not be made to U.S. Borrower.
Each applicable Lender shall be obligated to advance to the applicable Borrower
its Revolving Loan Percentage of each Agent Loan made in accordance with this
SUBSECTION 1.1.4. If Agent Loans are made in accordance with the preceding
sentence, then (a) the Aggregate Borrowing Base and the U.K. Borrowing Base,
U.S. Borrowing Base or Canadian Borrowing Base, as applicable, shall be deemed
increased by the amount of such permitted Agent Loans, but only for so long as
Agents allow such Agent Loans to be outstanding, and (b) all Lenders shall be
bound to make, or permit to remain outstanding, such Agent Loans based upon
their Revolving Loan Percentages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
All Agent Loans shall be repaid on demand, shall be secured by the Collateral
(PROVIDED that Agent Loans to U.S. Borrowers shall only be secured by the U.S.
Collateral) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate as provided in this
Agreement for Base Rate Portions of Revolving Credit Loans (for the applicable
Borrower) generally.

     1.2     LETTERS OF CREDIT; LC GUARANTIES.

                    (a)  U.S. LETTERS OF CREDIT; U.S. LC GUARANTIES. Agent
     agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists and if
     requested by Borrower Representative on behalf of U.S. Borrower, to (i)
     issue or cause to be issued by Bank or another Affiliate of Agent, on the
     date requested by Borrower Representative, U.S. Letters of Credit for the
     account of any U.S. Borrowers or (ii) execute U.S. LC Guaranties by which
     Agent, Bank, or another Affiliate of Agent, on the date requested by
     Borrower Representative, shall guaranty the payment or performance by U.S.
     Borrowers of their reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of
     credit and letters of credit issued for U.S. Borrowers' account by other
     Persons in support of U.S. Borrowers' obligations (other than obligations
     for the repayment of Money Borrowed); PROVIDED that the U.S. LC Obligations
     shall not exceed $20,000,000 at any time. Such U.S. Letters of Credit and
     U.S. LC Guaranties shall be denominated in Dollars or Euros. Unless

                                        6
<Page>

     otherwise consented to by Agent, no U.S. Letter of Credit or U.S. LC
     Guaranty that is a (i) standby letter of credit shall have an expiration
     date greater than one year from the date of issuance (provided that any
     standby letter of credit with a one-year term may provide for the customary
     evergreen renewals thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in
     no event extend beyond the date referred to in the immediately succeeding
     sentence)) or (ii) documentary letter of credit shall have an expiration
     date greater than 180 days from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding
     anything else herein to the contrary, no U.S. Letter of Credit or U.S. LC
     Guaranty may have an expiration date after the last day of the Term.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, U.S. Borrower,
     Agent and Lenders hereby agree that all U.S. LC Obligations and all
     obligations of U.S. Borrowers relating thereto shall be satisfied by the
     prompt issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans in Dollars to U.S.
     Borrowers that are Base Rate Portions, which U.S. Borrowers hereby
     acknowledge are requested and Lenders hereby agree to fund. If the draw on
     the underlying U.S. Letter of Credit or U.S. LC Guaranty is paid in Euros,
     the applicable Revolving Credit Loan shall be in the amount of the Dollar
     Equivalent of such draw. In the event that Revolving Credit Loans to U.S.
     Borrowers are not, for any reason, promptly made to satisfy all then
     existing U.S. LC Obligations, each Lender hereby agrees to pay to Agent, on
     demand, an amount equal to such U.S. LC Obligations MULTIPLIED BY such
     Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage, and until so paid, such amount shall be
     secured by the U.S. Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at
     the same rate and in the same manner as Base Rate Portions for Revolving
     Credit Loans to U.S. Borrowers. Immediately upon the issuance of a U.S.
     Letter of Credit or a U.S. LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each Lender
     shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and
     received from Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest
     and participation therein equal to the amount of such U.S. Letter of Credit
     or U.S. LC Guaranty MULTIPLIED BY such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage.
     The form of any U.S. Letter of Credit, U.K. Letter of Credit or Canadian
     Letter of Credit shall be reasonably acceptable to Agent and Borrower
     Representative. U.S. Letters of Credit, U.K. Letters of Credit and Canadian
     Letters of Credit shall be issued in accordance with the Uniform Customs
     and Practice for Documentary Credits then in effect and adopted by Bank
     (with respect to U.S. Letters of Credit), Fleet U.K. (with respect to U.K.
     Letters of Credit) or Fleet Canada (with respect to Canadian Letters of
     Credit).

                    (b)  U.K. LETTERS OF CREDIT; U.K. LC GUARANTIES. As of the
     U.K. Effective Date, U.K. Agent will cause Fleet U.K., and Fleet U.K.
     agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists and if
     requested by Borrower Representative on behalf of U.K. Borrower, to issue
     its, or cause an Affiliate of Fleet U.K. to issue, on the date requested by
     Borrower Representative, U.K. Letters of Credit for the account of U.K.
     Borrower in support of U.K. Borrower's obligations (other than obligations
     for the repayment of Money Borrowed); PROVIDED that the U.K. LC Obligations
     shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $10,000,000 at any time and all
     U.K. Letters of Credit and U.K. LC Guaranties shall be denominated in
     Sterling or Euros. Unless otherwise consented to by Agent, no U.K. Letter
     of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty that is a (i) standby letter of credit shall
     have an expiration date greater than one year from the date of issuance
     (provided that any standby letter of credit with a one-year term may
     provide for customary evergreen renewals (which shall in no event extend
     beyond the date referred to

                                        7
<Page>

     in the immediately succeeding sentence)) or (ii) documentary letter of
     credit shall have an expiration date greater than 180 days from the date of
     issuance. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, no U.K.
     Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty may have an expiration date after the
     last day of the Term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
     herein, U.K. Borrower and U.K. Lender hereby agree that all U.K. LC
     Obligations and all obligations of U.K. Borrower relating thereto shall be
     satisfied by the prompt issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans to
     U.K. Borrower that are Base Rate Portions, which U.K. Borrower hereby
     acknowledges are requested and U.K. Lender hereby agrees to fund. If the
     draw on the underlying U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty is paid in
     Sterling, the applicable Revolving Credit Loan shall be in Sterling. If the
     draw amount on the underlying U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty is
     paid in Euros, the applicable Revolving Credit Loan shall be in Euros. In
     the event that Revolving Credit Loans to U.K. Borrower is not, for any
     reason, promptly made to satisfy all then existing U.K. LC Obligations,
     U.K. Lender hereby agrees to pay to U.K. Agent, on demand, an amount equal
     to the Dollar Equivalent of such U.K. LC Obligations (paid in the currency
     of such U.K. LC Obligations), and until so paid, such amount shall be
     secured by the Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the
     same rate and in the same manner as Base Rate Portions for Revolving Credit
     Loans to U.K. Borrower. Immediately upon the issuance of a U.K. Letter of
     Credit or a U.K. LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each U.K. Participant
     shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and
     received from U.K. Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
     interest and participation therein equal to such U.K. LC Amount and the
     Dollar Equivalent of the U.K. LC Guaranty.

                    (c)  CANADIAN LETTERS OF CREDIT; CANADIAN LC GUARANTIES.
     Canadian Agent will cause Fleet Canada, and Fleet Canada agrees, for so
     long as no Default or Event of Default exists and if requested by Borrower
     Representative on behalf of any Canadian Borrower, to (i) issue its, or
     cause an Affiliate of Fleet Canada to issue, on the date requested by
     Borrower Representative, Canadian Letters of Credit for the account of
     Canadian Borrowers or (ii) execute Canadian LC Guaranties by which Fleet

     Representative, shall guaranty the payment or performance by Canadian
     Borrowers of their reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of

     greater than one year from the date of issuance (PROVIDED that any standby
     letter of credit with a one-year term may provide for customary evergreen
     renewals (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the
     immediately succeeding sentence)) or (ii) documentary letter of credit
     shall have an expiration date greater than 180 days from the date of
     issuance. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, no Canadian

     thereto shall be satisfied by the prompt issuance of one or more Revolving
     Credit Loans to Canadian Borrowers that are Base Rate Portions, which
     Canadian Borrowers hereby acknowledge are requested and Canadian Lender
     hereby agrees to fund. In the event that Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian
     Borrowers are not, for any reason, promptly made to satisfy all then
     existing Canadian LC Obligations, Canadian Lender hereby agrees to pay to
     Canadian Agent, on demand, an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such

     contrary, the Dollar Equivalent of the LC Amount shall not exceed the
     lesser of (i) Aggregate Borrowing Availability or (ii) $20,000,000 at any
     time.

     1.3     GUARANTEES; LIMITATIONS ON U.K. BORROWER'S AND CANADIAN BORROWERS'
             LIABILITY.

                    (a)  U.S. Borrowers hereby absolutely and unconditionally
     guarantee to Agents and each Lender and their respective successors and
     assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by
     acceleration or otherwise) and performance of the Obligations of U.K.
     Borrower and Canadian Borrowers hereunder and under all Loan Documents. As
     of the U.K. Effective Date, U.K. Borrower hereby absolutely and
     unconditionally guarantees to Agents and each Lender and their respective
     successors and assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated
     maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of the Obligations
     of Canadian Borrowers hereunder and under all Loan Documents. Canadian
     Borrowers hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantee to Agents and
     each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, the full and
     prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise)
     and performance of the Obligations of U.K. Borrower hereunder and under all
     Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, U.K.
     Borrower and Canadian Borrowers shall have no liability, direct or
     indirect, for the Obligations of U.S. Borrowers hereunder or under any Loan
     Documents.

                    (b)  Each of the Borrowers agrees that its guaranty
     obligation under SECTION 1.3(a) hereof is a continuing guaranty of payment
     and performance and not of collection, that its obligations under this
     SECTION 1.3 shall not be discharged until payment and performance, in full,
     of the Obligations has occurred, and that its obligations under this
     SECTION 1.3 shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and
     unaffected by,

                                        9
<Page>

                         (i)    the genuineness, validity, regularity,
             enforceability or any future amendment of, or change in, this
             Agreement, or any other Loan Document (including any provision
             hereof or thereof) or any other agreement, document or instrument
             to which any other Borrower of the Obligations is or may become a
             party;

                         (ii)   the absence of any action to enforce this
             Agreement or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by
             Agents and any Lender with respect to any of the provisions
             thereof;

                         (iii)  the existence, value or condition of, or failure
             to perfect its Lien against, any security for the Obligations or
             any action, or the absence of any action, by Agents and Lenders in
             respect thereof (including the release of any such security);

                         (iv)   the insolvency of any Borrower of the
             Obligations; or

                         (v)    any other action or circumstances that might
             otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
             surety or guarantor.

                    Subject to the last sentence of SECTION 1.3(a), each
     Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal
     debtor with respect to the Obligations of the other Borrowers guaranteed
     hereunder.

                    (c)  Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may have
     now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in
     equity, or otherwise, to compel Agents or Lenders to marshal assets or to
     proceed in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder against any
     other Borrower, any other party or against any security for the payment and
     performance of the Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition
     to proceeding against, any of the other Borrowers. Each Borrower also
     expressly waives the benefits of division and discussion under the Civil
     Code of Quebec. It is agreed among Borrowers, Agents and Lenders that the
     foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by
     this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that, but for the
     provisions of this SECTION 1.3 and such waivers, Agents and Lenders would
     decline to enter into this Agreement.

                    (d)  Subject to the last sentence of SECTION 1.3(a) and
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other
     Loan Document, each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this SECTION 1.3
     are for the benefit of Agents and Lenders and their respective successors,
     transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall
     impair, as among Borrowers and Agents or Lenders, the obligations of the
     other Borrowers under the Loan Documents.

                    (e)  Subject to the last sentence of SECTION 1.3(a) and
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other
     Loan Document, each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably waives all
     rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
     contribution, indemnification or set off and any and all defenses available
     to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the

                                       10
<Page>

     payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of the Revolving
     Loan Commitments. Borrowers acknowledge and agree that this waiver is
     intended to benefit Agents and Lenders, and their respective successors and
     assigns, and shall not limit or otherwise affect their liability hereunder
     or the enforceability of this SECTION 1.3, and that Agents, Lenders and
     their respective successors and assigns are intended third party
     beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this SECTION 1.3.

                    (f)  If Agents or any Lender may, under applicable law,
     proceed to realize their benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving
     Agents or such Lender a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any
     Borrower or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or sale or
     by non-judicial sale or enforcement, Agents or any Lender may, at their
     sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue
     without affecting any of its rights and remedies under this SECTION 1.3.
     If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agents or any Lender
     shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a
     deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether
     because of any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the
     like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by such of the Agents or
     such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such
     action by Agents or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of
     any rights of subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but
     for such action by such of the Agents or such Lender. Any election of
     remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of Agents or
     any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not,
     subject to the last sentence of SECTION 1.3(a), impair any other Borrower's
     obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. In the event Agents
     or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's or receiver's sale
     or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Agents or
     such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the
     amount of such bid need not be paid by Agents or such Lender but shall be
     credited against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any
     such sale, whether Agent or any Lender or other party is the successful
     bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the
     Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining
     balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of
     the Obligations guaranteed under this SECTION 1.3, notwithstanding that any
     present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of
     reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agents or any Lender
     might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.

                    (g)  Subject to the last sentence of SECTION 1.3(a), the
     liability of Borrowers under this SECTION 1.3 is in addition to and shall
     be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to Agents and Lenders
     under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower is
     a party, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or
     agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides
     to the contrary.

     1.4     CONVERSION TO DOLLARS.

                    (a)  All valuations or computations of monetary amounts set
     forth in this Agreement shall include the Dollar Equivalent of amounts in
     Canadian Dollars,

                                       11
<Page>

     Sterling and Euros. In connection with all Dollar amounts set forth in this
     Agreement, and the Aggregate Borrowing Base, U.S. Borrowing Base, U.K.
     Borrowing Base and Canadian Borrowing Base calculations, all Canadian
     Dollars, Euros and Sterling shall be converted to Dollars in accordance
     with the following procedure:

                         (i)    Conversions to Dollars shall occur in accordance
             with prevailing exchange rates, as determined by Agent in its sole
             discretion, on the applicable date; and

                         (ii)   Outstanding Loans denominated in Canadian
             Dollars, Sterling and Euros shall be marked to market on the date
             on which Borrower Representative is required to deliver to Agent
             Borrowing Base Certificates as provided in section 8.1.4 hereof (or
             more often as determined by Agent in its commercially reasonable
             discretion), taking into account in each case the Dollar Equivalent
             of all Revolving Credit Loans outstanding in Canadian Dollars,
             Sterling and Euros.

                    (b)  Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this
     Agreement, monetary amounts shall be in Dollars.

     1.5     JUDGMENT CURRENCY; CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY.

                    (a)  If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
     against any Borrower in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary
     to convert into any other currency (such other currency being hereinafter
     in this SECTION 1.5 referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due
     under any Loan Document in any currency (the "Obligation Currency") other
     than the Judgment Currency, the conversion shall be made at the rate of
     exchange prevailing on the Business Day immediately preceding (i) the date
     of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in the
     courts of any jurisdiction that will give effect to such conversion being
     made on such date, or (ii) the date on which the judgment is given, in the
     case of any proceeding in the courts of any other jurisdiction (the
     applicable date as of which such conversion is made pursuant to this
     SECTION 1.5 being hereinafter in this SECTION 1.5 referred to as the
     "Judgment Conversion Date").

                    (b)  If, in the case of any proceeding in the court of any
     jurisdiction referred to in SECTION 1.5(a), there is a change in the rate
     of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of
     actual receipt for value of the amount due, the applicable Borrower shall
     pay such additional amount (if any, but in any event not a lesser amount)
     as may be necessary to ensure that the amount actually received in the
     Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
     date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which
     could have been purchased with the amount of the Judgment Currency
     stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the rate of exchange
     prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date. Any amount due from a Borrower
     under this SECTION 1.5(b) shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be
     affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due under or in
     respect of any of the Loan Documents.

                                       12
<Page>

                    (c)  The term "rate of exchange" in this SECTION 1.5 means
     the rate of exchange at which Agent would, on the relevant date at or about
     12:00 noon (Chicago time), be prepared to sell the Obligation Currency
     against the Judgment Currency.

                    (d)  Any amount received or recovered by Agents in respect
     of any sum expressed to be due to them (whether for itself or as trustee
     for any other person) from any Borrower under this Agreement or under any
     of the other Loan Documents in a currency other than the currency (the
     "contractual currency") in which such sum is so expressed to be due
     (whether as a result of, or from the enforcement of, any judgment or order
     of a court or tribunal of any jurisdiction, the winding-up of a Borrower or
     otherwise) shall only constitute a discharge of such Borrower to the extent
     of the amount of the contractual currency that the relevant Agent is able,
     in accordance with its usual practice, to purchase with the amount of the
     currency so received or recovered on the date of receipt or recovery (or,
     if later, the first date on which such purchase is practicable). If the
     amount of the contractual currency so purchased is less than the amount of
     the contractual currency so expressed to be due, such Borrower shall
     indemnify the relevant Agent against any loss sustained by it as a result,
     including the cost of making any such purchase.

                                    SECTION 2

                           INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES

     accrue on the principal amount of the Base Rate Revolving Portions

     day at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect PLUS
     the Canadian BA Rate applicable to each Canadian BA Rate Loan for the

                    (d)  Unless Borrower Representative is otherwise
     advised by Agent, interest and Letter of Credit and LC Guaranty fees shall
     be payable solely in the currency in which the underlying Revolving Credit
     Loan is made or Letter or Credit or LC Guaranty is issued.

             2.1.2  DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST. At the option of Agent or at the
discretion of Majority Lenders, upon and after the occurrence of an Event of
Default and during the continuation thereof, the principal amount of all Loans
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.0% PLUS the interest rate
otherwise applicable thereto (the "Default Rate") and the per annum Applicable
Margin in effect for letter of credit fees shall be increased by 2%.

             2.1.3  MAXIMUM INTEREST.

                    (a)  In no event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all
     amounts deemed interest hereunder or under the Notes and charged or
     collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to the Notes
     exceed the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of
     competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable
     hereto. If any provisions of this Agreement or the Notes are in
     contravention of any such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to
     conform thereto (the "Maximum Rate"). If at any time, the amount of
     interest paid hereunder is limited by the Maximum Rate, and the amount at
     which interest accrues hereunder is subsequently below the Maximum Rate,
     the rate at which interest accrues hereunder shall remain at the Maximum
     Rate, until such time as the aggregate interest paid hereunder equals the
     amount of interest that would have been paid had the Maximum Rate not
     applied.

                                       14
<Page>

                    (b)  Without limiting SUBSECTION 2.1.3(a), if any provision
     of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents would obligate
     Canadian Borrowers to make any payment of interest under the Canadian
     Obligations or the U.K. Obligations or other amount in an amount or
     calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would result in a
     receipt by the applicable recipient of interest under the Canadian or U.K.
     Obligations at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the
     Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount
     or rates shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to
     the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be
     so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by the applicable recipient
     of interest under the Canadian or U.K. Obligations at a criminal rate, such
     adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1)
     firstly, by reducing the amount or rates of interest required to be paid to
     the applicable recipient under this SUBSECTION 2.1.3(b); and (2)
     thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts
     required to be paid to the applicable recipient which would constitute
     interest under the Canadian or U.K. Obligations for purposes of Section 347
     of the Criminal Code (Canada). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after
     giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if the applicable
     recipient shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted
     by that section of the Criminal Code (Canada), then the applicable
     recipient shall be entitled, by notice in writing to Canadian Agent at the
     Appropriate Notice Office, to obtain reimbursement from the applicable
     recipient in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such
     reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by the
     applicable recipient to Canadian Borrowers. Any amount or rate of interest
     under the Canadian Obligations or the U.K. Obligations referred to in this
     SUBSECTION 2.1.3 shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted
     actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest
     over the term that any Canadian Revolving Credit Loan to Canadian Borrowers
     or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans to U.K. Borrower, as applicable, remains
     outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall
     within the meaning of "INTEREST" (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada))
     shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be PRO RATED over that
     period of time and otherwise be PRO RATED over the period from the Closing
     Date to the date all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and
     all Canadian Lender's Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated and,
     in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian
     Institute of Actuaries appointed by Canadian Agent shall be conclusive for
     the purposes of such determination.

                    (c)  For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act
     (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of
     interest or fees provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
     for the Canadian Obligations (and stated herein or therein, as applicable,
     to be computed on the basis of a 360-day year or any other period of time
     less than a calendar year) are equivalent to the rates so determined
     multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and
     divided by 360 or such other period of time, respectively.

     2.2     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest, Letter of Credit and LC
Guaranty fees and Unused Line Fees hereunder shall be calculated daily and shall
be computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days (except
for the U.K. Obligations denominated in Sterling, which shall each be based on a
365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be). Unless

                                       15
<Page>

otherwise set forth herein, all fees and interest shall be paid in the same
currency as the underlying Revolving Credit Loan is made or Letter of Credit or
LC Guaranty is issued for which such fee or interest is associated.

     2.3     FEE LETTER. Borrowers shall pay to Agents certain fees and other
amounts in accordance with the terms of the fee letter among Borrowers and
Agents (the "Fee Letter").

     2.4     LETTER OF CREDIT AND LC GUARANTY FEES. Each applicable Borrower
shall pay to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, for standby and
documentary Letters of Credit and LC Guaranties of standby and documentary
letters of credit issued without duplication, for the ratable benefit of the
applicable Lenders a per annum fee equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect
of the aggregate available amount of such U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S. LC
Guaranties, Canadian Letters of Credit and Canadian LC Guaranties and U.K.
Letters of Credit and U.K. LC Guaranties, issued for the account of that
Borrower and outstanding from time to time during the term of this Agreement,
PLUS a fronting fee (for the account of Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable)
equal to 0.125% per annum of the aggregate available amount of such U.S. Letters
of Credit, U.S. LC Guaranties, U.K. Letters of Credit, U.K. LC Guaranties,
Canadian Letters of Credit and Canadian LC Guaranties, PLUS all normal and
customary charges of the Agent, Bank, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, associated with the issuance and administration thereof, which fees
and charges shall be deemed fully earned upon issuance of each such Letter of
Credit or LC Guaranty or as advised by Agent, Bank or U.K. Agent, as applicable,
and shall be due and payable on the first Business Day of each month or as
advised by Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, and shall not be subject to
rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

     2.5     ADDITIONAL FEES. U.S. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the benefit
of each Lender (except the U.K. Lender and the Canadian Lender) in accordance
with its Revolving Loan Percentage, a fee (the "Unused Line Fee") equal to the
Applicable Margin per annum multiplied by the average daily amount by which the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Dollar Equivalent
of the outstanding principal balance of the sum of the U.S. Revolving Credit
Loans, U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and Canadian Revolving Credit Loans, PLUS
(ii) the LC Amount. The Unused Line Fee shall be paid in Dollars. The Unused
Line Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month
hereafter.

     2.6     FRONTING FEES AND PARTICIPATION FEES. When and as interest is
collected on Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and
until the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans are
refunded in accordance with SECTIONS 3.13 and 3.14, Canadian Agent and U.K.
Agent, respectively, shall pay to Canadian Lender and U.K. Lender, respectively,
a fee (with respect to Canadian Lender, the "Canadian Fronting Fee," with
respect to the U.K. Lender, the "U.K. Fronting Fee" and collectively, the
"Fronting Fee") equal to 1/8th of one percent (0.125%) of the outstanding
principal balances of the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving
Credit Loans, respectively, at such time, and Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent
shall pay to each Canadian Participant and U.K. Participant, respectively, a
participation fee (a "Participation Fee") equal to the product of such Canadian
Participant's or U.K. Participant's, as applicable, corresponding Lender's
Revolving Loan Percentage and that portion of interest collected equal to the
sum of Applicable Margins then in effect with respect to each of the Canadian
Revolving Credit Loans and the U.K.

                                       16
<Page>

Revolving Credit Loans, respectively, for the relevant interest payment period
PLUS any Default Rate then in effect, less the product of such Canadian
Participant's or U.K. Participant's Revolving Loan Percentage and the Fronting
Fee. If any Borrower pays less than all of the interest then due and owing by it
for any period, that portion of the interest equating to the Participation Fee
shall be deemed to be the last portion of interest paid or to be paid.

     2.7     PREPAYMENT FEE. At the effective date of termination of this
Agreement for any reason or upon a reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments
in an aggregate amount in excess of $20,000,000 at the election of Borrowers,
U.S. Borrowers shall pay to Agents, for the ratable benefit of each Lender
(except the U.K. Lender and the Canadian Lender) (in addition to the then
outstanding principal, accrued interest and other charges owing under the terms
of this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents) and any amounts owing
pursuant to SUBSECTION 3.2.5, as liquidated damages for the loss of the bargain
and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 1.0% of such reduction in excess of an
aggregate amount of $20,000,000 or the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments
terminated if such reduction or termination occurs during the first twelve-month
period of the Term (December __, 2002 through December __, 2003) and 0.5% of
such reduction or the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments terminated if such
reduction or termination occurs during the second 12-month period of the Term
(December __, 2003 through December __, 2004). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) if the Revolving Loan Commitments are terminated with proceeds of financing
provided by Fleet, Fleet Canada, Fleet U.K. or an Affiliate thereof (including a
financing provided by any such Person together with other lenders under a
facility agented by any such Person), then any prepayment fee shall be waived or
(y) if the Revolving Loan Commitments are terminated after Borrowers' cost of
funds have increased by one-half of one percent (1/2%) or more pursuant to the
provisions of SECTION 3.8 of this Agreement, then any such prepayment fee shall
be waived. Any reduction of Revolving Credit Loan Commitments shall be PRO RATA
to the U.S. Revolving Credit Loan Commitment, U.K. Revolving Credit Loan
Commitment and Canadian Revolving Credit Loan Commitment. Each Borrower shall
pay to Agent, U.K. Agent and Canadian Agent, as applicable, that portion of the
fee attributable to the Revolving Credit Loan Commitment available to it. Any
termination of Revolving Credit Loan Commitments shall apply to all three
Revolving Credit Loan Commitments.

     2.8     AUDIT FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, Canadian Agent and U.K.
Agent, as applicable, audit fees in accordance with Agent's current schedule of

records and Collateral of Borrowers and such other matters as Agents shall deem
appropriate in their reasonable credit judgment, PLUS all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Agents in connection with such audits,
whether such audits are conducted by employees of Agents or by third parties
hired by Agents; PROVIDED that U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrowers shall not be
responsible for such fees and expenses incurred with respect to U.S. Borrowers.
Such audit fees and out-of-pocket expenses shall be payable on the first day of
the month following the date of issuance by Agents of a request for payment
thereof to Borrowers. Agents may, in their discretion, provide for the payment
of such amounts by making appropriate Revolving Credit Loans to the applicable
Borrower and charging the applicable Borrower Loan Account therefor. The
foregoing notwithstanding, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the maximum annual amount Borrowers shall be required to pay Agents
with respect to such audit fees shall be $15,000 PLUS any external consulting
costs incurred in conjunction with the audits of U.K. Borrower.

     2.9     REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES. If, at any time or times regardless of
whether or not an Event of Default then exists: (i) Agents incur legal or
accounting expenses or any other out-of-pocket expenses or costs in connection
with (1) the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, any amendment of or modification of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, or (2) the administration of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or
(ii) Agents or any Lender incurs reasonable legal or accounting expenses or any
other out-of-pocket expenses or costs in connection with (1) any litigation,
contest, dispute, suit, proceeding or action (whether instituted by Agents, any
Lender, any Borrower or any other Person) relating to the Collateral, this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any Borrower's affairs, (2) any
attempt to enforce any rights of Agents or any Lender against Borrowers or any
other Person which may be obligated to Agents or any Lender by virtue of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the
Account Debtors, or (3) any attempt to inspect, verify, protect, preserve,
restore, collect, sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the
Collateral; then all such legal and accounting expenses and other out-of-pocket
expenses and costs of Agents or any Lender, as applicable, shall be charged to
the applicable Borrower; PROVIDED, that such Borrower shall not be responsible
for such out-of-pocket expenses and costs to the extent incurred because of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agents or any Lender; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrowers shall not be responsible for
such out-of-pocket costs and expenses, incurred with respect to U.S. Borrowers.
All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this SECTION 2.9 shall be Obligations
secured by all of the Collateral (provided that amounts chargeable to U.S.
Borrowers shall not be secured by U.K. Collateral or Canadian Collateral), shall
be payable on demand to Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, and shall
bear interest from the date such demand is made until paid in full at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Revolving Portions (or, in the case of Canadian Agent or
Canadian Lender, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) from time to time. The applicable
Borrower shall also reimburse Agents for expenses incurred by Agents in their
administration of the Collateral to the extent and in the manner provided in
SECTIONS 2.10 and 2.11 hereof.

     2.10    BANK CHARGES. Each Borrower shall pay to Agents, on demand, any and
all fees, costs or expenses which Agents or any Lender pays to a bank or other
similar institution arising out of or in connection with (i) the forwarding to
such Borrower or any other Person on behalf of such Borrower, by Agents or any
Lender, of proceeds of Loans made to such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) the depositing for collection by Agents or any Lender of any check or item
of payment received or delivered to Agents or any Lender on account of the
Obligations of such Borrower and (iii) the costs and expenses incurred in
opening and maintaining blocked accounts; PROVIDED, that U.K. Borrower and
Canadian Borrowers shall not be responsible for such fees and expenses incurred
with respect to U.S. Borrowers.

     2.11    COLLATERAL PROTECTION EXPENSES. All out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in protecting, storing, warehousing, insuring, handling, maintaining and
shipping the Collateral, and any and all excise, property, sales, and use taxes
imposed by any state, provincial, federal, or local authority on any of the
Collateral or in respect of the sale thereof shall be borne and paid by
Borrowers; PROVIDED, that U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrowers shall not be
liable for any such expenses incurred with respect to U.S. Borrowers. If
Borrowers fail to promptly pay any

                                       18
<Page>

portion thereof when due, Agents may, at their option, but shall not be required
to, pay the same and charge the applicable Borrower therefor.

     2.12    PAYMENT OF CHARGES. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this
Agreement shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral (provided that
amounts chargeable to U.S. Borrowers shall not be payable by U.K. Borrower or
Canadian Borrowers and shall not be secured by U.K. Collateral or Canadian
Collateral). All such Obligations shall be, unless specifically otherwise
provided, payable on demand and shall bear interest from the date demand was
made or such amount is due, as applicable, until paid in full at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Revolving Portions (or, in the case of Canadian
Obligations, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) from time to time.

     2.13    NO DEDUCTIONS. Any and all payments or reimbursements made
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be made in Dollars, Euros,
Canadian Dollars or Sterling, as applicable, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, however, the
following: franchise or capital taxes and taxes imposed on the net income of
Agents, or any Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which Agents or any Lender or Canadian
Participant or U.K. Participant is organized or doing business or any political
subdivision thereof and franchise or capital taxes and taxes imposed on its net
income by the jurisdiction of Agents' or such Lender's or Canadian Participant's
or U.K. Participant's applicable lending office or any political subdivision
thereof (all such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings
and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding such franchise or capital
taxes and taxes imposed on net income, herein "Tax Liabilities"). If any
Borrower, any Lender or any Agent shall be required by law or the administration
thereof to deduct any such Tax Liabilities from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Agent or any Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
Participant, then the sum payable by the relevant Borrower hereunder or under
the relevant other Loan Document shall be increased as may be necessary so that,
after all required deductions are made, the applicable Agent, any such Lender,
Canadian Participant and U.K. Participant, as applicable, receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.
Whenever any Tax Liabilities are deducted by any Borrower, as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Borrower Representative shall send to Agent (or in
the case of Canadian Borrowers, Canadian Agent, or in the case of U.K. Borrower,
U.K. Agent) for its own account or for the account of the applicable Lender or
Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by any such Borrower showing payment thereof or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (or Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as the case may be). If any Borrower fails to pay any Tax
Liabilities when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fail to remit to
Agent (or in the case of Canadian Borrowers, Canadian Agent, or in the case of
U.K. Borrower, U.K. Agent) the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, each Borrower shall indemnify Agents and the Lenders and Canadian
Participants and U.K. Participants for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by Agents and the Lenders and Canadian
Participants and U.K. Participants as a result of any such failure. Without
limiting the foregoing, (x) U.K. Borrower shall also indemnify and hold harmless
(without duplication) U.K. Agent, U.K. Lender and U.K. Participants against any
and all arrangements relating to the refunding pursuant to SECTION 3.14 of this
Agreement of U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and (y) Canadian Borrowers shall also
indemnify and hold harmless

                                       19
<Page>

(without duplication) Canadian Agent, Canadian Lender and Canadian Participants
against any and all arrangements relating to the refunding pursuant to SECTION
3.13 of this Agreement of Canadian Revolving Credit Loans. The covenants in this
SECTION 2.13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of the
Obligations.

                    (a)  If Agents or a Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
     Participant during the Term of this Agreement shall become aware that it is
     entitled to claim a refund of tax from the jurisdiction to which the tax
     was paid, which refund, in the BONA FIDE discretion of Agents or such
     Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant, is allocable to the
     payment of any Tax Liabilities which Borrowers have paid, or indemnified
     Agents or such Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant pursuant
     to this SECTION 2.13, Agents or such Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
     Participant shall promptly notify Borrowers in writing of the availability
     of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days of receipt of a written
     request by Borrowers, make a claim to such jurisdiction for such refund at
     Borrowers' sole expense. If, during the Term of this Agreement, Agents or a
     Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant receives a refund of any
     such Tax Liabilities, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt
     pay over such amount of such refund to Borrowers PLUS any interest that is
     properly attributable to such refund as will leave Agents and such Lender
     and Canadian Participant and U.K. Participant (after that payment) in the
     same after-tax position as it would have been in if the Tax Liabilities had
     not been paid by, or indemnification had not been made by, Borrowers.

                    (b)  To the extent that any portion of the Participation Fee
     is payable to a Canadian Participant that is non-resident of Canada for
     purposes of the tax imposed pursuant to Part XIII of the Income Tax Act
     (Canada) or any successor provision thereto (a "Nonresident Canadian
     Participant"), Canadian Agent shall deduct and remit such tax to the
     Receiver General for Canada within the time payable by law, and shall
     increase such portion of the Participation Fee as may be necessary so that
     after all required deductions of such tax are made, the Nonresident
     Canadian Participant receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
     received had no such deductions been made. The Canadian Borrowers shall
     forthwith on demand remit to the Canadian Agent the full amount of the
     aforesaid increase; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Borrower will make such
     payment with respect to Tax Liabilities described in the proviso to the
     second sentence of this SECTION 2.13. Each of the Canadian Agent, Canadian
     Lender and each Canadian Participant represents and warrants to the
     Canadian Borrowers and to the Canadian Agent that, as of the date of this
     Agreement or, in the case of a Canadian Participant which is not a party to
     this Agreement on the date hereof, on the date it becomes a Canadian
     Participant, it is not a non-resident of Canada within the meaning of the
     Income Tax Act (Canada). Provided that no Default or Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, the Canadian Lender covenants and agrees with
     the Canadian Borrowers that it will not assign, sell or grant
     participations in its extensions of credit under this Agreement to any
     Person who is a non-resident of Canada within the meaning of the Income Tax
     Act (Canada). In the event that any of the Canadian Agent, the Canadian
     Lender or any Canadian Participant becomes a non-resident of Canada within
     the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), such party shall immediately
     notify the Canadian Borrowers and the Canadian Borrowers shall have the
     option to prepay that portion of the Canadian

                                       20
<Page>

     Obligations attributable to such party without the payment of any
     prepayment penalty, fee or other amounts.

                    (c)  As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
     Date (or where a Person becomes a Lender or U.K. Participant as soon as
     reasonably practicable following the date it becomes a Lender or a U.K.
     Participant), each Lender and U.K. Participant in respect of which the U.K.
     Agent would need to make withholding for taxes on interest fees paid to
     them shall file Form FD13 or such other documents as may be relevant and/or
     take all other steps reasonably necessary with each relevant tax authority
     and shall complete such procedural formalities as may be necessary to
     obtain relief from the withholding requirements imposed with respect to
     United Kingdom income tax due to the United States/United Kingdom Double
     Taxation Convention. The U.K. Borrower shall not be obliged to pay any
     increased sum pursuant to SECTION 2.13 hereof where (i) income tax is
     imposed by the United Kingdom on any sum payable by U.K. Agent to a U.K.
     Participant hereunder and (ii) U.K. Borrower is able to demonstrate that
     that income tax is imposed as a result of the failure of the relevant U.K.
     Participant to comply with its obligations under this SECTION 2.13(c).
     Alternatively, if a U.K. Participant is a bank as defined in Section 840A
     of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988 of the United Kingdom, it
     shall, upon the reasonable written request of the U.K. Borrower, provide
     certifications to that effect to the U.K. Borrower.

     2.14    ALLOCATION OF FEES AND EXPENSES. Unless expressly allocated to a
specific Borrower, all fees and expenses paid pursuant to this Agreement shall
be allocated to the Borrower which pays such fees and expenses.

                                    SECTION 3

                               LOAN ADMINISTRATION

     3.1     MANNER OF BORROWING REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS/LIBOR OPTION. Borrowings
under the credit facility established pursuant to SECTION 1 hereof shall be as
follows:

             3.1.1  LOAN REQUESTS. A request for a Revolving Credit Loan shall
be made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: (a) Borrower
Representative, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, or, in the case of any
request to the U.K. Agent, the U.K. Borrower, may give Agent, or Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, with a copy to Agent at the Appropriate Notice
Office notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Agent of such Borrower's
intention to borrow, in which notice Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower
(if applicable and as the case may be) shall specify the amount of the proposed
borrowing of a Revolving Credit Loan (which shall be no less than the Dollar
Equivalent of $500,000 or an integral multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of
$100,000 in excess thereof in the case of Base Rate Revolving Portions or
borrowings under the overdraft forming part of the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans),
the currency in which the borrowing is requested (which shall be Dollars or
Euros in the case of a U.S. Revolving Credit Loan to U.S. Borrowers, Canadian
Dollars in the case of a Canadian Revolving Credit Loan to Canadian Borrowers
and Sterling or Euros in the case of a U.K. Revolving Credit Loan to U.K.
Borrower) and the proposed borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day, no
later than 10:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate

                                       21
<Page>

Notice Office) on the proposed borrowing date (or in accordance with SUBSECTION
3.1.7, 3.1.8 or 3.1.9, as applicable, in the case of a request for a LIBOR
Revolving Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no request
for a LIBOR Loan or Canadian BA Rate Loan may be made at a time when there
exists a Default or an Event of Default; and (b) the becoming due of any amount
required to be paid under this Agreement, or the Notes, whether as interest or
for any other Obligation, shall be deemed irrevocably to be a request for a
Revolving Credit Loan by the applicable Borrower on the due date in the amount
required to pay such interest or other Obligation. With respect to borrowings
under the overdraft forming part of the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans, the prior
notice requirements and minimum borrowing amounts may be waived by U.K. Agent.

             3.1.2  DISBURSEMENT. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, to disburse the proceeds of
each Loan requested, or deemed to be requested, pursuant to SUBSECTION 3.1.1 as
follows: (i) the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan requested under
SUBSECTION 3.1.1(a) shall be disbursed by Agent in Dollars or Euros, as
requested by Borrower Representative (in the case of U.S. Borrowers), by
Canadian Agent in Canadian Dollars, as requested by Borrower Representative (in
the case of Canadian Borrowers) and by U.K. Agent in Sterling or Euros, as
requested by Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (in the case of U.K.
Borrower), as applicable, in immediately available funds, in the case of the
initial borrowing, in accordance with the terms of the written disbursement
letter from Borrower Representative, and in the case of each subsequent
borrowing, by wire transfer to such bank account as may be agreed upon by
Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (as the case may be) and Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, from time to time or elsewhere if
pursuant to a written direction from Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower,
as the case may be; and (ii) the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan deemed
requested under SUBSECTION 3.1.1(b) shall be disbursed by Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, by way of direct payment of the relevant interest
or other Obligation. If at any time any Loan is funded in excess of the amount
requested or deemed requested by Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (as
the case may be), such Borrower agrees to repay the excess to Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, immediately upon the earlier to occur of (a)
such Borrower's discovery of the error and (b) notice thereof to Borrower
Representative or U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, from Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, or any Lender.

             3.1.3  PAYMENT BY LENDERS. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as applicable, shall give to each applicable Lender prompt written notice by
facsimile, telex or cable of the receipt from Borrower Representative or U.K.
Borrower of any request for a Revolving Credit Loan. Each such notice shall
specify the requested date and amount of such Revolving Credit Loan, whether
such Revolving Credit Loan shall be subject to the LIBOR Option or shall be a
Canadian BA Rate Loan, the currency of such Revolving Credit Loan, and the
amount of each such Lender's advance thereunder (in accordance with its
applicable Revolving Loan Percentage). Each such Lender shall, not later than
12:00 noon (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) on
such requested date, wire to a bank designated by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as applicable, the amount of that Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage of
the requested Revolving Credit Loan. The failure of any Lender to make the
Revolving Credit Loans to be made by it shall not release any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Loan. Neither Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent

                                       22
<Page>

nor any Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Revolving Credit Loan to be made by such other Lender. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Agent, and following a refunding of the Canadian Revolving
Credit Loan and U.K. Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with SECTIONS 3.13 and
3.14, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, in its sole discretion, may
from its own funds make a Revolving Credit Loan on behalf of the applicable
Lenders. In such event, the Lender on behalf of whom Agent, Canadian Agent or
U.K. Agent made the Revolving Credit Loan shall reimburse Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, for the amount of such Revolving Credit Loan made
on its behalf, weekly (or more frequently, as determined by Agents, in their
sole discretion). On each such settlement date, Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as applicable, will pay to each Lender the net amount owing to such
Lender in connection with such settlement, including without limitation amounts
relating to Loans, fees, interest and other amounts payable hereunder. The
entire amount of interest attributable to such Revolving Credit Loan for the
period from the date on which such Revolving Credit Loan was made on such
Lender's behalf until so reimbursed by such Lender, shall be paid to Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, for its own account.

             3.1.4  AUTHORIZATION. U.S. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize
Agent, in Agent's sole discretion, to advance to such Borrower, and to charge to
U.S. Borrowers' Loan Account hereunder as a U.S. Revolving Credit Loan in
Dollars (which shall be a Base Rate Revolving Portion), a sum sufficient to pay
all interest accrued on the U.S. Obligations when due and to pay all fees, costs
and expenses and other U.S. Obligations at any time owed by such Borrower to
Agent or Lenders hereunder. U.K. Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes U.K.
Agent, in U.K. Agent's discretion, to advance to U.K. Borrower, and to charge to
such U.K. Borrower's Loan Account hereunder as a U.K. Revolving Credit Loan in
Sterling or Euros, if chosen by U.K. Agent in its discretion, (which shall be a
Base Rate Revolving Portion), a sum sufficient to pay all interest accrued on
the U.K. Obligations when due and to pay all fees, costs and expenses and other
U.K. Obligations at any time owed by U.K. Borrower to U.K. Agent or Lenders
hereunder. Canadian Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Canadian Agent, in
Canadian Agent's sole discretion, to advance to Canadian Borrowers, and to
charge to Canadian Borrower's Loan Account hereunder as a Canadian Revolving
Credit Loan in Canadian Dollars (which shall be a Base Rate Loan), a sum
sufficient to pay all interest accrued on the Canadian Obligations when due and
to pay all fees, costs and expenses and other Canadian Obligations at any time
owed by Canadian Borrowers to Canadian Agent or Canadian Lender hereunder.

             3.1.5  LETTER OF CREDIT AND LC GUARANTY REQUESTS. A request for a
Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty shall be made in the following manner: Borrower
Representative or, in the case of notice to Fleet U.K., U.K. Borrower, may give
Agent and Bank and Fleet U.K. or Fleet Canada, as applicable, a written notice
of its request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty, not later
than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice
Office), three Business Days before the proposed issuance date thereof, in which
notice Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower shall specify whether the Letter
of Credit or LC Guaranty is to be issued on behalf of a U.S. Borrower, a
Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower, the issuance date and format and wording for
the Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty being requested (which shall be satisfactory
to Agent and Bank or U.K. Agent, as applicable, and the Person being asked to
issue such Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty); and shall include the Letter of
Credit application of the proposed issuer of the Letter of Credit, duly
completed PROVIDED, that

                                       23
<Page>

no such request may be made at a time when there exists a Default or Event of
Default. Such request shall be accompanied by an executed application and
reimbursement agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Agents and the
Person being asked to issue the Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty, as well as any
required resolutions.

             3.1.6  METHOD OF MAKING REQUESTS. As an accommodation to Borrowers,
unless a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence, (i) solely in the
case of U.S. Revolving Credit Loans to U.S. Borrower, Agent shall permit
telephonic or electronic requests for U.S. Revolving Credit Loans to Agent, (ii)
solely in the case of U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S. LC Guaranties, Agent and
Bank may, in their discretion, permit electronic transmittal of requests for
U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S. LC Guaranties to them, and (iii) Agent may, in
Agent's discretion, permit electronic transmittal of instructions,
authorizations, agreements or reports to Agent. All other instructions,
authorizations, agreements or reports must be in written hard copy form
(including by facsimile). Unless Borrower Representative specifically directs
Agent or Bank in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or electronic
communications from Borrower Representative, neither Agent nor Bank shall have
any liability to the applicable Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by such
Borrower as a result of Agent's or Bank's honoring of any requests, execution of
any instructions, authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports
communicated to it telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been
sent to Agent or Bank by Borrower, and neither Agent nor Bank shall have any
duty to verify the origin of any such communication or the authority of the
Person sending it. Each telephonic request for a Revolving Credit Loan, Letter
of Credit or LC Guaranty accepted by Agent and Bank, if applicable, hereunder
shall be promptly followed by a written confirmation of such request from
Borrower Representative to Lender and Bank, if applicable.

             3.1.7  LIBOR PORTIONS AND CANADIAN BA RATE LOANS.

                    (a)  Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR Request
     and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default
     exists, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a LIBOR Portion,
     Borrower Representative shall give Agent a LIBOR Request no later than
     11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice
     Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested borrowing date.
     Each LIBOR Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the applicable
     Borrower. In no event shall Borrowers, in the aggregate, be permitted to
     have outstanding at any one time LIBOR Portions with more than five (5)
     different Interest Periods with respect to U.S. Revolving Credit Loans,
     U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and Canadian BA Rate Loans. The LIBOR Rate
     shall be available only (i) in the case of U.K. Borrower, for borrowings in
     Sterling and Euros and (ii) in the case of U.S. Borrowers, for borrowings
     in Dollars and Euros.

                    (b)  Provided that as of both the date of the Canadian BA
     Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of
     Default exists, in the event Canadian Borrowers desire to obtain a Canadian
     BA Rate Loan, Borrower Representative shall give Agent a Canadian BA
     Request no later than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
     Appropriate Notice Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested
     borrowing date. Each Canadian BA Request shall be irrevocable and binding
     on Canadian Borrowers. In no event shall Canadian Borrowers, in the
     aggregate, be

                                       24
<Page>

     permitted to have outstanding at any one time Canadian BA Rate Loans, U.S.
     Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans with more than five
     (5) different Interest Periods. The Canadian BA Rate shall be available
     only for borrowings in Canadian Dollars.

             3.1.8  CONVERSION OF BASE RATE PORTIONS AND CANADIAN PRIME RATE
LOAN CONVERSION.

                    (a)  Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR Request
     and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default
     exists, Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower may, on any Business Day
     and on behalf of the applicable Borrower, convert any Base Rate Portion
     (except with respect to Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrower) into a
     LIBOR Portion. If the applicable Borrower desires to convert a Base Rate
     Portion, Borrower Representative shall give Agent a LIBOR Request no later
     than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice
     Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested conversion date.

                    (b)  Provided that, as of both the date of the Canadian BA
     Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of
     Default exists, Borrower Representative may, on any Business Day and on
     behalf of Canadian Borrower, convert any Canadian Prime Rate Loan (that
     constitutes a Base Rate Loan under clause (ii)(b) of the definition of Base
     Rate) into a Canadian BA Rate Loan. If Canadian Borrowers desire to convert
     a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, Borrower Representative shall give Canadian
     Agent a Canadian BA Request no later then 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in
     the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) on the third Business Day
     prior to the requested conversion date.

             3.1.9  CONTINUATION OF LIBOR PORTIONS AND CANADIAN BA RATE LOANS.

                    (a)  Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR Request
     and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default
     exists, Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower may, on any Business Day

     a subsequent Interest Period of the same or a different permitted duration.
     If any Borrower desires to continue a LIBOR Portion, Borrower
     Representative shall give Agent and U.K. Agent, as applicable, a LIBOR
     Request no later than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
     Appropriate Notice Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested
     continuation date. If Borrower Representative shall fail to give timely
     notice of its election to continue any LIBOR Portion or portion thereof as
     provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted, such LIBOR
     Portion or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Portion shall be repaid, (x)
     with respect to U.S. Revolving Credit Loans funded in Dollars or U.K.
     Revolving Credit Loans, shall automatically be converted into a Base Rate
     Portion at the end of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to
     such LIBOR Portion or (y) with respect to U.S. Revolving Credit Loans
     funded in Euros, shall automatically be continued as a LIBOR Portion with a
     30-day Interest Period.

                                       25
<Page>

                    (b)  Provided that as of both the date of the Canadian BA
     Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of
     Default exists, Borrower Representative may, on any Business Day and on
     behalf of Canadian Borrowers, continue any Canadian BA Rate Loan into
     another Canadian BA Rate Loan with an Interest Period of the same or a
     different permitted duration. If Canadian Borrowers desire to continue a
     Canadian BA Rate Loan, Borrower Representative shall give Agent a Canadian
     BA Request no later than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
     Appropriate Notice Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested
     continuation date. If Borrower Representative shall fail to give timely
     notice of its election to continue any Canadian BA Rate Loan or portion
     thereof as provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted,
     such Canadian BA Rate Loan or portion thereof, unless such Canadian BA Rate
     Loan shall be repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Canadian
     Prime Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period then in effect with
     respect to such Canadian BA Rate Loan.

             3.1.10 INABILITY TO MAKE LIBOR PORTIONS AND CANADIAN BA RATE LOANS.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty,
regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this
SUBSECTION 3.1.10, the term "Lender" shall include the office or branch where
such Lender or any corporation or bank then controlling such Lender makes or
maintains any LIBOR Portions) to make or maintain its LIBOR Portions or Canadian
BA Rate Loans, or if with respect to any Interest Period, Agent, U.K. Agent or
Canadian Agent is unable to determine the LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate relating
thereto, or adverse or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law
relating to, the London interbank market or the Canadian BA market, as
applicable, make it, in the reasonable judgment of Agent, U.K. Agent or Canadian
Agent, impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA
Rate Loans, or make the projected LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate unreflective of the
actual costs of funds therefor to any Lender, the obligation of Agent, U.K.
Agent, Canadian Agent and Lenders to make or continue LIBOR Portions or Canadian
BA Rate Loans or convert Base Rate Portions or Canadian Prime Rate Loans to
LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA Rate Loans, as applicable, hereunder shall
forthwith be suspended during the pendency of such circumstances and the
applicable Borrower shall, if any affected LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA Rate
Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent or U.K. Agent,
convert such affected LIBOR Portions into Base Rate Portions, or promptly upon
request from Canadian Agent, convert such affected Canadian BA Rate Loans into
Canadian Prime Rate Loans.

     3.2     PAYMENTS. Except where evidenced by notes or other instruments
issued or made by Borrowers to any Lender and accepted by such Lender
specifically containing payment instructions that are in conflict with this
SECTION 3.2 (in which case the conflicting provisions of said notes or other
instruments shall govern and control), the Obligations shall be payable as
follows:

             3.2.1  PRINCIPAL. Principal on account of Revolving Credit Loans
shall be payable by the applicable Borrower to the applicable Agent for the
ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders at the Appropriate Payment Office
immediately upon the earliest of (i) the receipt by the applicable Agent, the
U.K. Borrower or, if U.S. Borrowers and/or Canadian Borrowers are subject to a
blocked account arrangement that then requires daily transfer of funds

                                       26
<Page>

received therein to the applicable Agent, any U.S. Borrower or any Canadian
Borrower, of any proceeds of any of the Collateral (except as otherwise provided
herein), including without limitation pursuant to SUBSECTIONS 3.3.1 and 6.2.4,
to the extent of said proceeds, subject to such Borrower's rights to reborrow
such amounts in compliance with SUBSECTION 1.1.1 hereof; (ii) the occurrence of
an Event of Default in consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to
accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations in accordance with
SECTIONS 10.2 and/or 10.3 of this Agreement, or (iii) termination of this
Agreement pursuant to SECTION 4 hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if an
Overadvance or an Agent Loan shall exist at any time, the applicable Borrower
shall, on demand, repay the Overadvance or Agent Loan. Each payment (including
principal prepayment) by Borrowers on account of principal of the Revolving
Credit Loans shall be applied FIRST to Base Rate Revolving Portions and
thereafter to LIBOR Revolving Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans, as
applicable.

             3.2.2  INTEREST.

                         (i)    BASE RATE PORTION. Interest accrued on Base Rate
             Portions shall be due and payable by the applicable Borrower to the
             applicable Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders
             on the earliest of (1) the first calendar day of each month (for
             the immediately preceding month), computed through the last
             calendar day of the preceding month, (2) the occurrence of an Event
             of Default in consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect
             to accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations in
             accordance with SECTIONS 10.2 and/or 10.3 of this Agreement or (3)
             termination of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 4 hereof.

                         (ii)   LIBOR PORTION AND CANADIAN BA RATE. Interest
             accrued on each LIBOR Portion and on Canadian BA Rate Loans shall
             be due and payable by the applicable Borrower to the applicable
             Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders on each
             LIBOR Interest Payment Date and on the earlier of (1) the
             occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of which Agent or
             Majority Lenders elect to accelerate the maturity and payment of
             the Obligations in accordance with SECTIONS 10.2 and/or 10.3 of
             this Agreement or (2) termination of this Agreement pursuant to
             SECTION 4 hereof.

             3.2.3  COSTS, FEES AND CHARGES. Costs, fees and charges payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, at the Appropriate Payment Office, as and
when provided in SECTION 2 or SECTION 3 hereof, as applicable, to Agent,
Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or a Lender, as applicable, or to any other Person
designated by Agent, Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or such Lender in writing.

             3.2.4  OTHER OBLIGATIONS. The balance of the Obligations
requiring the payment of money, if any, shall be payable by Borrowers to Agents
for distribution to Lenders, as appropriate, as and when provided in this
Agreement, the Other Agreements or the Security Documents, or on demand,
whichever is later, in each case at the Appropriate Payment Office.

             3.2.5  PREPAYMENT OF/FAILURE TO BORROW LIBOR PORTIONS. Borrowers
may prepay a LIBOR Portion and Canadian BA Rate Loans at the Appropriate Payment
Office only

                                       27
<Page>

upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to Agent, U.K. Agent
or Canadian Agent, as applicable (which notice shall be irrevocable). Each
applicable Borrower shall pay to each applicable Lender, upon request of such
Lender, at the Appropriate Payment Office such amount or amounts as shall be
sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate such Lender
for any loss, cost, or expense incurred as a result of: (i) any payment of a
LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan; (ii) any
failure by the applicable Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate
Loan on the date specified by the Borrower Representative's LIBOR Request or
Canadian BA Request; or (iii) any failure by the applicable Borrower to pay a
LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan on the date for payment specified in
Borrower Representative's written notice. In addition to reimbursement of
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, such compensation shall include a "yield
maintenance fee" in an amount computed as follows: the current rate for (i)
United States Treasury securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be
converted to a bond equivalent) (or Canadian or U.K. equivalent as applicable
and as determined by Agent) with respect to a LIBOR Portion or a Canadian BA
Rate Loan being repaid by U.S. Borrowers, U.K. Borrower or Canadian Borrowers,
as the case may be, in each case with a maturity date closest to the Interest
Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which
the prepayment is made, shall be subtracted from the LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate
in effect at the time of prepayment. If the result is zero or a negative number,
there shall be no yield maintenance fee. If the result is a positive number,
then the resulting percentage shall be multiplied by the amount of the principal
balance being prepaid. The resulting amount shall be divided by 360 and
multiplied by the number of days remaining in the Interest Period chosen
pursuant to the LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which the
prepayment is made. Said amount shall be reduced to present value calculated by
using the above-referenced United States Treasury securities (or Canadian
equivalent or securities issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, the United
Kingdom Government, as applicable) and the number of days remaining in the term
chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which
prepayment is made. The resulting amount shall be the yield maintenance fee due
to the applicable Lender upon the prepayment of a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA
Rate Loan. If by reason of an Event of Default, Agent or Majority Lenders elect
to declare the Obligations to be immediately due and payable, then any yield
maintenance fee with respect to a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan shall
become due and payable in the same manner as though Borrowers had exercised such
right of prepayment.

     3.3     MANDATORY AND OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.

             3.3.1  PROCEEDS OF SALE, LOSS, DESTRUCTION OR CONDEMNATION OF
COLLATERAL. Except as provided in SUBSECTIONS 6.4.2 and 8.2.9, if any Borrower
sells any of the Collateral or if any of the Collateral is lost or destroyed or
taken by condemnation, the applicable Borrower shall, unless otherwise agreed by
Majority Lenders, pay to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable
Lenders in accordance with SUBSECTION 3.4.2, as and when received by such
Borrower and as a mandatory prepayment of the applicable Loans, as herein
provided, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the
outstanding Loans and (ii) the proceeds (including insurance payments but net of
costs and taxes incurred in connection with such sale or event) received by such
Borrower from such sale, loss, destruction or condemnation; PROVIDED THAT,
Borrowers may elect not to prepay the Loans to the extent of up to $500,000 of
asset sale proceeds received by one or more Borrowers in each Fiscal Year;
PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT, if as of

                                       28
<Page>

the date of receipt of such proceeds, the applicable Borrower is not subject to
a blocked account arrangement that then requires daily transfers of funds
received therein to the applicable Agent, at Borrower Representative's option,
such proceeds may be released to the applicable Borrower for any use or
investment not otherwise prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in the case of U.K. Borrower and if U.S. Borrowers and/or
Canadian Borrowers are subject to a blocked account that then requires daily
transfers of funds received therein to the applicable Agent, any U.S. Borrower
or any Canadian Borrower, any and all proceeds from such asset sales or
Collateral lost or destroyed or taken by condemnation shall be used to prepay
the Loans without regard to any exceptions otherwise contained herein. The
applicable prepayment shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal
balance of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans, but shall not permanently
reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments or the maximum amount of the Canadian
Sublimit or the U.K. Sublimit.

             3.3.2  PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF EQUITY. If any Borrower issues or
obtains any additional equity in a manner permitted under this Agreement, such
Borrower, shall pay to Agents for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders
in accordance with SUBSECTION 3.4.2, when and as received by such Borrower at
the Appropriate Payment Office and as a mandatory prepayment of the applicable
Obligations, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the
outstanding Loans and (ii) 100% of the net proceeds to such Borrower of the
issuance of such equity; PROVIDED THAT, if, as of the date of receipt of such
proceeds, the applicable Borrower is not subject to a blocked account
arrangement that then requires daily transfers of funds received therein to the
applicable Lender, at Borrower's option, such proceeds may be released to the
applicable Borrower for any use or investment not otherwise prohibited
hereunder. Any such prepayment shall be applied to the applicable Loans in the
manner specified in the third sentence of SUBSECTION 3.3.1 until payment thereof
in full. Any payment of the outstanding Obligations made pursuant to this
SUBSECTION 3.3.2 above shall not permanently reduce the Revolving Loan
Commitments or the Canadian Sublimit or the U.K. Sublimit. Further, unless an
Event of Default exists and is continuing, Borrowers shall not be required to
prepay the Obligations from the proceeds of option exercises by any Borrower's
employees, directors or independent contractors.

             3.3.3  LIBOR PORTIONS AND CANADIAN BA RATE LOANS. If the
application of any payment made in accordance with the provisions of this
SECTION 3.3 at a time when no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
would result in termination of a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loans prior
to the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA
Rate Loans, the amount of such prepayment shall not be applied to such LIBOR
Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loans, but will, at the applicable Borrower's
option, be held by Agent, in the case of LIBOR Portions, and Canadian Agent, in
the case of Canadian BA Rate Loans, in a non-interest bearing account at a
Lender or another bank satisfactory to Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, in
the case of LIBOR Portions, and Canadian Agent, in the case of Canadian BA Rate
Loans, in its discretion, which account is in the name of Agent, U.K. Agent or
Canadian Agent, as the case may be, and from which account only Agent, U.K.
Agent or Canadian Agent, as the case may be, can make any withdrawal, in each
case to be applied as such amount would otherwise have been applied under this
SECTION 3.3 at the earlier to occur of (i) the last day of the relevant Interest
Period or (ii) the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default.

                                       29

             3.3.4  OPTIONAL REDUCTIONS OF REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS; OPTIONAL
PREPAYMENTS. Borrowers may, at their option from time to time upon not less than
three Business Days' prior written notice to Agent at the Appropriate Notice
Office, permanently reduce in part, or, upon 30 days' notice, terminate the
Revolving Loan Commitments or the U.K. Sublimit or the Canadian Sublimit;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each such partial reduction shall be in an amount of
the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 or integral multiples of the Dollar
Equivalent of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (ii) no such reduction shall result
in the prepayment of any LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan, (iii) all such
reductions shall be made ratably among the U.S. Revolving Loan Commitment, the
Canadian Sublimit and the U.K. Sublimit, and (iv) no such partial reduction
shall reduce the aggregate amount of Revolving Loan Commitments below
$30,000,000. Except for charges under SUBSECTION 3.2.5 applicable to prepayments
of LIBOR Revolving Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans and except for charges
under SECTION 2.7 applicable to termination or reductions of the Revolving Loan
Commitments, such prepayments shall be without premium or penalty. Subject to
SUBSECTION 3.2.5 with respect to prepayment of LIBOR Portions and Canadian BA
Rate Loans, optional prepayments (without a permanent reduction in the Revolving
Loan Commitments) may be made by Borrowers upon not less than one Business Day's
prior written notice to Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, in the case of
LIBOR Options, and to Canadian Agent, in the case of Canadian BA Rate Loans, at
the Appropriate Notice Office PROVIDED that each such prepayment shall be in an
amount that is the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000 or integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess thereof.

     3.4     APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS.

             3.4.1  COLLECTIONS. All items of payment received at the
Appropriate Payment Office by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent by 12:00 noon
(prevailing time at the location of the Appropriate Notice Office), on any
Business Day shall be deemed received on that Business Day. All items of payment
received after 12:00 noon (prevailing time at the location of the Appropriate
Notice Office), on any Business Day shall be deemed received on the following
Business Day. If, as the result of collections of Accounts as authorized by
SUBSECTION 6.2.4 hereof or otherwise, a credit balance exists in the Loan
Accounts, to the extent permitted by the Loan Documents such credit balance
shall not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers, but shall be disbursed to the
applicable Borrower or otherwise at Borrower Representative's direction in the
manner set forth in SUBSECTION 3.1.2, upon Borrower Representative's request (at
the Appropriate Notice Office) at any time, so long as no Default or Event of
Default then exists. Agents may, at their option, offset such credit balance
against any of the Obligations upon and during the continuance of an Event of
Default.

             3.4.2  APPORTIONMENT, APPLICATION AND REVERSAL OF PAYMENTS.
Principal and interest payments (i) by U.S. Borrowers shall be apportioned
ratably among all Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the
Loans to which such payments relate held by each Lender), (ii) by U.K. Borrower
shall be distributed to U.K. Lender subject to SECTION 2.6 or, following a
refunding in accordance with SECTION 3.14, apportioned among all U.K.
Participants (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which
such payments relate held by each U.K. Participant) and (iii) by Canadian
Borrowers shall be distributed to Canadian Lender subject to SECTION 2.6 or,
following a refunding in accordance with SECTION 3.13, apportioned among all
Canadian Participants (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to
which such payments relate held by each Canadian Participant). All payments of
principal and

                                       30
<Page>

interest on Revolving Credit Loans shall be remitted to Agent, Canadian Agent or
U.K. Agent, as applicable, at the Appropriate Payment Office and all such
payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not
constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts, or, except
as provided in SUBSECTION 3.3.1, other Collateral received by Agent, U.K. Agent
or Canadian Agent, as applicable, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, FIRST, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense
reimbursements (other than amounts related to Product Obligations) then due to
Agents or Lenders from the applicable Borrower; SECOND, to pay interest due from
the applicable Borrower in respect of all Loans made to such Borrower, and Agent
Loans; THIRD, to pay or prepay principal of Agent Loans; FOURTH, to pay or
prepay principal of the Revolving Credit Loans (other than Agent Loans) and
unpaid reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Obligations of the applicable
Borrower; FIFTH, to cash-collateralize the U.S. LC Obligations, Canadian LC

collateral account established with the Agent on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Agent an amount in cash equal to 103% of the aggregate
amount of such Obligations; SIXTH, to the payment of any other Obligation (other
than amounts related to Product Obligations) due to Agents by such Borrower;
SEVENTH, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements related to
Product Obligations of such Borrower; and EIGHTH, in the case of (x) payments by
U.K. Borrower, to the payment of any other Obligations due to Canadian Agent or
Canadian Lender by Canadian Borrower, (y) payments by Canadian Borrowers, to the
payment of any other Obligations due to U.K. Agent or any Lender by U.K.
Borrower and (z) payments by U.S. Borrowers, to the payment of any other
Obligations due to Agents or any Lender by U.S. Borrowers, U.K. Borrower or
Canadian Borrowers, ratably. Except as expressly set forth to the contrary,
payments received (i) from U.S. Borrowers shall be applied only to the U.S.
Obligations, (ii) from the U.K. Borrower shall be applied only to the U.K.
Obligations, and (iii) from Canadian Borrowers shall be applied only to the
Canadian Obligations; PROVIDED that after the U.S. Obligations, U.K. Obligations
or Canadian Obligations are paid in full by U.S. Borrowers, U.K. Borrower or
Canadian Borrowers, respectively, any such excess payments shall be applied PRO
RATA to the other Obligations (except that any payments received from U.K.
Borrower or Canadian Borrowers shall not be applied to the U.S. Obligations).
After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, as
between Agents and Borrowers, Agents shall have the continuing exclusive right
to apply and reapply any and all such payments and collections received at any
time or times hereafter by Agents against the Obligations, in such manner as
Agents may deem advisable, notwithstanding any entry by Agents or any Lender
upon any of its books and records. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, as
between Agents and other Lenders, all such payments shall be applied in the
order set forth above.

     3.5     ALL LOANS TO CONSTITUTE ONE OBLIGATION. Except as set forth in
SECTION 1.3 to the contrary and for the purpose of being ratably secured by
Agents' Liens upon all of the Collateral, the Loans and LC Obligations shall
constitute one general Obligation of Borrowers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the U.K.
Collateral and the Canadian Collateral shall not secure the U.S. Obligations.

     3.6     LOAN ACCOUNTS; REGISTRATION.

                    (a)  Agent shall enter all Loans and the LC Amount as debits
     to a loan account established for each Borrower (each, a "Loan Account"
     and, collectively, the

                                       31
<Page>

     "Loan Accounts") and shall also record in the Loan Accounts all payments
     made by Borrowers on any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral which
     are finally paid to Agents and may record therein, in accordance with
     customary accounting practice, other debits and credits, including interest
     and all charges and expenses properly chargeable to Borrowers.

                    (b)  Agent shall, on behalf of each Borrower, maintain at
     its address a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to
     it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
     addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Loan Commitment of, and the
     principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The
     entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest
     error, and Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person
     whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan and any Notes
     evidencing the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.
     Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note
     shall be registered on the Register and be effective only upon surrender
     for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such
     Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement
     and thereupon one or more new Notes shall be issued to the designated
     assignee. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or
     any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
     prior notice.

     3.7     STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT. Agent will account to Borrower
Representative, on behalf of Borrowers, monthly with a statement of Loans,
charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement during the immediately
preceding month, and such account rendered by Agent shall be deemed final,
binding and conclusive upon Borrowers absent demonstrable error unless Agent is
notified by Borrower Representative at the Appropriate Notice Office in writing
to the contrary within 30 days of the date each accounting is received by
Borrower Representative. Such notice shall be deemed an objection only to those
items specifically objected to therein.

     3.8     INCREASED COSTS. If any law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) adopted or implemented after the date of this
Agreement and having general applicability to all banks or finance companies
within the jurisdiction in which any Lender operates (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the effect of and phasing in of capital requirements or
other regulations or guidelines passed prior to the date of this Agreement), or
any interpretation or application thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance of such Lender
therewith, shall:

                         (i)    (1) subject such Lender to any tax with respect
             to this Agreement (other than (a) any tax based on or measured by
             net income or otherwise in the nature of a net income tax,
             including, without limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax
             based on capital, net worth or comparable basis for measurement and
             (b) subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.13, any tax collected by
             a withholding on payments and which neither is computed by
             reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the nature of an
             advance collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income
             of the payee) or (2) change the basis of taxation of payments to
             such Lender of principal, fees,

                                       32
<Page>

             interest or any other amount payable hereunder or under any Loan
             Documents (other than in respect of (a) any tax based on or
             measured by net income or otherwise in the nature of a net income
             tax, including, without limitation, any franchise tax or any
             similar tax based on capital, net worth or comparable basis for
             measurement and (b) subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.13, any
             tax collected by a withholding on payments and which neither is
             computed by reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the
             nature of an advance collection of a tax based on or measured by
             the net income of the payee);

                         (ii)   impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve
             (except any reserve taken into account in the determination of the
             applicable LIBOR), special deposit, assessment or similar
             requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the
             account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any
             office of such Lender, including (without limitation) pursuant to
             Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
             System; or

                         (iii)  impose on such Lender or the London interbank
             market or the Canadian BA market any other condition with respect
             to any Loan Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, renewing or maintaining Loans hereunder or the result of any of the
foregoing is to reduce the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder, or the result of any of the foregoing
is to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans, then, in any such case, the
applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender, upon demand and certification not
later than sixty (60) days following its receipt of notice of the imposition of
such increased costs, such additional amount as will compensate such Lender for
such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, to the extent such
Lender has not otherwise been compensated, with respect to a particular Loan,
for such increased cost as a result of an increase in the Base Rate, the LIBOR
or Canadian BA Rate. An officer of the applicable Lender shall determine the
amount of such additional cost or reduced amount using reasonable averaging and
attribution methods and shall certify the amount of such additional cost or
reduced amount to Borrower Representative, which certification shall include a
written explanation of such additional cost or reduction to such Borrower. Such
certification shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If a Lender claims any
additional cost or reduced amount pursuant to this SECTION 3.8, then such Lender
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions)
to designate a different lending office or to file any certificate or document
reasonably requested by Borrower Representative at the Appropriate Notice
Office, if the making of such designation or filing would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, any such additional cost or reduced amount and would not,
in the sole discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.

     3.9     BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE. In the event that
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent or any Lender shall have determined that:

                         (i)    reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
             the LIBOR for any Interest Period or the Canadian BA Rate for any
             term; or

                                       33
<Page>

                         (ii)   Sterling, Euro or Dollar deposits in the
             relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not available in
             the London interbank market with respect to a proposed LIBOR
             Portion, or that a market does not exist for Canadian BA Rate
             Loans, or a proposed conversion of a Base Rate Portion into a LIBOR
             Portion or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan into a Canadian BA Rate Loan;
             then

Agent, Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall give
Borrower Representative prompt written, telephonic or electronic notice of the
determination of such effect. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested
LIBOR Portion (in the affected currency, if not all applicable currencies are
affected) shall be made as a Base Rate Portion, unless Borrower Representative
shall notify Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office no later than 10:00 a.m.
(prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) three (3)
Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing that the request for
such borrowing shall be canceled or made as an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion,
(ii) any Base Rate Portion which was to have been converted to an affected type
of LIBOR Portion shall be continued as or converted into a Base Rate Portion,
or, if Borrower Representative shall notify Agent at the Appropriate Notice
Office, no later than 10:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
Appropriate Notice Office) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed
conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion, (iii)
any such requested Canadian BA Rate Loan shall be made as a Canadian Prime Rate
Loan, unless Borrower Representative shall notify Canadian Agent at the
Appropriate Notice Office no later than 10:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the
location of the Appropriate Notice Office), three (3) Business Days prior to the
date of such proposed borrowing that the request for such borrowing shall be
canceled and (iv) any Canadian Prime Rate Loan which was to have been converted
to an affected type of Canadian BA Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted
into a Canadian Prime Rate Loans, or, if Borrower Representative shall notify
Canadian Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office, no later than 10:00 a.m.
(prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) three (3)
Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an
unaffected type of Canadian BA Rate Loan.

     3.10    SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If (i) any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Loan made by it in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of Loans made by all Lenders, such Lender
shall forthwith purchase from each other Lender of such Loan such participation
in such Loan as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment ratably with each other Lender; PROVIDED, that, if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such applicable
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lenders the purchase price to the extent of
such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing
a participation from another Lender pursuant to this SECTION 3.10 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of the applicable Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                                       34

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all purchases and
repayments to be made under this SECTION 3.10 shall be made through Agent.

     3.11    LOCATION OF PAYMENTS AND NOTICES. Notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, all payments made by Borrowers or Borrower
Representative on behalf of Borrowers under this Agreement, whether principal or
interest payments, fees, expenses or other charges hereunder, shall be made at
the Appropriate Payment Office and all notices made by Borrowers or Borrower
Representative on behalf of Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made at the
Appropriate Notice Office.

     3.12    APPOINTMENT OF BORROWER REPRESENTATIVE. Each Borrower hereby
designates SITEL Corporation as its representative ("Borrower Representative")
and agent on its behalf for the purposes of issuing all notices (including,
without limitation, notices of borrowing), giving instructions with respect to
the disbursement of the proceeds of the Loans, selecting interest rate options,
requesting Letters of Credit or LC Guaranties, giving and receiving all other
notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents and
taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance with covenants) on
behalf of any Borrower or Borrowers under the Loan Documents. SITEL Corporation
hereby accepts such appointment. Agents may regard any notice or other
communications pursuant to any Loan Document from SITEL Corporation as a notice
or communication from all Borrowers, and may give any notice or communication
required or permitted to be given to any Borrower or Borrowers hereby to SITEL
Corporation on behalf of such Borrower or Borrowers. Each Borrower agrees that
each notice, election, representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and
undertaking made on its behalf by SITEL Corporation shall be deemed for all
purposes to have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and
enforceable against such Borrower or Borrowers, as applicable, to the same
extent as if the same had been made directly by such Borrower or Borrowers, as
applicable. Borrowers shall have the right to designate a replacement Borrower
Representative from time to time upon written notice to the Agents. Borrower
Representative hereby authorizes and appoints SITEL U.K. (who hereby accepts
such appointment) as its agent solely for purposes of giving notices of
borrowings or letter of credit requests to the U.K. Agent with respect to U.K.
Revolving Credit Loans.

     3.13    CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS REFUNDING.

                    (a)  If any Default or Event of Default shall occur and be
     continuing, Canadian Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
     direct that the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans owing to it be refunded by
     delivering a notice (with such detail as Agent shall request, a "NOTICE OF
     CANADIAN REVOLVING LOAN REFUNDING") to Agent. Upon receipt of such notice,
     Agent shall promptly give notice of the contents thereof to the Canadian
     Participants at their respective Facility Offices and, unless an Event of
     Default described in SUBSECTION 10.1.8 or 10.1.9 shall have occurred, to
     each Borrower. Each such Notice of Canadian Revolving Credit Loan Refunding
     shall be deemed to constitute delivery of a notice to Agent requesting each
     Canadian Participant to fund its undivided Participating Interest in the
     outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit Loans whereupon each Canadian
     Participant, through its Facility Office, shall fund a PRO RATA portion of
     the outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and related Obligations in
     an amount equal to the Canadian Participant's Revolving Loan Percentage of
     the

                                       35
<Page>

     aggregate principal amount of such Canadian Revolving Credit Loans held by
     each corresponding Lender to which the Canadian Participant is affiliated;
     PROVIDED that, with respect to the Canadian LC Obligations, the Canadian
     Participant is not required to fund the Revolving Loan Percentage
     attributable to the Canadian LC Obligations until such time as the
     underlying Canadian Letter of Credit or Canadian Letter of Credit supported
     by a Canadian LC Guaranty has been drawn. Subject to the proviso in the
     immediately preceding sentence, each Canadian Participant shall immediately
     transfer (or, if applicable, shall cause its Canadian Affiliate to
     transfer) to Canadian Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of
     its Participating Interest in the same currency as the underlying Revolving
     Credit Loan that was made by Canadian Lender.

                    (b)  Whenever, at any time after a Canadian Participant has
     funded a PRO RATA portion of the outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit
     Loans and related Obligations, Canadian Lender receives any payment on
     account thereof, Canadian Lender will distribute to Agent for delivery to
     each Canadian Participant its Participating Interest in such amount
     (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
     period of time during which such Canadian Participant's Participating
     Interest was outstanding and funded); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event
     that such payment received by Canadian Lender is required to be returned,
     such Canadian Participant will return to Agent for delivery to Canadian
     Lender any portion thereof previously delivered by Agent or Canadian Lender
     to it. For purposes of SECTION 2.13, any interest distributed by Canadian
     Lender to a Canadian Participant shall be deemed to have been paid by the
     Canadian Borrower.

                    (c)  Each Canadian Participant's obligation to fund the PRO
     RATA portion of the outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and related
     Obligations referred to in this SECTION 3.13 shall be absolute and
     unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
     without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
     other right which such Canadian Participant or any Borrower may have
     against Canadian Lender, any Canadian Participant, any Borrower or any
     other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance
     of a Default or Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition
     (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement
     or any other Loan Document by any Borrower or any other Lender or Canadian
     Participant, or (v) any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever,
     whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

     3.14    U.K. REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS REFUNDING.

                    (a)  If any Default or Event of Default shall occur and be
     continuing, U.K. Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, direct
     that the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans owing to it be refunded by delivering
     a notice (with such detail as Agent shall request, a "NOTICE OF U.K.
     REVOLVING LOAN REFUNDING") to Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, Agent
     shall promptly give notice of the contents thereof to the U.K. Participants
     at their respective Facility Office and, unless an Event of Default
     described in SUBSECTION 10.1.8 or 10.1.9 shall have occurred, to each
     Borrower. Each such Notice of U.K. Revolving Credit Loan Refunding shall be
     deemed to constitute delivery of a notice to Agent requesting each U.K.
     Participant fund its undivided U.K. Participating

                                       36
<Page>

     Interest in the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans whereupon each U.K.
     Participant, through its Facility Office, shall fund (or, if such Lender
     has a U.K. Affiliate, shall cause its U.K. Affiliate to fund) a pro rata
     portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and related
     Obligations in an amount equal to the U.K. Participant's Revolving Loan
     Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such U.K. Revolving Credit
     Loans held by each corresponding Lender to which the U.K. Participant is
     affiliated; PROVIDED that, with respect to the U.K. LC Obligations, the
     U.K. Participant is not required to fund the Revolving Loan Percentage
     attributable to the U.K. LC Obligations until such time as the underlying
     U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. Letter of Credit supported by a U.K. LC
     Guaranty has been drawn. Subject to the proviso in the immediately
     preceding sentence, each U.K. Participant shall immediately transfer to
     (or, if applicable, shall cause its U.K. Affiliate to transfer) U.K.
     Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its U.K.
     Participating Interest in the same currency as the underlying Revolving
     Credit Loan or U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty was made or issued
     by U.K. Lender, unless otherwise advised by Agent.

                    (b)  Whenever, at any time after a U.K. Participant has
     funded a PRO RATA portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans
     and related Obligations, U.K. Lender receives any payment on account
     thereof, U.K. Lender will distribute to Agent for delivery to each U.K.
     Participant its Participating Interest in such amount (appropriately
     adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time
     during which such U.K. Participant's Participating Interest was outstanding
     and funded); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that such payment
     received by U.K. Lender is required to be returned, such U.K. Participant
     will return to Agent for delivery to U.K. Lender any portion thereof
     previously delivered by Agent or U.K. Lender to it.

                    (c)  Each U.K. Participant's obligation to fund the PRO RATA
     portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and related
     Obligations referred to in this SECTION 3.14 shall be absolute and
     unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
     without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
     other right which such U.K. Participant or any Borrower may have against
     U.K. Lender, any U.K. Participant, any Borrower or any other Person for any
     reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event
     of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
     otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other
     Loan Document by any Borrower or any other Lender or U.K. Participant, or
     (v) any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing.

     3.15    MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS. If a Lender claims any additional cost or
reduced amount pursuant to SECTION 3.8, or any Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant or
any governmental authority for the account of any Lender or Canadian Participant
or U.K. Participant pursuant to SECTION 2.13, then such Lender or Canadian
Participant or U.K. Participant shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office or to
file any certificate or document reasonably requested by Borrower Representative
at the Appropriate Notice Office or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if the making of
such designation, filing or assignment would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount

                                       37
<Page>

of, any such additional cost or reduced amount and would not, in the bona fide
discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or
Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein
shall obligate a U.S. Lender to allocate the Canadian Participation or Canadian
Revolving Credit Loans or the U.K. Participation or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans
(following a funding under SECTION 3.13) to its Canadian or United Kingdom
office or Affiliate.

                                    SECTION 4

                              TERM AND TERMINATION

     4.1     TERM OF AGREEMENT. Subject to the right of Lenders to cease making
Loans to Borrowers during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default,
this Agreement shall be in effect for a period of three (3) years from the date
hereof, through and including December __, 2005 (the "Term"), unless terminated
as provided in SECTION 4.2 hereof.

     4.2     TERMINATION.

             4.2.1  TERMINATION BY LENDERS. Agent may, and at the direction of
Majority Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement with notice upon or after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or without notice
upon or after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default
under SECTION 10.1.7 (Insolvency and Related Proceedings) of the Agreement.

             4.2.2  TERMINATION BY BORROWER REPRESENTATIVE. Upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice to Agent and Lenders, Borrower
Representative, on behalf of Borrowers, may, at its option, terminate this
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such termination shall be effective until
Borrowers have paid or collateralized or supported by a letter of credit to
Agent's satisfaction all of the Obligations in immediately available funds, all
Letters of Credit and LC Guaranties have expired, terminated or have been cash
collateralized or supported by a letter of credit to Agent's satisfaction and
Borrowers have complied with SECTIONS 2.6 and 2.7 and SUBSECTION 3.2.5. Any
notice of termination given by Borrower Representative shall be irrevocable
unless all Lenders otherwise agree in writing and no Lender shall have any
obligation to make any Loans or issue or procure any Letters of Credit or LC
Guaranties on or after the termination date stated in such notice. Borrowers may
elect to terminate this Agreement only in its entirety. No section of this
Agreement or type of Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly.

             4.2.3  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. All of the Obligations shall be
immediately due and payable upon the termination date stated in any notice of
termination of this Agreement. All undertakings, agreements, covenants,
warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Loan Documents
shall survive any such termination and Agents shall retain their Liens in the
Collateral and Agents and Lenders shall retain all of their rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents, notwithstanding such termination, until all
Obligations have been discharged and paid in full, in immediately available
funds, including, without limitation, all Obligations under SECTIONS 2.6 and 2.7
and SUBSECTION 3.2.5 resulting from such termination; PROVIDED, THAT, the Lien
on the Canadian Collateral and the U.K. Collateral shall be released once all
U.K.

                                       38
<Page>

Obligations and Canadian Obligations have been discharged and paid in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the payment in full of the Obligations, Agents
shall not be required to terminate their Liens in the Collateral unless, with
respect to any loss or damage that Agents or Lenders may incur as a result of
dishonored checks or other items of payment received by Agents from any Borrower
or any Account Debtor and applied to the Obligations, Agent shall, at its
option, (i) have received a written agreement satisfactory to Agent, executed by
Borrowers and by any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used
in whole or in part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying Agent, Canadian
Agent, U.K. Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage or (ii) have
retained cash Collateral or other Collateral for such period of time as Agent,
in its discretion, may deem necessary to protect Agent, Canadian Agent, U.K.
Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage.

                                    SECTION 5

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent that the provisions of any lease or
license of Computer Hardware and Software or such Intellectual Property
expressly prohibit (which prohibition is enforceable under applicable law) any
assignment thereof, and the grant of a security interest therein, the applicable
Agent will not enforce its security interest in the applicable Borrower's rights
under such lease or license (other than in respect of the Proceeds thereof) for
so long as such prohibition continues, it being understood that upon request of
the applicable Agent, the applicable Borrower will in good faith use reasonable
efforts to obtain consent for the creation of a security interest in favor of
the applicable Agent (and to the applicable Agent's enforcement of such security
interest) in the applicable Agent's rights under such lease or license. In
addition to the foregoing grant of a security interest, Canadian Borrowers and
U.K. Borrower shall execute and deliver such debentures, hypothecs, pledges and
other security agreements as Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent may reasonably
request and, in the case of the security granted by the U.K. Borrower this will,
to the extent lawful, create fixed and floating charges over all of the U.K.
Borrower's Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this SECTION 5.1 and
the Security Documents executed by the U.K. Borrower or Canadian Borrowers, the
latter shall govern.

     5.2     OTHER COLLATERAL. Borrowers shall promptly notify Agent in writing
upon acquiring or otherwise obtaining any Collateral after the date hereof
consisting of Letter-of-Credit Rights arising out of or related to Accounts,
Electronic Chattel Paper arising out of or related to Accounts or Promissory

writing, upon acquiring or otherwise obtaining any Collateral after the date
hereof consisting of Documents arising out of or related to Accounts or
Instruments arising out of or related to Accounts, and, upon the request of
Agent, Canadian Agent, or U.K. Agent, as applicable, will promptly execute such
other documents, and do such other acts or things deemed appropriate by Agents
to deliver to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, possession of
such Documents that are negotiable and Instruments, and,

                                       40
<Page>

with respect to nonnegotiable Documents arising out of or related to Accounts,
to have such nonnegotiable Documents issued in the name of Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable; and with respect to Collateral in the possession
of a third party, obtain an acknowledgement from the third party that it is
holding the Collateral for the benefit of Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as the case may be.

     5.3     LIEN PERFECTION; FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrowers shall execute such
UCC-1 financing statements as are required by the UCC, such filings as are
required by the PPSA, and Section 395 of the Companies Act 1985 of England and
Wales (as amended) and any other applicable statutory scheme and such other
instruments, assignments or documents as are necessary to perfect Agents' Lien
upon any of the Collateral and shall take such other action as may be required
to perfect or to continue the perfection of Agents' Lien upon the Collateral.
Unless prohibited by applicable law, Borrowers hereby authorize Agents to
execute and file any such financing statement and other filings, including,
without limitation, financing statements that indicate the Collateral as being
of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater or lesser detail, than as set forth
in SECTION 5.1, on Borrowers' behalf. Borrowers also hereby ratify its
authorization for Agents to have filed in any jurisdiction any like filing and
financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.
The parties agree that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this
Agreement shall be sufficient as a filing and financing statement and may be
filed in any appropriate office in lieu thereof. At Agent's, Canadian Agent's or
U.K. Agent's request, Borrowers shall also promptly execute or cause to be
executed and shall deliver to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case
may be, any and all documents, instruments and agreements deemed necessary by
Agents to give effect to or carry out the terms or intent of the Loan Documents.

                                    SECTION 6

                            COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION

     6.1     GENERAL.

             6.1.1  LOCATION OF COLLATERAL. All books and records (including,
without limitation, Computer Hardware and Software) included within the
Collateral will at all times be kept by Borrowers at one or more of the business
locations set forth in EXHIBIT 6.1.1 hereto, as updated by Borrowers providing
(x) prior written notice to Agents of any new location at which any Borrower's
centralized accounting books and records (including, without limitation,
Computer Hardware and Software) are maintained or (y) written notice to Agent
within 30 days after the applicable Borrower opens or occupies any other new
location.

             6.1.2  INSURANCE OF COLLATERAL. Borrowers shall maintain and pay
for insurance or self insurance as the case may be, with respect to the business
of Borrowers, covering casualty, hazard, public liability, workers' compensation
and such other risks in such amounts and with such insurance companies as are
reasonably satisfactory to Agent (it being agreed that Agent shall not require
any Borrower to carry any insurance at any time to the extent it is not
available on commercially reasonable terms as reasonably determined by Agent at
such time to such Borrower in the relevant insurance market, PROVIDED that
Borrowers shall in all events maintain casualty insurance on all Collateral
customarily covered by casualty insurance and it being

                                       41
<Page>

further agreed that insurance comparable to that obtained by companies similarly
situated to Borrowers operating similar properties in the general areas and
businesses in which Borrowers operate shall be acceptable to Agent). Borrower's
Representative shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing such policies
to Agents as promptly as practicable, with satisfactory lender's loss payable
endorsements, naming Agent, in the case of the U.S. Collateral, Canadian Agent,
in the case of the Canadian Collateral, and U.K. Agent in the case of U.K.
Collateral, as a loss payee, assignee or additional insured, as appropriate, as
its interest may appear, and showing only such other loss payees, assignees and
additional insureds as are reasonably satisfactory to Agents. Each certificate
of insurance or endorsement shall contain a clause (in the case of the U.K.
Collateral, where available) requiring the insurer to give not less than 10
days' prior written notice to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case
may be, in the event of cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium and
not less than 30 days' prior written notice to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as the case may be, in the event of cancellation of the policy for any
other reason whatsoever and a clause specifying that the interest of Agent,
Canadian Agent, or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, shall not be impaired or
invalidated by any act or neglect of any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or
the owner of the Property or by the occupation of the premises for purposes more
hazardous than are permitted by said policy. Borrower Representative agrees to
deliver to Agents, promptly as rendered, true copies of any reports made in any
reporting forms to insurance companies, which reports could reasonably be
expected to have or evidence a Material Adverse Effect. If at the time of
receipt of such proceeds, the applicable Borrower is subject to a blocked
account arrangement that then requires daily transfer of received thereon to the
applicable Agent, all proceeds of business interruption insurance (if any) of
Borrowers shall be remitted to Agent, in the case of U.S. Collateral, to
Canadian Agent, in the case of Canadian Collateral and to U.K. Agent, in the
case of U.K. Collateral, for application to the outstanding balance of the
Revolving Credit Loans of the affected Borrower.

             U.K. Borrower shall deliver notification to the insurer relating to
the security created over its insurance policies in the form contained in the
Security Document governed by English law which creates such security and will
use reasonable endeavors to obtain the insurer's acknowledgement in the form
attached to the notice.

             Unless Borrowers provide Agents with evidence of the insurance
coverage required by this Agreement, Agents may purchase insurance at the
applicable Borrower's expense to protect Agents' interests in the Properties of
Borrowers. This insurance may, but need not, protect the interests of Borrowers.
The coverage that Agents purchase may not pay any claim that Borrowers make or
any claim that is made against Borrowers in connection with said Property.
Borrowers may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agents but only after
providing Agents with evidence that Borrowers have obtained insurance as
required by this Agreement. If Agents purchase insurance, the applicable
Borrower will be responsible for the costs of that insurance, including interest
and any other charges Agents may impose in connection with the placement of
insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the
insurance. The costs of the insurance may be added to the Obligations. The costs
of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance that Borrowers may be
able to obtain on their own.

                                       42
<Page>

             6.1.3  PROTECTION OF COLLATERAL. Neither Agents nor any Lender
shall be liable or responsible in any way for the safekeeping of any of the
Collateral or for any loss or damage thereto (except for reasonable care in the
custody thereof while any Collateral is in any Agent's or any Lender's actual
possession) or for any diminution in the value thereof, or for any act or
default of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, or other person
whomsoever, but the same shall be at Borrowers' sole risk.

     6.2     ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS.

             6.2.1  RECORDS, SCHEDULES AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ACCOUNTS. Borrowers
shall keep accurate and complete records of its Accounts and all payments and
collections thereon and Borrower's Representative shall submit to Agents on such
periodic basis as Agents shall request a sales and collections report for the
preceding period, in form acceptable to Agents.

             6.2.2  DISCOUNTS, ALLOWANCES, DISPUTES. If any Borrower grants any
discounts, allowances or credits that are not shown on the face of the invoice
for the Account involved, such Borrower shall report such discounts, allowances
or credits, as the case may be, to Agents as part of the next required Schedule
of Accounts.

             6.2.3  ACCOUNT VERIFICATION. Any of Agents' officers, employees or
agents shall have the right, at any time or times hereafter, in the name of
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, any designee of Agents, or
the applicable Borrower, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter
relating to any Accounts by mail, telephone, electronic communication or
otherwise. Borrowers shall cooperate fully with Agents in an effort to
facilitate and promptly conclude any such verification process.

             6.2.4  MAINTENANCE OF DOMINION ACCOUNT. Borrowers shall maintain
a Dominion Account or Accounts pursuant to lockbox and blocked account
arrangements (or, in the case of U.K. Borrower, collection account letters)
acceptable to Agents with Bank or its Affiliates; PROVIDED that, in the case of
U.K. Borrower, such Dominion Accounts shall be maintained with Fleet U.K. In the
case of (i) U.K. Borrower, such blocked account arrangements shall provide for
full dominion and control over U.K. Borrower's cash deposited into all deposit
accounts and (ii) U.S. Borrowers and Canadian Borrowers, such blocked account
arrangements shall provide for control and springing dominion over U.S.
Borrowers' and Canadian Borrowers' cash deposited into all deposit accounts such
that, in the event at any time Aggregate Borrowing Availability is less than
$10,000,000 at any time (the "TRIGGERING AVAILABILITY TEST"), Agents, for the
benefit of Lenders, shall have full dominion and control over such accounts.
Borrowers shall issue to any such banks (in the case of U.S. Borrowers and
Canadian Borrowers, upon notice by the applicable Agent that the Triggering
Availability Test has occurred) an irrevocable letter of instruction directing
such banks to make a daily transfer of all payments or other remittances
received in the lockbox and blocked accounts to the Dominion Account for
application on account of the Obligations as provided in SUBSECTION 3.4.2. All
funds deposited in any Dominion Account are subject to a security interest in
favor of the respective Agent. The applicable Borrower shall obtain the
agreement by such banks in favor of Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the
case may be, to waive any recoupment, setoff rights, compensation rights and any
security interest or hypothec in, or against, the funds so deposited. Agents
assume no responsibility for such lockbox and blocked account arrangements,
including, without limitation,

                                       43
<Page>

any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect to deposits
accepted by any bank thereunder. If Agent has notified the applicable banks that
a Trigger Availability Test has occurred and has directed such banks to make
daily transfer of payments or other remittances received in the lockbox and
blocked accounts to the Dominion Account and at any time 180 days or more after
the effective date of such notice, average Aggregate Borrowing Availability for
any 60 consecutive day period equals or exceeds $10,000,000 and no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, then Agent agrees to rescind its notice
to the applicable banks directing such banks to make daily transfers of all
payments and other remittances received in the lockbox and blocked accounts to
the Dominion Account. Upon a subsequent occurrence of a Triggering Availability
Test, Agent shall have the right to renotify such banks to make daily transfers
to the Dominion Account.

             6.2.5  COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL. Borrowers
agree that all invoices rendered and other requests made by Borrowers for
payment in respect of Accounts shall contain a written statement directing
payment in respect of such Accounts to be paid to a blocked account established
pursuant to SUBSECTION 6.2.4. To expedite collection, Borrowers shall endeavor
in the first instance to make collection of its Accounts for Agents. All
remittances received by Borrowers on account of Accounts, together with the
proceeds of any other Collateral, shall be held as Agent's, Canadian Agent's or
U.K. Agent's, as the case may be, property, for its benefit and the benefit of
the applicable Lenders, by the applicable Borrower as trustee of an express
trust for Agent's, Canadian Agent's or U.K. Agent's benefit, as applicable, and
the applicable Borrower shall promptly deposit same in kind in the Dominion
Account. Agents retain the right at all times after the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default to notify Account Debtors that Borrowers'
Accounts have been assigned to Agents and to collect Borrowers' Accounts
directly in its own name, and to charge the collection costs and expenses,
including legal fees, to the applicable Borrowers.

             6.2.6  TAXES. If an Account includes a charge for any tax
payable to any governmental taxing authority, Agents are authorized, in their
sole discretion, to pay the amount thereof to the proper taxing authority for
the account of the applicable Borrower and to charge such Borrower therefor,
except for taxes that (i) are being contested in good faith with reasonable
diligence and by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which such Borrower
maintains reasonable reserves on its books therefor and (ii) would not
reasonably be expected to result in any Lien other than a Permitted Lien.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Agent releases to any Borrower an amount
in respect of goods and services taxes and sales taxes that are included in each
Account, the applicable Borrower shall immediately remit such amount to the
proper taxing authority and, if requested by the applicable Agent, provide such
Agent with a receipt therefor. In no event shall Agents or any Lender be liable
for any taxes to any governmental taxing authority that may be due by Borrowers.

     6.3     PAYMENT OF CHARGES. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under
SECTION 6 hereof shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral (except
that amounts chargeable to U.S. Borrowers shall not be secured by U.K.
Collateral or Canadian Collateral), shall be payable on demand by the applicable
Borrower and shall bear interest from the date such advance was made until paid
in full at the rate applicable to Base Rate Revolving Portions (or in the case
of Canadian Borrower, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) from time to time.

enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law) and, with respect to
the obligations of the Canadian Borrower under Section 2.1.2, by the provisions
of Section 8(1) of the Interest Act (Canada).

             7.1.4  CORPORATE AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE. Except as disclosed to the

<Page>

             7.1.8  ACCOUNTS. Agents may rely, in determining which Accounts
are Eligible Accounts, on all statements and representations made by Borrowers
with respect to any Account or Accounts. With respect to each of Borrowers'
Accounts arising in the ordinary course of business of any Borrower from the
sale of goods or rendition of services, whether or not such Account is an
Eligible Account, unless otherwise disclosed to Agent in writing:

                         (i)    It is genuine and in all respects what it
             purports to be, and it is not evidenced by a judgment;

                         (ii)   It arises out of a completed, BONA FIDE sale and
             delivery of goods or rendition of services by a Borrower, in
             accordance with the terms and conditions of all purchase orders,
             contracts or other documents relating thereto and forming a part of
             the contract between a Borrower and the Account Debtor;

                         (iii)  It is for a liquidated amount maturing as stated
             in the duplicate invoice covering such sale or rendition of
             services, a copy of which has been furnished or is available to
             Agent;

                         (iv)   There are no facts, events or occurrences which
             materially impair the validity or enforceability of any Accounts or
             tend to reduce materially the amount payable thereunder from the
             face amount of the invoice and statements delivered or made
             available to Agent with respect thereto;

                         (v)    To Borrowers' knowledge, the Account Debtor
             thereunder (1) had the capacity to contract at the time any
             contract or other document giving rise to the Account was executed
             and (2) such Account Debtor is Solvent; and

                         (vi)   To Borrowers' knowledge, there are no
             proceedings or actions that are threatened or pending against the
             Account Debtor thereunder that could reasonably be expected to
             result in any material adverse change in the collectibility of such
             Account, other than changes for which Borrowers have already
             established or maintained (in the good faith judgment of the
             management of Borrowers) adequate reserves on the most recent
             Borrowing Base Certificate.

             7.1.9  EQUIPMENT. The Equipment of Borrowers that is material to
the conduct of their business is in good operating condition and repair and
shall be maintained and preserved in accordance with Borrower's past practices,
reasonable wear and tear excepted.

consolidating balance sheets of SITEL and its Subsidiaries (including the
accounts of all Subsidiaries of Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries for
the respective periods during which the Subsidiaries' relationship existed) as
of September 30, 2002, and the related statements of income, changes in
shareholder's equity, and changes in financial position for the periods ended on
such dates, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and present fairly in
all material respects the financial positions of Borrowers and such Persons,
taken as a whole, at such dates and the results of Borrowers' and such Persons'
operations, taken as a whole, for such periods and, in the case of the annual
audited accounts of U.K. Borrower, present a true and fair view of such U.K.
Borrower's financial condition. As of the date hereof, since September 30, 2002,

                                       47
<Page>

there has been no material adverse change in the financial position of
Borrowers, and such other Persons, taken as a whole, as reflected in the
Consolidated balance sheet as of such date. As of the date hereof, the fiscal
year of Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries ends on December 31 of each
year. Borrowers represent that all projections delivered to Agent indicate
compliance with all financial covenants set forth in this Agreement.

             7.1.11 FULL DISCLOSURE. The financial statements referred to in
SUBSECTION 7.1.10 hereof do not, nor does this Agreement or the other written
statements of Borrowers to Agents or any Lender for the purposes of or in
connection with this Agreement, taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading as of the date on which such statement are or
were provided and in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
provided. There is no fact which Borrowers have failed to disclose to Agents or
any Lender in writing which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

             7.1.12 SOLVENT FINANCIAL CONDITION. Each Borrower is on the Closing
Date, including, after giving effect to the initial Loans to be made and the
initial Letters of Credit and LC Guaranties to be issued hereunder and all
related transactions to occur on the Closing Date, Solvent.

             7.1.13 SURETY OBLIGATIONS. Except as set forth on EXHIBIT 7.1.13,
as of the date hereof, no Borrower is obligated as surety or indemnitor under
any surety or similar bond or other contract or has issued or entered into any
agreement to assure payment, performance or completion of performance of any
undertaking or obligation of any Person, other than (x) another Borrower or (y)
with respect to service or vendor contracts entered into in the ordinary course
of business, a Subsidiary of SITEL.

             7.1.14 TAXES. SITEL Corporation's federal tax identification
number is 47-0684333. The federal tax identification number, and Canadian and
United Kingdom equivalent, of each other Borrower is shown on EXHIBIT 7.1.14

returns and other reports relating to taxes it is required by law to file, and
has paid, or made provision for the payment of, all taxes, assessments, fees,
levies and other governmental charges upon it, its income and Properties, as and
when such taxes, assessments, fees, levies and charges are due and payable,
unless and to the extent (a) any thereof are being actively contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings and each Borrower maintains reasonable
reserves on its books therefor or (b) the failure to file such tax returns or
pay such taxes could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The provision for taxes on the books of each Borrower is (in the good
faith judgment of the management of such Borrower) adequate for all years not
closed by applicable statutes, and for the current fiscal year.

             7.1.15 BROKERS. There are no claims for brokerage commissions,
finder's fees or investment banking fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

             7.1.16 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES. To

to use all the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
licenses and other Intellectual Property

                                       48
<Page>

necessary for the present conduct of its business without, to Borrowers'
knowledge, conflict with the rights of others, except for such conflicts as
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or as set
forth on EXHIBIT 7.1.16 hereto. Except as set forth on EXHIBIT 7.1.16, there are
no claims that have been asserted to any Borrower which are currently pending
with any court or governmental authority that their use of their Intellectual
Property or the conduct of their business does or may infringe upon the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation and performance of
the transactions and actions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Document, including without limitation, the exercise by Agents of any of their
rights or remedies under SECTION 10, will not result in the termination or
impairment of any of any Borrower's ownership or rights relating to its
Intellectual Property, except for such Intellectual Property rights the loss or
impairment of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as listed on EXHIBIT 7.1.16 or except as could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no Borrower has received written
notice that it is in breach of, or default under, any term of any license or
sublicense with respect to any of its Intellectual Property and (ii) to the
knowledge of Borrowers, no other party to such license or sublicense is in
breach thereof or default thereunder.

             7.1.17 GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. Each Borrower has, and is in good
standing with respect to, all governmental consents, approvals, licenses,
authorizations, permits, certificates, inspections and franchises necessary to
continue to conduct its business as heretofore or proposed to be conducted by it
and to own or lease and operate its Properties as now owned or leased by it,
except where the failure to possess or so maintain such rights could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

             7.1.18 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Borrower has duly complied,
and its Properties, business operations and leaseholds are in compliance with,
the provisions of all United States of America, Canadian and United Kingdom
federal, state, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to
such Borrower, its Properties or the conduct of its business, except for such
noncompliance as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and there have been no citations, notices or orders of noncompliance
issued to such Borrower under any such law, rule or regulation, except where
such noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

             7.1.19 RESTRICTIONS. No Borrower is a party or subject to any
contract or agreement that restricts its right or ability to incur Indebtedness,
other than as set forth on EXHIBIT 7.1.19 hereto, none of which prohibits the

Borrowers.

             7.1.20 LITIGATION. Except as set forth on EXHIBIT 7.1.20 hereto,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings, investigations or arbitrations

             7.1.21 NO DEFAULTS. As of the Closing Date, no event has
occurred and no condition exists which would, upon or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or Borrowers' performance hereunder, constitute a
Default or an Event of Default. As of the Closing Date, no Borrower is in
default in (and no event has occurred and no condition exists which constitutes,
or which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute, a default in) the payment of any Indebtedness to any Person for
Money Borrowed in excess of $2,000,000.

             7.1.22 LEASES. Each Borrower is in full compliance with all of
the terms of each of its respective capitalized and operating leases, except
where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

             7.1.23 PENSION PLANS.

                    (a)  Except as disclosed on EXHIBIT 7.1.23 hereto, neither
     U.S. Borrowers nor any of their ERISA Affiliates maintains or contributes
     to any Plan. U.S. Borrowers and each of their ERISA Affiliates are in
     compliance with the requirements of ERISA and the regulations promulgated
     thereunder with respect to each Plan, except where the failure to so comply
     could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No fact
     or situation that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect exists in connection with any Plan. Neither any U.S.
     Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability
     under Title IV of ERISA in connection with a Multiemployer Plan which
     remains unsatisfied or which would reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

                    (b)  The Canadian Pension Plans are duly registered under
     and have been administered in compliance with the ITA and all other
     applicable laws which require registration except where the failure to so
     comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     All obligations of any Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
     (including fiduciary, funding, investment and administration obligations)
     required to be performed in connection with the Canadian Pension Plans and
     the funding agreements therefor have been performed in a timely fashion,
     except where the failure to so perform could not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding disputes, actions,
     suits or claims concerning the assets of the Canadian Pension Plans that
     could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None
     of the Canadian Borrowers or their Subsidiaries is required to make any
     contributions to the Canadian Pension Plans which contributions, in the
     aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Effect. Canadian Borrowers and their Subsidiaries have withheld all
     employee withholdings and have made all employer contributions to be
     withheld and made by it pursuant to Canadian and any provincial applicable
     law on account of Canadian Pension Plans, Canadian Benefit Plans, Canadian
     employment insurance and employee income taxes. No condition exists or
     transaction has occurred in connection with any Canadian Pension Plan or
     Canadian Benefit Plan which could result in the incurrence by Canadian
     Borrowers or their Subsidiaries of any liability, fine or penalty that
     could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                    (c)  All pension schemes of U.K. Borrower and any
     Subsidiaries of any Borrower that are organized under the laws of the
     United Kingdom are operated in substantial compliance with applicable law
     and fully funded to the extent required by law based on reasonable
     actuarial assumptions applicable in the United Kingdom.

             7.1.24 TRADE RELATIONS. There exists no actual or, to Borrowers'
knowledge, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation of, or any
modification or change in, the business relationship between any Borrower and
any customer or any group of customers whose purchases individually or in the
aggregate are material to the business of such Borrower, or with any material
supplier, except in each case, where the same could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, and there exists no present condition or
state of facts or circumstances which would prevent any Borrower from conducting
such business after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in substantially the same manner in which it has heretofore been
conducted, where the same could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

             7.1.25 LABOR RELATIONS. Except as described on EXHIBIT 7.1.25
hereto, as of the date hereof, no Borrower is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement. There are no material grievances, disputes or
controversies with any union or any other organization of any Borrower's
employees, or threats of strikes, work stoppages or any asserted pending demands
for collective bargaining by any union or organization, except those that could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

             7.1.26 COMMON ENTERPRISE. Borrowers are engaged in the businesses
of outsourced customer support services as of the Closing Date, as well as in
certain other businesses. These operations require financing on a basis such
that the credit supplied can be made available from time to time to Borrowers,
as required for the continued successful operation of Borrowers taken as a
whole. Borrowers have requested the Lenders to make credit available hereunder
primarily for the purposes of SECTION 1.1.3 and generally for the purposes of
financing the operations of Borrowers. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit
(and the Board of Directors of each Borrower has determined that such Borrower
may reasonably be expected to derive benefit), directly or indirectly, from a
portion of the credit extended by Lenders hereunder, both in its separate
capacity and as a member of the group of companies, since the successful
operation and condition of each Borrower is dependent on the continued
successful performance of the functions of the group as a whole. Each Borrower
acknowledges that, but for the agreement of each of the other Borrowers to
execute and deliver this Agreement, Agent and Lenders would not have made
available the credit facilities established hereby on the terms set forth
herein.

             7.1.27 U.S., CANADIAN OR U.K. OPERATING COMPANIES. SITEL has no
U.S. Subsidiary, U.K. Subsidiary or Canadian Subsidiary that has annual
operating revenues or accounts receivable or similar assets of $100,000 or more
other than Borrowers.

     7.2     CONTINUOUS NATURE OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each
representation and warranty contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be continuous in nature and shall remain accurate, complete and
not misleading at all times during the term of this Agreement, except with
respect to any representation or warranty which by its terms is as of a

                                       51

specified date and is therefore understood and agreed to be required to be true
and correct only as of a specified date and except for changes in the nature of
any Borrower's business or operations that would render the information in any
exhibit attached hereto or to any other Loan Document either inaccurate,
incomplete or misleading, so long as Majority Lenders have consented to such
changes, such changes are expressly permitted by this Agreement or such changes
that could not reasonably be expected to have or evidence a Material Adverse
Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan request made
or deemed made pursuant to subsection 3.1.1 hereof shall constitute Borrowers'
reaffirmation, as of the date of each such loan request, of each representation,
warranty or other statement made or furnished to Agents or any Lender by or on
behalf of Borrowers in this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any
instrument, certificate or financial statement furnished in compliance with or
in reference thereto.

     7.3     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties of Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance thereof by Agent
and each Lender and the parties thereto and the closing of the transactions
described therein or related thereto.

                                    SECTION 8

                       COVENANTS AND CONTINUING AGREEMENTS

     8.1     AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. During the Term, and thereafter for so long
as there are any Obligations outstanding, each Borrower covenants that, unless
otherwise consented to by Majority Lenders, in writing, it shall:

             8.1.1  VISITS AND INSPECTIONS; LENDER MEETING. Permit
representatives of Agents or Lenders accompanied by Agent, from time to time, as
often as may be reasonably requested, but only during normal business hours, to
visit and inspect the Collateral of such Borrower, inspect, audit and make
extracts from its books and records, and discuss with its officers, its
employees and its independent accountants, such Borrower's business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition, business prospects and results of operations.
Agent, U.K. Agent or Canadian Agent, if no Event of Default then exists, shall
give such Borrower reasonable prior notice of any such inspection or audit.
Without limiting the foregoing, such Borrower will participate and will cause
its key management personnel to be available to participate in periodic meetings
or teleconferences with Agents and Lenders at such times and such places as may
be reasonably requested by Agents, except that during the continuation of an
Event of Default such meetings may be held more frequently as requested by Agent
or Majority Lenders.

             8.1.2  NOTICES. Promptly notify Agent in writing of the occurrence
of any event or the existence of any fact which renders any representation or
warranty in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect as of the date made or remade. In addition,
such Borrower agrees to provide Agent with prompt written notice of any change
in the information disclosed in any Exhibit hereto, after such change first
becomes known to a senior officer of any Borrower in each case after giving
effect to the materiality limits and Material Adverse Effect qualifications
contained in this Agreement.

             Borrower's board of directors or senior management and which have
             been disclosed to Agent or in SITEL's public filings, and are no
             less favorable to such Borrower than would be obtained in a
             comparable arm's length transaction with a person not an Affiliate

             is not more disadvantageous to the Agent and Lenders in any
             material respect than the original agreement on the date of this
             Agreement.

             10.3.2 The right to take immediate possession of the Collateral,
and to (i) require Borrowers to assemble the Collateral, at Borrowers' expense,
and make it available to Agents at a place designated by Agents which is

Collateral in its then condition, or after any further manufacturing or
processing thereof, at public or private sale or sales, with such notice as may

<Page>

Computer Software or any Property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the
Collateral, in realizing upon any Collateral and each Borrower's rights under
all such licenses shall inure to Agent's, Canadian Agent's and U.K. Agent's
benefit; PROVIDED that any such license or right to use shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the underlying license.

             10.3.5 Agents, at their option, may require each applicable
Borrower to deposit with Agent, funds equal to the U.S. LC Amount, with Canadian
Agent, funds equal to the Canadian LC Amount and with U.K. Agent, the U.K. LC
Amount, and, if such Borrower fails to promptly make such deposit, Agent and
U.K. Agent, as the case may be, may advance such amount as a Revolving Credit
Loan (whether or not an Overadvance is created thereby). Each such Revolving
Credit Loan shall be secured by all of the Collateral (except that U.K.
Collateral and Canadian Collateral shall not secure Revolving Credit Loans to
U.S. Borrower) and shall constitute a Base Rate Revolving Portion. Any such
deposit or advance shall be held by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, as a reserve to fund future payments on such applicable LC
Guaranties and future drawings against such applicable Letters of Credit. At
such time as all LC Guaranties have been paid or terminated and all Letters of
Credit have been drawn upon or expired, any amounts remaining in such reserve
shall be applied against any outstanding Obligations, or, if all Obligations
have been indefeasibly paid in full, returned to the applicable Borrower;
PROVIDED, that in no event shall any such reserves held as Canadian Collateral
or U.K. Collateral be applied to the U.S. Obligations.

             10.3.6 COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. In the event that any
Agent takes possession of that portion of Collateral consisting of Computer
Hardware or Software, such Agent agrees that for the period during which such
Computer Hardware or Software is in possession of such Agent, such Agent shall
provide Borrowers with reasonable access to and use of such Computer Hardware or
Software to permit Borrowers to operate their respective businesses.

     10.4    SET OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby
authorized by Borrowers at any time or from time to time, with prior written
consent of Agents, and with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to Borrower
Representative (any prior or contemporaneous notice to Borrower Representative
being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all (i) balances held by such Lender at any of its offices for the account
of any Borrower (regardless of whether such balances are then due to any such
Borrower); and (ii) other property at any time held or owing by such Lender to
or for the credit or for the account of any Borrower against and on account of
any of the Obligations. Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall, to the
extent the amount of any such set off exceeds its Revolving Loan Percentage of
the amount set off, purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell)
interests in each such other Lender's PRO RATA share of the Obligations as would
be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess with each other Lender in
accordance with their respective Revolving Loan Percentages. Borrowers agree, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender may exercise its right to
set off with respect to amounts in excess of its pro rata share of the
Obligations and upon doing so shall deliver such excess to Agent for the benefit
of all Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Loan Percentages.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender

                                       71
<Page>

shall exercise set off rights with respect to U.K. Borrower's or Canadian
Borrowers' assets and apply such proceeds to the U.S. Obligations.

     10.5    REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; NO WAIVER. All covenants, conditions,
provisions, warranties, guaranties, indemnities, and other undertakings of
Borrowers contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in any
document referred to herein or contained in any agreement supplementary hereto
or in any schedule given to Agents or any Lender or contained in any other
agreement between any Lender and any Borrower or between Agents and any Borrower
heretofore, concurrently, or hereafter entered into, shall be deemed cumulative
to and not in derogation or substitution of any of the terms, covenants,
conditions, or agreements of any Borrower herein contained. The failure or delay
of Agents or any Lender to require strict performance by Borrowers of any
provision of this Agreement or to exercise or enforce any rights, Liens, powers,
or remedies hereunder or under any of the aforesaid agreements or other
documents or security or Collateral shall not operate as a waiver of such
performance, Liens, rights, powers and remedies, but all such requirements,
Liens, rights, powers, and remedies shall continue in full force and effect
until all Loans and other Obligations owing or to become owing from Borrowers to
Agents and each Lender have been fully satisfied. None of the undertakings,
agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of Borrowers contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and no Default or Event of
Default by Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall be
deemed to have been suspended or waived by Lenders, unless such suspension or
waiver is by an instrument in writing specifying such suspension or waiver and
is signed by a duly authorized representative of Agents and directed to
Borrowers.

                                   SECTION 11

                         AGENT; ASSIGNMENTS; AMENDMENTS

     11.1    AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.

                    (a)  Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Agent to
     take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
     Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the
     terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
     incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Canadian
     Agent to take such action on its behalf (and on behalf of Agent) and to
     exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with
     respect to the administration of all Loans made to Canadian Borrowers and
     with respect to Canadian Collateral. Each Lender hereby appoints and
     authorizes U.K. Agent to take such action on its behalf (and on behalf of
     Agent) and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents with respect to the administration of all Loans made to U.K.
     Borrower and with respect to U.K. Collateral. Each Lender hereby
     acknowledges that Agents shall not have by reason of this Agreement assumed
     a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. In performing its
     functions and duties under this Agreement, Agents shall act solely as agent
     of Lenders and shall not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, any
     obligation toward, or relationship of agency or trust with or for, any
     Borrower. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents (including without limitation enforcement and
     collection of the Notes),

                                       72
<Page>

     Agents may, but shall not be required to, exercise any discretion or take
     any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and
     shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
     instructions of the Majority Lenders, whenever such instruction shall be
     requested by Agents or required hereunder, or a greater or lesser number of
     Lenders if so required hereunder, and such instructions shall be binding
     upon all Lenders; PROVIDED, that Agents shall be fully justified in failing
     or refusing to take any action which exposes Agents to any liability or
     which is contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or applicable
     law, unless Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, is
     indemnified to its satisfaction by the other Lenders against any and all
     liability and expense which it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
     to take any such action. If Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent seeks the
     consent or approval of the Majority Lenders (or a greater or lesser number
     of Lenders as required in this Agreement), with respect to any action
     hereunder, Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, shall send
     notice thereof to each Lender and shall notify each Lender at any time that
     the Majority Lenders (or such greater or lesser number of Lenders) have
     instructed Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, to act or
     refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

                    (b)  Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to delegate to
     Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent any and all of its obligations under this
     Agreement and the Loan Documents with respect to all actions required to be
     taken in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively, of any kind
     whatsoever. Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent, when acting pursuant to the
     authority granted hereunder, shall have all the protections, indemnities,
     rights and powers granted to Agent under this Agreement and any Loan
     Document.

                    (c)  To the extent necessary, each Lender appoints the
     Canadian Agent as its agent to hold in the name of the Canadian Agent, for
     the benefit of each Lender, any of the debentures issued by Canadian
     Borrowers and outstanding from time to time forming part of the Security
     Documents, and appoints CIBC Mellon Trust Company as the person holding the
     power of attorney for the holders of bonds or other titles of indebtedness
     for all purposes of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec. Each
     Borrower, to the extent necessary, hereby consents to all present and
     future appointments made in this SECTION 11.1(c) or pursuant thereto.

     11.2    AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. None of Agents or their Affiliates, nor any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees, shall be liable
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection
with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of
the foregoing, Agents: (i) may treat each Lender party hereto as the holder of
Obligations until Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer of
such Lender's portion of the Obligations signed by such Lender and in form
reasonably satisfactory to Agent; (ii) may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by them and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it or
them in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts;
(iii) make no warranties or representations to any Lender and shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement

                                       73
<Page>

or any other Loan Documents; (iv) shall not have any duty beyond Agents'
customary practices in respect of loans in which Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent is the only lender, to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents on the part of Borrowers, to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of Borrowers, to monitor the financial
condition of Borrowers or to ascertain the existence or possible existence or
continuation of any Default or Event of Default; (v) shall not be responsible to
any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vi)
shall not be liable to any Lender for any action taken, or inaction, by Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent upon the instructions of Majority Lenders pursuant
to SECTION 11.1 hereof or refraining to take any action pending such
instructions; (vii) shall not be liable for any apportionment or distributions
of payments made by it pursuant to SECTION 3 hereof, absent gross negligence or
willful misconduct; (viii) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent,
certificate, message or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone,
facsimile, telegram, cable or telex) believed in good faith by it to be genuine
and signed or sent by the proper party or parties; and (ix) may assume that no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless Agent has actual
knowledge of the Event of Default, has received notice from Borrower
Representative or Borrowers' independent certified public accountants stating
the nature of the Event of Default, or has received notice from a Lender stating
the nature of the Event of Default and that such Lender considers the Event of
Default to have occurred and to be continuing.

     11.3    FLEET AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its commitment hereunder to
make Loans, Fleet, Fleet Canada and Fleet U.K. shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not Agent, Canadian Agent and U.K.
Agent, as applicable; and the terms "Lender," "Lenders" or "Majority Lenders"
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include each of Fleet, Fleet Canada
and Fleet U.K. in their individual capacity as a Lender. Fleet, Fleet Canada and
Fleet U.K. and its Affiliates may lend money to, and generally engage in any
kind of business with, Borrowers and any Person who may do business with or own
Securities of Borrowers all as if they were not Agents and without any duty to
account therefor to any other Lender.

     11.4    LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon Agents or any other Lender and based on
the financial statements referred to herein and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon Agents or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement. Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on an ongoing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other
similar information regarding Borrowers.

     11.5    INDEMNIFICATION. Lenders agree to indemnify Agents (to the extent
not reimbursed by Borrowers), in accordance with their respective Aggregate
Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,

                                       74
<Page>

incurred by, or asserted against Agents, in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by
Agents under this Agreement; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agents' gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse Agents promptly upon demand for its ratable share, as
set forth above, of any out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees) incurred
by Agents in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiation, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document,
to the extent that Agents are not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrowers. The
obligations of Lenders under this SECTION 11.5 shall survive the payment in full
of all Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. If after payment and
distribution of any amount by Agents to Lenders, any Lender or any other Person,
including Borrowers, any creditor of Borrowers, a liquidator, administrator or
trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from Agents any amount found to have been
wrongfully paid to Agents or disbursed by Agents to Lenders, then Lenders, in
accordance with their respective Aggregate Percentages, shall reimburse Agents
for all such amounts.

     11.6    RIGHTS AND REMEDIES TO BE EXERCISED BY AGENT ONLY. Each Lender
agrees that, except as set forth in SECTION 10.4, no Lender shall have any right
individually (i) to realize upon the security created by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, (ii) to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or (iii) to make demand for payment by Borrowers under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     11.7    AGENCY PROVISIONS RELATING TO COLLATERAL. Each Lender authorizes
and ratifies Agents' entry into this Agreement and the Security Documents for
the benefit of Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Agents with
respect to the Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or
the Security Documents, and the exercise by Agents of the powers set forth
herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Lenders. Agents are hereby
authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or
further consent from any Lender to take any action with respect to any
Collateral or the Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain
perfected Agents' Liens upon the Collateral, for their benefit and the ratable
benefit of Lenders. Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agents at their option
and in their discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Agents upon
any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Agreement and payment and
satisfaction of all Obligations; or (ii) constituting property being sold or
disposed of if Borrower Representative certifies to Agent that the sale or
disposition is made in compliance with SUBSECTION 8.2.9 hereof (and Agents may
rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (iii)
constituting property in which Borrowers owned no interest at the time the Lien
was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) in connection with any
foreclosure sale or other disposition of Collateral after the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default; or (v) if approved, authorized
or ratified in writing by Agent at the direction of all Lenders. Upon request by
Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm in writing Agents' authority to release
particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto. Agents shall have no
obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the
Collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or is cared for, protected or

                                       75
<Page>

insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Agents herein or
pursuant to the Security Documents have been properly or sufficiently or
lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any
particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under
any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of its
rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Agents in this SECTION
11.7 or in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in
respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Agents
may act in any manner they may deem appropriate, in their sole discretion, but
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including given Agents' own
interest in the Collateral as Lenders and that Agents shall have no duty or
liability whatsoever to any Lender.

     11.8    AGENTS' RIGHT TO PURCHASE COMMITMENTS. Agents shall have the right,
but shall not be obligated, at any time upon written notice to any Lender and
with the consent of such Lender, which may be granted or withheld in such
Lender's sole discretion, to purchase for Agents' own account all of such
Lender's interests in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
Obligations, for the available amount of the outstanding Obligations owed to
such Lender, including without limitation, all accrued and unpaid interest and
fees.

     11.9    RIGHT OF SALE, ASSIGNMENT, PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender shall be
permitted to participate, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose, at any
time or times hereafter, of this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents,
or of any portion hereof or thereof, including, without limitation, such
Lender's rights, title, interests, remedies, powers and duties hereunder or
thereunder subject to the terms and conditions set forth below:

             11.9.1 SALES, ASSIGNMENTS. Each Lender hereby agrees that, with
respect to any sale or assignment (other than the purchase of a Participating

Canadian Lender or U.K. Lender to an Affiliate of Agent (i) no such sale or
assignment shall be for an amount of less than $5,000,000 in the aggregate and
$1,000,000 increments in excess thereof, (ii) Agent and, in the absence of an
Event of Default, Borrowers, must consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, to each such assignment to a Person that is not an original signatory
to this Agreement, (iii) the assigning Lender shall pay to Agent a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 and any out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses
incurred by Agent in connection with any such sale or assignment and (iv) Agent,
the assigning Lender and the assignee Lender shall each have executed and
delivered an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. After such sale or assignment
has been consummated (x) the assignee Lender thereupon shall become a "Lender"
for all purposes of this Agreement and (y) the assigning Lender shall have no
further liability for funding the portion of Revolving Loan Commitments assumed
by such other Lender. Any assignment by a Lender shall be on a PRO RATA basis
among all Revolving Credit Loans and Participating Interests.

             11.9.2 PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may grant participations in its
extensions of credit hereunder to any other Lender or other lending institution

<Page>

maturity of any Loan or the stated maturity of any portion of any payment of
principal of, or interest or fees applicable to, any of the Loans; PROVIDED,
that the rights described in this subclause (2) shall not be deemed to include
the right to consent to any amendment with respect to or which has the effect of
requiring any mandatory prepayment of any portion of any Loan or any amendment
or waiver of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) no sale of a participation in
extensions of credit shall in any manner relieve the originating Lender of its
obligations hereunder, (v) the originating Lender shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of such obligations, (vi) Borrowers and Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Lender in
connection with the originating Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (vii) in no event shall any financial
institution purchasing the participation grant a participation in its
participation interest in the Loans without the prior written consent of Agent,
and, in the absence of a Default or an Event of Default, Borrowers, which
consents shall not unreasonably be withheld and (viii) all amounts payable by
Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if the originating Lender had not
sold any such participation. The provisions of this SUBSECTION 11.9.2 do not
apply to the Participating Interests or the Lenders or their Affiliates in their
capacity as holders of the Participating Interests. Any Participation by a
Lender or a Participant shall be on a PRO RATA basis among all Revolving Credit
Loans and Participating Interests.

available at reasonable times to meet with and answer questions of potential
assignees and Participants; and (ii) subject to the provisions of SECTION 12.14
hereof, such Lender may disclose credit information regarding Borrowers to any
potential Participant or assignee.

             11.9.4 NON U.S. RESIDENT TRANSFEREES. If, pursuant to this
SECTION 11.9, any interest in this Agreement or any Loans is transferred to any
transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States or any state thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
transferee (other than any Participant), and may cause any Participant,
concurrently with and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such
transfer, to (i) represent to the transferor Lender (for the benefit of the
transferor Lender, Agent and Borrowers) that under applicable law and treaties
no taxes will be required to be withheld by Agent, Borrowers or the transferor
Lender with respect to any payments to be made to such transferee in respect of
the interest so transferred, (ii) furnish to the transferor Lender, Agent and
Borrower Representative either United States Internal Revenue Service Form

benefit of the transferor Lender, Agent and Borrowers) to provide the transferor
Lender, Agent and Borrower Representative a new Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI upon
the obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in
accordance with applicable United States laws and regulations and amendments
duly executed and completed by such transferee, and to comply from time to time
with all applicable United States laws and regulations with regard to such
withholding tax

                                       77

exemption. The provisions of this SUBSECTION 11.9.4 are subject to the
provisions of SECTION 2.13(c).

     11.10   AMENDMENT. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, any Note),
nor consent to any departure by Borrowers therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders
and Borrowers, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED, that

Loan Commitments, or any Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, (2) reduce the
principal of, or interest on, any amount payable hereunder or under any Note or

hereof and any Assignment and Assumption Agreement to reflect such adjustments.

     11.11   RESIGNATION OF AGENT; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. Each of Agent,
Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent may resign as such by giving not less than thirty
(30) days' prior written notice, in the case of Agent, to Lenders and Borrower,
and in the case of Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent, to Lenders. If Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then, (i) subject to the
consent of Borrowers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which
consent shall not be required during any period in which a Default or an Event
of Default exists) in the case of Agent only, Majority Lenders shall appoint
from among Lenders (located in the relevant jurisdiction) successor agents or
agent, as applicable, for Lenders or (ii) if successor agents or agent, as
applicable, shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day
period following such Agents' notice of such resignation, then Agent shall
appoint successor agents or agent, as applicable, who shall serve as Agent until

relevant jurisdiction a successor agent or agents, as applicable. Upon its
appointment, such successor agents or agent shall succeed to the rights, powers
and duties of Agents and the term "Agent", "Canadian Agent", "U.K. Agent" and
"Agents", as applicable, shall mean each such successor effective upon its
appointment, and the former Agents' rights, powers and duties as Agents shall,
as applicable, be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the
part of such former Agents or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the
resignation of such Agents hereunder, the provisions of this SECTION 11 shall
inure to the benefit of such former Agents and such former Agents shall not by
reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any
actions taken or not taken by it while acting as Agents under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Lenders or the
Borrowers, an Affiliate of Fleet Capital Canada Corporation or Fleet Capital
Corporation may be appointed by Fleet Capital Canada Corporation to replace
Fleet Capital Canada Corporation as Canadian Agent hereunder; PROVIDED, that
such replacement Canadian Agent shall provide prior notice to Borrowers of such
replacement.

     11.12   AUDIT AND EXAMINATION REPORTS; DISCLAIMER BY LENDERS. By signing
this Agreement, each Lender:

                    (a)  is deemed to have requested that Agents furnish
     such Lender, promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each audit or

     12.1    POWER OF ATTORNEY. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates,
makes, constitutes and appoints Agent, Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent (and all
Persons designated by Agent, Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent) as such Borrower's
true and lawful attorney (and agent-in-fact), solely with respect to the matters
set forth in this SECTION 12.1, and Agents may, without notice to such Borrower
and in such Borrower's or Agents' name, but at the cost and expense of such
Borrower:

             12.1.1 At such time or times as Agents, in their sole discretion,
may determine, endorse such Borrower's name on any checks, notes, acceptances,
drafts, money orders or any other evidence of payment or proceeds of the
Collateral which come into the possession of Agents or under Agents' control.

             12.1.2 At such time or times upon or after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default as Agents in their sole discretion
may determine: (i) demand payment of the Accounts from the Account Debtors,
enforce payment of the Accounts by legal proceedings or otherwise, and generally
exercise all of such Borrower's rights and remedies with respect to the
collection of the Accounts; (ii) settle, adjust, compromise, discharge or
release any of the Accounts or other Collateral or any legal proceedings brought
to collect any of the Accounts or other Collateral; (iii) sell or assign any of
the Accounts and other Collateral upon such terms, for such amounts and at such
time or times as Agents deem advisable, and at Agents' option, with all
warranties regarding the Collateral disclaimed; (iv) take control, in any
manner, of any item of payment or proceeds relating to any Collateral; (v)
prepare, file and sign such Borrower's name to a proof of claim in bankruptcy or
similar document against any Account Debtor or to any notice of lien, assignment
or satisfaction of lien or similar document in connection with any of the
Collateral; (vi) receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to such
Borrower and notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery
thereof to such address as Agents may designate; (vii) endorse the name of such
Borrower upon any of the items of payment or proceeds relating to any Collateral
and deposit the same to the account of Agents on account of the Obligations;
(viii) endorse the name of such Borrower upon any chattel paper, document,
instrument, invoice, freight bill, bill of lading or similar document or
agreement relating to the Accounts or any other Collateral; (ix) use such
Borrower's stationery and sign the name of such Borrower to verifications of the

Agents' determination, to fulfill such Borrower's

                                       80
<Page>

obligations under this Agreement. The power of attorney granted hereby shall
constitute a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

     12.2    INDEMNITY. Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Agents and each
Lender (and each of their Affiliates) and hold Agents and each Lender (and each
of their Affiliates) harmless (to the extent set out in SECTION 1.3(a)) from and
against any liability, loss, damage, suit, action, proceeding or order ever
suffered or incurred by any such Person (including reasonable legal fees and
legal expenses) as the result of such Borrower's failure to observe, perform or
discharge such Borrower's duties hereunder (except to the extent resulting from
the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Agent or Lenders provided such
gross negligence or intentional misconduct shall not excuse the performance of
any such Person of its Obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents).
In addition, each Borrower shall defend Agents and each Lender (and each of
their Affiliates) against and save it harmless from all claims of any Person
with respect to the Collateral (except to the extent resulting from the gross
negligence or intentional misconduct of any such Person). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, these indemnities shall extend to any claims
asserted against Agents or any Lender (and each of their Affiliates) by any
Person under any Environmental Laws by reason of any Borrower's failure to
comply with laws applicable to solid or hazardous waste materials or other toxic
substances. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, the
obligation of each Borrower under this SECTION 12.2 shall survive the payment in
full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

     12.3    SALE OF INTEREST. Borrowers may not sell, assign or transfer any
interest in this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any of the
Obligations, or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, Borrowers'
rights, title, interests, remedies, powers and duties hereunder or thereunder.

     12.4    SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

     12.5    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement, the Other Agreements and
the Security Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
successors and assigns of Borrowers, Agents and each Lender permitted under
SECTION 11.9 hereof.

     12.6    CUMULATIVE EFFECT; CONFLICT OF TERMS. The provisions of the Other
Agreements and the Security Documents are hereby made cumulative with the
provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in any of the other
Loan Documents by specific reference to the applicable provision of this
Agreement, if any provision contained in this Agreement is in direct conflict
with, or inconsistent with, any provision in any of the other Loan Documents,
the provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control.

     12.7    EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so

                                       81

counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

(3) DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE MAIL, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID. NOTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO AFFECT THE RIGHT OF AGENTS OR ANY LENDER

be required to pay a portion of the Obligations which shall exceed the amount of
loans, advances or other extensions of credit received by such U.S. Borrower and
all interest, costs, fees and expenses attributable to such loans, advances or
other extensions of credit, then such U.S. Borrower shall be reimbursed by the
other U.S. Borrowers for the amount of such excess. This SECTION 12.19 is
intended only to define the relative rights of U.S. Borrowers, and nothing set
forth in SECTION 12.19 is intended or shall impair the obligations of each U.S.
Borrower, jointly and severally, to pay to Agent and Lenders the Obligations as
and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms
hereof.
