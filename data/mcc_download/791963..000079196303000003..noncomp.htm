    <p>A. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser
    has agreed to purchase certain of the property and assets
    used primarily in the Brokerage Business, as currently
    conducted by CIBCWM in the U.S.;</p>
    <p>B. The obligations of the Purchaser under the Asset
    Purchase Agreement are subject to the condition that CIBCWM
    execute and deliver this Non-Competition Agreement;</p>
    <p>C. The Purchaser acknowledges that, in addition to the
    Brokerage Business, CIBCWM currently carries on in the U.S.
    (independently and in conjunction with other subsidiaries and
    affiliates of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canadian
    Imperial Bank of Commerce and its subsidiaries and
    affiliates, including CIBCWM, are collectively referred to
    herein as, &quot;CIBC&quot;) a merchant banking business, and
    a full service investment banking and securities business
    serving institutional and other non-retail market segments;</p>
    <p>D. CIBC acknowledges that at the closing of the
    transaction, CIBC will cease to carry on in the U.S. the
    Brokerage Business and that the re-establishment of such a
    business by CIBC within a reasonable period of time following
    closing of the transaction contemplated in the Asset Purchase
    Agreement would diminish the value of the Brokerage Business
    to the Purchaser; and</p>
    <p>E. This Agreement is intended to recognize the
    Purchaser&#146;s interest in CIBC not re-establishing a
    Brokerage Business in the U.S. within a reasonable period of
    time, and the interest of CIBC in being free to continue to
    carry on its other existing businesses in U.S. and elsewhere.</p>

in any respect.</p>

seek interim and permanent injunctive relief, specific
performance and other equitable remedies.</p>

reasonableness (including the reasonableness of the territory or
the duration and scope of this agreement) in any proceeding to
enforce any provision of this agreement.</p>

including legal proceedings, to prevent or stop any violation,

action by CIBCWM, the Purchaser may take such action in its own
name or otherwise.</p>

deemed to constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or
not similar); nor shall waiver be binding unless executed in
writing by the party to be bound by the waiver.</p>

<p>No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising any right under this agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such right; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude any other or further exercise of such
right or the exercise of any other right.</p>

<p><b>11. </b><b><u>Governing Law</u></b></p>
