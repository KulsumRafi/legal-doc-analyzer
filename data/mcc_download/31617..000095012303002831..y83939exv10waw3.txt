2.       Miscellaneous.
         -------------

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
same meanings as defined in the Credit Agreement.

Except as expressly amended hereby, or as may have been previously amended, the
Credit Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the
original terms thereof.

waiver of any other provision of Credit Agreement or any default which may occur
or may have occurred under the Credit Agreement.

The Companies, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant that (a)
after giving effect to this Amendment, each of the representations and

effect to this Amendment, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is

This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall

counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the parties hereto shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent.

This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document.

THIS AMENDMENT SHALL GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
