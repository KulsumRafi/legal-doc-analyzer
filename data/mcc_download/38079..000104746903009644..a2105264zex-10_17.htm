Participant. Each Deferral Account shall be maintained for the Participant solely as a bookkeeping entry by the Company to evidence unfunded obligations of the Company. The Participant shall be 100%
vested in the Participant's Deferral Account at all times. The balance in a Deferral Account shall initially equal the Deferral Amount specified in the Participant's initial Deferral Election and

A Participant may select Hypothetical Investments or may select an investment manager from a list established by the Committee (a "Manager"), and the Manager will then select Hypothetical Investments

liberal and shall include Hypothetical Investments and Managers representing a wide variety of investment alternatives, and may include private equity securities that, in the judgment of the Company,
(i)&nbsp;can be reasonably valued at least quarterly and (ii)&nbsp;are transferable to accredited investors. The Committee shall consider requests from Participants to add to the initial list of
Hypothetical Investments and Managers and shall satisfy such requests if they are reasonably acceptable to the Committee. The Committee may change or discontinue any Hypothetical Investment or Manager
available under the Plan in its sole discretion. The initial list of Hypothetical Investments and Managers shall be established by the Board or the Committee and provided to potential Participants
prior to the Election Date. The initial list shall include as Hypothetical Investments all stock and compensatory options the Participants are permitted to defer under the Plan. </FONT></P>

more Hypothetical Investments as of the date of the deferral or credit, as the case may be. The amounts of hypothetical income, appreciation and depreciation in value of the Hypothetical Investments
shall be credited and debited to, or otherwise reflected in, such Deferral Account from time to time in accordance with procedures established by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the

reallocation shall not be permitted more than once per calendar quarter without the written consent of the Committee. The Committee
may direct the Managers accordingly; provided, however, that a Manager may reallocate amounts credited to a Deferral Account for which it has responsibility at any time without limitation. No

the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Deferral Account shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of
his or her Deferral Account in any such Hypothetical Investments. In the event that the Company or the Trustee, in its own discretion, decides to invest funds in any or all of the Hypothetical
Investments, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Deferral Account shall at all

to the Committee's satisfaction. The payment of benefits under the Plan to a Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge the Company from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to
