       NOTE: An Employer may elect both the safe harbor formula and the
       discretionary formula described below. If both are selected, the
       discretionary formula shall be treated as an additional Nonelective
       Employer Contribution and allocated separately.

       (a)  / /  SAFE HARBOR FORMULA - Effective only with respect to Plan Years
                 that begin on or after January 1, 1999, the Nonelective
                 Employer Contribution specified in the Safe Harbor Nonelective

                 Contribution on behalf of eligible Active Participants in
                 accordance with Section 5.10. Such contributions shall be
                 allocated to eligible Active Participants in the ratio that
                 each eligible Active Participant's Compensation bears to the
                 total Compensation paid to all eligible Active Participants for
                 the Plan Year.

            (1)  CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT - A Participant shall only
                 be entitled to receive Nonelective Employer Contributions for a

                 either earns at least 501 Hours of Service during the Plan Year
                 or is employed by the Employer or a Related Employer on the

                 Contributions that are FUNDED by the Employer AFTER the Plan

                 Plan Year shall not be subject to the eligibility requirements
                 of Subsection 1.11(b)(1).

                             ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS - Active Participants who
                             do not meet the last day and Hours of Service
                             requirements under Subsection 1.11(b)(1) because
                             they become disabled, as defined in Section 1.13,
                             retire, as provided in Subsection 1.12(a) or (b),

with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as otherwise provided below,
this amendment shall be effective as of the first day of the first plan year
beginning after December 31, 2001.

       beginning after April 1, 2002, pursuant to (a)(1) above, the Plan Limit
       set out in Section 1.07(a) shall continue to apply unless and until the

                        ARTICLE II. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.   SERVICES: Fidelity shall have the responsibility to perform only those
     services set forth in this Agreement, including any Appendices to this
     Agreement. All other matters relating to the Plan shall be the
     responsibility of the Employer and the Plan Administrator. The Employer
     acknowledges that Fidelity does not provide legal or tax advice and that
     the Employer must obtain its own legal and tax counsel for advice on the
     plan design appropriate for its specific situation and on legal and tax
     issues pertaining to the administration of the Plan. The Employer
     acknowledges that the primary method of communicating and conducting
     transactions for the Plan shall be through internet applications. The
     Employer's computer system must meet certain minimum specifications to
     enable this service. Participant communications and transactions shall be
     conducted primarily through the NetBenefits(SM) website ("NetBenefits(SM)")
     or any other application subsequently utilized. A Participant must have
     access to a computer system that meets certain minimum specifications to
     utilize NetBenefits(SM). To the extent NetBenefits(SM) is unavailable to a
     Participant for purposes of certain transactions, the Employer is
     responsible for conducting such transactions in accordance with other
     procedures specified by Fidelity.

2.   DOCUMENTS: The Employer must use the Fidelity e401k(SM) Profit Sharing/
     401(k) Plan ('e401k') Prototype Basic Plan Document, corresponding
     Adoption Agreement, and Service Agreement. The Service Agreement includes
     any Appendices or Amendments, which are expressly made part of the Service
     Agreement. The Employer may not add, delete, or modify the documents in any
     way without the written consent of Fidelity. The Employer shall be
     responsible for completing and executing the Adoption Agreement,
     Standardized or Non-Standardized. Fidelity as the Prototype Plan Sponsor is
     responsible for updating and amending the Prototype plan document and may
     not provide legal advice to the Employer on the completion and execution of
     the documents. The Employer may only rely on the opinion letter issued by
     the National Office of the Internal Revenue Service as evidence that this
     Plan is qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code to the
     extent provided for by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Employer is
     responsible for filing a request with the appropriate IRS office to obtain
     an individual determination letter for the Plan and for paying associated
     IRS user fees.

3.   RELATED EMPLOYERS: The Employer is responsible for determining if the
     Employer is a member of a controlled group of businesses or an affiliated
     service group, as those terms are defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and
     for notifying Fidelity in writing of its determination. Fidelity is under
     no obligation to verify the Employer's determination. Only members of the
     Employer's controlled group or affiliated service group may participate in
     the Plan. If the Standardized Adoption Agreement is adopted by the
     Employer, all members of its controlled group or affiliated service group
     MUST be included in the plan. Failure to do so may result in
     disqualification of the Plan by the Internal Revenue Service. If the
     Non-Standardized Adoption Agreement is adopted by the Employer, group
     members that participate in the Plan must be listed as Related Employers in
     the Adoption Agreement. All employees of group members must be considered
     for the coverage and contribution requirements of the Plan and of any plan
     of a group member. If the Employer's controlled group or affiliated service
     group status changes after initial retention of Fidelity, the Employer must
     provide timely written notification to Fidelity and take other appropriate
     action to include, exclude, or remove group members or former group members
     from the Plan.

4.   CONVERSION METHOD/TRANSITION PERIOD: An existing Employer plan converting
     to Fidelity shall be subject to transition period to facilitate the
     movement of Participant records and Plan assets from the prior recordkeeper
     and/or trustee to a Fidelity. The responsibilities of the Parties, the
     procedures for the conversion, and the duration of the transition period
     are dependent upon the conversion method(s) selected by the Employer in the
     separate Conversion Strategy Agreement and are subject to the conditions
     and limitations contained therein.

                    ARTICLE II. TERMS AND CONDITIONS (CONT.)

5.   INVESTMENTS: Fidelity shall have no discretion or authority with respect to
     the investment of the Plan assets but shall act solely as a directed
     trustee of the contributed funds. All Plan assets must be invested in the
     Permissible Investments identified in Appendix A and are subject to the
     terms and conditions contained therein.

     Forfeitures held by the Plan prior to application and contributions
     received by Fidelity as to which investment instructions have not been
     provided shall be invested in the Permissible Investment selected by the
     Employer for such purposes or, absent Employer selection, in the most
     conservative Permissible Investment designated in Appendix A, until
     investment instructions have been received by Fidelity.

6.   EMPLOYER INVESTMENT DIRECTION: Except to the extent necessary to facilitate
     an amendment to the available investment options in Appendix A, or unless
     otherwise provided in the e401k Basic Plan Document, Adoption Agreement,
     Conversion Strategy Agreement or any Appendix attached to this Agreement,
     Employers shall not be allowed to direct the investments of Participant
     accounts.

7.   INVESTMENT DIRECTIONS BY PARTICIPANTS: Each Participant in the Plan shall
     be permitted to direct the investment of his/her individual account balance
     and future contributions among Permissible Investments through Fidelity's
     internet exchange system, except as otherwise provided in the Plan and this
     Agreement, including any Appendices. The frequency of changes in
     investments shall be determined under the rules applicable to the
     Permissible Investments. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
     including any Appendices, a proper exchange request received by Fidelity
     prior to the closing of the New York Stock Exchange shall be effective on
     that day. The Employer hereby directs Fidelity to act upon such directions
     without questioning the authenticity of the direction other than as
     provided in this section. A Participant shall be required to provided
     his/her Social Security Number and personal identification number. Only
     authorized Plan contacts and the Participant shall have access to a
     Participant's account.

8.   RELIANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION: Fidelity may rely upon and act upon any
     writing or any other medium acceptable to Fidelity, including but not
     limited to electronic medium, from any person authorized by the Employer to
     give instructions concerning the Plan and may conclusively rely upon and be
     protected in acting upon any written or electronic order from the Employer
     or upon any other notice, request, consent, certificate, or other
     instructions or paper reasonably believed by it to have been executed by a
     duly authorized person, so long as it acts in good faith in taking or
     omitting to take any such action. Fidelity need not inquire as to the basis
     in fact of any statement in writing received from the Employer. Fidelity
     shall be entitled to reasonably rely upon the information provided by the
     Employer in performance of its duties hereunder. Unless resulting from
     Fidelity's negligence or willful misconduct, the Employer shall indemnify
     and save harmless Fidelity from any and all liabilities and expenses,
     including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees incurred or
     required to be paid by Fidelity in connection with the Plan.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
     the provisions of the attached Appendices to this Agreement, (i) any
     direction, notice or other communication provided to the Employer or
     Fidelity by another party required to be in writing by the Plan or this
     Service Agreement, (ii) any service provided under this Agreement requiring
     or utilizing written information, or (iii) any written communication or
     disclosure to Participants required by the Plan or this Service Agreement
     may be provided through any medium that is permitted under applicable law
     or regulation and, to the extent so allowed, will no longer require any
     writing to which reference is made in this Agreement.

                    ARTICLE II. TERMS AND CONDITIONS (CONT.)

9.   FEES: As consideration for its services, under this Agreement, Fidelity
     shall be entitled to the fees in accordance with Article I, this Article
     II, and any Appendices or amendments to this Agreement. Fees shall be
     billed to the Employer or charged to Participant accounts as indicated. The
     Employer is responsible for determining whether any fees paid from Plan
     assets are reasonable expenses of administering the Plan as required by the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Fees
     charged to Participant accounts shall be charged as a flat dollar amount to
     all Participants unless otherwise indicated or directed by the Employer. A
     reasonable additional fee shall be charged if Fidelity has to reprocess any
     contribution data transmission due to excessive errors of the Employer or
     its payroll vendor. Fidelity shall be entitled to reasonable compensation
     for its extraordinary costs and expenses incurred in either the termination
     of this Agreement or a change in the Implementation date of this Agreement.
     In the event the Employer terminates this Contract before the second
     anniversary of the Implementation Date, Fidelity reserves the right to
     charge a termination fee equal to the Annual Service Fees specified in
     Article I determined as of the date of termination.

     The Implementation Services fees in Article I shall be billed with the
     initial invoice generated by Fidelity. The Trustee and Administrative
     Services fees in Article I shall become effective as of the Implementation
     Date. Except as otherwise indicated, all other fees under this Agreement,
     including any Appendices, shall become effective as of the Implementation
     Date. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fidelity fees under this Agreement,
     including any Appendices, shall be billed in arrears to the Employer or
     Participants, as applicable, on a quarterly basis during the twelve-month
     annual billing cycle. An Employee is treated as a Participant for purposes
     of the annual per-participant Administrative Services fee if he/she has an
     account balance on any day in the twelve-month annual billing cycle. If
     payment of the aforementioned fees is not received by Fidelity within sixty
     days of receipt of Fidelity's invoice, the fees shall be paid from
     available Plan forfeitures or shall be charged against the respective
     accounts of all Participants in such reasonable manner as the Trustee may
     determine.

     Fidelity may charge a separate Conversion Fee if the Employer acquires
     another Company and merges the acquired Company's plan with its Plan or
     receives additional assets for its Plan. The Conversion Fee shall be
     determined after the relevant information has been received by Fidelity,
     and it shall be communicated to the Employer prior to the conversion.

10.  DURATION AND AMENDMENT: This Agreement shall remain in effect for the
     remainder of the current calendar year and shall thereafter be
     automatically extended for successive one-year terms. Either party, by
     sixty days prior written notice to the other, may terminate this Agreement.
     The receiving party may agree to a shorter notice period. Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Fidelity may alter the
     provisions of this Agreement by giving the Employer written notice of the
     alteration in accordance with Section 8 hereof at least sixty days prior to
     the effective date of the change.

11.  SERVICE PROVIDERS: Fidelity Management Trust Company is the
     non-discretionary Trustee of the Employer's Plan under the e401k(SM)
     Profit Sharing /401(k) Plan. Fidelity may use its affiliates in providing
     the services described in this Agreement.

12.  CONSTRUCTION AND INTERPRETATION: This agreement shall be construed in
     accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts except to the
     extent such laws are superseded by Section 514 of ERISA. Unless defined
     herein or a different meaning is clearly required by the context,
     capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.

     service subsequently employed by Fidelity to facilitate electronic plan
     administration) virtually 24 hours a day. Participants shall direct the

     elections shall have their future contributions invested in the default
     investment option. For Participants who fail to use NetBenefits(SM) to

     Participant's conversion account balance as provided to Fidelity from the
     prior recordkeeper and the applicable earnings allocated to their account
     during the conversion process. Each statement shall contain the following
     message: Your conversion account balance and future contributions have been
     invested based on your investment elections (s) provided to Fidelity
     through NetBenefits(SM). If you failed to contact Fidelity during the

     who requested contribution election changes on a monthly or less frequent
     basis.

     Fidelity does not warrant, guarantee or certify that the above described

     provided by the Employer, the amount available for the loan. Based on the
     interest rate supplied by the Employer in accordance with the terms of the

                    APPENDIX D-LOANS AND WITHDRAWALS (CONT.)

  This appendix describes the loan and withdrawal services for the Employer's
                                     Plan.

     ii.  Duration. The repayment period of any loan shall be no more than five
          years unless such loan is for the purchase of a Participant's primary
          residence, in which case the repayment period may not extend beyond
          ten years from the date of the loan. A loan becomes immediately due
          and payable upon a Participant's termination of employment, death or
          disability.

     iii. Sources. The Administrator may provide that loans only be made from
          certain contribution sources within Participant Account(s) by
          notifying the Trustee in writing of the restricted source.

     iv.  Purpose: A loan will be granted for any general purpose.

     v.   Repayment Method. A loan to an Employee shall be repaid at least
          quarterly by payroll. If repayment is not made by payroll deduction, a
          loan shall be repaid by the Employee to the Employer. Loan repayments
          are forwarded to Fidelity, by the Employer, in the same manner and
          frequency as contributions.

     vi.  Outstanding Loans. A Participant may have only one outstanding loan at
          a time. A Participant with an existing loan may not apply for another
          loan until the existing loan is paid in full. Also, a Participant may
          not (1) refinance an existing loan, (2) apply for an additional loan
          for the purpose of paying off an existing loan, or (3) apply for more
          than one loan during such plan year.

  d. INTEREST RATE - Using PSW, the Employer shall determine, communicate and
     update as appropriate a reasonable rate of interest based on the prevailing
     interest rates charged by persons in the business of lending money for
     loans which would be made under similar circumstances. The interest rate
     shall remain fixed throughout the duration of the loan.

  e. PREPAYMENT - A Participant may prepay the entire outstanding loan balance
     prior to maturity without penalty.

  f. DEFAULT - A Participant's loan shall be considered in default at the end of
     the calendar quarter following a calendar quarter (end of the "cure
     period") for which there is outstanding any part of any payment due
     (principal or interest). The Employer agrees to provide to Fidelity
     information regarding the status of participants relating to loan
     repayments. Fidelity agrees to provide the Employer with information
     regarding the repayment status of outstanding loans and thereafter to
     provide notices to Participants regarding late, missing or insufficient
     payments relating to loans they have outstanding. The Employer hereby
     directs Fidelity to default loans of Participants, in accordance with the
     Plan, after Participants have defaulted by the terms of their loans, but in
     no event later than the date legally required. Notwithstanding the above,
     based upon the information Fidelity has provided regarding the repayment
     status of outstanding loans, the Employer may direct Fidelity not to
     provide notices of delinquency for specific Plan Participants, however, an
     Employer cannot direct Fidelity to delay the loan default.

  g. PRE-EXISTING LOANS - Loans existing prior to the Effective Date of the
     e401k(SM) Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan shall continue under their existing
     terms until repaid. However, Fidelity shall not accept any pre-existing
     loans that require fedelity to hold as security for the loan property other
     than the Participant's vested account.

                    APPENDIX D-LOANS AND WITHDRAWALS (CONT.)
  This appendix describes the loan and withdrawal services for the Employer's
                                     Plan.

2.   PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWALS

     Participant withdrawals and distributions shall be processed in accordance
     with the provisions of the Plan and subject to the following terms and
     conditions:

  a. Except as indicated herein, the Employer hereby directs Fidelity that all
     Participant withdrawals shall be considered pre-approved by the Employer
     and there shall not be any advance notification to the Employer of any
     Participant withdrawal.

  b. Participants shall use Automated Channels (NetBenefits(SM) or any other
     service subsequently employed by Fidelity to facilitate electronic plan
     administration) to request withdrawals. Participant withdrawals that cannot
     be serviced via the Automated Channels shall be referred to the Employer
     for assistance. The Employer understands that currently certain types of
     withdrawals cannot be completed through Automated Channels and agrees that
     Fidelity may expand the Automated Channels service to include those types
     of withdrawals by giving notice (which may be an electronic transmission)
     to the Employer in advance. The Employer is responsible for updating the
     status code, termination date, and hire date for participants via Plan
     Sponsor Webstation(R) (PSW), or other agreed upon transmission.

  c. Participant withdrawals shall be processed any business day during any
     month except, that no withdrawals shall be processed from December 15
     through January 1. The Automated Channels shall determine the amount
     available for withdrawal based on the current value of the Participant's
     Account on the date of the request and any guidelines provided by the
     Employer. The vested percentage on Fidelity's Participant Recordkeeping
     System (FPRS) shall be used to process the distribution. Fidelity shall
     distribute withdrawals directly to Participants based upon the addresses of
     record.

  d. The Employer shall review and approve withdrawal requests via PSW only for
     such distributions requiring approval or verification of the Plan
     Administrator. The following distributions are among those requiring
     approval through PSW:

          i.  withdrawals subject to Spousal consent
          ii. hardship withdrawals
