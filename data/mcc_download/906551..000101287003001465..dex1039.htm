payable to you, constitute an &#147;excess parachute payment&#148; within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147; Code&#148;) and would subject you to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (or
successor or similar provisions), the Company shall pay you an additional amount, which, when reduced by all taxes thereon (including any additional tax owed under Section 4999 of the Code (or successor or similar provision)) provides you with
sufficient cash to pay the amount of excise tax owed by you on all amounts payable hereunder (computed disregarding than such additional payment). If the Internal Revenue Service asserts such an excise tax and the Company does not believe such
excise tax is due, you agree to assist the Company in contesting such assertion; provided the Company advances you funds to pay the amount of excise tax when asserted by the IRS and indemnifies you for any penalties or interest resulting from such
contest.<I></I> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
