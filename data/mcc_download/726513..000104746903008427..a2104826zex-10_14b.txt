hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1.        Section 6.3 (a) of the Operating Agreement is hereby deleted in its

          Committee shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner
          provided herein. All members of the Investment Committee shall be
          either (i) Members of the Company, (ii) officers, directors, trustees,
          employees or beneficiaries of a Member of the Company or (iii) after
          the Trust Termination, the Representatives."

2.        All references in the Operating Agreement to "TMC Designated
          Investment Committee Members" are hereby replaced with "Tribune
          Designated Investment Committee Member."

3.        Except as herein specifically modified and amended, all the terms,
          covenants and conditions of the Operating Agreement are hereby adopted
          and reaffirmed by the parties hereto and shall remain in full force
          and effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
          the meanings ascribed to them in the Operating Agreement. This Second
          Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which
          shall be considered one and the same agreement.
