</TABLE>


6.      OPERATING EXPENSES. Effective June 1, 2003, the Lease is modified by
        deleting Paragraph 6 of the Second Modification and the first sentence
        of Section 2.02 Operating Expenses and substituting in lieu thereof the
        following:

              In the event Lessor's operating expenses for the Building and/or
              project of which the leased premises are a part shall, in any
              calendar year during the term of this Lease exceed, the operating
              expenses paid in calendar year 2003, Lessee agrees to pay as
              additional rent Lessee's pro rata share of such excess operating
              expenses.

              Lessor hereby agrees that Lessee shall not be required to pay its
              prorata share of increases in operating expenses which exceed ten
              percent (10%) per annum compounded annually during the term of
              this Lease.

7.      TENANT IMPROVEMENTS. Lessor agrees to provide Lessee with a tenant
        improvement allowance (the "Allowance") of $7.00 per rentable square
        foot to be applied to the cost of constructing

<PAGE>


Page 3 of 3
Amendment to Lease Agreement


        tenant improvements (the "Tenant Improvements") during the first year of
        the renewal term of this Lease. Any unused portion of the Allowance may
        be applied as a credit toward Tenant's rent. All costs of the Tenant
        Improvements that exceed the Allowance shall be the responsibility of
        Lessee and shall be paid directly to Lessor within thirty (30) days
        after completion of such Tenant Improvements. Any such amounts payable
        by Lessee which are not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date
        will have interest added to the unpaid principal balance at the rate of
        one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month until payment, including any
        added interest, is received in full by Lessor. Any such Tenant
        Improvements shall be constructed by contractors and subcontractors
        approved in writing by Lessor and in accordance with plans and
        specifications to be provided by Lessee and to be approved in writing by
        Lessor prior to commencement of construction of such Tenant
        Improvements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only one-half (1/2) of the
        cost of constructing a new demising wall (exclusive of wall finishes) on
        the seventh (7th) floor of the Building (the "New Demising Wall"), as a
        part of the Tenant Improvements and in connection with the reduction in
        the number of rentable square feet of the leased premises as described
        in Paragraph 3 hereinabove, shall be paid from the Allowance. The other
        one-half of the cost of constructing the New Demising Wall (exclusive of
        wall finishes) shall be paid by Lessor. The cost of wall finishes on the
        New Demising Wall shall be borne solely by Lessee. Lessor shall, at
        Lessor's sole cost and expense, remodel the restrooms located on the
        eighth (8th) floor of the Building in a manner consistent with the
        remodeling of the other restrooms located within the common areas of the
        Building (the "Lessor Improvements"). The Lessor Improvements shall not
        be included as a part of the Tenant Improvements, and no portion of the
        Allowance shall be applied to the cost of constructing the Lessor
        Improvements. The Lessor at its sole expense shall replace the existing
        sign in front of the Building that identifies the Lessee as a tenant of
        the Building with new identification of similar size containing the name
        of Lessee and its business logo. Lessee shall provide Lessor with all
        necessary artwork and shall have the right to approve the final drawings
        for such sign.

8.      RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL SPACE. If Lessee is not in default of any terms,
        covenants or conditions of this Lease, then Lessee, but not any assignee
        or sublessee of Lessee, shall have a right of first refusal to lease any
        space located on the sixth (6th), seventh (7th), or ninth (9th) floors
        of the Building (the "ROFR Space"), if and as such space becomes vacant
        and available for lease from time to time, only upon the following terms
        and conditions:

        (a) The period of this right of first refusal shall begin on June 1,
        2003, and shall expire on May 31, 2013, except to the extent that this
        right of first refusal is terminated earlier in accordance with the
        provisions of this Paragraph 8;

        (b) During the aforedescribed period of this right of first refusal,
        Lessor shall have the right to market the ROFR Space and solicit offers
        from third-parties to lease all or any part of the ROFR Space for such a
        term and upon such other terms and conditions as may be satisfactory to
        the Lessor;

        (c) If Lessor receives an offer from a third-party to lease all or any
        part of the ROFR Space, Lessor shall give a written notice ("Offer
        Notice") of such offer to Lessee specifying in reasonable detail the
        material terms and conditions of such third-party's offer, including a
        description of the particular ROFR Space proposed to be leased, the base
        rental rate (on a rentable per square foot basis), the operating expense
        stop, the dollar amount of any free rent or any other rent concessions,
        the dollar amount of any allowance for construction of leasehold
        improvements and tenant finish, and any other terms and conditions of
        such offer deemed by Lessor to be material. The Offer Notice shall be
        substantially similar to the form of Offer Notice attached hereto as
        Exhibit "D". Within ten (10) business days after receipt of such Offer
        Notice, Lessee

<PAGE>


Page 4 of 4
Amendment to Lease Agreement

        shall notify Lessor in writing if Lessee wishes to exercise the right so
        first refusal granted by this Paragraph 8. If Lessee does not exercise
        its right of first refusal by giving such notice within said ten (10)
        business day period, then the right of first refusal as to the ROFR
        Space described in the Offer Notice shall terminate and Lessor may lease
        such ROFR Space to such third-party upon the terms and conditions
        specified in the Offer Notice. If Lessee exercises its right of first
        refusal by giving of written notice to Lessor within said ten (10)
        business day period, Lessee shall within fourteen (14) business days
        after the giving of such notice, execute and deliver to Lessor either an
        amendment of this Lease to include the ROFR Space, as described in the
        Offer Notice, as part of the leased premises, or a new lease on Lessor's
        then standard office lease form for the same term, at the same base
        rental rate, and upon the other material terms and conditions of the
        third-party's offer, as set forth in the Offer Notice. If Lessee does
        not execute and deliver such amendment of this Lease or such new lease
        within said fourteen (14) business day period, Lessee's right of first
        refusal shall terminate (not subject to any right of reinstatement) and
        Lessor may lease such ROFR Space to any third party upon such terms as
        may be acceptable to Lessor in its sole and absolute discretion;

        (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of the fourth sentence of
        Subparagraph 8 (c) hereinabove, in the event the ROFR Space described in
        the Offer Notice is not leased to such third-party, on the material
        terms and conditions as were contained in the Offer Notice, within sixty
        (60) days after expiration of the ten (10) business day period for
        Lessee's exercise of the right of first refusal, the right of first
        refusal shall be automatically reinstated upon the same terms and
        conditions as set forth in this Paragraph 8; provided, however, Lessee
        shall have no right to reinstatement of its right of first refusal if
        such right has terminated because Lessee has failed to execute an
        amendment of this Lease or a new lease within the fourteen (14) business
        day period (as described in Subparagraph 8 (c) hereinabove, without
        regard to when such termination has occurred during the term of this
        Lease;

        (e) Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the ROFR
        Space shall not include any space which is subject to any renewal
        option, expansion option, right of first refusal, right of first offer,
        or similar right of any tenant of space of the sixth (6th), seventh
        (7th), or ninth (9th) floors of the Building (i) under any lease
        existing as of the date of this First Amendment, or (ii) under any lease
        executed after the date of this First Amendment with regard to space for
        which Lessee's right of first refusal terminated in accordance with the
        provisions of Paragraph 8 (c) hereinabove.

9.      BROKERAGE. Lessor and Lessee each warrants to the other that it has not
        dealt with any broker or agent in connection with the negotiation or
        execution of this First Amendment to Lease other than CB Richard Ellis
        pursuant to a separate agreement. Lessee shall indemnify Lessor against
        all costs, expenses, attorney's fees, and other liability for
        commissions or other compensation claimed by any broker or agent
        claiming the same by, through, or under Lessee.

10.     RATIFICATION; DEFINITION OF TERMS. Lessee hereby ratifies and confirms
        its obligations under the Lease and represents and warrants to Lessor
        that it has no defenses thereto. Additionally, Lessee further confirms
        and ratifies that, as extended hereby, (a) the Lease is and shall remain
        in good standing and in full force and effect and (b) Lessee has no
        claims, counterclaims, set-offs or defenses against Lessor arising out
        of the Lease or in any way relating thereto or arising out of any other
        transaction between Lessor or Lessee. Any terms not expressly herein
        defined shall be given the meanings assigned to them in the Lease.

11.     BINDING EFFECT; GOVERNING LAW. Except as expressly modified hereby, the
        Lease shall govern Lessee's lease of the leased premises. This First
        Amendment shall be binding upon Lessor and

<PAGE>

Amendment to Lease Agreement


        Lessee and their respective successors and assigns. If any inconsistency
        exists or arises between the terms of and the terms of the Lease, the
        terms of this First Amendment shall prevail. The laws of the State in
        which the leased premises are located shall govern this First Amendment.

12.     DELETED PROVISIONS. Any provisions of the Lease which were applicable to
        Lessee's occupancy prior to the renewal of the term herein provided and
        which were heretofore fully performed are hereby now deleted from the
        Lease. Except as expressly modified hereinabove, all terms, conditions
        and covenants of the Lease shall remain unchanged and in full force and
        effect.

13.     COUNTERPARTS. This First Amendment may be executed in multiple
        counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
        which shall constitute one document.
