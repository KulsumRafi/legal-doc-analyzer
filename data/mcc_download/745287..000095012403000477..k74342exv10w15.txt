     of Termination. The Executive will not be entitled to receive any other
     compensation or benefits under this Agreement.

     such an executive's death or Disability; and

(d)  a pro rata portion of the Annual Bonus applicable to the Annual Bonus
     Period during which the Date of Termination occurs based upon actual
     performance for the Annual Bonus Period (such pro rata bonus shall be based

     Securities") provided, however, that the event





                                       4
<PAGE>


     described in this paragraph shall not be deemed to be a Change in Control
     by virtue of any of the following acquisitions: (i) by the Company or,
     direct or indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, (ii) by any
     employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
     corporation controlled by the Company, (iii) by any underwriter temporarily
     holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, (iv)
     pursuant to a Non-Control Transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)), (v)
     pursuant to any acquisition by the Executive or any group of persons
     including the Executive, or (vi) in which Company Voting Securities are
     acquired from the Company, if a majority of the Board of Directors of the
     Company approves a resolution providing expressly that the acquisition
     pursuant to this clause (vi) does not constitute a Change in Control under
     this paragraph (a);

(b)  individuals who, on June 1, 1999, constitute the Board of Directors of the
     Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
     a majority thereof, provided that (i) any person becoming a director
     subsequent to June 1, 1999, whose election, or nomination for election, by
     the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least
     three-quarters of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board (either by a
     specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which
     such person is named as a nominee for director, without objection to such
     nomination) shall be, for purposes of this paragraph (b), considered as
     though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; Provided however,
     that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
     Company as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
     respect to directors or any other actual or threatened solicitation of
     proxies or consents by or on behalf of any person other than the Board of
     Directors shall be deemed to be a member of the Incumbent Board;

(c)  the consummation of a merger or consolidation or similar form of corporate
     reorganization, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
     the assets, of the Company (a "Business Combination") is consummated,
     unless immediately following such Business Combination: (i) more than 50%
     of the total voting power of the corporation resulting from such Business
     Combination (including, without limitation, for purposes of making such 50%
     determination, any shares owned through any entity which directly or
     indirectly has beneficial ownership of the Company Voting Securities or all
     or substantially all of the Company's assets) eligible to elect directors
     of such corporation is represented by shares held by shareholders of the
     Company immediately prior to such Business Combination (either by remaining
     outstanding or being converted), (ii) no person (other than any holding
     company resulting from such Business Combination, any employee benefit plan
     sponsored or maintained by the Company (or the corporation resulting from
     such Business Combination), or any person which beneficially owned,
     immediately prior to such Business Combination, directly or indirectly, 30%
     or more of the Company Voting Securities) becomes the beneficial owner,
     directly or indirectly of 30% or more of the total voting power of the
     outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the
     corporation resulting from such Business Combination, and (iii)





                                       5
<PAGE>


     at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
     corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the
     Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or
     action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Business Combination
     (a "Non-Control Transaction"); or

(d)  the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or
     dissolution of the Company.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur
solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 30% of the
Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Company Voting
Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Company Voting
Securities outstanding, increases the percentage of shares beneficially owned by
such person; provided, that if a Change in Control would occur as a result of
such an acquisition by the Company (if not for the operation of this sentence),
and after the Company's acquisition such person becomes the beneficial owner of
additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of
outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, then a
Change in Control shall occur.

2.8  "Good Reason" means the occurrence of any one of the following events:

(a)  assignment to the Executive of any duties materially and adversely
     inconsistent with the Executive's current position (or such other position
     to which he/she may be promoted) (but excluding a diminution of title which
     does not result in a diminution of status, offices, or responsibilities),
     or any other action by the Company which results in a material and adverse
     change in such position, status, offices, titles or responsibilities;

(b)  the failure of the Company to assign this Agreement to a successor to the
     Company,

(c)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base salary, or

(d)  any material adverse change to the terms and conditions of the Executive's
     employment under this Agreement,

if the Company fails to cure such event within thirty (30) days after written
notice from the Executive; provided, however, that if the event is intentional,
knowing or repeated, the Executive shall not be required to provide written
notice or an opportunity to cure.

                              Restrictive Covenants

3.1  Trade Secrets. Confidential and Proprietary Business Information

(a)  The Company has advised the Executive and the Executive acknowledges that
     it is the policy of the Company to maintain as secret and confidential all
     Protected Information (as defined below), and that Protected Information
     has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the
     Company. "Protected Information" means trade secrets, confidential and
     proprietary business information of the Company, any information of the
     Company other than information which has entered the public domain (unless
     such information entered the public domain through the efforts of or on
     account of the Executive), and all valuable and unique information and
     techniques acquired, developed or used by the Company relating to its
     business, operations, employees and customers, which give the Company a
     competitive advantage over those who do not know the information and
     techniques and which are protected by the Company from unauthorized
     disclosure, including by not limited to, customer lists (including
     potential customers), sources of supply processes, plans, materials,
     pricing information, internal memoranda, marketing plans, internal
     policies, and products and services which may be developed from time to
     time by the Company and its agents or employees.

(b)  The Executive acknowledges that the Executive will acquire Protected
     Information with respect to the Company and its successors in interest,
     which information is valuable, special and a unique asset of the Company's
     business and operations and that disclosure of such Protected Information
     would cause irreparable damage to the Company.

(c)  The Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish or make
     accessible to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity
     (otherwise than as may be required in the regular course of the Executive's
     employment) nor use in any manner, either during or after termination of
     employment by the Company and Protected Information or cause any such
     information of the Company to enter the public domain.

3.2  Non-Competition.

(a)  The Executive agrees that the Executive shall not during the Executive's
     employment with the Company, and, if the Executive's employment is
     terminated for any reason other than termination of employment without
     Cause or for Good Reason, thereafter for a period of one (1) year, directly
     or indirectly, in any capacity, engage or participate in or become employed
     by or render advisory or consulting or other services in connection with
     any Prohibited Business as defined below.

(b)  The Executive agrees that the Executive shall not during the Executive's
     employment with the Company, and, if the Executive's employment is
     terminated for




                                       7
<PAGE>
     any reason, thereafter for a period of one (1 ) year, make any financial
     investment, whether in the form of equity or debt, or own any interest,
     directly or indirectly, in any Prohibited Business. Nothing in this Section
     7.02 shall, however, restrict the Executive from making any investment in
     any Company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or
     actively traded in the over-the-counter market; provided that (i) such
     investment does not give the Executive the right or ability to control or
     influence the policy decisions of any Prohibited Business, and (ii) such
     investment does not create a conflict of interest between the Executive's
     duties hereunder and the Executive's interest in such investment.

(c)  "Prohibited Business" shall be defined as any business and any branch,
     office or operation thereof, which is a direct and material competitor of
     the Company wherever the Company does business, in the United States or
     abroad, and which has established or seeks to establish contact, in
     whatever form (including but not limited to solicitation of sales, or the
     receipt or submission of bids) with any entity who is at any time a client,
     customer or supplier of the Company (including but not limited to all
     subdivisions of the federal government).

(d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Section 3.2, this Section 3.2
     shall not apply if the Executive's employment with the Company terminates
     for any reason during the one-year period following a Change in Control.

3.3  Undertaking Regarding Employees. From the date hereof until two years after
     the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not, directly or
     indirectly, (a) encourage any employee of the Company or its successors in
     interest to leave their employment with the Company or its successors in
     interest; or (b) employ, hire, solicit or, cause to be employed or hired or
     solicited (other than by the Company or its successors in interest), or
     establish a business with, or encourage others to hire, any person who
     within two (2) years prior thereto was employed by the Company or its
     successors in interest, to leave their employment with the Company or its
     successors in interest.

3.4  Disclosure of Employee-Created Trade Secrets. Confidential and Proprietary
     Business Information. The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the
     Company all Protected Information developed in whole or in part by the
     Executive during the Executive's employment with the Company and which
     relate to the Company's business. Such Protected Information is, and shall
     remain, the exclusive property of the Company. All writings created during
     the Executive's employment with the Company (excluding writings unrelated
     to the Company's business) are considered to be "works-for-hire for the
     benefit of the Company and the Company shall own all rights in such
     writings.
