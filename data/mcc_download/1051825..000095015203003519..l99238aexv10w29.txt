      rebuilding, service and support of the Cosworth engines.

   F. Applicant agrees that its failure to observe or perform any of its
      obligations as stated in this Agreement shall constitute a material breach
      of this Agreement.

4. TERM AND TERMINATION; DEFAULT.

   A. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon the execution hereof by
      CART and shall continue through the conclusion of the 2003 Series, unless
      earlier terminated as herein provided.

   B. Either party may terminate this Agreement forthwith by written notice:

      (i)   if the other party fails to observe or perform any of its material
            obligations hereunder or breaches any of the warranties contained
            herein; or

      (ii)  if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent or enters into
            liquidation (other than a voluntary liquidation for the purposes of
            reconstruction, amalgamation or similar reorganization) or enters
            into any arrangement or composition with its creditors, or has a
            receiver or administrator appointed over all or part of its property
            or assets; or

      (iii) if the other party breaches the terms and conditions of the lease
            agreement referred to in Section 3E above.


<PAGE>

   C. Termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any existing
      rights and/or claims that the terminating party may have against the
      other, and shall not relieve such other party from fulfilling the
      obligations accrued prior to such termination.

   D. Upon termination of this Agreement by CART based on material breach of
      this Agreement, (i) Applicant shall forfeit eligibility to receive the
      payments or benefits identified in Exhibit A, and (ii) Applicant shall be
      liable for liquidated damages which shall be defined as all amounts
      identified in Exhibit A theretofore received by or paid on behalf of
      Applicant as provided in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Exhibit A. The parties
      acknowledge that because of the difficulties and inconvenience in
      attempting to establish the damage to CART if Applicant breaches this
      Agreement, the parties agree to the aforesaid damages as liquidated
      damages and not as a penalty, which is the parties' reasonable estimate of
      fair compensation for the foreseeable losses that might result from the
      breach. Applicant understands and agrees that Section 7.4.6 of the CART
      Series Rule Book regarding debts due CART shall apply to such liquidated
      damages.

      authority to enter into this Agreement and execute and deliver this
      Agreement and perform the transactions contemplated herein and that the
      execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation thereby will
      not result in the breach of any agreement or undertaking by which it or
      its affiliated entities are bound, or violate any order, injunction or
      decree of any court, administrative agency or governmental body.

   B. Applicant represents and warrants that it has appropriate financial
      capability to operate a race team, suitable equipment and qualified
      personnel to participate in each and every Series event in 2003, and the
      ability to pay its debts in the normal course of business by way of
      sponsorship contracts or other means. Applicant shall make its books,
      records, and sponsorship contracts available for inspection by CART or its
      designee during normal business hours upon reasonable request and such
      inspection may be imposed by CART as a precondition to the execution of
      this Agreement. The evaluation of the criteria as described in this
      Section 5B shall be at CART's sole discretion. Such books, records, and
      sponsorship contracts shall be kept strictly confidential.

      integral part of this Agreement, is intended to be the sole and complete

      all attorneys? fees, interests and costs therein.

   H. FORCE MAJEURE.

           impossible based upon verified equipment damage or mechanical
           failure, safety considerations, driver injury, or other event or
           circumstances beyond the control of the Applicant including act of
           God, accident, fire, strike or other labor dispute, such failure to

           such force majeure event.

      (ii) If the staging of any Series race event is prevented or cancelled due

           not be obligated in any manner to Applicant with respect to such
           cancelled Series race event.

         less or one hundred ten (110%) percent if such average is greater than
