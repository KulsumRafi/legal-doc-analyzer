<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance Data Systems Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") was established, effective May&nbsp;1, 1999, to provide an opportunity
for a select group of management and highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their regular compensation and bonuses payable for services rendered to Alliance Data Systems Corporation
("ADSC") and its participating affiliates and to receive certain employer contributions. ADSC established the SERP to assist in attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve as officers and
key managers. The SERP is unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. ADSC hereby amends and restates the SERP in its entirety, effective January&nbsp;1, 2003. </FONT></P>

Participants shall vest in the Restorative Contributions in accordance with the vesting schedule and rules applicable to Retirement Contributions. If a Participant terminates employment and receives a
payout of his vested Account at a time when the Account is not fully vested, the Participant will forfeit the nonvested portion of the Account; and the forfeiture shall not be restored for any reason,
including a subsequent reemployment. Forfeitures shall be used to offset future Restorative Contributions. Upon termination of the SERP, unallocated forfeitures shall be returned to the Employer. </FONT></P>

to which will be contributed sufficient assets to fully fund all Accounts. All assets in the rabbi trust will remain subject to the claims of the Employer's creditors, and a Participant will continue
to have the status of an unsecured creditor with respect to the Employer's obligation to make benefit payments. </FONT></P>

credited with interest at a rate of 8% a year, compounded quarterly. The applicable interest rate was established by ADSC and shall be adjusted periodically at the sole discretion of the Committee.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, direct that the Employer invest the amount credited to an Account, in whole or in part, in such property (real, personal, tangible or intangible), as the
Committee may select (collectively the "Investments"), or may direct that the Employer retain the amount credited as cash to be added to its general assets. The Employer shall be the sole owner and

otherwise access any amounts credited to an Account. For example, loans are not permitted. However, amounts may be withdrawn in the event of an "unforeseeable financial emergency," which is an
unanticipated emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the Participant or beneficiary and that would result in severe financial hardship to the individual if early withdrawal were
not permitted. Any such early withdrawal must be approved by the Committee and must be limited to an amount necessary to meet the emergency. If the Committee or its delegate approves a distribution on
this basis, the distribution shall be made as soon as practicable thereafter; and the Participant's right to make Elective Contributions shall be suspended until the first of the month following

SIZE=2><B>Distribution in the Event of Taxation.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participant's benefits under this SERP
becomes taxable to the Participant prior to receipt, a Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of that portion of his or her benefit that has become taxable. Upon the grant of such a
petition, which grant shall not be unreasonably withheld (and, after a Change in Control, shall be granted), the Committee shall cause to be distributed to the Participant funds in an amount equal to
the taxable portion of his or her benefit (which amount shall not exceed the existing balance in a Participant's Account). If the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution shall be made
within 90&nbsp;days of the date when the Participant's petition is granted and shall reduce any subsequent benefits paid under this SERP. </FONT></P>

Participant's Eligible Compensation pursuant to any state, federal, or local law, such amounts shall, to the extent possible, be withheld from the Participant's Eligible Compensation before such
amounts are credited under the SERP. Any additional withholding amount required shall be paid by the Participant to the Employer as a condition to the crediting of any contributions to the
Participant's Account. The Employer shall withhold any required state, federal, or local taxes or other amounts from any benefits payable to a Participant or beneficiary. </FONT></P>
