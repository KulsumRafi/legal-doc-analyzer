year based upon which the Executive shall be entitled to earn an annual cash
incentive bonus (the &#147;Annual Cash Bonus&#148;) for such calendar year if he is
employed by the Corporation on the last day of such year.&#160; In adopting such criteria the Board of Directors
shall establish targeted consolidated performance based upon which the

based upon which the Executive will be entitled to earn an Annual Cash Bonus in
an amount less or greater than 50% of the Corporation Salary but not in excess
of 100% of the Corporation Salary.&#160; The
Annual Cash Bonus earned by the Executive for a calendar year shall be paid
within 90 days after the expiration of such calendar year; provided, however,
in the event the payment of the Annual Cash Bonus (or any portion thereof) when
added to the other compensation (which is taken into account under Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the &#147;Code&#148;)) that is
expected to be paid to the Executive in the same calendar year would, in the
reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors, result in a limitation on
compensation deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code, then in that
event, the Annual Cash Bonus (or affected portion thereof) shall be deferred in
an amount necessary to assure full deductibility of compensation paid to the
Executive for purposes of&#160; Section
162(m) of the Code, with the deferred amount being paid, together with interest
from the date of deferral to the date of payment at the average
interest-bearing cost of funds of the Bank (the deferred amount plus interest
shall be deemed the &#147;Deferred Payment&#148;),&#160;

grant to the Executive one or more options under the Stock Option Plan to
acquire common stock of the Corporation at an exercise price per share equal to
Fair Market Value (as defined in the Stock Option Plan) on the date of grant

the Black-Scholes value per share or such other value per share determined by
an investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors (in either case
utilizing duration, volatility and other criteria reasonably selected by the
Board of Directors) of the shares that will be subject to the option(s) into
100% of the Corporation Salary earned by the Executive for the preceding
calendar year, which value per share shall be determined utilizing the same
methodology (and the same assumptions applied to such methodology) that is used
for grants of stock options at such time for other senior executives of the
Corporation.&#160; If the Corporation&#146;s
consolidated performance is less or greater than the targeted consolidated
performance established by the Committee, the Executive may be awarded</p>

the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Total Payments
(not including any Gross-Up Payment). All determinations as to whether any of
the Total Payments are &#147;parachute payments&#148; (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such
Gross-Up Payment and any amounts relevant to the foregoing sentence shall be
made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Corporation, which may
be the accounting firm then regularly retained by the Corporation (the
&#147;Accounting Firm&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the
&#147;Determination&#148;), together with detailed supporting calculations, regarding the
amount of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant matter, both to the
Corporation and the Executive, within 60 days of the Date of Termination, if
applicable, or such earlier time as is reasonably requested by the Corporation
or the Executive (if the Executive reasonably believes that any of the Total
Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). If the Accounting Firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive
with an opinion that the Executive has substantial authority not to report any
Excise Tax on his Federal income tax return.&#160;
Subject to the determination of any Underpayment or Overpayment, any
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and
the Executive.&#160; As a result of uncertainty
in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that the
Corporation should have made larger Gross-Up Payments (&#147;Underpayment&#148;) or that
Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the Corporation which should not have
been made (&#147;Overpayments&#148;). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred,
which amount shall be redetermined, if necessary, to reflect any final
assessment by the Internal Revenue Service respecting amounts resulting in an
Underpayment or Overpayment. In the case of an Underpayment, the amount of such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of
the Executive, and in the case of an Overpayment, the amount of such
Overpayment shall be promptly paid by the Executive to the Corporation.&#160; The provisions of this Section 8 shall not
be applicable and shall have no force or effect if none of the stock options
held by the Executive under the Stock Option Plan become exercisable solely by
virtue of a Change in Control. If the Total Payments after subtracting the
acceleration and lapse value of the stock options held by the Executive under
the Stock Option Plan that become exercisable solely by virtue of a Change in
Control (the &#147;Adjusted Total Payments&#148;) would be subject, in whole or in part,
to the Excise Tax, then the provisions of this Section 8 shall not be
applicable to the Adjusted Total Payments, but shall continue to apply to and
shall have full force and effect on the part of the Total Payments remaining
after subtracting the Adjusted Total Payments.</font></p>
