Dear Mr. Brunson:

                     As you know, the Board of Directors has approved an
increase in your salary from a rate of $425,000 per annum to a rate of $600,000
per annum subject to an amendment to your employment agreement to provide that
the prior ($425,000) annual rate would be used in computing amounts payable to
you following a termination of employment in certain events. Accordingly, we
hereby agree that the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between you and
the Company dated as of April 30, 1998 (the "Agreement") is amended as follows:


               1.   Section 4(d)(i)(C) is hereby amended by deleting the phrase
                    "the Executive's annual salary hereunder (at the rate then
                    in effect)" where it appears therein and, substituting in
                    place thereof, "a salary at the rate of $425,000 per annum".

               2.   Section 4(d)(ii)(C)(2) is hereby amended by deleting, in
                    clause (i) thereof, the phrase "one year's salary (at the
                    rate then in effect)" where it appears therein and,
                    substituting in place thereof, "$425,000".

                     This letter also confirms that, except as amended thereby,
the Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
