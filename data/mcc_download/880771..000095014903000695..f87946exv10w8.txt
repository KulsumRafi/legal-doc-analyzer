      The following constitute the provisions of the 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan of SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

      1. Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company
and its Designated Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock of
the Company. It is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an
"Employee Stock Purchase Plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. The provisions of the Plan shall, accordingly, be construed so
as to extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the
requirements of that section of the Code.

      2. Definitions.

            (a) "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

compensation.

interruption or termination of service as an Employee. Continuous Status as an
Employee shall not be considered interrupted in the case of a leave of absence
agreed to in writing by the Company, provided that such leave is for a period of
not more than 90 days or reemployment upon the expiration of such leave is
guaranteed by contract or statute.

            (g) "Contributions" shall mean all amounts credited to the account
of a participant pursuant to the Plan.

            (h) "Designated Subsidiaries" shall mean the Subsidiaries which have
been designated by the Board from time to time in its sole discretion as
eligible to participate in the Plan.
<PAGE>
            (i) "Employee" shall mean any person, including an Officer, who is
customarily employed for at least twenty (20) hours per week and more than five
(5) months in a calendar year by the Company or one of its Designated
Subsidiaries.

of the Plan.

            (l) "Offering Date" shall mean the first business day of each
Offering Period of the Plan, except that in the case of an individual who
becomes eligible after the first business day of an Offering Period, the term
"Offering Date" shall mean the first business day of the Purchase Period
coinciding with or next succeeding the day on which that individual becomes an
eligible Employee.

                  Options granted after the first business day of an Offering
Period will be subject to the same terms as the options granted on the first
business day of such Offering Period except that they will have a different
grant date (thus, potentially, a different exercise price) and, because they
expire at the same time as the options granted on the first business day of such
Offering Period, a shorter term.

            (m) "Offering Period" shall mean a period of twenty-four (24) months
commencing on August 1 of every second year commencing August 1, 1996 (i.e., the
second Offering Period will commence on August 1, 1998), except as otherwise
determined under Section 11.

            (n) "Officer" shall mean a person who is an officer of the Company
within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

            (o) "Plan" shall mean this Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

an Offering Period.

            (q) "Subsidiary" shall mean a corporation, domestic or foreign, of
which not less than 50% of the voting shares are held by the Company or a
Subsidiary, whether or not such corporation now exists or is hereafter organized
or acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary.

            (a) Any person who is an Employee as of the Offering Date of a given
Offering Period shall be eligible to participate in such Offering Period under
the Plan, subject to the requirements of Section 5(a) and the limitations
imposed by Section 423(b) of the Code.

            (b) Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the
grant, such Employee (or


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Employee pursuant to
Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding options to
purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting
power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any subsidiary of
the Company, or (ii) if such option would permit his or her rights to purchase
stock under all employee stock purchase plans (described in Section 423 of the
Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) of fair market value of such stock
(determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which
such option is outstanding at any time.

      4. Offering Periods and Purchase Periods.

            (a) Offering Periods. The Plan shall be implemented by a series of
Offering Periods of twenty-four (24) months duration, with new Offering Periods
commencing on or about August 1 of alternating years (or at such other time or
times as may be determined by the Board of Directors). The first Offering Period
shall commence on August 1, 1996 and continue until July 31, 1998. The Plan
shall continue until terminated in accordance with Section 19 hereof. The Board
of Directors of the Company shall have the power to change the duration and/or
the frequency of Offering Periods with respect to future offerings without
shareholder approval if such change is announced at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Offering Period to be affected.

            (b) Purchase Periods. Each Offering Period shall consist of eight
(8) consecutive purchase periods of three (3) months duration. The last day of
each Purchase Period shall be the "Purchase Date" for such Purchase Period. A
Purchase Period commencing on August 1 shall end on the next October 31. A
Purchase Period commencing on November 1 shall end on the next January 31. A
Purchase Period commencing on February 1 shall end on the next April 30. A
Purchase Period commencing on May 1 shall end on the next July 31. The first
Purchase Period shall commence on August 1, 1996 and shall end on October 31,
1996. The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power to change the
duration and/or frequency of Purchase Periods with respect to future purchases
without shareholder approval if such change is announced at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Purchase Period to be
affected.

      5. Participation.

            (a) An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by
completing a subscription agreement on the form provided by the Company and
filing it with the Company's payroll office prior to the applicable Offering
Date, unless a later time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the
Board for all eligible Employees with respect to a given offering. The
subscription agreement shall set forth the percentage of the participant's
Compensation (which shall be not less than 1% and not more than 15%) to be paid
as Contributions pursuant to the Plan.

            (b) Payroll deductions shall commence on the first payroll following
the Offering Date and shall end on the last payroll paid on or prior to the last
Purchase Period of the


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
Offering Period to which the subscription agreement is applicable, unless sooner
terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.

      6. Method of Payment of Contributions.

            (a) The participant shall elect to have payroll deductions made on
each payday during the Offering Period in an amount not less than one percent
(1%) and not more than fifteen percent (15%) of such participant's Compensation
on each such payday. All payroll deductions made by a participant shall be
credited to his or her account under the Plan. A participant may not make any
additional payments into such account.

            (b) A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the
Plan as provided in Section 10, or, on one occasion only during each six (6)
month period during an Offering Period, may increase or decrease the rate of his
or her Contributions during the Offering Period by completing and filing with
the Company a new subscription agreement. The change in rate shall be effective
as of the beginning of the next calendar month following the date of filing of
the new subscription agreement, if the agreement is filed at least ten (10)
business days prior to such date and, if not, as of the beginning of the next
succeeding calendar month.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) herein, a participant's
payroll deductions may be decreased to 0% at such time during any Offering
Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year that the
aggregate of all payroll deductions accumulated with respect to such Offering
Period and any other Offering Period ending within the same calendar year equal
$21,250. Payroll deductions shall re-commence at the rate provided in such
participant's subscription Agreement at the beginning of the first Offering
Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless
terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10.

      7. Grant of Option.

            (a) On the Offering Date of each Offering Period, each eligible
Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an option to
purchase on each Purchase Date a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock
determined by dividing such Employee's Contributions accumulated prior to such
Purchase Date and retained in the participant's account as of the Purchase Date
by the lower of (i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a
share of the Company's Common Stock on the Offering Date, or (ii) eighty-five
percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock
on the Purchase Date; provided however, that the maximum number of shares an
Employee may purchase during each calendar year for which an option is
outstanding shall be determined at the Offering Date by dividing $25,000 by the
fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Offering Date,
and provided further that such purchase shall be subject to the limitations set
forth in Sections 3(b) and 13. The fair market value of a share of the Company's
Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 7(b).

            (b) The option price per share of the shares offered in a given
Offering Period shall be the lower of: (i) 85% of the fair market value of a
share of the Common Stock of the


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
Company on the Offering Date; or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of
the Common Stock of the Company on the Purchase Date. The fair market value of
the Company's Common Stock on a given date shall be determined by the Board in
its discretion based on the closing price of the Common Stock for such date (or,
in the event that the Common Stock is not traded on such date, on the
immediately preceding trading date), as reported by the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (Nasdaq) National Market or, if such
price is not reported, the mean of the bid and asked prices per share of the
Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq or, in the event the Common Stock is listed
on a stock exchange, the fair market value per share shall be the closing price
on such exchange on such date (or, in the event that the Common Stock is not
traded on such date, on the immediately preceding trading date), as reported in
The Wall Street Journal.

      8. Exercise of Option. Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as
provided in paragraph 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares will be
exercised automatically on each Purchase Date of an Offering Period, and the
maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased at the
applicable option price with the accumulated Contributions in his or her
account. The shares purchased upon exercise of an option hereunder shall be
deemed to be transferred to the participant on the Purchase Date. During his or
her lifetime, a participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable
only by him or her.

      9. Delivery. As promptly as practicable after each Purchase Date of each
Offering Period, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each participant, as
appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of
his or her option or the deposit of such number of shares with the broker
selected by the Company for administration of Plan stock purchases, as
determined by the Company. Any cash remaining to the credit of a participant's
account under the Plan after a purchase by him or her of shares at the
termination of each Purchase Period, shall be carried over to the next Purchase
Period if the Employee continues to participate in the Plan, or if the Employee
does not continue to participate, shall be returned to said participant.

      10. Voluntary Withdrawal; Termination of Employment.

            (a) A participant may withdraw all but not less than all the
Contributions credited to his or her account under the Plan at any time prior to
each Purchase Date by giving written notice to the Company. All of the
participant's Contributions credited to his or her account will be paid to him
or her promptly after receipt of his or her notice of withdrawal and his or her
option for the current period will be automatically terminated, and no further
Contributions for the purchase of shares will be made during the Offering
Period.

            (b) Upon termination of the participant's Continuous Status as an
Employee prior to the Purchase Date of an Offering Period for any reason,
including retirement or death, the Contributions credited to his or her account
will be returned to him or her or, in the case of his or her death, to the
person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14, and his or her option will
be automatically terminated.


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
            (c) In the event an Employee fails to remain in Continuous Status as
an Employee of the Company for at least twenty (20) hours per week during the
Offering Period in which the employee is a participant, he or she will be deemed
to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to his
or her account will be returned to him or her and his or her option terminated.

            (d) A participant's withdrawal from an offering will not have any
effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in a succeeding offering or in
any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.

      11. Automatic Withdrawal. If the fair market value of the shares on any
Purchase Date of an Offering Period, other than the final Purchase Date of an
Offering Period, is less than the fair market value of the shares on the initial
Offering Date for such Offering Period, then every participant shall
automatically (i) be withdrawn from such Offering Period at the close of such
Purchase Date and after the acquisition of shares for such Purchase Period, and
(ii) be enrolled in a new twenty-four (24) month Offering Period commencing on
the first business day subsequent to such Purchase Period, with subsequent
Offering Periods commencing in twenty-four (24) month periods thereafter.

      12. Interest. No interest shall accrue on the Contributions of a
participant in the Plan.

      13. Stock.

            (a) The maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which
shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be 500,000 shares, subject
to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in
Section 18. If the total number of shares which would otherwise be subject to
options granted pursuant to Section 7(a) on the Offering Date of an Offering
Period exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan (after
deduction of all shares for which options have been exercised or are then
outstanding), the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares
remaining available for option grant in as uniform a manner as shall be
practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable. In such event, the
Company shall give written notice of such reduction of the number of shares
subject to the option to each Employee affected thereby and shall similarly
reduce the rate of Contributions, if necessary.

            (b) The participant will have no interest or voting right in shares
covered by his or her option until such option has been exercised.

            (c) Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will be
registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and
his or her spouse.

      14. Administration. The Board, or a committee named by the Board, shall
supervise and administer the Plan and shall have full power to adopt, amend and
rescind any rules deemed desirable and appropriate for the administration of the
Plan and not inconsistent with the Plan, to construe and interpret the Plan, and
to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration
of the Plan. The composition of the committee shall be in accordance with the


                                      -6-
<PAGE>
requirements to obtain or retain any available exemption from the operation of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.

      15. Designation of Beneficiary.

            (a) A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary
who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account
under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to the end of
a Purchase Period but prior to delivery to him or her of such shares and cash.
In addition, a participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who
is to receive any cash from the participant's account under the Plan in the
event of such participant's death prior to the Purchase Date of an Offering
Period. If a participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the
spouse, spousal consent shall be required for such designation to be effective.

            (b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the
participant (and his or her spouse, if any) at any time by written notice. In
the event of the death of a participant and in the absence of a beneficiary
validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such
participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the
executor or administrator of the estate of the participant, or if no such
executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company),
the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the
spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the participant, or if
no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other
person as the Company may designate.

      16. Transferability. Neither Contributions credited to a participant's
account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive
shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise
disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution, or as provided in Section 15) by the participant. Any such attempt
at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect,
except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in
accordance with Section 10.

      17. Use of Funds. All Contributions received or held by the Company under
the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company
shall not be obligated to segregate such Contributions.

      18. Reports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant
in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees
promptly following the Purchase Date, which statements will set forth the
amounts of Contributions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares
purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.

      19. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization; Corporate Transactions.

            (a) Adjustment. Subject to any required action by the shareholders
of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each option
under the Plan which has not yet been exercised and the number of shares of
Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but have not
yet been placed under option (collectively,


                                      -7-
<PAGE>
the "Reserves"), as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each
option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised, shall be proportionately
adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common
Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or
decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
without receipt of consideration". Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock
of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall
affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the
number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an option.

            (b) Corporate Transactions. In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period will terminate immediately
prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by
the Board. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another
corporation, each option under the Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option
shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of
such successor corporation, unless the Board determines, in the exercise of its
sole discretion and in lieu of such assumption or substitution, to shorten the
Offering Period then in progress by setting a new Purchase Date (the "New
Purchase Date"). If the Board shortens the Offering Period then in progress in
lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets,
the Board shall notify each participant in writing, at least ten (10) days prior
to the New Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for his or her option has been
changed to the New Purchase Date and that his or her option will be exercised
automatically on the New Purchase Date, unless prior to such date he or she has
withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10. For purposes of
this paragraph, an option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed
if, following the sale of assets or merger, the option confers the right to
purchase, for each share of option stock subject to the option immediately prior
to the sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other
securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by holders of
Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration received
in the sale of assets or merger was not solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code), the Board
may, with the consent of the successor corporation and the participant, provide
for the consideration to be received upon exercise of the option to be solely
common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair market
value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock and the
sale of assets or merger.

            The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole
discretion, also make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price
per share of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, in the event that
the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights
offerings or other increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding


                                      -8-
<PAGE>
Common Stock, and in the event of the Company being consolidated with or merged
into any other corporation.

      20. Amendment or Termination.

            (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time terminate
or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 19, no such termination may
affect options previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any
option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any
participant. In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act, or under Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule
or provision or any applicable law or regulation), the Company shall obtain
shareholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as so required.

            (b) Without shareholder consent and without regard to whether any
participant rights may be considered to have been adversely affected, the Board
(or its committee) shall be entitled to change the Offering Periods and Purchase
Periods, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld
during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts
withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in
excess of the amount designated by a participant in order to adjust for delays
or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed withholding
elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting
and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of
Common Stock for each participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from
the participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or
procedures as the Board (or its committee) determines in its sole discretion
advisable which are consistent with the Plan.

      21. Notices. All notices or other communications by a participant to the
Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly
given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by
the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.

      22. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued with
respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and
delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable
provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which
the shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of
counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

                  As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may
require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time
of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and
without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of
the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.


                                      -9-
<PAGE>
      23. Term of Plan; Effective Date. The Plan shall become effective upon the
earlier to occur of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by
the shareholders of the Company. It shall continue in effect for a term of
twenty (20) years unless sooner terminated under Section 20.

      24. Additional Restrictions of Rule 16b-3. The terms and conditions of
options granted hereunder to, and the purchase of shares by, persons subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall comply with the applicable provisions of
Rule 16b-3. This Plan shall be deemed to contain, and such options shall
contain, and the shares issued upon exercise thereof shall be subject to, such
additional conditions and restrictions as may be required by Rule 16b-3 to
qualify for the maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with
respect to Plan transactions.

      8. I understand that if I dispose of any shares received by me pursuant to
the Plan within 2 years after the Offering Date (the first day of the Offering
Period during which I purchased such shares) or within 1 year after the Purchase
Date, I will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received
ordinary compensation income at the time of such disposition in an amount equal
to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the Purchase Date over
the price which I paid for the shares, regardless of whether I disposed of the
shares at a price less than their fair market value at the Purchase Date. The
remainder of the gain or loss, if any, recognized on such disposition will be
treated as capital gain or loss.

            I hereby agree to notify the Company in writing within 30 days after
the date of any such disposition, and I will make adequate provision for
federal, state or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon
the disposition of the Common Stock. The Company may, but will not be obligated
to, withhold from my compensation the amount necessary to meet any applicable
withholding obligation including any withholding necessary to make available to
the Company any tax deductions or benefits attributable to the sale or early
disposition of Common Stock by me.

      9. If I dispose of such shares at any time after expiration of the 2-year
and 1-year holding periods, I understand that I will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as having received compensation income only to the extent of
an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the excess of the fair market value of the
shares at the time of such disposition over the purchase

change. I further understand that I should consult a tax advisor concerning the
