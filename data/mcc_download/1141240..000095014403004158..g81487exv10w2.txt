          area. Landlord may change the size, dimension, and location of any
          common areas, provided that such change does not materially impair
          Tenant's use and access to the leased premises. If a modification to
          the common areas is required by law or governmental regulation or
          order, Landlord will modify the item. Tenant has the non-exclusive
          license to use the common areas in compliance with Landlord's rules
          and restrictions. Tenant may not solicit any business in the common
          areas or interfere with any other person's right to use the common
          areas.

     G.   Notice of Repairs: Tenant must promptly notify Landlord of any item
          that is in need of repair and that is Landlord's responsibility to
          repair. All requests for repairs to Landlord must be in writing.

     H.   Failure to Repair: Landlord must make a repair for which Landlord is
          responsible within a reasonable period of time after tenant provides
          Landlord written notice of the needed repair. If tenant fails to
          repair or maintain an item for which Tenant is responsible within 10
          days after Landlord provides Tenant written notice of the needed
          repair or maintenance, Landlord may: (1) repair or maintain the item,
          without liability for any damage or loss to Tenant, and Tenant must
          immediately reimburse Landlord for the cost to repair or maintain; or
          (2) exercise Landlord's remedies under Paragraph 20.

16.  ALTERATIONS:

     A.   Tenant may not alter, improve, or add to the Property or the leased
          premises without Landlord's written consent. Landlord will not
          unreasonably withhold consent for the tenant to make reasonable
          alterations, modifications, or improvements to the leased premises.

     B.   Tenant may not alter any locks or any security devices on the Property
          or the leased premises without Landlord's consent. If Landlord
          authorizes the
<PAGE>
          changing, addition, or rekeying of any locks or other security
          devices, Tenant must immediately deliver the new keys and access
          devices to Landlord.

     C.   If a governmental order requires alteration or modification to the
          leased premises, the party obligated to maintain and repair the item
          to be modified or altered as designated in Paragraph 15 will, at its
          expense, modify or alter the item in compliance with the order.

     D.   Any alterations, improvements, fixtures or additions to the Property
          or leased premises installed by either party during the term of this
          lease will become Landlord's property and must be surrendered to
          Landlord at the time this lease ends, except for those fixtures
          Landlord requires Tenant to remove under Paragraph 14 or if the
          parties agree otherwise in writing.

17.  LIENS: Tenant may not do anything that will cause the title of the Property
     or leased premises to be encumbered in any way. If Tenant causes a lien to
     be filed against the Property or leased premises, Tenant will within 60
     days after Landlord demands Tenant to take action to remove the lien, pay
     the lien or take whatever action is necessary to cause the lien to be
     released of record. Tenant will provide Landlord a copy of any release
     Tenant obtains pursuant to this paragraph.

18.  LIABILITY: To the extent permitted by law, Landlord is NOT responsible to
     Tenant or Tenant's employees, patrons, guests, or invitees for any damages,
     injuries, or losses to person or property caused by:

     A.   an act, omission, or neglect of: Tenant, Tenant's agent, Tenant's
          guest, Tenant's employees, Tenant's patrons or Tenant's invitees;

     B.   fire, flood, water leaks, ice, snow, hail, winds, explosion, smoke,
          riot, strike, interruption of utilities, theft, burglary, robbery,
          assault, vandalism, other persons, environmental contaminants, or
          other occurrences or casualty losses.

19.  INDEMNITY: Tenant will indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any
     property damage, personal injury, suits, actions, liabilities, damages,
     cost of repairs or service to the leased premises or Property, or any other
     loss caused, negligently or otherwise, by Tenant or tenant's employees,
     patrons, guests, or invitees.

20.  DEFAULT:

     A.   If Landlord fails to comply with this lease within 30 days after
          Tenant notifies Landlord of Landlord's failure to comply, Landlord
          will be in default and Tenant may seek any remedy provided by law. If,
          however, Landlord's non-
<PAGE>
          compliance reasonably requires more than 30 days to cure, Landlord
          will not be in default if the cure is commenced within the 30 day
          period and is diligently pursued.

     B.   If landlord does not actually receive at the place designated for
          payment any rent due under this lease within 5 days after it is due,
          Tenant will be in default. If tenant fails to comply with this lease
          for any other reason within 14 days after landlord notifies Tenant of
          its failure to comply, Tenant will be in default.

     C.   If Tenant is in default, Landlord may terminate Tenant's right to
          occupy the leased premises by providing tenant with at least 14 days
          written notice; Landlord will attempt to mitigate any damage or loss
          caused by Tenant's breach. If Tenant is in default, Tenant will be
          liable for:

          (1)  any lost rent;

          (2)  Landlord's cost of reletting the leased premises, including
          brokerage fees, advertising fees, and other fees necessary to relet
          the leased premises;

          (3)  repairs to the leased premises for use beyond normal wear and
          tear;

          (4)  all Landlord's costs associated with eviction of Tenant, such as
          attorney's fees, court costs, and prejudgment interest;

          (5)  all landlord's costs associated with collection of rent, such as
          collection fees, late charges, and returned check charges;

          (6)  cost of removing any equipment and trade-fixtures left on the
          leased premises by Tenant;

          (7)  cost to remove any trash, debris, personal property, hazardous
          materials, or environmental contaminants left by Tenant or Tenant's
          employees, patrons, guests, or invitees in the leased premises or
          Property; and

          (8)  any other recovery to which Landlord may be entitled by law.

21.  ABANDOMNMENT, INTERRUPTION OF UTILITIES, REMOVAL OF TENANT'S PROPERTY, AND
     LOCKOUT: Chapter 93 of the Texas Property Code governs the rights and
     obligations of the parties with regard to: (a) abandonment of the leased
     premises; (b) interruption of utilities; (c) removal of Tenant's personal
     property; and (d) "lock-out" of Tenant.

22.  HOLDOVER: If Tenant fails to vacate the leased premises at the time this
     lease ends, Tenant will become at tenant-at-will and must vacate the leased
     premises immediately upon receipt of demand from Landlord. No holding over
     by Tenant, with or without the consent of Landlord, will extend this lease.
     Tenant will indemnify Landlord and any prospective tenants for any and all
     damages caused by the holdover. Rent for any holdover period will be 2
     times the base monthly rent plus any additional rent calculated on a daily
     basis and will be immediately due and payable daily without notice or
     demand.
<PAGE>
23.  LANDLORD'S LIEN AND SECURITY INTEREST: To secure tenant's performance under
     this lease, Tenant grants to Landlord a lien and security interest against
     all of Tenant's nonexempt personal property that is in the leased premises
     or Property. This lease is a security agreement for the purposes of the
     Uniform Commercial Code. Landlord may file a copy of this lease as a
     financing statement.

24.  ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING: Tenant may not assign this lease or sublet any
     part of the leased premises without Landlord's written consent. An
     assignment of this lease or subletting of the leased premises without
     Landlord's written consent is voidable by Landlord. If Tenant assigns this
     lease or sublets any part of the leased premises, Tenant will remain liable
     for all of Tenant's obligations under this lease regardless if the
     assignment or sublease is made with or without the consent of Landlord.

          (2)  all advances made under any such lien, encumbrance, or ground

<PAGE>
28.  CASUALTY LOSS:

     A.   Tenant must immediately notify Landlord of any casualty loss in the
          leased premises. Within 20 days after receipt of Tenant's notice of a
          casualty loss, Landlord will notify Tenant if the leased premises are
          less than or more than 50% unusable, on a per square foot basis, and
          if Landlord can substantially restore the leased premises within 120
          days after Tenant notifies Landlord of the casualty loss.

     B.   If the leased premises are less than 50% unusable and Landlord can
          substantially restore the leased premises within 120 days after Tenant
          notifies Landlord of the casualty, Landlord will restore the leased
          premises to substantially the same condition as before the casualty.
          If Landlord fails to substantially restore within the time required,
          Tenant may terminate this lease.

     C.   If the leased premises are more than 50% unusable and Landlord can
          substantially restore the leased premises within 120 days after Tenant
          notifies Landlord of the casualty, Landlord may: (1) terminate this
          lease; or (2) restore the leased premises to substantially the same
          condition as before the casualty. If Landlord chooses to restore and
          does not substantially restore the leased premises within the time
          required, Tenant may terminate this lease.

     D.   If Landlord notifies Tenant that Landlord cannot substantially restore
          the leased premises within 120 days after Tenant notifies Landlord of

          terminate this lease; or (2) choose to restore, notify Tenant of the
          estimated time to restore, and give Tenant the option to terminate

          be reduced from the date Tenant notifies Landlord of the casualty loss
          to the date the leased premises are substantially restored by an
          amount proportionate to the extent the leased premises are unusable.

29.  CONDEMNATION: If after a condemnation or purchase in lieu of condemnation
the leased premises are totally unusable for the purposes stated in this lease,
this lease will terminate. If after a condemnation or purchase in lieu of
condemnation the leased premises are partially unusable for the purposes stated
in this lease, this lease will continue and rent will be reduced in an amount
proportionate to the extent the leased premises are unusable, but if a material
portion of the premises is unusable, the Tenant shall have the right to
terminate this lease. Any condemnation award or proceeds in lieu of condemnation
are the property of Landlord and Tenant has
<PAGE>
no claim to such proceeds or award. Tenant may seek compensation from the
condemning authority for its moving expenses and damages to tenant's personal
property.

default. Landlord is not aware of any material defect on the Property that would

                       IMPROVED PROPERTY COMMERCIAL LEASE

     THIS SUPPLEMENTAL ADDENDUM, dated September 11, 2002, is incorporated into
and made a part of that certain Improved Property Commercial lease of even date

                                   WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant desire to hereby set forth certain terms and
conditions as a supplement to the Lease, and the terms and conditions set forth
in this Supplemental Addendum shall be incorporated into and made a part of the
Lease.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   In connection with Section 3(A) of the Lease, tenant shall have the
          right to defined in the Lease), provided that tenant delivers to

          the Expiration Date. In the event of such a renewal, the base monthly
          rent for the renewal term shall be equal to the market rate for the
          premises (to be determined on the basis of other premises of a
          comparable size, type, and location). Tenant and Landlord shall work
          together in good faith to determine what such market rate shall be,
          but if they cannot come to agreement on such market rate, then the
          market rate shall be deemed to be equal to the average of (i) the
          market rate as determined by a real estate appraiser selected by
          Tenant, and (ii) the market rate as determined by a real estate
          appraiser selected by Landlord.

     2.   Landlord, at its own cost and expense, shall cause to be maintained on
          the leased premises fire insurance and other casualty insurance in

     3.   In connection with Section 8 and 10 and of the lease, Landlord and
          Tenant agree that Tenant shall be permitted to bring only that
          quantity of hazardous materials onto the leased premises necessary to
          accomplish its own business and Tenant may utilize such materials
          thereon, if and only if, Tenant secures all permits, licenses, and
          approvals of any Federal, State, or local governmental agency
          necessary for such activities (including any permits from OSHA or the
          EPA) and complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in
          connection with such activities and disposal of such chemicals, if
          applicable. In connection with its responsibilities under Sections 8
          and 10
<PAGE>
          respectively, tenant shall provide Landlord and Tenant's Insurer with
          all material data safety sheets for each such hazardous chemical
          intended to be brought on the premises and Tenant agrees to update
          Landlord and Insurer as such chemicals change from time to time.
          Tenant shall include in the insurance it purchases in compliance with
          Paragraph No. 10 insurance sufficient to cover Landlord from hazards
          typically associated with the use or storage of such hazardous
          chemicals.

     4.   Landlord acknowledges that Tenant will be keeping proprietary and/or
          confidential information and/or materials on the leased premises, and
          Landlord agrees that if Landlord becomes aware of any nonpublic
          information as a result of Landlord's access to the leased premises
          (whether pursuant to Section 12 of the Lease or otherwise), then
          Landlord agrees that Landlord will not disclose such information to
          any third party without Tenant's prior written consent.

     5.   Notwithstanding Section 15(C) of the Lease, Landlord will repair any
          items listed in Section 15(C ) if and to the extent that such items
          are covered by a warranty held by Landlord.

     6.   In addition to Section 19 of the Lease, Landlord will indemnify and
          hold Tenant harmless from any property damage, personal injury, suits,
          actions, liabilities, damages, cost of repairs or service, or any
          other loss caused, negligently or otherwise, by Landlord or Landlord's
          employees, patrons, guests, or invitees.

     7.   Not withstanding the provisions of Section 22 of the Lease, at the
          time that the Lease ends, Tenant may extend the term of the Lease for
          a period of up to six (6) additional months at a monthly rental rate
          period equal to 1.25 times the base monthly rent then in effect,
          provided that tenant gives Landlord notice of Tenant's intent to
          extend no later than three (3) months prior to the originally
          scheduled Expiration Date for the Lease. This extension shall not
          constitute a "holdover" and will not be deemed to be a breach of the
          Lease. In the event of such a six-month extension, Tenant shall have
          the right, upon expiration of such six-month extension, to renew the
          Lease pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Supplemental Addendum.

     8.   Landlord acknowledges that all improvements and other work items
          reflected on the Leasehold Construction Addendum (as attached to the
          Lease) shall be at the sole cost and expense of Landlord.

     9.   Whenever the Lease requires Tenant to obtain the consent of Landlord
          for a particular action or inaction, Landlord agrees that such consent
          shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. This
          paragraph 9 shall apply to the entire Lease and all appendices,
          attachments, addenda, and exhibits thereto.
