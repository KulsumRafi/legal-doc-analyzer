                                     <b>2002 Investment Incentive Plan</b>



<B><U>PURPOSE</U></B>

Phoenix Investment Partners' 2002 Investment Incentive Plan provides an opportunity for Investment Plan
participants to significantly enhance their compensation if Phoenix Investment Partners achieves its plan and
their investment team meets expectations.


<B><U>PLAN SUMMARY</U></B>


      &#149;   Company incentive pool based on earnings
      &#149;   Investment team pool based on team performance
      &#149;   Individual awards


<B><U>PLAN COMPONENTS</U></B>

&#149;    <b>Company Incentive Pool</b> - A Company incentive pool will be determined based on PXP cash operating
     earnings.  At target, the pool will be funded in an amount equal to the sum of the target incentives for
     all participants in the Management Incentive Plan and the Investment Incentive Plan. This pool will
     increase or decrease by 35% of any change in cash operating earnings.

&#149;    <b>Pool Allocation</b> - Once Company financial results are determined, the Company pool will be allocated in
     proportion to the sum of the target incentives for all participants in the  Management Incentive Plan and
     the Investment Incentive Plan.  Allocation to the individual investment plans will be based on relative
     success of each investment incentive plan.  (See Exhibit A for pool allocation example)

&#149;    <b>Investment Team Objectives</b> - At the beginning of each year, expectations are set for each team, which
     emphasize specific peer group or index measures.  (See Exhibit B for your performance expectations)

&#149;    <b>Incentive Calculation</b> - The total incentive award is calculated in the following steps:
          1. Company pool created based on adjusted cash operating earnings and allocated between MIP and IIP
          2. IIP pool allocated to all investment teams based on their performance relative to benchmarks and
             peer groups
          3. 70% of the award is based on team performance and 30% is based on discretion
         (See Exhibit C for calculation example)

                                                                                                  <b>Exhibit 10.19</b>


&#149;    <b>Discretionary Award</b> - In determining the discretionary award consideration will be given, but not
     limited to, New Revenue Generation, Investment Performance, Sales Effort, Product Development and Expense
     Control.  Consideration may also be given to rankings in other related peer groups and indexes.

<B><U>INCENTIVE TARGET</U></B>

Annually, target incentive awards are established for each participant. Your target incentive award for 2002
is $&laquo;TARGET&raquo;.  Your actual incentive award can range from a minimum of  $0 to a maximum of $&laquo;MAX&raquo;.

<B><U>ELIGIBILITY</U></B>

Your eligibility for this plan is based on your role in substantially influencing the achievement of Company
and investment results. If your employment is terminated for any reason (voluntary or involuntary) other than
death, disability or retirement you will not receive a bonus payment. In the event of termination during the
plan year due to death, disability, or retirement, a pro-rata payment will be made. Employees who become
eligible for participation in the plan during the plan year will be eligible for a pro-rata award based on the
number of months as a plan participant. You must be actively employed by the Company on the day the award is
paid. The Plan does not provide for any pro-rata distribution except as outlined above.



<B><U>PROCESS FOR DETERMINING INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS</U></B>

Following the close of the plan year, investment results and business growth will be determined.
Recommendations for individual awards will be based on overall investment results, on your contribution to
achieving those results, and on business growth.

These recommendations will be submitted to the Chief Executive Officer.  The Chief Executive Officer may at his
discretion, modify awards based on individual contribution or overall investment and Company results.
Regardless of eligibility criteria stated above, employees have no right or entitlement to any incentive award
or calculation until conditions stated in the plan are met, approvals are received and payments are made. The
Company may amend or terminate this plan at any time without advance notice. No consent of any employee is
required to terminate, modify or change this plan. Incentives will be paid subject to normal withholdings and
plan deferrals as soon as is practical after approval by the Chief Executive Officer. All incentive plan awards
are paid at the discretion of the Company.

<B><U>IMPACT ON BENEFITS</U></B>

Incentive payments made under the plan will not be used to determine pay-related benefits under the qualified or
non-qualified benefit plans maintained by the Company.
