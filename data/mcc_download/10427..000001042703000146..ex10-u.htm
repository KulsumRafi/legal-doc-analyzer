</DIR>

<P>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Measurement.</P>
<DIR>

<P>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Plan Year, the Company and each Operating Unit and eligible Participant will set objectives in accordance with this Plan.  These will be applied for Incentive Plan purposes either to fund a Bonus Pool (as to Total Company and Operating Unit Objectives) or to allocate a Bonus Pool among Participants. </P>

<P>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Company, Operating Unit and PMP Objectives will be set early in the Plan Year in which performance is to occur.  Total Company performance will be evaluated based on Total Company Objectives which are set with approval from the Committee.  Operating Unit Objectives for commercial business units shall be based on objective identifiable measures of business performance, including, for example, sales and operating earnings, return on assets/equity and cash flow.  Operating Unit Objectives for units other than commercial business units (e.g., RD&amp;E, Global Supply Chain) shall be based on deliverables required to meet annual plan and longer term objectives, including, for example, cost containment, cost improvement, product launch, product quality and cash flow goals.  All Operating Unit Objectives shall be approved by the relevant Operating Unit head as well as the Senior Vice President- Human Resources, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer.</P>

<P>Company and Operating Unit Objectives will be assigned a weighting for Bonus Pool funding purposes.  (Bonus Pool funding is described further under Section VI of this Plan). The weighting of Company and Operating Unit Objectives will be approved by the Committee at the time Company Objectives are approved. 2003 Annual Incentive Plan weightings for Bonus Pool Funding are set forth in Appendix B hereto.</P>

<P>PMP objectives will be team or individual measures which will, where possible, impact the Operating Unit Objectives and ultimately the Total Company Objectives. PMP objectives shall be set in accordance with guidelines issued by the Senior Vice President-Human Resources, and shall be approved by the immediate manager of the individual or team to whom the measure applies, <U>and</U> that person's immediate manager (i.e., a &quot;one-over-one&quot; approval).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<P>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threshold, Target and Stretch Goals</P>

<P>All objectives  (Total Company, Operating Unit, and PMP objectives where appropriate) will be set with a &quot;target&quot; goal, a &quot;stretch&quot; goal and a &quot;threshold&quot; goal.  Achievement of the &quot;target&quot; goal should reflect performance which is in line with expected performance, and which supports expected Company performance.  &quot;Stretch&quot; goals should assume performance well in excess of that required to achieve the target goal, while &quot;threshold&quot; goals should define a minimum level of performance warranting payment of any Bonus.  &quot;Stretch&quot; and &quot;threshold&quot; goals must be approved with respect to each Objective at the same time and in the same manner that the respective Objective is approved. </P>

<P>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonus Calculation.  </P>
<DIR>

<P>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of an individual Participant's Approved Incentive Award (or Bonus) in any Plan Year is determined as follows:</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bonus Pool for Corporate Officers, Corporate Staff and for each Operating Unit will be calculated and funded based on a factor taking into account (a) Standard Incentive Funding within the Operating Unit or Staff and (b) performance against Company Objectives and, where applicable, Operating Unit Objectives.  Where an Operating Unit has multiple Operating Unit Objectives, performance will be assessed based on aggregate achievement against all Objectives on a weighted average basis in accordance with guidelines established by the Corporate Senior Vice President - Human Resources. </P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bonus Pool which is so determined shall then be allocated among the individual participants within a group (Corporate Officers or Corporate Staff) or Operating Unit based upon achievement by the members of that group or Operating Unit against PMP objectives.  The total of Annual Incentive Awards with respect to a group or Operating Unit shall not exceed the Bonus Pool for such group or Operating Unit.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Approved Incentive Award is based on the extent to which the relevant Bonus Pool is funded and on an assessment of performance against PMP objectives.  Assessment of performance against PMP objectives shall be in accordance with guidelines issued by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, and shall be subject to discretionary upward or downward modification in accordance with such guidelines.</P>

<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where performance against Company or Operating Unit Objectives meets or exceeds the &quot;stretch goal&quot; established with respect to that Objective, the calculation of the funded Bonus Pool which is attributable to that Objective shall be 200% of the Standard Incentive Funding.  This is the maximum extent of Bonus Pool Funding.  Conversely, where performance against a Company or Operating Unit Objective meets the &quot;threshold goal&quot; established with respect to that Objective, the calculation of the funded Bonus Pool will start at 0% of the Standard Incentive Funding. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where actual performance on a particular Objective falls between &quot;threshold&quot;, &quot;target&quot; and &quot;stretch&quot; goals, the Bonus Pool Funding which is attributable to that Objective shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis with respect to the payouts set for achievement of goals (50%, 100%, and 200%) depending on where performance lies between such goals.</P>
</DIR>

<P>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonus Pool Funding may be modified as a result of the following:</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance against Company or Operating Unit Objectives may be modified by the Committee based on the Committee's overall assessment of the manner in which such performance was achieved or, with respect to Operating Unit performance, relative contribution to Total Company Performance.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Bonus Pool Funding for a group or Operating Unit may be modified by the Chief Executive Officer, in his sole discretion, to reflect a group's or Operating Unit's relative contribution to Total Company performance, provided that such modification shall not have the effect of increasing the total Funded Bonus Pool for the Company as a whole beyond the level approved by the Committee.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any modification to the Chief Executive Officer's Approved Incentive Award shall be approved by the Committee.</P>
</DIR>

<P>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual Participant's Approved Incentive Award shall be determined based upon relevant performance against PMP objectives, which will allow for allocation to the Participant of a portion of the funded Bonus Pool of such Participant's group or Operating Unit. Assessment of performance against PMP objectives shall be in accordance with guidelines issued by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources.  Approved Incentive Awards may vary upward or downward against the targeted level based on evaluation of his or her performance PMP objectives.  However, the total of all Bonuses within each group or Operating Unit cannot exceed 100% of the funded Bonus Pool as to such group or Operating Unit.</P>
</DIR>

<P>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change in Status During Plan Year</P>
<DIR>

<P>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Hires and Promotions.</P>
<U><DIR>

</U><P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newly hired or recently promoted employee of the Company who is a Participant in the Plan for at least six months of his/her first Plan Year will be eligible for a Bonus which is based on salary paid during the partial Plan Year after the effective date of hire or promotion, as the case may be.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newly hired or recently promoted employee of the Company who is a Participant for less than six months in his/her initial Plan Year will be eligible for a Bonus for a portion of that Plan Year after the effective date of hire or promotion, as the case may be, only if the terms of such partial Plan Year bonus are agreed to in writing between the Participant and the Company at the time of hire.  These arrangements must be approved in writing in advance by Corporate Senior Vice President Human Resources and normal one-over-one approval matrix.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<P>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers.</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a Participant transfers from one Operating Unit or group to another during a Plan Year, the Bonus for the Plan Year in which the transfer occurs will be based on Bonus Pool Funding as to the particular Operating Unit or group in which the Participant worked for the majority of the Plan Year, or as otherwise approved by the Corporate Senior Vice President Human Resources.</P>
</DIR>

<P>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminations.</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant who terminates voluntarily from the Company during a Plan Year will not be eligible for any bonus for that Plan Year.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of involuntary termination due to death, disability, reduction in work force, or the sale or closing of a plant or business unit before completion by the Participant of at least six months service as an eligible Participant during the Plan Year, such Participant will not be eligible for any Bonus for that Plan Year.  In cases of involuntary termination due to death, disability, reduction in work force, or the sale or closing of a plant or business unit after completion by the Participant of at least six months service as an eligible Participant during the Plan Year, a pro rata Bonus will be calculated and paid in accordance with the Plan.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant who is terminated during a Plan Year involuntarily for any other reason will not be eligible for any Bonus for the Plan Year in which termination occurs.</P>
</DIR>

<P>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of Absence.</P>

<P>An employee whose status as an active employee is changed during a Plan Year as a result of a leave of absence may, at the discretion of the Committee, be eligible for a pro rata Bonus determined in the same way as in Subsection VII A.</P>

<P>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demotions.</P>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is transferred into a non-eligible group of employees after having served six months during the Plan Year shall be paid a pro-rata Bonus determined in the same manner as in Subsection VII A.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is transferred into a non-eligible group of employees prior to having served six months during the Plan Year in an eligible group of employees shall not be entitled to a Bonus.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an employee is transferred into a lower band position within a Plan Year, such employee's Standard Incentive Award percentage shall be based on the band or position in which the employee spent the majority of the Plan Year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of Control.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a special incentive bonus shall be paid to Participants if there is a change in control of the Company during the Plan Year.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the special incentive bonus shall equal the greater of (a) the Bonus based upon &quot;target&quot; performance without regard to any other calculations under the Plan, prorated where applicable, through the date of termination of the Participant's employment where it is terminated involuntarily other than for good cause, or (b) the Bonus which would be payable to the Participant based on results for the full Plan Year, prorated where applicable, through the date of termination of the Participant's employment where it is terminated involuntarily other than for good cause, as applicable.</P>
