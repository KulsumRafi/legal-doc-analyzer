     (a) Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the starting reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

     (b) Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include
the plural and vice versa.

     (c) Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

     (d) Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

                            Agere Systems Proprietary





<PAGE>


     (e) Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general
statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

     (f) Reasonable Commercial Efforts. Reasonable commercial efforts means that
the obligated party is required to make a diligent, reasonable and good faith
effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such obligation, however, does
not require an expenditure of material funds or the incurrence of a liability on
the part of the obligated party, nor does it require that the obligated party
act in a manner that would be contrary to normal commercial practices in order
to accomplish the objective. The fact that the objective is or is not actually
accomplished is no indication that the obligated party did or did not in fact
utilize its reasonable commercial efforts in attempting to accomplish the
objective.

     (g) Schedules and Exhibits. The Schedules and Exhibits attached to this
Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter
disclosed by either party on any one Schedule with respect to any
representation, warranty or covenant of such party shall be deemed disclosed for
purposes of all other representations, warranties or covenants of such party to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure that it also
relates to such other representations, warranties or covenants, and to the
extent any matter disclosed on any Schedule conflicts with any representation,
warranty or covenant of such party contained in this Agreement, and to the
extent such conflict is reasonably apparent thereto, such party shall not have
any liability with respect such representation, warranty or covenant.

Business (x) based upon, or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the
rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in any of the Assigned Intellectual
Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property (collectively, the
"Optoelectronics Intellectual Property"), (y) alleging that the use of the
Optoelectronics Intellectual Property or any services provided, processes used,
or products manufactured, used, imported, offered for sale or sold with respect
to the Optoelectronics Business do or may conflict with, misappropriate,
infringe or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights or other
proprietary rights of any third party, or (z) alleging that Seller or any of its
Affiliates infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated any intellectual
property rights or other proprietary rights of any third party in connection
with the operation of the Optoelectronics Business; and

         (iii) to Seller's knowledge, (A) the Optoelectronics Intellectual
Property constitutes all the material intellectual property rights or other
material proprietary rights owned or licensed (to the extent Seller has a right

one of its Affiliates. Buyer's sole remedy for Seller's failure to deliver the

requires to conduct the Optoelectronics Business after the Closing and to make,
have made, use, lease, import, offer to sell or sell the products, as such
products and services existed as of the Closing Date, of the Optoelectronics
Business. Seller will transfer clear title to the Assigned Intellectual Property

Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable.

foregoing shall not be deemed to apply to the patent applications that Seller is
assigning to Buyer pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement.

Business. Subsequently, in connection with the separation of Agere from Lucent,
Agere and Lucent executed and delivered patent assignments. The ownership of
patents, as between Agere and Lucent, was divided such that Agere or one of its
Affiliates was vested, among other patents, with ownership of patents that

of the foregoing.

         5.3 Tax Reporting and Allocation of Consideration

         (a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller will be
responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding, payment and reporting
duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Seller or a

of the Optoelectronics Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (ii) Buyer
will be responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding, payment and
reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Buyer

the substantive liability of Buyer and Seller under this Agreement with respect
to the Taxes described in this paragraph.

         (b) Seller and Buyer recognize their mutual obligations pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code to timely file IRS Form 8594 (the "Asset Acquisition
Statement") with their respective federal income tax returns. Accordingly,
Seller and Buyer shall, no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
attempt in good faith to (i) enter into a Purchase Price allocation agreement
providing for the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets
consistent with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and (ii) cooperate in the preparation of the Asset
Acquisition Statement in accordance with clause (i) for timely filing with their
respective federal income tax returns. If Seller and Buyer shall have agreed on
a Purchase Price allocation and an Asset Acquisition Statement, then Seller and
Buyer shall file the Asset Acquisition Statement in the form so agreed and
neither Seller nor Buyer shall take a Tax position which is inconsistent with
such Purchase Price allocation, unless compelled to do otherwise by the IRS.

receiving short-term disability benefits or on approved leave of absence on the
Closing Date will become effective as of the date they present themselves for
work with the Buyer or a Buyer Designee. The parties agree to finalize the list
of Business Employees (to include not more than approximately 150 employees plus
Matamoros, Mexico employees Buyer wishes to retain) not later ten (10) days from
the date hereof to whom offers of employment may be made. Buyer understands that
the individuals that are not on such list of Business Employees may be
terminated by Seller, in its sole discretion at any time thereafter except for
any such employees that Seller retains to provide transition services to Buyer
or for its other businesses.

         (b) Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to Transferred Employees, until at least December 31, 2003, the same
salary offered by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing Date as set forth on Schedule 1.1(a ). Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Transferred Employees employee
benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee. Except
as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4, no assets of any Benefit Plan shall
be transferred to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer. Each employee benefit plan,
program, policy and arrangement of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, including any
Pension Plans, Welfare Plans, vacation plans and severance plans, shall
recognize to the extent permitted by Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's plans and to
the extent that it is administratively feasible to do so (i) for purposes of
satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the
coverage period that includes the Closing Date, any payment made by any
Transferred Employee towards deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums in
any health or other insurance plan of Seller or a Subsidiary and (ii) for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and for any schedule
of benefits based on service, all service with Seller or a Subsidiary, including
service with predecessor employers that was recognized by Seller or a Subsidiary
and any prior unbridged service with Seller or a Subsidiary, provided that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee will continue to
provide (x)

relocation assistance to those Transferred Employees receiving it as of the
Closing Date and (y) tuition assistance to those Transferred Employees who are
receiving such benefits as of the Closing Date for the current academic session,
in each case as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b). Buyer or the applicable Buyer
Designee will honor the terms and conditions of Seller's international assignee
program, including repatriation upon completion of assignment, completion
bonuses, Tax equalization and Tax return preparation, with respect to
Transferred Employees who are on international assignment as of the Closing
Date, in each case as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b), except that these costs
shall be allocated between the parties based on the portion of the international
assignment occurring before or on the Closing Date (which shall be Seller's or
the applicable Subsidiary's obligation) and after the Closing Date (which shall
be Buyer's or the applicable Buyer Designee's obligation).

         (c) Seller intends that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not constitute a severance of employment of any Transferred Employee prior
to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and that
such employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately
before and immediately after the Closing Date. Buyer intends that each
Transferred Employee shall be treated as a new employee of Buyer or the
applicable Buyer Designee, subject only to Buyer's commitments hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall provide
severance benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits listed on Schedule
5.4(c) to Transferred Employees whose employment is terminated involuntarily by
Buyer on or before December 31, 2003 other than terminations in circumstances
that would not require payments of severance benefits under Seller's severance
plan.

         (d) Buyer agrees that its and its Affiliate's health and welfare plans
shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusion (to the extent such exclusion
was waived under applicable health and welfare plans offered to the Transferred
Employees by Seller or a Subsidiary) and any proof of insurability. Seller or
the applicable Subsidiary shall remain responsible for any benefits payable
under a Benefit Plan with respect to claims incurred by Business Employees prior
to or on the Closing Date. The medical and dental plans maintained by Buyer and
Affiliates of Buyer shall recognize as dependents of the Transferred Employees
any Class 2 dependents recognized by Seller's or the applicable Subsidiary's
medical and dental plans.

         (e) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause one or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify under
sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer Savings Plan") to provide for
the receipt of Transferred Employees' lump sum cash distributions, in the form
of an eligible rollover distribution from the Agere Systems Inc. Management
401(k) Plan, provided such rollovers are made at the election of the Transferred
Employees and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Savings Plan. Seller
shall cause the Agere Systems Inc. Management 401(k) Plan to permit the
Transferred Employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued
through the Closing Date in accordance with the Code.

         (f) Seller shall make and be responsible for incentive compensation
payments, if any, to Transferred Employees for the period from October 1, 2002
to and including the Closing Date in accordance with its short-term incentive
plan in effect for any such period.

         (g) The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether
any notification may be required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act") as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Seller will be responsible for providing any notification
that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to any of its employees.
Buyer will be responsible for providing any notification that may be required
under the WARN Act with respect to any Transferred Employees terminated after
the Closing Date.

         (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or a Buyer Designee
to employ any Business Employees, or to employ any Transferred Employee on
anything other than an at-will basis, terminable at any time with or without
cause. Except with Buyer's express written consent, Seller shall make no
representation to any Business Employees regarding Buyer's or Buyer Designee's
intentions or plans to hire or not hire any Business Employees or to assume or
honor or to not assume or honor any collective bargaining agreement. Seller
shall instruct its management and supervisory employees in the Optoelectronics
Business or involved in negotiating this transaction to refrain from any such
representation.

         5.5 Collateral Agreements; Leased Equipment

         (a) On or before the Closing Date, Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall
execute and deliver to Seller, and Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall
execute and deliver to Buyer or a Buyer Designee the Collateral Agreements.
Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith the
schedules for the Supply Agreement and the services to be attached to the
Transition Services Agreement.

         (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with the
costs and other terms applicable to the Leased Equipment and Buyer shall decide
whether such Leased Equipment will (i) transfer to Buyer as of the Closing Date
by Buyer assuming the leases for such equipment in which case such lease
agreement shall be deemed a Contract hereunder, (ii) be acquired by Buyer as of
the Closing Date by Buyer paying for the costs of purchasing such equipment to
the applicable Third Party pursuant to the equipment rentals or leases (the
"Purchased Leased Equipment"), or (iii) remain the property of Seller as of the
Closing Date (the "Excluded Leased Equipment").

         5.6 Reasonable Commercial Efforts

         (a) Subject to Section 5.6(b), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions

respective initial filings under the HSR Act and in respect of any foreign
antitrust approval shall be made no later than the fifth business day following

of, the Optoelectronics Business in connection with or pertaining to any subject
matter of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements.

         5.8 Use of Agere Systems' Name

         (a) Buyer and Seller agree as follows:

             (i) Except as provided below, immediately after the Closing Date,
Buyer and any Buyer Designee shall cease using "Agere," "Agere Systems" or other
similar mark (the "Seller Name") and any other trademark, design or logo
previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
those that are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) in
all invoices, letterhead, advertising and promotional materials, office forms or
business cards;

             (ii) Except as provided below, within three (3) months after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (A) remove any other trademark, design or logo
previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates from all
buildings, signs and vehicles of the Optoelectronics Business; and (B) cease
using the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or
currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are
transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) in electronic
databases, web sites, product instructions, packaging (except as provided below)
and other materials, printed or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall not be restricted in using any packaging materials that are in inventory
as of the Closing Date;

             (iii) Buyer shall not be required at any time to remove the Seller
Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by
Seller or any of its Affiliates from inventory of the Optoelectronics Business
that is in existence as of the Closing Date, nor shall Buyer be required at any
time to remove such Seller Name and any such other trademark, design or logo
from schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, machinery, tooling including hand
tools, and the like of the Optoelectronics Business in existence as of the
Closing Date to the extent that such instrumentalities are used in the ordinary
internal conduct of the Optoelectronics Business and are neither generally
observed by the public nor intended for use as means to effectuate or enhance
sales;

             (iv) Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall have the right to sell
existing inventory and to use existing packaging, labeling, containers,
supplies, advertising materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials
bearing the Seller Name or any other trademark, design or logo previously or
currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates until the earlier of (A) one
year after the Closing Date or (B) the depletion of existing inventory;

             (v) Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) to remove
the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently
used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are transferred
pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) from those assets of the
Optoelectronics Business (such as, but not limited to, tools, molds, and
machines) used in association with the manufacture of the

                           Agere Systems Proprietary






<PAGE>


products of the Optoelectronics Business or otherwise reasonably used in the
conduct of the Optoelectronics Business after the Closing. For the purposes of
this Section 5.8(a)(v), "Reasonable Efforts" means Buyer shall remove the Seller
Name from such assets but only at such time when such asset is not operated or
otherwise is taken out of service in the normal course of business due to
regular maintenance or repair (but only for such repairs or maintenance where
such removal could normally be undertaken, for example, repair or maintenance of
a mold cavity) whichever occurs first; provided that, in no event shall Buyer
use the Seller Name after the date which is one (1) year from the Closing Date.
Buyer shall not be required to perform such removal on such assets that are not
or are no longer used to manufacture the products of the Optoelectronics
Business or other parts, or if discontinuance of use of such assets is
reasonably anticipated during such time period, or from assets stored during
that period provided that such marks are removed upon such asset's return to
service or prior to their sale or other disposition.

             (vi) Seller hereby grants to Buyer a limited right to use Seller's
Name and associated trademarks, designs and logos as specified in, and during
the periods, if any, specified in clauses (i) - (v) above.

         (b) In no event shall Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer advertise or hold
itself out as Agere or an Affiliate of Agere after the Closing Date.

         5.9 Non-Solicitation or Hiring of Transferred Employees

         None of Seller, any of its representatives or any of its Affiliates
will at any time prior to one year from the date hereof, directly or indirectly,
solicit the employment of or hire any Transferred Employee without Buyer's prior
written consent. The term "solicit the employment" shall not be deemed to
include generalized searches for employees through media advertisements,
employment firms or otherwise that are not focused on Transferred Employees.
This restriction shall not apply to any employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated by Buyer, or its successors, after the Closing.
Solicitation of employment shall be deemed to occur if the Persons who perform
such solicitation have knowledge of the existence of this Agreement or if such
Persons have no knowledge of the existence of this Agreement but Seller's
employees with knowledge of the existence of this Agreement have advance
knowledge of any such solicitation.

<PAGE>


         5.10 No Negotiation or Solicitation

         Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates will not (and
Seller will cause each of its employees, officers and agents not to) directly or
indirectly (a) solicit, initiate, entertain or encourage the submission of any
proposal, offer or any discussions that might reasonably be expected to lead to
or result in any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the direct or
indirect acquisition of the Optoelectronics Business or any portion of the
Purchased Assets (other than purchases of goods or services from the
Optoelectronics Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice), or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding the
Optoelectronics Business, furnish any information with respect thereto, or
assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or
attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing, except as otherwise
agreed herein. Seller will notify Buyer if any Person makes any proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing within two Business Days
after receipt of any such offer or proposal.

         5.11 Non-Competition

         (a) Seller agrees that, as part of the consideration for the payment of
the Purchase Price, for a period of two (2) years immediately following the
Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, as a principal, stockholder or otherwise, operate, perform or have
any ownership interest in any business that develops, manufactures, sells,
installs or distributes products in competition with the Optoelectronics
Business, except that Seller may (i) purchase or otherwise acquire by merger,
purchase of assets, stock, controlling interest or otherwise any Person or
business or engage in any similar merger and acquisition activity with any
Person the primary business of which is not in competition with the
Optoelectronics Business, or (ii) invest as a minority shareholder in any
Person. For the purposes of this Section 5.11(a), ownership of securities of a
company whose securities are publicly traded under a recognized securities
exchange not in excess of 15% of any class of such securities shall not be
considered to be competition with the Optoelectronics Business, and a Person
shall not be considered to be in the "primary business" of competing with the
Optoelectronics Business if such Person derives less than 30% of its revenues
from products that compete with the Optoelectronics Business. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties agree that the agreements and limitations set forth in
this Section 5.11 shall not apply to any entity that acquires all or part of
Seller in any transaction.

         (b) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section
5.11(a) constitute a material inducement to Buyer's entering into and performing
this Agreement. Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach
of such obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to
Buyer for which there may be no adequate remedy at law and further agrees that
in the event of any breach of said obligation, Buyer may be entitled to
injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the circumstances.

         (c) If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 5.11, but this Section 5.11 shall be construed as if


                                      -44-


                           Agere Systems Proprietary






<PAGE>


such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a
length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed
to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed
to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.11 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law.

         5.11 Future Collaborations

         Seller and Buyer both contemplate the potential for future
collaboration in the development and supply of optical systems that will require
capabilities of both parties to address. On request, each party shall identify
to the other its suitable business contacts for exploring that potential.

6. Confidential Nature of Information

         6.1 Confidentiality Agreement

         Buyer agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to (a) all
documents, materials and other information that it shall have obtained regarding
Seller or its Affiliates during the course of the negotiations leading to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or
after the date of this Agreement), any investigations made in connection
therewith and the preparation of this Agreement and related documents and (b)
all analyses, reports, compilations, evaluations and other materials prepared by
Buyer or its counsel, accountants or financial advisors that contain or
otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any of the provided
information; provided, however, that subject to Section 6.2(a), the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing and shall be of no
further force and effect thereafter with respect to information of Seller or its
Affiliates the ownership of which is transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee.

         6.2 Seller's Proprietary Information

         (a) Except as provided in Section 6.2(b), after the Closing and for a
period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it will
keep confidential all of Seller's and its Affiliates' Proprietary Information
that is received from, or made available by, Seller in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, for purposes of this Section 6.2,
information about the Optoelectronics Business's business plans and strategies,
marketing ideas and concepts, especially with respect to unannounced products
and services, present and future product plans, pricing, volume estimates,
financial data, product enhancement information, business plans, marketing
plans, sales strategies, customer information (including customers' applications
and environments), market testing

information, development plans, specifications, customer requirements,
configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus, sketches, software,
hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or other technical and
business information, except for such Proprietary Information the ownership of
which is transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee as part of the Purchased
Assets. This clause shall not restrict the use of any licensed assets within the
scope of the license.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Proprietary Information shall
not be deemed confidential and Buyer shall have no obligation with respect to
any such Proprietary Information that:

             (i) at the time of disclosure was already known to Buyer other than
as a result of this transaction, free of restriction as evidenced by
documentation in Buyer's possession;

             (ii) is or becomes publicly known through publication, inspection
of a product, or otherwise, and through no negligence or other wrongful act of
Buyer;

             (iii) is received by Buyer from a Third Party without similar
restriction and without breach of any agreement;

             (iv) to the extent it is independently developed by Buyer; or

             (v) is, subject to Section 6.2(c), required to be disclosed under
applicable Law or judicial process.

         (c) If Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is requested or required (by
oral question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Proprietary
Information, Buyer will promptly notify Seller of such request or requirement
and will cooperate with Seller such that Seller may seek an appropriate
protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is
in the opinion of Buyer's counsel compelled to disclose the Proprietary
Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, Buyer (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the Proprietary
Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required by Law. Buyer will
exercise its (and will cause its Affiliates to exercise their) reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Proprietary Information.

         6.3 Buyer's Proprietary Information

         (a) Except as provided in Section 6.3(b), after the Closing Date and
for a period of five (5) years thereafter, Seller agrees that it will keep
confidential all of Seller's and its Affiliates' Proprietary Information the
ownership of which or exclusive use of which is transferred to Buyer as part of

civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Proprietary
Information regarding the Optoelectronics Business, Seller will promptly notify

accounting, stock exchange or federal securities or labor relations Laws
disclosure obligations, both parties agree that the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and all Schedules, attachments and

the contrary, in the event that any such Proprietary Information is also subject
to a limitation on disclosure or use contained in another written agreement
between Buyer and Seller or either of their respective Affiliates that is more
restrictive than the limitation contained in this Article 6, then the limitation
in such agreement shall supersede this Article 6.

9. Status of Agreements

         The rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller under this Agreement
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

         9.1 Effect of Breach

         In the event of a material breach of any representation, certification
or warranty, or agreement or covenant of Seller under this Agreement that is
discovered by the Buyer prior to Closing and that cannot be or is not cured by
Seller upon prior notice and the passage of a reasonable period of time prior to
Closing, the Buyer may elect not to proceed with the Closing hereunder, which
shall be the Buyer's sole remedy for such breach discovered prior to Closing.

         9.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties

         The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article 9
and such representations and warranties shall terminate at the close of business
on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
(i) the representations and warranties in Section 3.7(d) with respect to
environmental matters and the representations and warranties relating to Tax and
ERISA matters shall survive the Closing and shall terminate at the close of
business on the 120th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the environmental, Tax or ERISA liabilities in
question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) and (ii)
the representation and warranty in Section 3.5(a) with respect to title matters
shall survive indefinitely. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability
whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties after the
applicable expiration date.

         9.3 General Agreement to Indemnify

         (a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other party hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer, employee
or agent of such other party or Affiliates thereof (each an "Indemnified Party")
from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities,
obligations, Taxes, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement, interest,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the
foregoing) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Party to the extent that the Losses arise by reason of, or result from (i)
subject to Section 9.2, any breach or any failure of any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to have been true when made
and at and as of the Closing Date, or (ii) the breach by such party


                                      -53-


                           Agere Systems Proprietary






<PAGE>


of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the
extent not waived by the other party.

         (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and any
Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Buyer or any
Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) the
Excluded Liabilities; (ii) Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's waiver of any
applicable Bulk Sales Laws; and (iii) any claim, demand or liability relating
to, pertaining to, or arising out of the Optoelectronics Business or the
Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

         (c) Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any
Seller Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Seller or any
Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any
failure of Buyer to discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) any
medical, health or disability claims of any Transferred Employee or such
Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer accruing after the Closing Date;
and (iii) any claim, demand or liability for Taxes relating to, pertaining to,
or arising out of the Optoelectronics Business or the Purchased Assets for any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

         (d) Amounts payable in respect of the parties' indemnification
obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer and
Seller agree to cooperate in the preparation of a supplemental Asset Acquisition
Statement as required by Section 5.3(b) and Treasury Reg. 'SS' 1.1060-1(e) as a
result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the preceding
sentence. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) chooses to
defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim (as defined below), both parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith or as provided in Section 5.1.

         (e) The amount of the Indemnifying Party's liability under this
Agreement shall be net of any applicable insurance proceeds actually received
by, the Indemnified Party and other savings, including Tax savings, that
actually reduce the overall impact of the Losses upon, the Indemnified Party. In
computing the amount of any such Tax savings, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence of any payment of any indemnified Loss. The
indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article 9 shall
inure to the benefit of the directors, officers and Affiliates of the other
party hereto on the same terms as are applicable to such other party.

         (f) The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under
Section 9.3(a) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate
amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed $1,000,000, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the portion of the Losses exceeding


                                      -54-


                           Agere Systems Proprietary






<PAGE>


$1,000,000, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability for all such
claims shall not exceed $10,000,000.

         (g) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties
to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms, conditions, representations or
warranties contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, this exclusive
remedy for damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for (i)
specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or (ii) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

         (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss of
revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party
in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims. Both parties
shall mitigate their damages.

         (i) The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.3 shall not be
subject to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to
such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.

         9.4 General Procedures for Indemnification

         (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement
shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party, in respect of which indemnity may
be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered
material prejudice by such failure). If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written
notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any claim, action, suit
or proceeding by a Third Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), to assume the defense and control the
settlement of such Third-Party Claim that (i) involves (and continues to
involve) solely money damages, or (ii) involves (and continues to involve)
claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
that cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary
claims asserted by the Third Party and the claims for equitable relief are
incidental to the claims for money damages. If the Indemnifying Party has not
acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, then
the Indemnified Party shall


                                      -55-


                           Agere Systems Proprietary






<PAGE>


have the right to assume and control the defense or the settlement against such
Third Party Claim. In the event that any party exercises its right to undertake
any such defense against any Third Party Claim as provided above, then the other
parties shall cooperate in such defense and make available at such cooperating
party expense all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
such party's possession and control relating thereto as is reasonably required
to by the party conducting the defense.

         (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own
expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as
provided in this Agreement.

         (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any
Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party
Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or
judgment relates solely to monetary damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, enter into any compromise
or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to
take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such Third
Party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and
exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as
it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall
have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which
the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 9.4
with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

         (d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment
pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of
such claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by such failure). Such
notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and
the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall
contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such
a claim shall have been incurred. Such notice shall be given promptly after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such a claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice
of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3,
(i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss
specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii)
notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to contest the existence or amount of
part or all of such a Loss by stating with particularity the basis upon which it
contests the existence or amount thereof.
