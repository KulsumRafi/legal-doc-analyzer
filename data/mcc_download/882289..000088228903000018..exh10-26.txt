          A. The  Company  and the  Executive  have  entered  into an  Executive
Severance Agreement dated as of May 8, 2002 (the "Severance Agreement").

          B. The Company and the Executive now wish to amend Section 4(a) of the
Severance Agreement to increase the severance pay to which the Executive will be
entitled in the event his employment is terminated under certain circumstances.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the covenants
and agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows:

          1. Section 4(a) of the Severance  Agreement is hereby  amended to read
in its entirety as follows:

               "4. Payments upon Termination.

               (a)  Without  Cause or with Good  Reason.  In the event  that the
          Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by the Company for any reason
          other than death, disability or cause as defined in Section 3 (b), (c)
          and  (d)  of  this  Agreement,  or in the  event  that  the  Executive
          terminates  his employment  hereunder with Good Reason,  the Executive
          shall be  entitled to receive  severance  pay in an  aggregate  amount
          equal  to 200% of his  Annual  Compensation,  which  shall  be paid in
          periodic  installments  in  accordance  with the  Company's  customary
          practice over a period of two (2) years,  less any amounts required to
          be withheld by applicable  law, in exchange for a valid release of all
          claims the Executive may have against the Company in a form acceptable
          to the Company.  The Company will also pay to the Executive any earned
          but unused  vacation  time at the rate of pay in effect on the date of
          the notice of termination."

          2. Except as specifically  provided above, the Severance Agreement and
all other terms and provisions  thereof shall continue  unmodified in full force
and effect.

date and year first above written.
