                                AMENDMENTS TO THE
                        CENTURYTEL, INC. DOLLARS & SENSE
                                 PLAN AND TRUST

     CENTURYTEL,  INC.,  represented herein by its Executive  Vice-President and
Chief Financial  Officer,  R. Stewart Ewing,  Jr., as Plan Sponsor and Employer,
does hereby execute the following  amendments to the CenturyTel,  Inc. Dollars &
Sense Plan and Trust:

     1.   Preamble:

          "These   amendments  to  the  Plan  are  adopted  to  reflect  certain
     provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
     ("EGTRRA").   These  amendments  are  intended  to  constitute  good  faith
     compliance  with the  requirements  of EGTRRA  and are to be  construed  in
     accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder.  Except as otherwise
     provided  herein,  each amendment shall be effective as of the first day of
     the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2001."

     2.   Article X is hereby  amended to delete  paragraph (7) thereof,  and to
     re-number paragraphs (8) and (9) as (7) and (8), respectively.

     3.   Section 5.4(d) is hereby amended to read as follows:

          "(d) Defined  Contribution  Dollar  Limitation shall mean $30,000,  as
     adjusted under Code Section  415(d).  For Limitation  Years beginning after
     December  31,  2001,  the  limitation  shall be $40,000,  as  adjusted  for
     increases in the cost-of-living under Section 415(d) of the Code."

     4.   The first  paragraph  of Section  5.4(j) is hereby  amended to read as
     follows:

          "(j)  Maximum   Permissible  Amount  shall  mean  the  maximum  Annual
     Additions that may be contributed or allocated to a  Participant's  Account
     under the Plan for any Limitation Year, not to exceed the lesser of:

     (i)  the defined contribution dollar limitation, or

     (ii) twenty-five  percent (25%) of the  Participant's  Compensation for the
          Limitation  Year.  For Plan Years  beginning  after December 31, 2001,
          this percentage shall be one hundred percent (100%)."

     5.   Insert the following as the second sentence of the second paragraph of
     Section 1.11:

          "For  Plan  Years  beginning  after  December  31,  2001,  the  annual
     Compensation  of  each  Participant   taken  into  account  in  determining
     allocations for any Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2001,  shall not
     exceed $200,000 as adjusted for Cost-of-Living Increases in accordance with
     Code Section  401(a)(17)(B).  Annual Compensation means Compensation during
     the  Plan  Year  or such  other  consecutive  12-month  period  over  which
     Compensation  is  otherwise  determined  under the Plan (the  determination
     period)."

     6.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 11.2(d):

          "For Plan Years  beginning  after  December 31, 2001,  any Employee or
     former  Employee  (including any deceased  Employee) who at any time during
     the Plan Year that  includes the  determination  date was an officer of the
     Employer  having  annual  Compensation  greater than  $130,000 (as adjusted
     under Code Section  416(i)(1) for Plan Years  beginning  after December 31,
     2002),  a 5-percent  owner of the  Employer,  or a  1-percent  owner of the
     Employer  having  annual  Compensation  of more  than  $150,000.  For  this
     purpose,  annual Compensation means compensation within the meaning of Code
     Section 415(c)(3).  The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made
     in accordance  with Code Section  416(i)(1) and the applicable  regulations
     and other guidance of general applicability issued thereunder."

     7.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 11.2(j)(iii):

          "For Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, for purposes of (i)
     and (ii),  above, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply. The present
     value of  accrued  benefits  and the  amounts  of  account  balances  of an
     Employee  as  of  the   determination   date  shall  be  increased  by  the
     distributions made with respect to the Employee under the plan and any plan
     aggregated  with the Plan under Code  Section  416(g)(2)  during the 1-year
     period ending on the determination  date. The preceding sentence shall also
     apply to  distributions  under a  terminated  plan  which,  had it not been
     terminated,  would have been  aggregated  with the Plan under Code  Section
     416(g)(2)(A)(i). In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than
     severance from  employment,  death, or disability,  this provision shall be
     applied by substituting  `5-year  period' for `1-year  period.' The accrued
     benefits and accounts of any individual who has not performed  services for
     the Employer  during the 1-year  period  ending on the  determination  date
     shall not be taken into account."

     8.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 11.4(a):

          "For  Plan  Years   beginning   after  December  31,  2001,   Matching
     Contributions  shall be taken into account for purposes of  satisfying  the
     minimum  contribution  requirements of Code Section 416(c)(2) and the Plan.
     The preceding  sentence shall apply with respect to matching  contributions
     under  the Plan or,  if the Plan  provides  that the  minimum  contribution
     requirement  shall  be met in  another  plan,  such  other  plan.  Matching
     Contributions   that  are  used  to  satisfy   the   minimum   contribution
     requirements shall be treated as matching contributions for purposes of the
     actual contribution  percentage test and other requirements of Code Section
     401(m)."


     9.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 7.10(b)(i):

          "For  distributions  made  after  December  31,  2001,  a portion of a
     distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover  distribution merely
     because the portion consists of after-tax employee  contributions which are
     not  includable in gross income.  However,  such portion may be transferred
     only to an  individual  retirement  account  or annuity  described  in Code
     Section  408(a)  or  (b),  or  to a  qualified  defined  contribution  plan
     described  in Code  Section  401(a) or  403(a)  that  agrees to  separately
     account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the
     portion of such  distribution  which is  includable in gross income and the
     portion of such distribution which is not so includable."

     10.  Insert the following as the third paragraph of Section 7.10(b)(i):

          "Effective for distributions  made after December 31, 2001, any amount
     that is  distributed  on  account  of  hardship  shall  not be an  eligible
     rollover distribution and the distributee may not elect to have any portion
     of such a distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan."

     11.  Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 7.10(b)(ii):

          "For   distributions   made  after  December  31,  2001,  an  eligible
     retirement  plan  shall  also mean an annuity  contract  described  in Code
     Section  403(b) and an eligible  plan under Code  Section  457(b)  which is
     maintained by a state,  political  subdivision of a state, or any agency or
     any  instrumentality  of a state or  political  subdivision  of a state and
     which agrees to separately  account for amounts  transferred into such plan
     from this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply
     in the case of a  distribution  to a  surviving  spouse,  or to a spouse or
     former  spouse  who is the  alternate  payee  under  a  qualified  domestic
     relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p)."

     12.  Insert the following as the fifth paragraph of Section 7.8:

          "The value of a Participant's  nonforfeitable account balance shall be
     determined  without  regard to that portion of the account  balance that is
     attributable to rollover  contributions  (and earnings  allocable  thereto)
     within  the  meaning  of  Code  Sections  402(c),   403(a)(4),   403(b)(8),
     408(d)(3)(A)(ii)  and  457(e)(16).   If  the  value  of  the  Participant's
     nonforfeitable account balance as so determined is $5,000 or less, the Plan
     may immediately  distribute the Participant's entire nonforfeitable account
     balance."

     13.  Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 6.4:

          "For  distributions  made after  December 31, 2001,  if an Employee so
     elects,  a  Participant's   Elective  Deferral   Contributions,   qualified
     non-elective contributions,  qualified matching contributions, and earnings
     attributable to these  contributions shall be distributed on account of the
     Participant's severance from employment. However, such a distribution shall
     be subject to the other  provisions  of the Plan  regarding  distributions,
     other than  provisions  that require a separation  from service before such
     amounts may be distributed."

     14.  Section  1.11 is  amended  by  inserting  the  following  as the  last
     paragraph thereof:

          "For Plan Years  beginning on and after January 1, 2001,  for purposes
     of the  definition  of  Compensation  contained in this Section  1.11,  and
     Sections 1.37, 1.40, 5.4(b) and 11.3 of the Plan, Compensation paid or made
     available  during such years shall  include  elective  amounts that are not
     includible  in the gross  income of the  Employee by reason of Code Section
     132(f)(4)."

     15.  Insert the following as Section 3.7(c)(viii):

          "(viii) The multiple use test described in Treasury Regulation Section
     1.401(m)-2  and this  Section  of the Plan  shall not apply for Plan  Years
     beginning after December 31, 2001."

     16.  Delete the first  sentence of Section  3.1(c) and insert the following
     in lieu thereof:

          "(c) No Participant shall be permitted to have Elective Deferrals made
     under this Plan,  or any other  qualified  plan  maintained by the Employer
     during any taxable  year, in excess of the dollar  limitation  contained in
     Code Section  402(g) in effect for such taxable year,  except to the extent
     permitted  under Section  3.1(d) of this Plan and Code Section  414(v),  if
     applicable."

     17.  Insert the following as Section 3.1(d):

          "(d)  All  Employees  who  are  eligible  to  make  Elective  Deferral
     Contributions under this Plan and who have obtained age 50 before the close
     of the Plan  Year  shall be  eligible  to make  catch-up  contributions  in
     accordance  with, and subject to the  limitations  of, Code Section 414(v).
     Such catch-up contributions shall not be taken into account for purposes of
     the provisions of the Plan  implementing  the required  limitations of Code
     Sections  402(g)  and 415.  The Plan  shall not be  treated  as  failing to
     satisfy the provisions of the Plan  implementing  the  requirements of Code
     Sections 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11),  401(k)(12), 410(b), or 416, as applicable,
     by reason of the making of such catch-up contributions."

     18.  Delete Section 6.5(a)(ii)(2) and insert the following in lieu thereof:

          "(2) All plans  maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee's
     Elective Deferrals (and Employee  Contributions)  will be suspended for six
     months after receipt of the hardship distribution;"
