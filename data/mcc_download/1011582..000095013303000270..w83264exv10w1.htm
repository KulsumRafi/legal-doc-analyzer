</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Peter:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">On April&nbsp;29, 2001, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an
affiliate of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws
of Switzerland (&#147;Roche&#148;), and Digene Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(&#147;Digene&#148;), entered into a letter agreement to set forth the understanding
between Roche and Digene regarding the sale, marketing and distribution of
Digene&#146;s Hybrid Capture&#174; HPV products and the negotiation of a strategic
collaboration and relationship, which letter agreement was amended by the
Amendment to the Letter Agreement dated September&nbsp;7, 2001 (which is hereinafter
referred to as Amendment No.&nbsp;1) and the Amendment to the Letter Agreement dated
October&nbsp;24, 2001 (which is hereinafter referred to as Amendment No.&nbsp;2). The
Letter Agreement dated April&nbsp;29, 2001, Amendment No.&nbsp;1 and Amendment No.&nbsp;2 are
collectively hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Letter Agreement&#148;. The purpose of
this letter agreement (&#147;Amendment No.&nbsp;3&#148;) is to amend certain terms of the
Letter Agreement to reflect our current agreements and understandings. Upon
execution of this Amendment No.&nbsp;3 below, each of Digene and Roche agrees to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Amendment No.&nbsp;3. All capitalized
terms used in this Amendment No.&nbsp;3 without definition have the meanings given
to such terms in the Letter Agreement.
