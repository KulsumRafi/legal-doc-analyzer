                                   ARTICLE II

                      EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON COMPANY STOCK

         Section 2.1  MERGER CONSIDERATION.

         (a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Corporation's Series A
Preferred Stock, no par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action
on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $
0.0002 per share, each share of the Corporation's Series B Preferred Stock,
no par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of any
holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $ 0.0003 per share,
each share of the Corporation's Series C Preferred Stock, no par value,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, by
virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of any holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive $ 0.0003 per share, each
share of the

                                       -2-
<Page>

Corporation's Series D Preferred Stock, no par value, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive $ 0.0011 per share, and each share of the Corporation's
Series E Preferred Stock, no par value, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger and without
further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into the right
to receive $ 0.0019 per share.

         (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company
Shareholders, each share of Company Common Stock and each Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto (subject to any dissenters' rights properly
exercised in accordance with the CGCL);

         (c) each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto;

         (d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no
par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate evidencing
shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall continue to evidence ownership of
such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 2.2  EXCHANGE OF COMPANY STOCK.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall act as exchange
agent in effecting the exchange of cash pursuant to Section 2.1, as applicable,
for certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock which were converted into the
right to receive such cash. On the second Business Day after the Effective Time,
Parent shall mail to each holder of Company Preferred Stock entitled to receive
such cash in exchange for their Company Preferred Stock a letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal"), and instructions for use in surrendering such
Company Preferred Stock and receiving cash pursuant to Section 2.1.

                  Upon the surrender of a properly completed Letter of
         Transmittal to Parent, together with the certificate representing the
         applicable shares of Company Preferred Stock, and such other documents
         as may reasonably be required by Parent, Parent promptly shall cause to
         be issued to the holder of such Company Preferred Stock in exchange
         therefor, as applicable, that portion of the Merger Consideration to
         which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2 (less any amounts
         withheld for applicable withholding taxes). The Company Preferred Stock
         so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

                  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each
         share of Company Preferred Stock shall (subject to dissenters rights
         under the CGCL) be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
         represent only the right to receive upon surrender that portion of the
         Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Corporation Preferred
         Stock is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1.

         (b) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Preferred Stock such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Preferred Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

         (c) LOST SECURITIES. If any certificate evidencing shares of Company
Preferred Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact and the making of an indemnity by the person claiming
such certificate evidencing shares of Company Preferred Stock to be lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent shall

                                       -3-
<Page>

issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate evidencing
shares of Company Preferred Stock, the cash to which such person is entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

         (d) NO FURTHER RIGHTS IN COMPANY STOCK. All cash issued upon conversion
of the Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock.

         Section 2.3 STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company
Options or certificates representing shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Options or shares of Company Stock, except as otherwise
provided by Law.

         Section 2.4 COMPANY OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, all Company
Options, whether vested or unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company
or the holder thereof, be cancelled and cease to exist. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall assume any of the Company Options in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 2.5 NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Company Stock or Company Options for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

         Section 2.6 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. All persons who have executed and
delivered a Shareholders Consent shall be deemed to have consented to the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or delivered a valid, unrevoked proxy
in favor of the Merger, or consented thereto in writing and who has delivered
written notice to the Company objecting to the Merger and demanding payment for
his shares as required in accordance, and has otherwise complied, with the
applicable provisions of the CGCL regarding dissenters rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be terminated and extinguished unless and until such holder
fails to elect to dissent from the Merger or effectively withdraws or otherwise
forfeits his or her dissenters rights under the provisions of the CGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses his or her dissenters rights, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been terminated and extinguished as of the
Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for dissenters rights of any Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments that related to such demands received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for dissenters rights under the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

the Company Subsidiaries are qualified or licensed to do business and each

Subsidiaries so listed.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties

Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect on Parent" means any state of affairs or

Sub, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms subject to (i) the effect of applicable bankruptcy,
fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar federal or
state laws affecting the rights of creditors and (ii) the effect of availability
of rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other
agreeable remedies (regardless or whether any such remedy is considered in a
proceeding or law or in equity).

         Section 4.3 NO CONFLICT. Except as set forth in Section 4.3 of the
Parent Schedule of Exceptions, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
each of Parent and Merger Sub will not:

                  (i) conflict with or violate any provision of its
         organizational documents; and

                  (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and

         Exceptions have been obtained and all filings and obligations described

         conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or by which any
         property or asset of Parent is or may be bound or affected, except for
         any such conflicts or violations that, individually or in the
         aggregate, have no Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         Section 4.4 REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
Parent will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity except (i) for any
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the filing of the Agreement of
Merger as required by the CGCL, filings required under the HSR Act, and (ii)
where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or
to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, have no

                   PLEASE FOLLOW THE ACCOMPANYING INSTRUCTIONS
Ladies and Gentlemen:

         In connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March
21, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Click Commerce, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Click"), Allegis Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Click ("DE Sub"), Allegis Acquisition of California,
Inc., a California corporation and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent

pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into Company (the "Merger"),
the undersigned hereby transmits to you, on the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and this Letter of Transmittal, the Certificate(s) formerly
representing shares of the outstanding capital stock of Company (the "Company

shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.

         Please mail to the undersigned, as instructed below, a check for the
amount of cash to which the undersigned is entitled pursuant to the Merger
Agreement at the closing of the Merger. The undersigned hereby consents and
agrees that the Company and Click shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any
holder of Company Stock ("Company Shareholder") such amounts as Click is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Company or Click, as the case may be, such withheld


<Page>

amounts shall be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company or Click, as the case may be.

         The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that:

         o        the undersigned is the record owner of the shares of Company
                  Stock formerly represented by the Certificate(s) hereby
                  delivered and identified in the box on the preceding page;

         o        the undersigned has full right, power, legal capacity and
                  authority to sell, transfer and deliver the Certificate(s),
                  free and clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances and such
                  shares are not subject to any adverse claims, and there is no
                  limitation or restriction on the sale, transfer and delivery
                  of the Certificate(s); and

         o        the undersigned will, upon request, execute any additional
                  documents necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
                  transfer and cancellation of the shares of Company Stock
                  formerly represented by the Certificate(s) hereby delivered.
                  All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this
                  Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the successors,
                  assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
                  representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected
                  by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the
                  undersigned. The undersigned understands that payment for the
                  Certificates will be made as promptly as practicable after the
                  surrender of the Certificate(s) is made in acceptable form.

         o        The undersigned hereby consents and agrees to the termination
                  and cancellation of such Company Shareholder's options and
                  warrants to acquire Company Stock (if any) without any payment
                  of any consideration therefore.

         Effective upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
the Merger Agreement, except for any rights expressly set forth in the Merger
Agreement, the undersigned hereby releases the Company from any and all claims
of such shareholder against the Company or liabilities or obligations of the
Company or to the undersigned arising under any Company investor agreements or
in connection with the issuance of any securities by the Company to Company
Shareholder, or otherwise as a result of the undersigned having been a
shareholder of the Company.

         The undersigned acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the
shareholder consent, dated March 21st, 2003, delivered by the Company to Company

         1. METHOD OF DELIVERY: The Certificate(s) and this Letter of
Transmittal must be sent or delivered to Justin Dearborn of Click Commerce, Inc.
(the "Exchange Agent"). The method of delivery of the Certificate(s) to be
surrendered to the Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the front of this
Letter of Transmittal is at the option and risk of the surrendering Company
Shareholder. Delivery will be deemed effective only when received. IF THE

         2. CHECK ISSUED IN THE SAME NAME: The check will be issued in the same
name as the surrendered certificate is registered. This Letter of Transmittal
should be completed and signed exactly as the surrendered certificate is
registered. DO NOT SIGN THE CERTIFICATE(S). If any of the Certificate(s) are
owned by two or more joint owners, ALL such owners must sign this Letter of
Transmittal exactly as written on the face of the Certificate(s). If any of the
Certificate(s) are registered in different names on several certificates, it
will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of
Transmittal as there are different registrations. Letters of Transmittal
executed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, officers of
corporations, or others acting in a fiduciary capacity who are not identified as
such in the registration must be accompanied by proper evidence of the signer's
authority to act.

         3. LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL REQUIRED; SURRENDER OF THE CERTIFICATE(S);
LOST CERTIFICATE(S): You will not receive your check unless and until you

OR DESTROYED, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE EXCHANGE AGENT FOR INSTRUCTIONS AT (312)

         4. SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9/SUBSTITUTE FORM W-8: Each tendering shareholder
is required to provide the Exchange Agent with a correct Taxpayer Identification
Number ("TIN") on the Substitute Form W-9 attached as EXHIBIT A, and to certify,
under penalties of perjury, that this number is correct and that the shareholder
is not subject to backup withholding of United States federal income tax. If a
tendering Company Shareholder has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that the shareholder is subject to backup withholding, the Company Shareholder
must cross out item (2) of the Certification box of the Substitute Form W-9,
unless the shareholder has since been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that the Company Shareholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. Failure
to provide the information on the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the tendering
shareholder to 30% United States federal income tax withholding with respect to
any payments received pursuant to the offer. If the tendering Company
Shareholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for one or intends to
apply for one in the near future, the Company Shareholder should write "Applied
For" in the space provided for the TIN in Part I of the Substitute Form W-9, and
sign and date the Substitute Form W-9. If "Applied For" is written in Part I and
the Depositary is not provided with a TIN within 60 days, the Depositary will
withhold 30% on all payments of the purchase price to the shareholder until a
TIN is provided to the Depositary.
