<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive is employed by the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to
assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, in the event of the threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes that
it is important to diminish the distraction of the Executive from Company business because of personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the
Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control. </FONT></P>

excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such
that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and
penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax

public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen business
days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or
auditor for the Company or the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations
required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any
Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's
determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the
