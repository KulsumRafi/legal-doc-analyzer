against Borrower or such Grantor for such interest in the related bankruptcy
proceeding), reimbursement of amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, payments
for early termination of Lender Hedge Agreements, fees, expenses, indemnities or
otherwise, whether voluntary or involuntary, direct or indirect, absolute or

increased, created or incurred, and all or any portion of such obligations or
liabilities that are paid, to the extent all or any part of such payment is
avoided or recovered directly or indirectly from Secured Party or any Lender or
Hedge Agreement Counterparty as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise,
and all obligations of every nature of Grantors now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3. GRANTORS REMAIN LIABLE.

by a certificate of title, upon the filing with the registrar of motor vehicles

certificate of title, the security interests in the Collateral (other than
Collateral consisting of investment property that is not a certificated security
or deposit account) granted to Secured Party for the ratable benefit of Lenders
and Hedge Agreement Counterparties will constitute perfected security interests
therein (except to the extent that recordation of the Lien is required under the
laws of any foreign country or any subdivision thereof with respect to the
Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents) prior to all other Liens (except for
Permitted Encumbrances), and all filings and other actions necessary or

                  SECTION 5. FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  (a) GENERALLY. Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at
its own expense, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver all further
instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be necessary or
desirable, or that Secured Party may reasonably request, in order to perfect and
protect any security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to
enable Secured Party to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies



                                       9
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION

hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Grantor will: (i) at the request of Secured Party, mark
conspicuously each item of chattel paper included in the Accounts, each Related
Contract and, at the request of Secured Party, each of its records pertaining to
the Collateral, with a legend, in form and substance satisfactory to Secured
Party, indicating that such Collateral is subject to the security interest
granted hereby, (ii) at the request of Secured Party, deliver and pledge to
Secured Party hereunder all promissory notes and other instruments (including

assignment, all in form and substance satisfactory to Secured Party, (iii) (A)
file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, (B)
execute and deliver, and cause to be executed and delivered, agreements
establishing that Secured Party has control of specified items of Collateral and

and preserve the security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby,
(iv) furnish to Secured Party from time to time statements and schedules further
identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection
with the Collateral as Secured Party may reasonably request, all in reasonable
detail, (v) at the request of Secured Party, promptly after the acquisition by
such Grantor of any item of Equipment that is covered by a certificate of title
under a statute of any jurisdiction under the law of which indication of a
security interest on such certificate is required as a condition of perfection
thereof, execute and file with the registrar of motor vehicles or other
appropriate authority in such jurisdiction an application or other document
requesting the notation or other indication of the security interest created
hereunder on such certificate of title, (vi) within 30 days after the end of
each calendar quarter, deliver to Secured Party copies of all such applications
or other documents filed during such calendar quarter and copies of all such
certificates of title issued during such calendar quarter indicating the
security interest created hereunder in the items of Equipment covered thereby,
(vii) to the extent permitted under or required under the Credit Agreement,
permit any authorized representatives designated by any Lender to visit and
inspect the Collateral, upon reasonable notice and, except during the
continuance of an Event of Default, no more than once per year, (viii) to the
extent permitted under or required under the Credit Agreement, at Secured
Party's request, appear in and defend any action or proceeding that may affect
such Grantor's title to or Secured Party's security interest in all or any part
of the Collateral, and (ix) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary consents of third parties to the assignment and perfection of a
security interest to Secured Party with respect to any Collateral. Each Grantor
hereby authorizes Secured Party to file one or more financing or continuation
statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the
Collateral. Each Grantor agrees that a carbon, photographic or other
reproduction of this Agreement or of a financing statement shall be sufficient
as a financing statement and may be filed as a financing statement in any and
all jurisdictions.

                  (b) SECURITIES COLLATERAL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing Section 5(a), each Grantor agrees that it will, upon obtaining any
additional shares of stock or other securities, in the case of certificated
securities, required to be pledged hereunder, promptly (and in any event within
five Business Days) deliver to Secured Party a Pledge Supplement, duly executed
by such Grantor, in substantially the form of Exhibit IV (a "PLEDGE
SUPPLEMENT"), in respect of the additional Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt or, in
the case of certificated securities, to be pledged pursuant to this Agreement.
Upon each delivery of a Pledge Supplement to Secured Party, the representations
and warranties contained in clauses (i)-(iv) of Section 4(f)



                                       10
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION
<PAGE>

hereof shall be deemed to have been made by such Grantor as to the Securities
Collateral described in such Pledge Supplement as of the date thereof. Each
Grantor hereby authorizes Secured Party to attach each Pledge Supplement to this
Agreement and agrees that all Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt of such Grantor
listed on any Pledge Supplement shall for all purposes hereunder be considered
Collateral of such Grantor; provided, the failure of any Grantor to execute a
Pledge Supplement with respect to any additional Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt
pledged pursuant to this Agreement shall not impair the security interest of
Secured Party therein or otherwise adversely affect the rights and remedies of
Secured Party hereunder with respect thereto.

                  (c) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing Section 5(a), if any Grantor shall hereafter obtain
rights to any new Intellectual Property Collateral material to the operations or
business of such Grantor or become entitled to the benefit of (i) any patent
application or patent or any reissue, division, continuation, renewal, extension
or continuation-in-part of any Patent or any improvement of any Patent, in each
case, material to the operations or business of such Grantor or (ii) any
Copyright Registration, application for Copyright Registration or renewals or
extension of any Copyright, in each case, material to the operations or business
of such Grantor, then in any such case, the provisions of this Agreement shall
automatically apply thereto. Each Grantor shall promptly notify Secured Party in
writing of any of the foregoing rights acquired by such Grantor after the date
hereof and of (i) any Trademark Registrations issued or application for a
Trademark Registration or application for a Patent made, and (ii) any Copyright
Registrations issued or applications for Copyright Registration made, in any
such case, after the date hereof. Promptly after the filing of an application
for any (1) Trademark Registration; (2) Patent; and (3) Copyright Registration,
in each case, material to the operations or business of such Grantor, each
Grantor shall execute and deliver to Secured Party and record in all places
where a Grant is recorded an IP Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit
V (an "IP SUPPLEMENT"), pursuant to which such Grantor shall grant to Secured
Party a security interest to the extent of its interest in such Intellectual
Property Collateral; provided, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Grantor,
after due inquiry, granting such interest would result in the grant of a
Trademark Registration or Copyright Registration in the name of Secured Party,
such Grantor shall give written notice to Secured Party as soon as reasonably
practicable and the filing shall instead be undertaken as soon as practicable
but in no case later than immediately following the grant of the applicable
Trademark Registration or Copyright Registration, as the case may be. Upon
delivery to Secured Party of an IP Supplement, Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii), and
1(f)(iii) hereto and Schedule A to each Grant, as applicable, shall be deemed
modified to include reference to any right, title or interest in any existing
Intellectual Property Collateral or any Intellectual Property Collateral
included on Schedule A to such IP Supplement. Each Grantor hereby authorizes
Secured Party to modify this Agreement without the signature or consent of any
Grantor by attaching Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii), and 1(f)(iii), as applicable,
that have been modified to include such Intellectual Property Collateral or to
delete any reference to any right, title or interest in any Intellectual
Property Collateral in which any Grantor no longer has or claims any right,
title or interest; provided, the failure of any Grantor to execute an IP
Supplement with respect to any additional Intellectual Property Collateral
pledged pursuant to this Agreement shall not impair the security interest of
Secured Party therein or otherwise adversely affect the rights and remedies of
Secured Party hereunder with respect thereto.

                  SECTION 6. CERTAIN COVENANTS OF GRANTORS.

                  Each Grantor shall:

                  (a) not use or permit any Collateral to be used unlawfully or
in violation of any provision of this Agreement or any applicable statute,
regulation or ordinance or any policy of insurance covering the Collateral;

                  (b) notify Secured Party of any change in such Grantor's name,
identity, jurisdiction of incorporation or formation or corporate structure
within 15 days of such change;

                  (c) if Secured Party gives value to enable such Grantor to
acquire rights in or the use of any Collateral, use such value for such
purposes; and

                  (d) except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement, pay
all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon it or any of
its properties or assets or in respect of any of its income, businesses or
franchises before any penalty accrues thereon, and all claims (including claims
for labor, services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become due and
payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of its properties or
assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine shall be incurred with
respect thereto; provided that no such tax, assessment, charge or claim need be
paid if it is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, so long
as (i) such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required
in conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor and (ii) in the case of a
charge or claim which has or may become a Lien against any of the Collateral,
such proceedings conclusively operate to stay the sale of any portion of the
Collateral to satisfy such charge or claim.

                  SECTION 7. SPECIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO EQUIPMENT AND
INVENTORY.

                  Each Grantor shall:

                  (a) keep the Equipment and Inventory owned by such Grantor
(except to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement for Equipment and
Inventory used or leased in the ordinary course of business) in jurisdictions
where all action that may be necessary or desirable, or that Secured Party may
request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest granted or
purported to be granted hereby, or to enable Secured Party to exercise and
enforce its rights and remedies hereunder, with respect to such Equipment and
Inventory shall have been taken, except in a case where removal of such
Equipment and Inventory from such jurisdictions, either individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;

                  (b) cause the Equipment valued in excess of $1,000,000 owned
by such Grantor to be maintained and preserved in good condition, repair and
working order as when new, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in accordance
with such Grantor's past practices, and shall forthwith make or cause to be made
all repairs, replacements and other improvements in connection therewith that
are necessary or desirable to such end. Each Grantor shall promptly furnish to
Secured Party a statement respecting any material loss or damage to any of the
Equipment owned by such Grantor;

                  (c) keep, in accordance with past practice, correct and
accurate records of Inventory owned by such Grantor, itemizing and describing
the kind, type and quantity of such Inventory, such Grantor's cost therefor and
(where applicable) the current list prices for such Inventory;

such Grantor's agents or processors, if the aggregate book value of all such
Inventory exceeds $2,500,000, and in any event upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, instruct such agent or processor to hold all such Inventory for the
account of Secured Party and subject to the instructions of Secured Party;

                  (e) promptly upon the issuance and delivery to such Grantor of
any Negotiable Document of Title, deliver such Negotiable Document of Title to
Secured Party; and

                  (f) each Grantor shall, at its own expense, maintain insurance
with respect to the Equipment and Inventory in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 8. SPECIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS AND
RELATED CONTRACTS.

                  (a) Each Grantor will hold and preserve its records concerning
the Accounts and Related Contracts and all originals of all chattel paper that
evidence Accounts and will permit representatives of Secured Party to inspect
such records and chattel paper as provided in the Credit Agreement. Promptly
upon the request of Secured Party, each Grantor shall deliver to Secured Party
complete and correct copies of each Related Contract.

                  (b) Each Grantor shall, for not less than three (3) years from
the date on which each Account of such Grantor arose, maintain (i) complete
records of such Account, including records of all payments received, credits

                  (c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (c), each
Grantor shall continue to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to
become due to such Grantor under the Accounts and Related Contracts. In
connection with such collections, each Grantor may take (and, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default at Secured Party's
direction, shall take) such action as such Grantor or Secured Party may deem
necessary or advisable to enforce collection of amounts due or to become due
under the Accounts; provided, however, that Secured Party shall have the right
at any time, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default and upon written notice to such Grantor of its intention to do so, to
notify the account debtors or obligors under any Accounts of the assignment of
such Accounts to Secured Party and to direct such account debtors or obligors to
make payment of all amounts due or to become due to such Grantor thereunder
directly to Secured Party, to notify each Person maintaining a lockbox or
similar arrangement to which account debtors or obligors under any Accounts have
been directed to make payment to remit all amounts representing collections on
checks and other payment items from time to time sent to or deposited in such
lockbox or other arrangement directly to Secured Party and, upon such
notification and at the expense of Grantors, to enforce collection of any such
Accounts and to adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in
the same manner and to the same extent as such



                                       13

Grantor might have done. After receipt by such Grantor of the notice from

amounts and proceeds (including checks and other instruments) received by such
Grantor in respect of the Accounts and the Related Contracts shall be received
in trust for the benefit of Secured Party hereunder, shall be segregated from

Secured Party in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement)
to be held as cash Collateral and applied as provided by Section 17, and (ii)
such Grantor shall not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any
Account, or release wholly or partly any account debtor or obligor thereof, or

         of the Related Contracts to be performed or observed by it, maintain
         the Related Contracts in full force and effect, enforce the Related
         Contracts in accordance with their terms, and take all such action to
         such end as may be from time to time requested by Secured Party; and

                  (ii) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and the
         reasonable request of Secured Party, furnish to Secured Party, promptly
         upon receipt thereof, copies of all notices, requests and other
         documents received by such Grantor under or pursuant to the Related
         Contracts, and from time to time (A) furnish to Secured Party such
         information and reports regarding the Related Contracts as Secured
         Party may reasonably request and (B) upon request of Secured Party make
         to the parties to such Related Contracts such demands and requests for
         information and reports or for action as such Grantor is entitled to
         make under the Related Contracts.

                  (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, no Grantor shall:

                  (i) cancel or terminate any of the material Related Contracts
         or consent to or accept any cancellation or termination thereof;

                  (ii) amend or otherwise modify the material Related Contracts
         or give any consent, waiver or approval thereunder;

                  (iii) waive any default under or breach of the material
         Related Contracts;

                  (iv) consent to or permit or accept any prepayment of amounts

         Contracts that could reasonably be expected to materially impair the
         value of the interest or rights of such Grantor thereunder or that
         could reasonably be expected to materially impair the interest or
         rights of Secured Party.

instruments representing or evidencing the Securities Collateral shall be
delivered to and held by or on behalf of Secured Party pursuant hereto and shall
be in suitable form for transfer by delivery or, as applicable, shall be
accompanied by such Grantor's endorsement, where necessary, or duly executed
instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance

any time to exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing
Securities Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger
denominations.

                  (b) COVENANTS. Each Grantor shall (i) not, except as expressly
permitted by the Credit Agreement, permit any issuer of Pledged Shares to merge
or consolidate unless all the outstanding Capital Stock of the surviving or
resulting Person is, upon such merger or consolidation, pledged hereunder and no
cash, securities or other property is distributed in respect of the outstanding
shares of any other constituent corporation; provided, if the surviving or
resulting Person upon any such merger or consolidation involving an issuer of
Pledged Shares which is a controlled foreign corporation is a controlled foreign
corporation, then such Grantor shall only be required to pledge outstanding
capital stock of such surviving or resulting Person possessing up to but not
exceeding 65% of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of such issuer
entitled to vote; (ii) cause each issuer of Pledged Shares not to issue any
stock, other equity interests or other securities in addition to or in
substitution for the Pledged Shares issued by such issuer, except to such
Grantor; (iii) pledge hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition (directly or
indirectly) thereof, any and all additional shares of stock, other equity
interests or other securities of each issuer of Pledged Shares; (iv) pledge
hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition (directly or indirectly) thereof,
any and all shares of stock or other equity interests of any Person that, after
the date of this Agreement, becomes, as a result of any occurrence, a direct
Subsidiary of such Grantor; provided, notwithstanding anything contained in this
clause (iv) to the contrary, such Grantor shall only be required to pledge the
outstanding capital stock of a controlled foreign corporation possessing up to
but not exceeding 65% of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of
such controlled foreign corporation entitled to vote; (v) pledge hereunder,
immediately upon their issuance, any and all instruments or other evidences of
additional indebtedness from time to time owed to such Grantor by any obligor on
the Pledged Debt; (vi) pledge hereunder, immediately upon their issuance, any
and all instruments or other evidences of indebtedness from time to time owed to
such Grantor by any Person that after the date of this Agreement becomes, as a
result of any occurrence, a Subsidiary of such Grantor; (vii) promptly deliver
to Secured Party all written notices received by it with respect to the
Securities Collateral; and (viii), at the request of Secured Party upon the

that term is defined in the UCC, by Secured Party of all securities entitlements
and securities accounts of such Grantor.

                  (c) VOTING AND DISTRIBUTIONS. So long as no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, (i) each Grantor shall be entitled to
exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the
Securities Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement; provided, no Grantor shall
exercise or refrain from exercising any such right if Secured Party shall have
notified such

Grantor that, in Secured Party's judgment, such action would have a material
adverse effect on the value of the Securities Collateral or any part thereof;
and provided further, such Grantor shall give Secured Party at least five
Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to

Pledged Shares for or such Grantor's consent to the election of directors or
other members of a governing body of an issuer of Pledged Shares at a regularly
scheduled annual or other meeting of stockholders or holders of equity interests
or with respect to incidental matters at any such meeting, nor (B) such
Grantor's consent to or approval of any action otherwise permitted under this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement shall be deemed inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement within the meaning of this Section,
and no notice of any such voting or consent need be given to Secured Party);
(ii) each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain, and to utilize free
and clear of the Lien of this Agreement, any and all dividends, other

other property or funds of such Grantor and be forthwith delivered to Secured
Party as Securities Collateral in the same form as so received (with all
necessary endorsements); provided that the foregoing shall not apply to (x) any
Restricted Junior Payments permitted under subsection 7.5 of the Credit
Agreement or (y) any intercompany indebtedness permitted under subsection
7.1(iv) of the Credit Agreement; and (iii) Secured Party shall promptly execute

Default, (x) upon written notice from Secured Party to any Grantor, all rights

other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and
to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled to
receive hereunder, (I) each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause
to be executed and delivered) to Secured Party all such proxies, dividend
payment orders and other instruments as Secured Party may from time to time
reasonably request, and (II) without limiting the effect of clause (I) above,
each Grantor hereby grants to Secured Party an irrevocable proxy to vote the
Pledged Shares and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies
to which a holder of the Pledged Shares would be entitled (including giving or
withholding written consents of shareholders or other holders of equity
interests, calling special meetings of shareholders or other holders of equity
interests and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective,
automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer of
any Pledged Shares on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other
Person (including the issuer of the Pledged Shares or any officer or agent
thereof), upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and which proxy shall
terminate upon the cure or waiver of such Event of Default or the payment in
full of the Secured Obligations.

                  SECTION 10. SPECIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY COLLATERAL.

                  (a) Each Grantor shall:

                  (i) diligently keep reasonable records respecting the
         Intellectual Property Collateral and at all times keep at least one
         complete set of its records concerning such Collateral at its chief
         executive office or principal place of business;

                  (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts so as not to permit
         the inclusion in any contract to which it hereafter becomes a party of
         any provision that could or might in any way impair or prevent the
         creation of a security interest in, or the assignment of, such
         Grantor's rights and interests in any property included within the
         definitions of any Intellectual Property Collateral acquired under such
         contracts;

                  (iii) take commercially reasonable steps to protect the
         secrecy of all trade secrets relating to the products and services sold
         or delivered under or in connection with the Intellectual Property
         Collateral, including, without limitation, where appropriate entering
         into confidentiality agreements with employees and labeling and
         restricting access to secret information and documents;

                  (iv) use proper statutory notice in connection with its use of
         any of the Intellectual Property Collateral;

                  (v) use a commercially appropriate standard of quality (which
         may or may not be consistent with such Grantor's past practices) in the
         manufacture, sale and delivery of products and services sold or
         delivered under or in connection with the Trademarks; and



                                       17
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION
<PAGE>

                  (vi) furnish to Secured Party from time to time at Secured
         Party's reasonable request statements and schedules further identifying
         and describing any Intellectual Property Collateral and such other
         reports in connection with such Collateral, all in reasonable detail;
         provided, however, that Secured Party shall not make such request more
         than once per year except during the continuation of an Event of
         Default.

                  (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, each
Grantor shall continue to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to
become due to such Grantor in respect of the Intellectual Property Collateral or
any portion thereof. In connection with such collections, each Grantor may take
(and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default at
Secured Party's reasonable direction, shall take) such action as such Grantor or
Secured Party may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to enforce collection
of such amounts; provided, Secured Party shall have the right at any time, upon
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and upon
written notice to such Grantor of its intention to do so, to notify the obligors
with respect to any such amounts of the existence of the security interest
created hereby and to direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts
directly to Secured Party, and, upon such notification and at the expense of
such Grantor, to enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust, settle or
compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same
extent as such Grantor might have done. After receipt by any Grantor of the
notice from Secured Party referred to in the proviso to the preceding sentence
and during the continuation of any Event of Default, (i) all amounts and
proceeds (including checks and other instruments) received by each Grantor in
respect of amounts due to such Grantor in respect of the Intellectual Property
Collateral or any portion thereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of
Secured Party hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor
and shall be forthwith paid over or delivered to Secured Party in the same form
as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral
and applied as provided by Section 17, and (ii) such Grantor shall not adjust,
settle or compromise the amount or payment of any such amount or release wholly
or partly any obligor with respect thereto or allow any credit or discount
thereon.

                  (c) Each Grantor shall have the duty diligently to prosecute,
file and/or make, unless and until such Grantor, in its commercially reasonable
judgment, decides otherwise, (i) any application relating to any of the
Intellectual Property Collateral owned, held or used by such Grantor and
identified on Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii) or 1(f)(iii), as applicable, that is
pending as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) any Copyright Registration on any
existing or future unregistered but copyrightable works (except for works of
nominal commercial value or with respect to which such Grantor has determined in
the exercise of its commercially reasonable judgment that it shall not seek
registration), (iii) application on any future patentable but unpatented
innovation or invention comprising Intellectual Property Collateral, and (iv)
any Trademark opposition and cancellation proceedings, renew Trademark
Registrations and Copyright Registrations and do any and all acts which are
necessary or desirable to preserve and maintain all rights in all Intellectual
Property Collateral. Any expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be
borne solely by Grantors. Subject to the foregoing, each Grantor shall give
Secured Party prior written notice of any abandonment of any Intellectual
Property Collateral or any pending patent application or any Patent, in each
case, material to its operations or business.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Except as provided herein, each Grantor shall have the
right to commence and prosecute in its own name, as real party in interest, for
its own benefit and at its own expense, such suits, proceedings or other actions
for infringement, unfair competition, dilution, misappropriation or other
damage, or reexamination or reissue proceedings as are necessary to protect the
Intellectual Property Collateral. Secured Party shall provide, at such Grantor's
expense, all reasonable and necessary cooperation in connection with any such
suit, proceeding or action including, without limitation, joining as a necessary
party. Each Grantor shall promptly, following its becoming aware thereof, notify
Secured Party of the institution of, or of any adverse determination in, any
proceeding (whether in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United
States Copyright Office or any federal, state, local or foreign court) or
regarding such Grantor's ownership, right to use, or interest in any
Intellectual Property Collateral material to its operations or business. Each
Grantor shall provide to Secured Party any information with respect thereto
requested by Secured Party.

                  (e) In addition to, and not by way of limitation of, the
granting of a security interest in the Collateral pursuant hereto, each Grantor,
effective upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to Secured Party the nonexclusive
right and license to use all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents or
technical processes (including, without limitation, the Intellectual Property
Collateral) owned or used by such Grantor that relate to the Collateral and any
other collateral granted by such Grantor as security for the Secured
Obligations, together with any goodwill associated therewith, all to the extent
necessary to enable Secured Party to realize on the Collateral in accordance
with this Agreement and to enable any transferee or assignee of the Collateral
to enjoy the benefits of the Collateral. This right shall inure to the benefit
of all successors, assigns and transferees of Secured Party and its successors,
assigns and transferees, whether by voluntary conveyance, operation of law,
assignment, transfer, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise.
Such right and license shall be granted free of charge, without requirement that
any monetary payment whatsoever be made to such Grantor. In addition, each
Grantor hereby grants to Secured Party and its employees, representatives and
agents the right to visit such Grantor's and any of its Affiliate's or
subcontractor's plants, facilities and other places of business that are
utilized in connection with the manufacture, production, inspection, storage or
sale of products and services sold or delivered under any of the Intellectual
Property Collateral (or which were so utilized during the prior six month
period), and to inspect the quality control and all other records relating
thereto upon reasonable advance written notice to such Grantor and at reasonable
dates and times and as often as may be reasonably requested. If and to the
extent that any Grantor is permitted to license the Intellectual Property
Collateral, Secured Party shall promptly enter into a non-disturbance agreement
or other similar arrangement, at such Grantor's request and expense, with such
Grantor and any licensee of any Intellectual Property Collateral permitted
hereunder in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Secured Party
pursuant to which (i) Secured Party shall agree not to disturb or interfere with
such licensee's rights under its license agreement with such Grantor so long as
such licensee is not in default thereunder, and (ii) such licensee shall
acknowledge and agree that the Intellectual Property Collateral licensed to it
is subject to the security interest created in favor of Secured Party and the
other terms of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 11. COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

                  Secured Party is hereby authorized to establish and maintain
at its office at Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, NY, 10010, or at any other
location determined by Administrative Agent as a blocked deposit account in the
name of Borrower over which Secured Party has control in accordance with Section
9-104 of the UCC, a restricted deposit account designated as "Brand Services,
Inc. Collateral Account". All amounts at any time held in the Collateral Account
shall be beneficially owned by Grantors but shall be held in the name of Secured
Party hereunder, for the benefit of Lenders, as collateral security for the
Secured Obligations upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Grantors
shall have no right to withdraw, transfer or, except as expressly set forth
herein, otherwise receive any funds deposited into the Collateral Account.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Collateral
Account shall be subject to such applicable laws, and such applicable
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and of any
other appropriate banking or Government Authority, as may now or hereafter be in
effect. All deposits of funds in the Collateral Account shall be made by wire
transfer (or, if applicable, by intra-bank transfer from another account of a
Grantor) of immediately available funds, in each case addressed in accordance
with instructions of Secured Party. Each Grantor shall, promptly after
initiating a transfer of funds to the Collateral Account, give notice to Secured
Party by telefacsimile of the date, amount and method of delivery of such
deposit. Cash held by Secured Party in the Collateral Account shall not be
invested by Secured Party but instead shall be maintained as a cash deposit in
the Collateral Account pending application thereof as elsewhere provided in this
Agreement. To the extent permitted under Regulation Q of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, any cash held in the Collateral Account shall
bear interest at the standard rate paid by Secured Party to its customers for
deposits of like amounts and terms. Subject to Secured Party's rights hereunder,
any interest earned on deposits of cash in the Collateral Account shall be
deposited directly in, and held in the Collateral Account.

                  SECTION 12. SECURED PARTY APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.

                  Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints Secured Party as such
Grantor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such
Grantor and in the name of such Grantor, Secured Party or otherwise, from time
to time in Secured Party's discretion to take any action and to execute any
instrument that Secured Party may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the
purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation:

                  (a) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to obtain and adjust insurance required to be maintained by such
Grantor or paid to Secured Party pursuant to Section 7;

                  (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and
give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in
respect of any of the Collateral;

                  (c) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to receive, endorse and collect any drafts or other instruments,
documents and chattel paper in connection with clauses (a) and (b) above;



                                       20
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION
<PAGE>

                  (d) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings
that Secured Party may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of
the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of Secured Party with respect
to any of the Collateral;

                  (e) to pay or discharge taxes or Liens (other than Liens
permitted under this Agreement or the Credit Agreement) levied or placed upon or
threatened against the Collateral, the legality or validity thereof and the
amounts necessary to discharge the same to be determined by Secured Party in its
sole discretion, any such payments made by Secured Party to become obligations
of such Grantor to Secured Party, due and payable immediately without demand;

                  (f) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to sign and endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of
lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments,
verifications and notices in connection with Accounts and other documents
relating to the Collateral; and

                  (g) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, generally to sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect
to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as
though Secured Party were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to
do, at Secured Party's option and Grantors' expense, at any time or from time to
time, all acts and things that Secured Party deems necessary to protect,
preserve or realize upon the Collateral and Secured Party's security interest
therein in order to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and
effectively as such Grantor might do.

                  SECTION 13. SECURED PARTY MAY PERFORM.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, if any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, Secured
Party may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the
expenses of Secured Party incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by
Grantors under Section 18(b).

                  SECTION 14. STANDARD OF CARE.

                  The powers conferred on Secured Party hereunder are solely to
protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to
exercise any such powers. Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys
actually received by it hereunder, Secured Party shall have no duty as to any
Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against
prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. Secured Party
shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which Secured Party accords its own
property.

                  SECTION 15. REMEDIES.

                  (a) Generally. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under
the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and



                                       21
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION
<PAGE>

also may, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law (i) require
each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and
upon request of Secured Party forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral
as directed by Secured Party and make it available to Secured Party at a place
to be designated by Secured Party that is reasonably convenient to both parties,
(ii) enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession
thereof with or without judicial process, (iii) prior to the disposition of the
Collateral, store, process, repair or recondition the Collateral or otherwise
prepare the Collateral for disposition in any manner to the extent Secured Party
deems appropriate, (iv) take possession of any Grantor's premises or place
custodians in exclusive control thereof, remain on such premises and use the
same and any of such Grantor's equipment for the purpose of completing any work
in process, taking any actions described in the preceding clause (iii) and
collecting any Secured Obligation, (v) without notice except as specified below,
sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or
private sale, at any of Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on
credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices
and upon such other terms as Secured Party may deem commercially reasonable,
(vi) exercise dominion and control over and refuse to permit further withdrawals
from any Deposit Account maintained with Secured Party or any Lender and provide
instructions directing the disposition of funds in Deposit Accounts not
maintained with Secured Party or any Lender and (vii) provide entitlement orders
with respect to security entitlements and other investment property constituting
a part of the Collateral and, without notice to any Grantor, transfer to or
register in the name of Secured Party or any of its nominees any or all of the
Securities Collateral. Secured Party or any Lender or any Hedge Agreement
Counterparty may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any such
sale and Secured Party, as agent for and representative of Lenders and Hedge
Agreement Counterparties (but not any Lender or Hedge Agreement Counterparty in
its individual capacity unless Requisite Obligees (as defined in Section 20(a))
shall otherwise agree in writing), shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding
and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of
the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Secured
Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral
payable by Secured Party at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall
hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of
any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has
or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now
existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of
sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to such Grantor of the
time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to
be made shall constitute reasonable notification. Secured Party shall not be
obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having
been given. Secured Party may adjourn any public or private sale from time to
time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against Secured Party arising
by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold
at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at
a public sale, even if Secured Party accepts the first offer received and does
not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. If the proceeds of any sale
or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Secured
Obligations, Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency
and the fees of any attorneys employed by Secured Party to collect such
deficiency. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants



                                       22
Security Agreement                                                     EXECUTION
<PAGE>

contained in this Section will cause irreparable injury to Secured Party, that
Secured Party has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a
consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section shall be
specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives
and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance
of such covenants except for a defense that no default has occurred giving rise
to the Secured Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated
maturities.

                  (b) SECURITIES COLLATERAL.

                  (i) Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
         prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state
         securities laws, Secured Party may be compelled, with respect to any
         sale of all or any part of the Securities Collateral conducted without
         prior registration or qualification of such Securities Collateral under
         the Securities Act and/or such state securities laws, to limit
         purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the
         Securities Collateral for their own account, for investment and not
         with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor
         acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms
         less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such
         restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a
         registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding
         such circumstances and the registration rights granted to Secured Party
         by such Grantor pursuant hereto and notwithstanding the provisions of
         Section 9-610(b) of the UCC, which each Grantor hereby waives, each
         Grantor agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been
         made in a commercially reasonable manner and that Secured Party shall
         have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay
         the sale of any Securities Collateral for the period of time necessary
         to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale
         requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable
         state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or should, agree to
         so register it. If Secured Party determines to exercise its right to
         sell any or all of the Securities Collateral, upon written request,
         each Grantor shall and shall cause each issuer of any Pledged Shares to
         be sold hereunder from time to time to furnish to Secured Party all
         such information as Secured Party may request in order to determine the
         number of shares and other instruments included in the Securities
         Collateral which may be sold by Secured Party in exempt transactions
         under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
         Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from
         time to time in effect.

                  (ii) If Secured Party shall determine to exercise its right to
         sell all or any of the Securities Collateral pursuant to this Section,
         each Grantor agrees that, upon request of Secured Party (which request
         may be made by Secured Party in its reasonable discretion), such
         Grantor will, at its own expense (A) execute and deliver, and cause
         each issuer of the Securities Collateral contemplated to be sold and
         the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such
         instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other
         acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of
         Secured Party, advisable to register such Securities Collateral under
         the provisions of the Securities Act and to use best efforts to cause
         the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to
         remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required by law to
         be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to
         the

         related prospectus which, in the reasonable opinion of Secured Party,
         are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of
         the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
         Exchange Commission applicable thereto; (B) use its best efforts to
         qualify the Securities Collateral under all applicable state securities
         or "Blue Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary governmental approvals
         for the sale of the Securities Collateral, as reasonably requested by
         Secured Party; (C) cause each such issuer to make available to its
         security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement which
         will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; (D)
         do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be
         necessary to make such sale of the Securities Collateral or any part
         thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law; and
         (E) bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
         of carrying out its obligations under this Section.

                  (iii) Without limiting the generality of subsections 10.2 and
         10.3 of the Credit Agreement, in the event of any public sale described
         herein, each Grantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Secured
         Party, and each Lender and each Hedge Agreement Counterparty and each
         of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
         against any loss, fee, cost, expense, damage, liability or claim, joint
         or several, to which any such Persons may become subject or for which
         any of them may be liable, under the Securities Act or otherwise,
         insofar as such losses, fees, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities or
         claims (or any litigation commenced or threatened in respect thereof)
         arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
         statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus,
         registration statement, prospectus or other such document published or
         filed in connection with such public sale, or any amendment or
         supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
         alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
         will reimburse Secured Party and such other Persons for any legal or
         other expenses reasonably incurred by Secured Party and such other
         Persons in connection with any litigation, of any nature whatsoever,
         commenced or threatened in respect thereof (including any and all fees,
         costs and expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred by Secured Party and
         such other Persons and counsel for Secured Party and such other Persons
         in investigating, preparing for, defending against or providing
         evidence, producing documents or taking any other action in respect of,
         any such commenced or threatened litigation or any claims asserted).
         This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability which any Grantor
         may otherwise have and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions
         to each Person, if any, that controls Secured Party or such Persons
         within the meaning of the Securities Act.

                  (c) COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and, in accordance with Section 8 of the Credit Agreement,
Borrower is required to pay to Secured Party an amount (the "AGGREGATE AVAILABLE
AMOUNT") equal to the maximum amount that may at any time be drawn under all
Letters of Credit then outstanding under the Credit Agreement, Borrower shall
deliver funds in such an amount for deposit in the Collateral Account. If for
any reason the aggregate amount delivered by Borrower for deposit in the
Collateral Account as aforesaid is less than the Aggregate Available Amount, the
aggregate amount so delivered by Borrower shall be apportioned among all
outstanding Letters of Credit for purposes of this Section in accordance with
the ratio of the maximum amount available for



                                       24

drawing under each such Letter of Credit (as to such Letter of Credit, the
"MAXIMUM AVAILABLE AMOUNT") to the Aggregate Available Amount. Upon any drawing
under any outstanding Letter of Credit in respect of which Borrower has
deposited in the Collateral Account any amounts described above, Secured Party
shall apply such amounts to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of such
drawing. In the event of cancellation or expiration of any Letter of Credit in
respect of which Borrower has deposited in the Collateral Account any amounts
described above, or in the event of any reduction in the Maximum Available
Amount under such Letter of Credit, Secured Party shall apply the amount then on
deposit in the Collateral Account in respect of such Letter of Credit (less, in
the case of such a reduction, the Maximum Available Amount under such Letter of
Credit immediately after such reduction) first, to the payment of any amounts
payable to Secured Party pursuant to Section 17 hereof, second, to the extent of
any excess, to the cash collateralization pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement of any outstanding Letters of Credit in respect of which Borrower has
failed to pay all or a portion of the amounts described above (such cash
collateralization to be apportioned among all such Letters of Credit in the
manner described above), third, to the extent of any further excess, to the
payment of any other outstanding Secured Obligations in such order as Secured
Party shall elect, and fourth, to the extent of any further excess, to the
payment to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive such funds.

                  SECTION 16. ADDITIONAL REMEDIES FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
COLLATERAL.

                  (a) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i)
Secured Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to bring suit, in
the name of any Grantor, Secured Party or otherwise, to enforce any Intellectual
Property Collateral, in which event each Grantor shall, at the request of
Secured Party, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all documents
required by Secured Party in aid of such enforcement and each Grantor shall
promptly, upon demand, reimburse and indemnify Secured Party as provided in
Sections 10.2 and 10.3 of the Credit Agreement and Section 18 hereof, as
applicable, in connection with the exercise of its rights under this Section,
and, to the extent that Secured Party shall elect not to bring suit to enforce
any Intellectual Property Collateral material to its operations or business as
provided in this Section, each Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures,
whether by action, suit, proceeding or otherwise, to prevent the infringement of
any of the Intellectual Property Collateral by others and for that purpose
agrees to use its commercially reasonable judgment in maintaining any action,
suit or proceeding against any Person so infringing reasonably necessary to
prevent such infringement; (ii) upon written demand from Secured Party, each
Grantor shall execute and deliver to Secured Party an assignment or assignments
of the Intellectual Property Collateral and such other documents as are
necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement;
(iii) each Grantor agrees that such an assignment and/or recording shall be
applied to reduce the Secured Obligations outstanding only to the extent that
Secured Party (or any Lender) receives cash proceeds in respect of the sale of,
or other realization upon, the Intellectual Property Collateral; and (iv) within
five Business Days after written notice from Secured Party, each Grantor shall
make available to Secured Party, to the extent within such Grantor's power and
authority, such personnel in such Grantor's employ on the date of such Event of
Default as Secured Party may reasonably designate, by name, title or job
responsibility, to permit such Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to
produce, advertise and sell the products and services sold or delivered by such
Grantor under or in connection with the

available to perform their prior functions on Secured Party's behalf and to be
compensated by Secured Party at such Grantor's expense on a per diem, pro-rata
basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure applicable to each as of
the date of such Event of Default.

                  (b) If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by
reason of cure, waiver, modification, amendment or otherwise, no longer be
continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (iii) an assignment to Secured Party of any rights, title and
interests in and to the Intellectual Property Collateral shall have been
previously made, and (iv) the Secured Obligations shall not have become
immediately due and payable, upon the written request of any Grantor, Secured
Party shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor such assignments as may
be necessary to reassign to such Grantor any such rights, title and interests as
may have been assigned to Secured Party as aforesaid, subject to any disposition
thereof that may have been made by Secured Party; provided, after giving effect
to such reassignment, Secured Party's security interest granted pursuant hereto,
as well as all other rights and remedies of Secured Party granted hereunder,
shall continue to be in full force and effect; and provided further, the rights,
title and interests so reassigned shall be free and clear of all Liens other
than Liens (if any) encumbering such rights, title and interest at the time of
their assignment to Secured Party and Permitted Encumbrances.

                  SECTION 17. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

                  Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all
proceeds received by Secured Party in respect of any sale of, collection from,
or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied as
provided in the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 18. INDEMNITY AND EXPENSES.

                  (a) Grantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify Secured
Party, each Lender and each Hedge Agreement Counterparty from and against any
and all claims, losses and liabilities in any way relating to, growing out of or
resulting from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including without limitation enforcement of this Agreement), except to the
extent such claims, losses or liabilities result from Secured Party's or such
Lender's or such Hedge Agreement Counterparty's gross negligence or willful
misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (b) Grantors jointly and severally agree to pay to Secured
Party upon demand the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, that
Secured Party may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the
exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Secured Party hereunder, or (iv)
the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

                  (c) The obligations of Grantors in this Section 18 shall (i)
survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of Grantors' other

to the provisions of Section 1(b) thereof.

                  SECTION 19. CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF LOANS;
TERMINATION AND RELEASE.

                  (a) This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest
in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the
payment in full of the Secured Obligations, the cancellation or termination of
the Commitments and the cancellation or expiration of all outstanding Letters of
Credit, (ii) be binding upon Grantors and their respective successors and
assigns, and (iii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of Secured Party
hereunder, to the benefit of Secured Party and its successors, transferees and
assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), (A) but
subject to the provisions of subsection 10.1 of the Credit Agreement, any Lender
may assign or otherwise transfer any Loans held by it to any other Person, and
such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect
thereof granted to Lenders herein or otherwise and (B) any Hedge Agreement
Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer any Lender Hedge Agreement to
which it is a party to any other Person in accordance with the terms of such
Lender Hedge Agreement, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with
all the benefits in respect thereof granted to Hedge Agreement Counterparties
herein or otherwise.

                  (b) Upon the payment in full of all Secured Obligations, the
cancellation or termination of the Commitments and the cancellation or
expiration of all outstanding Letters of Credit, the security interest granted
hereby shall automatically terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall
revert to the applicable Grantors. Upon any such termination Secured Party will,
at Grantors' expense, execute and deliver to Grantors such documents as Grantors
shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. In addition, upon the
proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral by a Grantor in accordance
with the Credit Agreement for which such Grantor desires to obtain a security
interest release from Secured Party, a security interest release may be obtained
pursuant to the provisions of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 20. SECURED PARTY AS AGENT.

                  (a) Secured Party has been appointed to act as Secured Party
hereunder by Lenders and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, Hedge
Agreement Counterparties. Secured Party shall be obligated, and shall have the
right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action (including
without limitation the release or substitution of Collateral), solely in
accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement; provided that Secured
Party shall exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies provided for in
Section 15 in accordance with the instructions of (i) Requisite Lenders or (ii)
after payment in full of all Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, the cancellation or expiration of all Letters of Credit
and the termination of the Commitments, (A) the holders of a majority of the
aggregate notional amount under all Lender Hedge Agreements (including Lender
Hedge Agreements that have been terminated) or (B) if all Lender Hedge
Agreements have been terminated in accordance with their terms, the aggregate
amount then due and payable (exclusive of expenses and similar payments but
including any early termination payments then due) under such Lender

Hedge Agreements (Requisite Lenders or, if applicable, such holders being
referred to herein as "REQUISITE OBLIGEES"). In furtherance of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 20(a), each Hedge Agreement Counterparty, by its
acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right
individually to realize upon any of the Collateral hereunder, it being
understood and agreed by such Hedge Agreement Counterparty that all rights and
remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by Secured Party for the benefit of
Lenders and Hedge Agreement Counterparties in accordance with the terms of this
Section 20(a).

                  (b) Secured Party shall at all times be the same Person that
is Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement. Written notice of
resignation by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5 of the Credit
Agreement shall also constitute notice of resignation as Secured Party under
this Agreement; and appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection 9.5 of the Credit Agreement shall also constitute appointment of a
successor Secured Party under this Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent under subsection 9.5 of the Credit Agreement
by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Secured Party under this Agreement, and the retiring
Secured Party under this Agreement shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor
Secured Party all sums, securities and other items of Collateral held hereunder,
together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in
connection with the performance of the duties of the successor Secured Party
under this Agreement, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Secured
Party such amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as
may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the assignment to such
successor Secured Party of the security interests created hereunder, whereupon
such retiring Secured Party shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Secured Party, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this
Agreement while it was Secured Party hereunder.

                  (c) Secured Party shall not be deemed to have any duty
whatsoever with respect to any Hedge Agreement Counterparty until it shall have
received written notice in form and substance satisfactory to Secured Party from
a Grantor or the Hedge Agreement Counterparty as to the existence and terms of
the applicable Lender Hedge Agreement.

                  SECTION 21. ADDITIONAL GRANTORS.

                  The initial Subsidiary Grantors hereunder shall be such of the
Material Subsidiaries of Borrower as are signatories hereto on the date hereof.
From time to time subsequent to the date hereof, additional Subsidiaries of
Borrower may become parties hereto as additional Grantors (each an "ADDITIONAL
GRANTOR"), by executing a Counterpart substantially in the form of Exhibit VI
annexed hereto. Upon delivery of any such Counterpart to Secured Party, notice
of which is hereby waived by Grantors, each such Additional Grantor shall be a
Grantor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Additional Grantor were
an original signatory hereto. Each Grantor expressly agrees that its obligations
arising hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release
of any other Grantor hereunder, nor by any election of Administrative Agent not
to cause any Subsidiary of Borrower to become an Additional Grantor hereunder.
This Agreement shall be fully effective as to any Grantor that is or becomes a
party



                                       28

ceases to be a Grantor hereunder.

                  SECTION 22. AMENDMENTS; ETC.

                  No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by Secured Party and, in the case of any such amendment or
modification, by Grantors; provided this Agreement may be modified by the
execution of a Counterpart by an Additional Grantor in accordance with Section
21 and Grantors hereby waive any requirement of notice of or consent to any such
amendment. Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.

                  SECTION 23. NOTICES.

                  Any notice or other communication herein required or permitted
to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served or sent by
telefacsimile in complete and legible form or United States mail or courier
service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or by
courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile, or three Business Days after
depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly
addressed. For the purposes hereof, the address of each party hereto shall be as
provided in subsection 10.8 of the Credit Agreement or as set forth under such
party's name on the signature pages hereof or such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice delivered to the other parties
hereto.

                  SECTION 24. FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES
CUMULATIVE.

                  No failure or delay on the part of Secured Party in the
exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall impair such power,
right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence
therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or
privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

                  SECTION 25. SEVERABILITY.

                  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of
such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

                  SECTION 26. HEADINGS.

                  Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this

ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW

OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, MAY BE

GRANTOR, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (I)
ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF
SUCH COURTS; (II) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (III) AGREES THAT

                  SECTION 29. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                  GRANTORS AND SECURED PARTY HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR

ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. The scope of this waiver is
intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any
court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including
without limitation contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all
other common law and statutory claims. Each Grantor and Secured Party
acknowledge that this waiver is a material inducement for Grantors and Secured
Party to enter into a business relationship, that Grantors and Secured Party
have already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement and that each
will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each
Grantor and Secured Party further warrant and represent that each has reviewed
this waiver with its legal counsel, and that each knowingly and voluntarily
waives its jury trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS
WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN
WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS
SECTION 29 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL
APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO
THIS AGREEMENT. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a
written consent to a trial by the court.

                  SECTION 30. COUNTERPARTS.

                  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and
by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may
be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single
counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same
document.

                  SECTION 31. ASSESSMENT OF BORROWER.

                  Lenders, Hedge Agreement Counterparties and Secured Party
shall have no obligation to disclose or discuss with any Grantor their
assessment, or such Grantor's assessment, of the financial condition of
Borrower. Each Grantor has adequate means to obtain information from Borrower on
a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of Borrower and its
ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and Lender Hedge

         guaranty, payable by reason of loss or damage to or otherwise with
         respect to any of the foregoing Trademark Collateral. For purposes of
         this Grant of Trademark Security Interest, the term "PROCEEDS" (a)
         whatever is acquired upon the sale, lease, license, exchange, or other

         of the value of the Trademark Collateral, insurance payable by reason
         of the loss or nonconformity of, defects or infringement of rights in,
