<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Change of Control Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into on December&nbsp;11, 2002 by and between Pete McCormick, an individual (the "Officer"), and

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the
threat or the occurrence of a Change of Control can result in significant distractions of its key management personnel because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board has determined that it is essential and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to retain the services of the Officer in the event of a threat or
occurrence of a Change of Control and to ensure the Officer's continued dedication and efforts in such event without undue concern for personal financial and employment security; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to induce the Officer to remain in the employ of the Company, particularly in the event of a threat or the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company desires to
enter into this Agreement with the Officer to provide the Officer with certain benefits in the event his or her employment is terminated as a result of, or in connection with, a Change of Control. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,

this Section&nbsp;5, "Value" shall mean value as determined by the Arbitrators applying the valuation procedures and methodologies established pursuant to Code Section&nbsp;280G, including any
non-binding interpretive guidance as the Arbitrators determine appropriate. The determinations of the Arbitrators shall be final and binding on both the Company and Executive, and their
successors, assignees, heirs and beneficiaries, for purposes of determining the amount payable under Section&nbsp;2. All fees and expenses of the Arbitrators (including attorneys' and accountants'
fees) shall be borne by the Company. The arbitrators will be compensated, to the extent they are not then members of the Board's Compensation Committee, at the rates at which they would have been

arising under theories of liability or damages based upon contract, tort or statute, will be determined exclusively by arbitration before a single arbitrator in accordance with the employment
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association, except as modified by this Agreement. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding on both parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction. In recognition of the fact that resolution of any disputes or claims in the courts is rarely timely or cost effective for either party, the Company and the Executive enter
this mutual agreement to arbitrate in order to gain the benefits of a speedy, impartial and cost-effective dispute resolution procedure. The parties further intend that the arbitration
hereunder be conducted in as confidential a manner as is practicable under the circumstances, and intend for the award to be confidential unless that confidentiality would frustrate the purpose of the
arbitration or render the remedy awarded ineffective. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
arbitration will be held in Los Angeles, California. The arbitrator must be an attorney with substantial experience in employment matters, selected by the parties
alternately striking names from a list of five such persons provided by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) office located nearest to the place of employment, following a request by the party
seeking arbitration for a list of five such attorneys with substantial professional experience in employment matters. If either party fails to strike names from the list, the arbitrator will be
selected from the list by the other party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
party will have the right to take the deposition of one individual and any expert witness designated by the other party. Each party will also have the right to
propound requests for production of documents to any party and the right to subpoena documents and witnesses for the arbitration. Additional discovery may be made only where the arbitrator selected so
orders upon a showing of substantial need. The arbitrator will have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or a motion for summary judgment by any party and will apply the standards
governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company and the Executive agree that they will attempt, and they intend that they and the arbitrator should use their best efforts in that attempt, to conclude the
arbitration proceeding and have a final decision from the arbitrator within 120&nbsp;days from the date of selection of the arbitrator; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the arbitrator will be entitled to extend such 120-day period for one additional 120-day period. The arbitrator will deliver a written
award with respect to the dispute to each of the parties, who must promptly act in accordance therewith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company will pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in seeking to obtain or enforce any rights or benefits provided by this
Agreement, </FONT></P>
