<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(b) Cause. Subject to the
notice provisions set forth below, the Company may terminate the Employee&#146;s

the willful failure by the Employee to substantially perform his duties with
the Company (other than any such failure resulting from his incapacity due to
physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance
is delivered to him by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the
manner in which the Board believes that he has not substantially performed his
duties; (2) the Employee&#146;s willful misconduct that is demonstrably and
materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; or (3) the
Employee&#146;s commission of such acts of dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or
other acts of moral turpitude as would prevent the effective performance of his
duties. For purposes of this subsection (b), no act, or failure to act, on the
Employee&#146;s part shall be deemed &#147;willful&#148; unless done, or omitted to be done,
by him not in good faith and without the reasonable belief that his action or
omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Employee shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause
unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution
duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the non-employee members
of the Board at a meeting of such members (after reasonable notice to him and
an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before such
members of the Board), finding that he has engaged in the conduct set forth
above in this subsection (b) and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.</font></p>

receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute
exists concerning a termination by the Employee for Good Reason (as defined in

Date of Termination shall be the earlier of the expiration date of the
Agreement, or the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by
mutual written agreement of the parties or by a final judgment, order or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect
to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been

by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party
giving such notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable
diligence.</font></p>

salary) and continue the Employee as a participant in all compensation, benefit
and insurance plans in which the Employee was participating when the notice
