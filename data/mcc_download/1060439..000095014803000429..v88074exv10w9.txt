              SECOND ADDENDUM TO OVERTURE SEARCH SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Second Addendum (the "Second Addendum") is effective as of January 13, 2003
(the "Second Addendum Effective Date") and entered into by and between Overture
Services, Inc. ("Overture"), a Delaware corporation with offices at 74 Pasadena

2002 and entered into by and between Overture and Yahoo, as amended by the First

(collectively referred to as the "Agreement").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Agreement provides for, among other things, the delivery
by Overture and the display by Yahoo of sponsored search results in response to
search queries conducted through Yahoo's principal, U.S. targeted directory to
the World Wide Web.

         WHEREAS, the parties agree to delete and modify certain exhibits, as
further described herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and conditions
contained herein, and for good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as
follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

1.       Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the
         Agreement.

2.       The parties acknowledge and agree that Schedule 8.4 as filed with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission is hereby deleted in its entirety.

3.       Exhibit F is deleted and replaced with the attached Amended Exhibit F,
         and all references in the Agreement to Exhibit F shall be to the
         Amended Exhibit F.

4.       Incorporation of Certain Provisions of the Agreement by Reference. Each
         party's performance hereunder will be subject to the provisions of
         Sections 12-14 and 16 of the Agreement, and those provisions are
         incorporated herein by reference. For clarity, one party's liability to
         the other party under this Second Addendum will be subject to the same
         liability caps set forth in Section 14 of the Agreement (i.e., this
         Second Addendum does not give rise to separate and distinct liability
