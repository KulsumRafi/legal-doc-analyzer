<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant may pay for Stock that is acquired pursuant to the exercise of all or any portion of an Option by (a)&nbsp;making a cash payment to his or her
employer that shall be at least 1% but may not exceed 10% of his or her Eligible Compensation (a "Cash Payment") and/or (b)&nbsp;directing his or her employer to withhold a fixed dollar amount or
percentage of his or her Eligible Compensation that shall be at least 1% but shall not exceed 10% of his or her Eligible Compensation for any Plan Year (a "Payroll Deduction"); provided, however, that
if a Participant elects to make a combination of Cash Payments and Payroll Deductions, such Participant's aggregated contributions may not exceed 10% of his or her Eligible Compensation; and provided
further that the Board or the Committee may specify different percentage limitations for a future Offering or Plan Year. Except as set forth in this Section&nbsp;9, the amount of compensation to be
withheld from a Participant's Eligible Compensation during each pay period shall be determined by the Participant's Subscription. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.2 Method of Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A
Participant may make Cash Payments to the Participant's employer in such manner as is provided by the Committee. Any Cash Payment elected to be made by a Participant
shall be made by a deadline specified by the Committee that shall not be later than the close of the Plan Year. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll
Deductions shall commence on the first payday following an Offering Date and shall continue through the last payday of the Offering unless sooner altered or
terminated as provided in the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.3 Memorandum Accounts  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual accounts shall be maintained for each Participant for memorandum purposes only. All Cash Payments and/or Payroll Deductions from a Participant's
Eligible Compensation shall be credited to such account but shall be deposited with the general funds of the Company. All Cash Payments and/or Payroll Deductions received or held by the Company may be

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the purchase of fractional shares is not permitted for any future Offering, any cash balance remaining in the Participant's account at the termination of a
Purchase Period that is not sufficient to purchase a whole share of Stock shall be applied to the purchase of Stock in the next Purchase Period, provided the Participant participates in the next
Purchase Period and the purchase complies with Section&nbsp;8.1. All other amounts remaining in a Participant's account after a Purchase Date shall be refunded to the Participant as soon as
practical after the Purchase Date without the payment of any interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Stock is disposed of, a Participant shall make adequate provision for
local, state, federal and foreign withholding obligations of the Company, if any, that arise upon exercise of the Option or upon disposition of the Stock. The Company may withhold from the
Participant's compensation the amount necessary to meet such withholding obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Stock shall be purchased on behalf of a Participant on a Purchase Date if his or her participation in a current Offering or the Plan has terminated on or
before such Purchase Date or if the Participant has otherwise terminated employment prior to a Purchase Date. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.9 Procedural Matters  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may, from time to time, establish (a)&nbsp;limitations on the frequency and/or number of any permitted changes in the amount withheld during an
Offering, as set forth in Section&nbsp;11.1, (b)&nbsp;an exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, (c)&nbsp;payroll withholding in excess of the amount
designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed withholding elections, and (d)&nbsp;such other limitations or procedures as
deemed advisable by the Company in the Company's sole discretion that are consistent with the Plan and in accordance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;423. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During leaves of absence approved by the Company and meeting the requirements of the applicable treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, a Participant may
elect to continue participation in the Plan by delivering cash payments to the Company on the Participant's normal paydays equal to the amount of his or her Cash Payments and/or Payroll Deductions
under the Plan had the Participant not taken a leave of absence. Currently, the treasury regulations provide that a Participant may continue participation in the Plan only during the first
90&nbsp;days of a leave of absence unless the Participant's reemployment rights are guaranteed by statute or contract. </FONT></P>

Period shall be restricted for the same period as the Stock with respect to which the dividend was paid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plan Administrator designates or approves a stock brokerage or other financial services firm (the "ESPP Broker") to hold shares purchased under the Plan
for the accounts of Participants, the following procedures shall apply. Promptly following each Purchase Date, the number of shares of Stock purchased by each Participant shall be deposited into an
account established in the Participant's name with the ESPP Broker. A Participant shall be free to undertake a disposition of the shares of Stock in his or her account at any time after expiration of
a Holding Period set forth in Section&nbsp;10.1(a), but, in the absence of such a disposition, the shares of Stock must remain in the Participant's account at the ESPP Broker until the holding
period set forth in Code Section&nbsp;423 has been satisfied. With respect to shares of Stock for which the holding periods set forth above have been satisfied, the Participant may move those shares
of Stock to another brokerage account of the Participant's choosing or request that a stock certificate be issued and delivered to him or her. Dividends paid in the form of shares of Stock with
respect to Stock in a Participant's account shall be credited to such account. A Participant who is not subject to payment of U.S. income taxes may move his or her shares of Stock to another brokerage
account of his or her choosing or request that a stock certificate be delivered to him or her at any time, without regard to the Code Section&nbsp;423 holding period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>10.3 Notice of Disposition  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By entering the Plan, each Participant agrees to promptly give the Company notice of any Stock disposed of within the later of one year from the Purchase Date and
two years from the Offering Date for such Stock, showing the number of such shares disposed of and the Purchase Date and Offering Date for such Stock. This notice shall not be required if and so long
as the Company has a designated ESPP Broker. </FONT></P>

Payments accumulated with respect to an Offering exceeds the amount necessary to purchase (i)&nbsp;2,000 shares of Stock in any Purchase Period or Plan Year (or such other number as the Board or
Committee shall specify for a future Offering). Payroll Deductions or Cash Payments shall re-commence at the rate provided in such Participant's Subscription at the beginning of the next
