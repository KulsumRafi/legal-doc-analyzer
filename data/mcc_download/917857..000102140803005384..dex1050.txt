Amendment, each reference in the Credit Agreement to "Credit Agreement,"

a waiver of, amendment of, consent to or modification of any of the rights of
the Lenders or the Administrative Agent under or of any other term or provisions
of the Credit Agreement, any Loan Document, or other agreement executed in
connection therewith, or of any term or provision of any other instrument

the within Amendment on behalf of the Company has been duly authorized to
execute and deliver the same and bind the Company with respect to the provisions
provided for herein; (c) the execution and delivery hereof by the Company and
the performance and observance by the Company of the provisions hereof do not

the Company or any law applicable to the Company or result in the breach of any
provision of or constitute a default under any agreement, instrument or document
binding upon or enforceable against the Company; and (d) this Amendment
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation upon the Company in every
respect.

     10.  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document.
Separate counterparts may be executed with the same effect as if all parties had
executed the same counterparts.

     11.  Costs and Expenses. The Company agrees to pay on demand in accordance
with the terms of the Credit Agreement all reasonable costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, reproduction, execution
