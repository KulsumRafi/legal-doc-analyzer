<P>PURCHASER: _______________________________  (Please Print)</P>

<P>ISSUER:  EtG Corporation (Referred to hereinbelow as the "Company")</P>

<P>SECURITY:  Common Stock, par value $.001</P>

<P>QUANTITY:  _______________ Shares</P>

<P>In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities of the Company, I, the purchaser represent to the Company
the following:</P>

<P>(1) Investment.  I am aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition.  I am purchasing the Securities for
investment for my own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (as Amended).  These securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends on, among other things, the bona
fide nature of the investment intent as expressed herein.  In this connection I understand that, in view of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if my representation was
predicated solely upon a present intention to hold these Securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax
statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the market price of the Securities or for the period of one
year or any other fixed period in the future.</P>

<P>(2) Restrictions on Transfer Under Securities Act.  I further acknowledge and understand that the Securities must be held
indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from such registration
is available.  Moreover, I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities.  In addition, I
understand that the certificate evidencing the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the
Securities unless they are registered or unless the Company receives an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Company that such registration is not required.</P>

<P>(3) Sales Under Rule 144.  I am aware of the adoption of Rule 144 by the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act,
which in substance permits limited public resale of securities acquired in a non- public offering subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, including: (i) the availability of certain current public information about the Company, (ii) the resale
being made through a broker in an unsolicited "broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a " market maker," and
(iv) the amount of securities sold during any three-month period not exceeding specified limitations (generally 1% of the
total shares outstanding).</P>

<P>(4) Limitations on Rule 144.  I further acknowledge and understand that the Company is not now, and at any time I wish to
sell the Securities may not be, satisfying the public information requirement of Rule 144, and, in such case, I would be
precluded from selling the Securities under Rule 144 even if the minimum holding period had been satisfied.  </P>

<P>(5) Sales Not Under Rule 144.  I further acknowledge that, if all the requirements of Rule 144 are not met, then Regulation
A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, although Rule 144 is not exclusive, the staff of the
Commission has expressed its opinion (i) that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a
registered offering or exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and (ii) that such persons and the
brokers who participate in the transactions do so their own risk.</P>

<P>(6) Stop Transfer Instructions.  I further understand that stop transfer instructions will be in effect with respect to the
transfer of the Securities consistent with the above.</P>

<P>(7) Additional Representations and Warranties.  In addition, I represent and warrant:</P>

<P>(i) That I have had the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Company ( or any person acting on its
behalf) concerning the Company and my proposed investment in the Securities;</P>

<P>(ii) That I have concluded that I have sufficient information upon which to base my decision to acquire the Securities;</P>

<P>(iii) That I have made my own determination of the value of the Securities and have not relied upon any statements,
representations or warranties of the Company regarding the value of the Securities or the business prospects of the
Company;</P>

<P>(iv) That I understand that in acquiring the Securities, I am making a highly speculative investment with the knowledge that
the Company is in the initial stages of development;</P>

<P>(v) That I am capable of bearing the economic risk and burdens of the investment, the possibility of complete loss of all of
the investment, and the possible inability to readily liquidate the investment due to the lack of public market; and</P>

<P>(vi) That I understand that, in selling and transferring the Securities, the Company had relied upon an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and that, in an attempt to effect compliance with all the conditions of such
exemption, the Company is relying in good faith upon all of my foregoing representations and warranties.</P>

<P>                                                                SIGNATURE OF PURCHASER</P>

<P>                                                                _______________________________                Date:  _______________</P>

<P>                                                 Address:  ______________________________</P>
