Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option shall become 100% exercisable if,

exercised for such longer period as provided in the Plan. In no event shall this
Option be exercised later than the Term/Expiration Date as provided above.

II.   AGREEMENT

      1. Grant of Option. The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to
the Optionee named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Agreement
(the "Optionee") an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares, as
set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in
the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 14(b)
of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the terms and
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

      2. Exercise of Option.

            (a) Right to Exercise. This Option is exercisable during its term in
accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the
applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement.

            (b) Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an
exercise notice, in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Exercise Notice"),
which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in
respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "Exercised Shares"), and
such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be completed
by the Optionee and delivered to a member of the Stock Option Administration
Department of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment
of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be
deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed
Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price.

            No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option
unless such issuance and exercise complies with Applicable Laws. Assuming such
compliance, for


                                       2
<PAGE>

income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the
Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised
Shares.

      3. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by
any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee:

            (a) cash;

            (b) check;

            (c) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise
program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan.

      4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in
any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and
may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms
of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors,
administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.

      5. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set
out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in
accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option Agreement.

      6. Tax Consequences. Some of the federal tax consequences relating to this
Option, as of the date of this Option, are set forth below. THIS SUMMARY IS
NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR
DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

            (a) Exercising the Option. The Optionee may incur regular federal
income tax liability upon exercise of an NSO. The Optionee will be treated as
having received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal
to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the
date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise Price. If the Optionee is an
Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be required to withhold from his
or her compensation or collect from Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing
authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage of this compensation income
at the time of exercise, and may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to
deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are not delivered at the time of
exercise.

            (b) Disposition of Shares. If the Optionee holds NSO Shares for at
least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated
as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes.

      7. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan is incorporated herein by
reference. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the


                                       3
<PAGE>

parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their
entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Optionee with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the
Optionee's interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and
Optionee. This agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws, but not
the choice of law rules, of California.

      8. NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED SERVICE. OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED
ONLY BY CONTINUING AS AN EMPLOYEE AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH
THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED AN OPTION OR PURCHASING SHARES HEREUNDER).
OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT
CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE
FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH
OPTIONEE'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE OPTIONEE'S RELATIONSHIP AS
AN EMPLOYEE AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.

      By your signature and the signature of the Company's representative below,
you and the Company agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the
terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. Optionee has
reviewed the Plan and this Option Agreement in their entirety, has had an
opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option
Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and Option Agreement.
Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions
or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan
and Option Agreement. Optionee further agrees to notify the Company upon any
change in the residence address indicated below.
