<P>&#9;2.&#9;<B><U>BUILDING:</B></U>  Landlord is the owner of a certain parcel of land located at the intersection of Mu&ntilde;oz Rivera Avenue and Coll y Toste Street, Hato Rey, Puerto Rico on which a seven (7) story office building (hereinafter referred to as the "Building") and adjoining parking garage have been constructed.  The Building will be known as "Interstate General Building".</P>

<P>&#9;3.&#9;<B><U>TERM:</B></U>  Landlord agrees to lease to Tenant and Tenant agrees to lease from Landlord the Premises (as defined in Paragraph 1 (d) hereof) in the Building for the Term (as defined in Paragraph 1 (e) hereof) commencing on the Date of Commencement (as defined in Paragraph 1 (a) hereof), upon and subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease.</P>

<P>&#9;4.&#9;<B><U>FIXED MINIMUM RENT:</B></U>  Tenant shall pay the Fixed Minimum Rent (as defined in Paragraph 1 (f) hereof) in lawful money of the United States of America in equal monthly installments in advance without deduction or offset, on the first day of each and every month during the Term, at the offices of Landlord in the Building, or at such other place as Landlord may designate in writing.  </P>

<P>&#9;5.&#9;<B><U>ADDITIONAL RENT:</B></U>  The Fixed Minimum Rent payable each month on and after the Adjustment Date (as defined in Paragraph 1 (j) hereof) shall be increased by one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's Pro Rata Share (as defined in Paragraph 1 (h) hereof) of any increases in Real Estate Taxes (as hereinafter defined) and Operating Expenses (as hereinafter defined) over the Real Estate Taxes and Operating Expenses incurred by Landlord during the Base Year (as defined in Paragraph 1 (j) hereof).  Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant's Pro Rata Share represents the ratio that the area of the Premises bears to the total rentable area of office space in the Building which, is 65,435 square feet.  Tenant agrees to pay as additional rent to Landlord for each calendar year or portion thereof after the Adjustment Date  Tenant's Pro Rata Share of increases in Real Estate Taxes and Operating Expenses over those incurred by Landlord during the Base Year, such payment to be made in equal monthly installments in advance (i.e., 1/12th of the annual increase aforesaid) on the first day of each month beginning with the Adjustment Date.</P>

<P>&#9;The term  "Operating Expenses" is defined as all costs and expenses of every kind and nature paid or incurred by Landlord (including reasonable and appropriate reserves) in operating, managing, equipping, promoting, policing (if and to the extent provided by Landlord), lighting, repairing, replacing, cleaning and maintaining  the Building (excluding its parking area).  Such costs and expenses shall likewise include (but shall not be limited to) water and sewer charges; security services, seasonal holiday decorations, gas, electricity, steam and telephone utility charges; premiums for liability, property damage, fire, workmen's compensation, and other insurance (including all insurance, hazard, rent and otherwise, carried by Landlord on the Building); payments toward mass transit or car pooling facilities or otherwise as required by Federal, Commonwealth or local governmental authorities; the cost of the maintenance and repair rendered to the water standpipe system installed in the Building, including any alarm service charges, as well as the cost of the water consumed by the water standpipe system; costs and expenses in connection with maintaining fire or smoke detection or alarm system; the costs of complying with Federal, Commonwealth or local governmental ambient air and environmental standards; (i)  provided that such costs are amortized over the useful life of such equipment and materials the cost of all materials, supplies and services purchased or hired therefore; the cost of maintenance and repair to and of the roof and structure of the Building; total compensation and benefits paid to or on behalf of employees, including unemployment taxes, social security taxes, and payroll taxes of any kind; real and personal property taxes and assessments; fees for required licenses and permits; municipal license fees ("patentes municipales"), supplies, operation of loudspeakers and any other equipment supplying music to the Building; reasonable depreciation of equipment used in the operation of the Building; and administrative costs equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total costs of operating and maintaining the Building (except appropriate reserves);  (ii) provided, however, that such taxes are not included within the definition of 'Real Estate Taxes' as defined below.  </P>

<P>&#9;"Operating Expenses" shall not include capital improvements, interest or amortization of mortgages, depreciation of the Building, compensation paid to officers or executives of Landlord or management agent, or income taxes imposed on income of Landlord from the Building;  (iii) and costs incurred in connection with the leasing or procuring new lessees including leasing commissions paid to the agents of Landlord.</P>

<P>&#9;The term "Real Estate Taxes" is defined as all real estate taxes, ad valorem charges and assessments, water and sewer rents, and other government levies and charges of every kind and nature whatsoever, general and special, extraordinary as well as ordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, and each and every installment thereof, which during the Term of this Lease are levied, assessed, or imposed on the Building or which become due and payable, in connection with the use, occupancy or possession of the Building or any part thereof of any land or other improvements now or at any time during the Term of this Lease constituting a part of the Building.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to include as Real Estate Taxes any inheritance, estate, succession, transfer, gift or income tax imposed on Landlord.  If at any time during the Term of this Lease the methods of taxation prevailing on the Date of Commencement shall be altered so that in addition to or in lieu of or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the Real Estate Taxes now levied, assessed or imposed on real estate as such there shall be levied, assessed or imposed  (i) a tax on the rents received from such real estate, or  (ii) a license fee measured by the rents receivable by Landlord from the Building or any portion thereof, or  (iii) a tax upon Landlord which is otherwise measured by or based in whole or in part upon the building or any portion thereof, then the same shall be included in the computation of Real Estate Taxes, computed as if the amount of such tax or fee so payable were that part due if the Building were the only property of Lessor subject thereto.</P>

<P>&#9;After each calendar year, Landlord will procure from its independent accountants a Statement of Taxes and Operating Expenses for the calendar year just ended, with the purpose of determining the pro-rata share amount of Tenant, for possible increase in the rent on the Adjustment Date anniversary during the year just started.  Additional rent will be collected only if the Taxes and Operating Expenses exceed the base year's similar type expenses.</P>

<P>&#9;On each subsequent anniversary date of the Adjustment Date, a comparison  of expenses will be made against the Base Year's expenses to determine further increases or decreases in the Additional Rent.  Decreases may reduce in total the Additional Rent affected by this process but will not reduce the Fixed Minimum Rent if the Year's operating expenses are less that the Base Year's.  Adjustments in Additional Rent will be made retroactive to the Adjustment Date when this date precedes the date when the independent accountant's Statement of Taxes and Operating Expenses is received.  If the amount to be paid as a result of the new computation of the Tenant's Pro Rata Share is larger than the amount being actually paid, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in full, the corresponding increase for the months that have elapsed since the Adjustment Date to the billing date within ten (10) days after Landlord's written request for such payment.  If the amount to be paid monthly as Additional Rent, as a result of the adjustment revision, is lower that the actual amount being paid, the difference for the months that have elapsed since the Adjustment Date to the date of receipt of the Accountant's Statement will be credited to the next succeeding Tenant's monthly payment.  Tenant will make the subsequent monthly payments for the new adjusted rent amount, whether increased or decreased.  (iv)  The Landlord agrees, if so requested by the Tenant, to provide to the Tenant access to pertinent records of the Landlord to verify the operating expenses.</P>

<P>&#9;6.&#9;<B><U>DELIVERY OF PREMISES:</B></U>  If Landlord, by reason on any act or neglect of the Tenant or by any separate contractor employed by Tenant or by changes ordered by Tenant or by fire, unavoidable casualty, or by actions of governmental entities or changes in governmental requirements, cannot deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Date of Commencement, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor shall the Landlord be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting there from, nor shall the Term be extended; but in such event there shall be a proportionate reduction of rent covering the period between the Date of Commencement and the time when Landlord can deliver possession.</P>

<P>&#9;7.&#9;<B><U>SERVICES TO BE FURNISHED BY LANDLORD:</B></U>  Landlord agrees herein, to furnish Tenant:  refrigerated water at those points of supply provided for general use of tenants in the Building; and air conditioning at such times as Landlord normally furnishes air conditioning to all other tenants in the Building and at such temperatures and in such amounts as are considered by Landlord to be standard.

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;The failure by Tenant to make any payment of rent or any other payment required to be made by Tenant hereunder, as and when required and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after receipt by Tenant of written notice therof from Landlord to Tenant;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(3)&#9;The failure by tenant to observe or perform any of the agreements, covenants, conditions or other provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant, other than described in Paragraph 21.A (2) above, where such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by Tenant of written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(4)&#9;(i) The making by Tenant of any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors;  (ii) the filing by or against Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed with 60 days);  (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises or of Tenants' interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Tenant within 30 days;  or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within thirty (30) days.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;21.B&#9; <B>Remedies:</B>  In the event of any such default or breach by Tenant, Landlord may at any time thereafter, with or without notice or demand and without limiting Landlord in the exercise of any right or remedy which Landlord may have by reason of such default or breach:</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(1)  Terminate Tenant's right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this lease shall terminate and Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord.  In such event Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's default, including, but not limited to, the cost of recovering possession of the Premises; expenses of reletting, including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises; reasonable attorneys' fees and any real estate commission actually paid; and that portion of any leasing commission paid by Landlord in connection with a lease applicable to the unexpired term of this Lease; and Landlord may relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of the Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be less than or exceed the period which would have otherwise constituted the balance of the term of this Lease and may grant concessions or free rent; and Tenant or the legal representative of Tenant shall also pay Landlord as liquidated damages for the failure of Tenant to observe and perform the terms, agreements and covenants herein contained, any deficiency between the Fixed Minimum Rent and Additional Rent herein agreed to be paid by Tenant and the net amount, if any, of the rents collected on account of any new lease or leases of the Premises for each monthly period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term of this Lease.  This provision and all other pertinent provisions of this Lease shall survive the termination of this Lease.  Unpaid installments of rent or other sums shall bear interest at the prevailing market rates.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Tenant shall not be in default if its failure to make a payment of the full amount of the rent or its share of the Operating Expenses is only due to Landlord's failure to provide a written notice of any change in the rent or in the amount of Additional Rent due from Tenant or any other amount that is due and payable under this Lease, it being understood that this does not apply to the payment of the Fixed Minimum or the Additional Rent due under this Lease once they have been established for any given year during the term of this Lease.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;Maintain Tenant's right to possession in which case this Lease shall continue in effect whether or not Tenant shall have abandoned the Premises.  In such event Landlord shall be entitled to enforce all of Landlord's rights and remedies under this Lease, including, without limitation, the right to recover the rent as it becomes due hereunder.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(3)&#9;Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available to Landlord under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>

Said abatement shall continue until Landlord restores the damaged areas to the condition they were in prior to the damage.  No penalty shall accrue for delays which may arise by reason of adjustment of insurance by Landlord or for reasonable delays for any cause beyond Landlord's control.  If the Premises are rendered wholly untenantable by fire or other cause, and if Landlord shall decide not to restore or rebuild the same, or if the Building be so damaged that Landlord shall decide to demolish it or to rebuild it with substantial modifications, then or in any such event Landlord may, within thirty (30) days after such fire or other cause, give Tenant notice in writing of such decision and thereupon the term of this Lease shall expire.  Upon the termination of this Lease under the conditions provided for in the sentence immediately preceding, Tenant's liability for rent shall cease accruing as of the day following the casualty.</P>

<P>&#9;23.&#9;<B><U>PROPERTY-LOSS OR DAMAGE:</B></U>  Landlord and its agents shall not be liable for any damage to property of Tenant by theft, riot, civil disorder or strike, sabotage, pollution, hurricane, storm, earthquake or otherwise.

<P>&#9;24.&#9;<B><U>CONDEMNATION:</B></U>  Tenant agrees that if the Building or Premises, or any part thereof, shall be taken or condemned by a governmental authority, Tenant shall have no claim against the amount that may be awarded as damages or paid as a result of any such condemnation or taking.  At the option of Landlord, the term of this Lease shall cease and terminate from the date of such gevernmental taking or condemnation, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired term of this Lease.  The rent, however, shall in any such case be apportioned to the date of such taking.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant hereby reserves such rights as it may have to recover damages or compensation for loss of trade fixtures, relocation expenses and the unamortized cost of its leasehold improvements.</P>

<P>&#9;25. &#9;<B><U>QUIET ENJOYMENT:</B></U>  Landlord covenants and agrees with Tenant that upon Tenant paying the rent and additional rent and observing and performing all the terms, covenants and conditions on Tenant's part to be observed and performed under this Lease, Tenant may peaceably and quietly enjoy the Premises, subject nevertheless to the terms and conditions of this Lease and including all ground leases and other underlying leases and mortgages to which the Building may now or hereafter be subject.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;that such holder shall be treated as having assumed Landlord's obligations hereunder only upon:  (i) the taking of possession of the Building by such holder,  or (ii) such holder exercising its election pursuant to subparagraph (a) above;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;to execute such instruments as may be required to assure such holder that without the written consent of such holder:  (i) no rent shall be prepaid hereunder other than for the current and next ensuing month;  (ii) no modifications shall be made in the provisions of this Lease nor shall the Term be extended or renewed, except as provided herein;  (iii) this Lease shall not be terminated by Tenant except as provided herein nor shall the Tenant tender or accept a surrender of this lease except incident to a termination provided for herein;  (iv) no notice of termination of this Lease by Landlord shall be deemed to be effective unless such written consent has been given or such holder subsequently waives the requirement; and (v) this Lease not be subordinated to any lien subordinated to such first mortgage; and</P>

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Paragraph to the contrary, if any mortgagee or ground lessor shall elect to have this Lease prior to the lien of its mortgage or ground lease, and shall give written notice thereof at any time to Tenant, this Lease shall be deemed prior to such mortgage or ground lease, whether this Lease is dated prior or subsequent to the date of said mortgage or ground lease.

<P>&#9;</P>
