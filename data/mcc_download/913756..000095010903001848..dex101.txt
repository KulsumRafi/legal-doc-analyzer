Dear Maarten:

It was a pleasure meeting you and I am delighted that you have chosen to join
Orthovita. You will, no doubt, bring solid experience to the management team
here, and I am sure you will enjoy the environment at Orthovita and your
re-location to the Philadelphia area and all it offers.

The following confirms our discussion regarding your employment by Orthovita:

1.   Position: Vice President, Medical Affairs, Worldwide. Your prime
     responsibility will be clinical affairs directly reporting to me. You will
     be a member of the executive management team and will work with me to
     define the strategic opportunities for Orthovita.

2.   Reporting Relationship: To the CEO/President of Orthovita

3.   Compensation: $170,000 per annum with an annual salary grade review, and
     participation in the Executive Compensation Plan for Vice President level,
     with a 30% bonus opportunity based upon performance criteria established on
     Company and individual performance (bonus criteria to be described as part
     of this agreement). Year-end bonus can be in cash and/or stock options at
     your discretion.

4.   Stock Options in Orthovita: The current plan approved at the last meeting
     of the Board of Directors changed the vesting period to 25% each year for 4
     years beginning on the anniversary of you employment date. Although I
     indicated that I was not sure that this had taken effect, it has been
     initiated since the year-end grants were awarded this past January. Thus,
     you will received a 50,000 stock option grant at the current price of $4.00
     per share with the vesting as stated above. Additional options may be
     granted at the discretion of the CEO/President and Board of Directors.

     Orthovita or its successor, you will receive 9 months salary as a severance
     benefit. Additionally, you will be able to continue your participation in
     any short-term and long-term incentive compensation and benefit programs
     generally established for the Company's executives.
