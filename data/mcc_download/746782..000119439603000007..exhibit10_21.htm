<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The purpose of this 2002-2005
Restricted Share Unit Plan (the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;) of Cognos Incorporated (the
&#147;<U>Corporation</U>&#148;) and any present or future wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation wherever located (each a &#147;<U>Subsidiary</U>&#148;) is to provide grants (each an
&#147;<U>Award</U>&#148;) of Restricted Share Units (as defined below) to officers, directors and
employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries. Any person to whom an Award has been
granted under this plan is called a &#147;<U>Participant</U>&#148;. A &#147;<U>Restricted Share
Unit</U>&#148; means a right to receive, on the basis set out in the Plan, one (1) common
share in the capital stock of the Corporation (a &#147;<U>Common Share</U>&#148;). </FONT> </P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>For greater certainty, the Plan
together with any trust established pursuant hereto shall be constituted as an
&#147;employee benefit plan&#148; for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the
&#147;Tax Act&#148;). No provision of the Plan shall be applied, interpreted or
administered in a manner contrary to the requirements of the Tax Act for qualification of
the Plan as such. For greater certainty, the grant of an Award represents a contingent
entitlement of the Participant to whom it has been granted and the exchange of a
Restricted Share Unit which is the subject of an Award for a Common Share shall be the
payment of such share out of or under an employee benefit plan. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"><B>A.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Plan shall be administered by the Human Resources &amp; Compensation
Committee (the &#147;<U>Committee</U>&#148;) of the Board of Directors of the

Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to
(a)&nbsp;determine the Participants of the Corporation and any Subsidiary (from
among the class of individuals eligible under paragraph 1) to whom Awards may be
granted; (b)&nbsp;determine the time or times at which Awards may be granted;
(c) determine the limitations, restrictions, and conditions of any grant of
Awards; (d) determine the time or times when each Restricted Share Unit which is
the subject of an Award shall become exchangeable or exercisable for a Common
Share and the duration of the exchange or exercise period; (e) interpret the
Plan and prescribe and rescind rules and regulations relating to it; and (f)
select on or more trustees (each a &#147;<U>Trustee</U>&#148; and collectively the
&#147;<U>Trustees</U>&#148;) and establish one or more agreements between the
Corporation and each Trustee (each a &#147;<U>Trust Agreement</U>&#148;) to provide for
the purchase of Common Shares on the open market for exchange or exercise under
the Plan and the administration of the policies and procedures governing such
purchases. The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any
provisions of the Plan or of any Awards granted under it is final unless
otherwise determined by the Board. The Committee may from time to time adopt
such rules and regulations for carrying out the Plan as it may consider
appropriate. No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any
action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award
granted under it. </FONT> </P>

Awards may be granted to members of the Board, including members of the
Committee. All grants of Awards to members of the Board shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of this Plan applicable to other eligible
persons. Members of the Board who either (a) are eligible to receive grants of
Awards pursuant to the Plan or (b)&nbsp;have been granted Awards may vote on any
matters affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of any Awards
pursuant to the Plan, except that no such member shall act upon the granting to
himself of Awards, but any such member may be counted in determining the
existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board during which such action is
taken with respect to the granting of Awards to such member. </FONT> </P>
