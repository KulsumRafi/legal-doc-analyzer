Thus if the Contract Price were being determined for the fourth calendar quarter of 2001, the variable SFI would be the SFI calculated for the second calendar quarter of 2001, the variable ABRP would be the BRP, or ABRP, as appropriate, calculated for the third calendar quarter of 2001, the variable GDPIPD indices would be the GDPIPD indices as published for the first and second calendar quarters of 2001, the variable RCP would be RCP calculated for third calendar quarter of 2001, and the variable RAF would be as calculated for the quarter for which the Contract Price is being determined. <BR>
<BR>
** The methodology for computing price escalations for the Virginia Power Transportation Contract is modified, then such modification shall become effective for escalation of the Rail Compensation Price hereunder as of the date of effectiveness of such modification under the Virginia Power Transportation Contract." <BR>
