multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) ABR Advance made on each
Borrowing Date shall equal no less than $100,000 or an integral multiple thereof

to make such repayment, and only the excess of the proceeds of the new Loan over
the Loan being repaid need be made available to the Borrower.

be due and payable on the date specified. Each partial prepayment pursuant to
this subsection shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $250,000 or a whole
multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof, or, if less, the outstanding principal
balance of the Loans. After giving effect to any partial prepayment with respect
to LIBOR Advances which were made (whether as the result of a borrowing or a
conversion) on the same date and which had the same Interest Period, the
outstanding principal balance of such LIBOR Advances shall exceed $500,000 or a
whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.

            (b)  MANDATORY PREPAYMENT RELATING TO COLLATERAL. On any date that
the aggregate amount of all Loans then outstanding exceeds the Market Value of

CREDIT COMMITMENT AND REDUCTIONS OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT AMOUNT. (i)

simultaneously with a reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment Amount under
Section 2.6, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans by the aggregate amount, if
any, by which the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans plus the
Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the Revolving Credit Commitment Amount as so
reduced.

<Page>

            (d)  PREPAYMENTS GENERALLY. With each prepayment of a Loan, the
Borrower shall pay all interest accrued on the principal amount prepaid to the
date of prepayment. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, each prepayment
of Loans shall first be applied to ABR Advances.

accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all fees and expenses payable hereunder
shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

Bank at the Bank's office specified in Section 10.2, in each case in lawful
money of the United States, in immediately available funds and without set-off
or counterclaim. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such
time shall not constitute a Default, PROVIDED THAT such payment is made on such
due date, but any such payment made after 1:00 p.m. on such due date shall be
deemed to have been made on the next Business Day for the purpose of calculating
interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans.

            (b)  If any payment hereunder or under the Note shall be due and
payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof (except as
otherwise provided in the definition of Interest Period) shall be extended to
the next Business Day and interest shall be payable at the applicable rate
specified herein during such extension, provided, however that if such next
Business Day is after the Maturity Date, any such payment shall be due on the
immediately preceding Business Day.

     2.9.   USE OF PROCEEDS

            Loans shall be used solely, directly or indirectly, to (i) fund the
Acquisition of independent sales representative offices of the Borrower and
other Acquisitions, and (ii) provide working capital for the Borrower and for
their general corporate purposes not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. No
part of the proceeds of any Loan nor any Letter of Credit will be used, directly
or indirectly, for a purpose which violates any law, including, without
limitation, the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, as amended.

     2.10.  LETTER OF CREDIT SUB-FACILITY

            (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Bank

Credit Exposure would not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment Amount.

of Credit Commitment and shall be a "Letter of Credit" under this Agreement.

            (b)  Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date which shall
not be later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. In

            (c)  Each Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account of the
Borrower in support of an obligation of the Borrower in favor of a beneficiary
who has requested the issuance of such Letter of Credit as a condition to a
transaction entered into in connection with the business of the Borrower. The
Borrower shall give the Bank a Letter of Credit Agreement for such Letter of
Credit by 12:00 noon on the requested date of issuance of a Letter of Credit.
Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Bank, with such provisions with respect to the conditions under which a
drawing may be made thereunder and the documentation required in respect of such
drawing as the Bank shall reasonably require.

            (d)  In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the
Bank shall have no obligation to the Borrower other than to confirm that any
documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been
delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of
such Letter of Credit. Upon each payment by the Bank under a Letter of Credit,
the Borrower shall reimburse the Bank for the amount thereof upon demand
therefor by the Bank. If all or any portion of any Reimbursement Obligation in
respect of a Letter of Credit shall not be paid when due (whether upon demand,
by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable
upon demand by the Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate
PLUS the Applicable Margin applicable to ABR Advances PLUS 2%, from the date of
such nonpayment until paid in full (whether before or after the entry of a
judgment thereon).

            (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Letter of Credit Agreement, to the extent that the terms of this Agreement shall
be inconsistent with the terms of such Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall govern.

     2.11.  ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS

            The Borrower's obligation to reimburse the Bank for each payment
under or in respect of a Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or
defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, the Bank or any other Person, including
any defense based on the failure of any drawing to conform to the terms of such
Letter of Credit, any drawing document proving to be forged, fraudulent or
invalid, or the illegality,

                                      -16-
<Page>

invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Letter of Credit, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, PROVIDED THAT with respect to any Letter
of Credit, the foregoing shall not relieve the Bank of any liability it may have
to the Borrower for any actual damages sustained by the Borrower arising from a
wrongful payment under such Letter of Credit made as a result of the Bank's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

3.   INTEREST, YIELD PROTECTIONS, ETC.

     3.1.   INTEREST RATE AND PAYMENT DATES

            (a)  PRIOR TO MATURITY. Except as otherwise provided in Sections
3.1(b) and 3.1(c), prior to maturity, the Loans shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates
per annum set forth below:

<Table>
<Caption>
         Advances                     Interest Rate
         --------                     -------------
     <S>                            <C>
     Each ABR Advance              Alternate Base Rate

     Each LIBOR Advance            LIBOR for the applicable Interest Period
                                    PLUS the Applicable Margin
</Table>

            (b)  LATE CHARGES. If all or any portion of the principal balance of
or interest payable on any of the Loans or any other amount payable under the
Loan Documents shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity
thereof, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest
at a rate per annum (whether before or after the entry of a judgment thereon)
equal to 2% PLUS the rate which would otherwise be applicable pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), from the date such amount was due to the date such amount is
paid in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rate applicable
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) to any overdue principal, interest or other amount
payable under the Loan Documents shall be (i) in the case of an overdue
principal balance of any LIBOR Advance, the applicable LIBOR PLUS the Applicable
Margin until the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or the earlier
termination thereof pursuant to this Agreement) and thereafter at the Alternate
Base Rate and (ii) in all other cases, the Alternate Base Rate. All such
interest shall be payable on demand.

            (c)  COMPUTATION. Interest on (i) ABR Advances to the extent based
on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year (as
the case may be), and (ii) ABR Advances (to the extent based on the Federal
Funds Rate), and LIBOR Advances shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year for the actual number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.1(b), interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date and upon each payment (including prepayment) of the Loans. Any change in
the interest rate on the Loans resulting from a change in the Alternate Base
Rate or reserve requirements shall become effective as of the opening of
business on the day on which such change shall become effective. Each
determination of the Alternate Base Rate or a LIBOR by the Bank pursuant to this
Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto absent manifest
error. At no time shall the interest rate payable on the Loans, together with
the fees and

                                      -17-
<Page>

all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to the Bank, to the extent
the same are construed to constitute interest, exceed the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law.

     3.2.   FEES

            (a)  RESERVED.

            (b)  RESERVED.

            (c)  LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank
the Bank's standard fees with respect to each Letter of Credit, plus an issuance
fee equal to 1.50% of the face amount of such Letter of Credit.

     3.3.   CONVERSIONS

            (a)  Provided no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the
Borrower may elect from time to time to convert one or more LIBOR Advances to
ABR Advances by submitting a duly executed Notice of Conversion to the Bank at
least one Business Day prior to such election, which notice shall be
irrevocable, specifying the amount to be converted, PROVIDED THAT any such
conversion of LIBOR Advances shall only be made on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto. In addition, the Borrower may elect from time to time
to (i) convert ABR Advances to LIBOR Advances and (ii) continue LIBOR Advances
as new LIBOR Advances, in each case by giving the Bank at least three Business
Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so
converted and the initial Interest Period relating thereto, PROVIDED THAT any
such conversion of ABR Advances to LIBOR Advances shall only be made on a
Business Day and any such conversion of LIBOR Advances to new LIBOR Advances
shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the
LIBOR Advances which are to be converted to such new LIBOR Advances. Advances
may be converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, PROVIDED THAT the
amount to be converted to a LIBOR Advance, when aggregated with any LIBOR
Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.5(a) and having the
same Interest Period, shall be $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof.

            (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or
an Event of Default, all LIBOR Advances shall be automatically converted to ABR
Advances on the last day of the applicable Interest Period.

            (c)  Each conversion shall be effected by the Bank by applying the
proceeds of the new ABR Advance or LIBOR Advance, as the case may be, to the
Advances (or portion thereof) being converted. Any such conversion shall not
constitute a borrowing for purposes of Section 6.

            (d)  If the Borrower shall have failed to elect to continue a LIBOR
Advance as a new LIBOR Advance prior to the expiration of its Interest Period,
the amount of the Loan represented by such Advance shall be automatically
converted to an ABR Advance at the expiration of its Interest Period.

                                      -18-
<Page>

     3.4.   INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSS

            Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the
Borrower shall fail for any reason to borrow or convert an Advance after it
shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a LIBOR
Advance, or if a LIBOR Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if any repayment or
prepayment of the principal amount of a LIBOR Advance is made by the Borrower
for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank against, and to
pay on demand directly to the Bank the amount (calculated by the Bank using any
method chosen by the Bank which is customarily used by the Bank for such
purpose) equal to any loss or out-of-pocket expense suffered by the Bank as a
result of such failure to borrow or convert, or such termination, repayment or
prepayment, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Bank in
liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of
such LIBOR Advance, or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which
correspond to such LIBOR Advance, and any internal processing charge customarily
charged by the Bank in connection therewith.

     3.5.   CAPITAL ADEQUACY

            If the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
the Bank or any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling the Bank
(each a "CONTROL PERSON"), shall be affected by the occurrence of a Regulatory
Change and the Bank shall have determined that such Regulatory Change shall have
had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (i) the rate of return on the
Bank's or such Control Person's capital, or (ii) the asset value to the Bank or
such Control Person of the Loans made or maintained by the Bank or the
Reimbursement Obligations, in any case to a level below that which the Bank or
such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve
but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account the Bank's or such
Control Person's policies regarding capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the
Bank to be material to the Bank or Control Person, then, within ten days after
demand by the Bank, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank or such Control Person
such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Bank
or such Control Person, as the case may be, for such reduction.

     3.6.   REIMBURSEMENT FOR INCREASED COSTS

            If the Bank shall determine that a Regulatory Change:

                 (a)  does or shall subject it to any Taxes of any kind
     whatsoever with respect to any LIBOR Advances or its obligations under this
     Agreement to make LIBOR Advances, or change the basis of taxation of
     payments to it of principal, interest or any other amount payable hereunder
     in respect of its LIBOR Advances, or impose on the Bank any other
     condition, including any Taxes required to be withheld from any amounts
     payable under the Loan Documents (except for imposition of, or change in
     the rate of, tax on the overall net income of the Bank); or

                                      -19-
<Page>

                 (b)  does or shall impose, modify or make applicable any
     reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, assessment, increased cost or
     similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits of, or advances or
     loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds
     by, any office of the Bank in respect of its LIBOR Advances which is not
     otherwise included in the determination of a LIBOR;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Bank of
making, renewing, converting or maintaining its LIBOR Advances or its commitment
to make such LIBOR Advances, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in
respect of its LIBOR Advances, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay
the Bank within ten days after demand therefor, such additional amount as is
sufficient to compensate the Bank for such additional cost or reduction in such
amount receivable which the Bank deems to be material as determined by the Bank.
No failure by the Bank to demand, and no delay in demanding, compensation for
any increased cost shall constitute a waiver of its right to demand such
compensation at any time. A statement setting forth the calculations of any
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by the Bank to the
Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     3.7.   ILLEGALITY OF FUNDING

            Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if the Bank shall
reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it
unlawful for the Bank to make or maintain any LIBOR Advance as contemplated by
this Agreement, the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof, and (i) the
commitment of the Bank to make such LIBOR Advances or convert ABR Advances to
LIBOR Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (ii) the Bank shall fund each
requested LIBOR Advance as an ABR Advance and (iii) the Loans then outstanding
as such LIBOR Advances shall be converted automatically to ABR Advances on the
last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such
earlier time as may be required by law. If the commitment of the Bank with
respect to LIBOR Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and the Bank
shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for the Bank to
make or maintain LIBOR Advances, the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower
thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower, the Bank's commitment
to make or maintain LIBOR Advances shall be reinstated.

     3.8.   SUBSTITUTED INTEREST RATE

            In the event that (i) the Bank shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason
of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR applicable pursuant to
Section 3.1 or (ii) the Bank shall have determined (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable LIBOR will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Bank of maintaining or funding
loans bearing interest based on such LIBOR, with respect to any portion of the
Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as or converted to LIBOR Advances
(each, an "AFFECTED ADVANCE"), the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower (by
telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in

                                      -20-
<Page>

writing) of such determination, on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the
requested Borrowing Date or Conversion Date for such Affected Advances. If the
Bank shall give such notice, (a) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR
Advances, (b) the Advances (or any portion thereof) that were to have been
converted to Affected Advances shall be converted to ABR Advances and (c) any
outstanding Affected Advances shall be converted, on the last day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances. Until any notice
under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this section has been
withdrawn by the Bank (by notice to the Borrower promptly upon either (x) the
Bank having determined that such circumstances affecting the interbank
eurodollar market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do
exist for determining LIBOR pursuant to Section 3.1 or (y) the Bank having
determined that circumstances no longer render the Advances (or any portion
thereof) Affected Advances), no further LIBOR Advances shall be required to be
made by the Bank, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert all or any
portion of the Loans to or as LIBOR Advances.

     3.9.   TAXES

            All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes
required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan
Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making
payments hereunder free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall
pay such additional amounts to the Bank as may be necessary in order that the
actual amounts received by the Bank in respect of interest and any other amounts
payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after
payment of any additional Taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the
payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been
received if such deduction or withholding were not required.

     3.10.  OPTION TO FUND

            The Bank has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a LIBOR
Advance, the Bank may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or
maintain its funding of such LIBOR Advance during the Interest Period with
respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement
relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the
rate of interest to be paid in respect of such LIBOR Advance and any amounts
owing under Sections 3.4 and 3.6. The Bank shall be entitled to fund and
maintain its funding of all or any part of each LIBOR Advance in any manner it
sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if the Bank had
actually funded and maintained each LIBOR Advance during the applicable Interest
Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to such LIBOR Advance
having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period. The Bank may fund each
LIBOR Advance from or for the account of any branch or office of the Bank as the
Bank may choose from time to time.

4.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     In order to induce the Bank to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Loans to the Borrower, the Borrower represents and warrants that:

                                      -21-
<Page>

     4.1.   SUBSIDIARIES; CAPITALIZATION

            As of the Effective Date, the only Subsidiaries of the Borrower are
the companies listed on SCHEDULE 4.1, and the authorized, issued and outstanding
Capital Stock of the Borrower and each such Subsidiary is as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.1.

     4.2.   EXISTENCE AND POWER

            The Borrower is duly organized or formed and validly existing in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation, as the case may be, has all requisite power and authority to own its
property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is in good standing
and authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted therein or the property owned by it therein makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified could have
a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.3.   AUTHORITY AND EXECUTION

            The Borrower has full legal power and authority to enter into,
execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have
been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are in
full compliance with its Organizational Documents. The Borrower has duly
executed and delivered the Loan Documents.

     4.4.   BINDING AGREEMENT

            The Loan Documents constitute, the valid and legally binding
obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

     4.5.   LITIGATION

            There are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity or by
or before any Governmental Authority (whether purportedly on behalf of the
Borrower) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the
Borrower, or which may affect the property or rights of the Borrower, which (i)
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) call into
question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any
Loan Document, or (iii) might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

     4.6.   REQUIRED CONSENTS

            Except for information filings required to be made in the ordinary
course of business which are not a condition to the performance by the Borrower
under the Loan Documents, no consent, authorization or approval of, filing with,
notice to, or exemption by,

                                      -22-
<Page>

stockholders or holders of any other equity interest, any Governmental Authority
or any other Person is required to authorize, or is required in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents or is required as
a condition to the validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents.

     4.7.   ABSENCE OF DEFAULTS; NO CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS

            (a)  The Borrower is not in default under any mortgage, indenture,
contract or agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
property is bound, the effect of which default could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery or carrying out of the
terms of the Loan Documents will not constitute a default under, or result in
the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon any
property of the Borrower or result in a breach of or require the mandatory
repayment of or other acceleration of payment under or pursuant to the terms of
any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement.

            (b)  The Borrower is not in default with respect to any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which
default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.8.   COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS

            The Borrower is complying in all material respects with all
statutes, regulations, rules and orders of all Governmental Authorities which
are applicable to the Borrower, a violation of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.9.   TAXES

            The Borrower has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns
required to be filed and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the
payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any
assessments made against it (other than those being contested as required under
Section 7.4) which would be material to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
and no tax Liens have been filed with respect thereto. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower with respect to all taxes are, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, adequate for the payment of such taxes, and the
Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which is due and payable against the
Borrower or any claims being asserted which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, except such thereof as are being contested as
required under Section 7.4, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside
in accordance with GAAP.

     4.10.  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

            The Borrower is not subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to any statute or regulation
which prohibits or restricts the incurrence of Indebtedness.

                                      -23-
<Page>

     4.11.  FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS; USE OF LOAN PROCEEDS

            The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock. After giving effect to the making of each Loan,
Margin Stock will constitute less than 25% of the assets (as determined by any
reasonable method) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

     4.12.  PLANS

            The only Pension Plans in effect as of the Effective Date are listed
on SCHEDULE 4.12. Each Employee Benefit Plan is in compliance with ERISA and the
Code, where applicable, in all material respects. The Borrower and ERISA
Affiliates have complied with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with
respect to each Pension Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan. As of the Effective
Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have no liability
under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA (including the obligation to satisfy
secondary liability as a result of purchaser default). The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have, as of the Effective Date, made all
contributions or payments to or under each such Pension Plan required by law or
the terms of such Pension Plan or any contract or agreement with respect
thereto. No material liability to the PBGC has been, or is expected by the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate to be incurred by the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is a group health plan within the
meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code is in material compliance with the
continuation of health care coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code.

     4.13.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

            The Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Bank copies of the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower as of December 31, 2001 and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder's equity and cash
flows for the fiscal years then ended (with the related notes and schedules, the
"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial Statements fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and results of the operations of the Borrower
as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein and have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP. Except as reflected in the Financial Statements or in the
notes thereto, the Borrower has no obligation or liability of any kind (whether
fixed, accrued, Contingent, unmatured or otherwise) which, in accordance with
GAAP, should have been shown on the Financial Statements and was not. Since the
date of the Financial Statements, the Borrower has conducted its business only
in the ordinary course and there has been no Material Adverse Change.

     4.14.  PROPERTY

            The Borrower has (i) good and marketable title to all of its
property, title to which is material to the Borrower or such Subsidiary and (ii)
a valid leasehold interest in all property, a leasehold interest in which is
material to the Borrower, in each case subject to no Liens, except Permitted
Liens.

                                      -24-
<Page>

     4.15.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LICENSES

            The Borrower owns, or has the legal right to use, all United States
trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, service marks, and copyrights
and all technology, know-how, and processes necessary for each of them to
conduct its business as currently conducted (the "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"),
except for those the failure to own or have the legal right to use would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been
asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any
such Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any such claim, and to
the knowledge of the Borrower the use of such Intellectual Property by the
Borrower does not infringe on the rights of any Person, except for such claims
and infringements that in the aggregate would not be reasonably expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred which permits or, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, after notice or the lapse of time or both, or any
other condition, could reasonably be expected to permit, the revocation or
termination of any license or other right to use Intellectual Property which
revocation or termination could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     4.16.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

            (a)  No Hazardous Substances have been generated or manufactured on,
transported to or from, treated at, stored at or discharged from any Real
Property in material violation of any Environmental Laws; no Hazardous
Substances have been discharged into subsurface waters under any Real Property
in material violation of any Environmental Laws; no Hazardous Substances have
been discharged from any Real Property on or into property or waters (including
subsurface waters) adjacent to any Real Property in material violation of any
Environmental Laws; and there are not now, nor ever have been, on any Real
Property any underground or above ground storage tanks regulated under any
Environmental Laws.

            (b)  The Borrower (i) has not received notice (written or oral) or
otherwise learned of any claim, demand, suit, action, proceeding, event,
condition, report, directive, Lien, violation, non-compliance or investigation
indicating or concerning any potential or actual liability (including, without
limitation, potential liability for enforcement, investigatory costs, cleanup
costs, government response costs, removal costs, remedial costs, natural
resources damages, property damages, personal injuries or penalties) arising in
connection with: (x) any non-compliance with or violation of the requirements of
any applicable Environmental Laws, or (y) the presence of any Hazardous
Substance on any Real Property (or any Real Property previously owned by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) or the release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Substance into the environment, (ii) has no threatened or actual
liability in connection with the presence of any Hazardous Substance on any Real
Property (or any Real Property previously owned by the Borrower) or the release
or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance into the environment, (iii) has
received notice of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any
remedial action is needed to respond to the presence of any Hazardous Substance

except that any notice, request or demand by the Borrower to or upon the Bank
pursuant to Sections 2.5 or 3.3 and any notice by either party of a change of
address shall not be effective until received. Any party to a Loan Document may
rely on signatures of the parties thereto which are transmitted by facsimile or
other electronic means as fully as if originally signed.

     10.3.  NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES

            No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of
the Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege under any Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege under any Loan Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges under the Loan Documents
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

     10.4.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

            (a)  All representations and warranties made under the Loan
Documents and in any document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant
thereto or in connection therewith shall survive the execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents.

            (b)  The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
(to the extent that such obligations under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 arose prior to
the termination of

                                      -37-
<Page>

the Revolving Credit Commitment and the payment of the Loans), 3.9 and 10.5
shall survive the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment and the payment
of the Loans and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents.

     10.5.  EXPENSES

            The Borrower agrees, promptly upon presentation of a statement or
invoice therefor, and whether or not any Loan is made or any Letter of Credit is
issued (i) to pay or reimburse the Bank for all its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the development, preparation and
execution of, the Loan Documents and any amendment, supplement or modification
thereto (whether or not executed or effective), any documents prepared in
connection therewith and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including without limitation the reasonable fees and disbursements of
Special Counsel, (ii) to pay or reimburse the Bank for the cost of all audits
undertaken from time to time with respect to any Collateral (provided that prior
to the occurrence of an Event of Default the Borrower shall not be obligated to
pay for the cost of audits undertaken more frequently than once per year), all
costs incurred by the Bank to perfect its Lien in the Collateral, and any costs
or expenses incurred by the Bank in protecting its interest in the Collateral,
(iii) to pay or reimburse the Bank for all of its costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of Special Counsel or any
other counsel, incurred in connection with (A) any Default or Event of Default
and any enforcement or collection proceedings resulting therefrom or in
connection with the negotiation of any restructuring or "work-out" (whether
consummated or not) of the obligations of the Borrower under any of the Loan
Documents and (B) the enforcement of this section, and (iv) to pay, indemnify
and hold the Bank and each of its officers, directors and employees harmless
from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, claims, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable
counsel fees and disbursements) with respect to the enforcement and performance
of the Loan Documents, the use of the proceeds of the Loans and the enforcement
and performance of the provisions of any subordination agreement involving the
Bank (all the foregoing in this clause (iv), collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
LIABILITIES") and, if and to the extent that the foregoing indemnity may be
unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower agrees to make the maximum payment
not prohibited under applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower shall
have no obligation to pay Indemnified Liabilities to the Bank arising from the
finally adjudicated gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Bank or claims
between one indemnified party and another indemnified party.

     10.6.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

            This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents to which the
Borrower is a party shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower and the Bank, all future holders of the Note and their respective
successors and assigns, provided, however, that such the Borrower may neither
delegate its liabilities and obligations, nor assign its rights and benefits,
under any Loan Document to any Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section, the Bank may at any time or from time to time assign
all or any portion of its rights

                                      -38-
<Page>

under the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, PROVIDED THAT any such
assignment shall not release such assignor from its obligations thereunder.

     10.7.  COUNTERPARTS

            Each Loan Document (other than the Note) may be executed by one or
more of the parties thereto on any number of separate counterparts and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
document. It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to
produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be
charged. A counterpart of any Loan Document and of any an amendment,
modification, consent or waiver to or of any Loan Document transmitted by
facsimile shall be deemed to be an originally executed counterpart.

     10.8.  SET-OFF

            In addition to any rights and remedies of the Bank provided by law,
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the
obligations owing in connection with the Loan Documents, or at any time upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Sections
9.1(a) or (b), the Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness,
whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to the Bank any amount owing from
the Bank to the Borrower, at, or at any time after, the happening of any of the
above-mentioned events. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the
aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by the Bank against the Borrower, or
against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for
the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment
creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the
Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession,
assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or
attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall
not have been exercised by the Bank prior to the making, filing or issuance, or
service upon the Bank of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a
receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. The Bank agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by
the Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

     10.9.  CONSTRUCTION

            Each party to a Loan Document represents that it has been
represented by counsel in connection with the Loan Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby and that the principle that agreements are to
be construed against the party drafting the same shall be inapplicable.

                                      -39-
<Page>

     10.10. GOVERNING LAW

            The Loan Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance
with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles
of conflict of laws, but including Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations
Law.

     10.11. HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE

            Section headings have been inserted in the Loan Documents for
convenience only and shall not be construed to be a part thereof.

     10.12. SEVERABILITY

            Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable,
and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

     10.13. INTEGRATION

            All exhibits to a Loan Document shall be deemed to be a part
thereof. Except for agreements between the Bank and the Borrower with respect to
certain fees, the Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding
between the Borrower and the Bank with respect to the subject matter thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Borrower and the
Bank with respect to the subject matter thereof.

     10.14. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

            The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
New York State or Federal court sitting in the City of New York over any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents. The
Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted or not
prohibited by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a
court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower hereby agrees that
a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court,
after all appropriate appeals, shall be conclusive and binding upon it.

     10.15. SERVICE OF PROCESS

            Each party to a Loan Document hereby irrevocably consents to the
service of process in any suit, action or proceeding by sending the same by
first class mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier service, to
the address of such party set forth in Section 10.2 or in the applicable Loan
Document executed by such party. Each party to a Loan Document hereby agrees
that any such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of

                                      -40-
<Page>

process upon it in any such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the
fullest extent enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal
service upon and personal delivery to it.

     10.16. NO LIMITATION ON SERVICE OR SUIT

            Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification, waiver, consent
or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Bank to serve process in any
manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Bank to bring proceedings
against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which
the Borrower may be served.

     10.17. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY

            EACH OF THE BANK AND THE BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN. FURTHER, THE BORROWER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE BANK, OR COUNSEL TO THE BANK, HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE BANK WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. THE
BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE BANK HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, INTER ALIA, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.

         [THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE HAS INTENTIONALLY BEEN LEFT BLANK.]
