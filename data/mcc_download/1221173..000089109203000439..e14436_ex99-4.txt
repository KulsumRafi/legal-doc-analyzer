      WHEREAS, Centre Capital Group, Inc. ("CCGI") acquired certain first lien,
fixed and adjustable rate, conventional mortgage loans on a servicing-retained
basis from the Servicer, which mortgage loans were either originated or acquired
by the Servicer.

      WHEREAS, such mortgage loans are currently being serviced by the Servicer
for CCGI pursuant to a Master Servicing Agreement for Fixed and Adjustable Rate
Mortgage Loans (the "Master Servicing Agreement"), dated as of June 19, 2001 and
annexed as Exhibit B hereto, by and between CCGI, as owner, and the Servicer, as
servicer.

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the Master Mortgage Loan Purchase and Warranties
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2002 (the "Master Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement"), and annexed as Exhibit C hereto, the Bank has purchased or received
from CCGI all of CCGI's right, title and interest in and to certain of the
mortgage loans currently serviced under the Master Servicing Agreement
(hereinafter, the "Mortgage Loans") and assumed for the benefit of the Servicer
and the obligations of CCGI as owner under such Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank has conveyed certain Mortgage Loans identified on
Exhibit F hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans") to Structured Asset Securities
Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO"), which in turn has
conveyed the Serviced Mortgage Loans to Citibank, N.A. (the "Trustee"), pursuant
to a trust agreement, dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Trust Agreement"),
among the Trustee, Aurora Loan Services Inc., as master servicer ("Aurora," and,
together with any successor Master Servicer appointed pursuant to the provisions
of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer") and SASCO.

      WHEREAS, the Bank desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the
rights of the Bank (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the
rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder at any time without cause in
accordance with Section 9.02 of the Master Servicing Agreement and to the other
conditions set forth herein.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the Master
Servicing Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced Mortgage Loans,
except to the extent otherwise provided herein and that this Agreement shall
constitute a Reconstitution Agreement (as such term is defined in the Master
Servicing Agreement) which shall govern the Serviced Mortgage Loans for so long
as such Serviced Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the
conditions specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of
the Servicer under this Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer intend that each of the Master Servicer
and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Bank and the Servicer hereby agree as
follows:

                                   AGREEMENT

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement,
including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement
incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are defined
in the Master Servicing Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Trust Agreement.

      2. Servicing. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the Serviced Mortgage
Loans, to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that
are to be performed and observed under the provisions of the Master Servicing
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and that
the provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement, as so modified, are and shall
be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full.

      3. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including any
successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the Master
Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the Servicer
services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the SASCO
2003-7H Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
shall have the same rights as the Bank, as owner, under the Master Servicing
Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the Master Servicing
Agreement and the term "Owner" as used in the Master Servicing Agreement in
connection with any rights of the Owner shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the
context requires, the Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the
Trust Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement upon the failure of the Servicer to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of
Default as provided in Section 9.01 of the Master Servicing Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master
Servicer assume any of the obligations of the Bank under the Master Servicing
Agreement; and in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

      4. Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer shall be
obligated or required to make any representations and warranties regarding the
characteristics of the

13.   The definition of "Qualified GIC" is hereby added to Article I to
      immediately follow the definition of "Qualified Depository", to read as
      follows:

            "Qualified GIC": A guaranteed investment contract or surety bond
            providing for the investment of funds in the Custodial Account and
            insuring a minimum, fixed or floating rate of return on investments
            of such funds, which contract or surety bond shall:

                  (a) be an obligation of an insurance company or other
            corporation whose long-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in
            one of its two highest rating categories or, if such insurance
            company has no long-term debt, whose claims paying ability is rated
            by each Rating Agency in one of its two highest rating categories,
            and whose short-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in its
            highest rating category;

                  (b) provide that the Servicer may exercise all of the rights
            under such contract or surety bond without the necessity of taking
            any action by any other Person;

                  (c) provide that if at any time the then current credit
            standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract is
            such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of funds
            would result in a downgrading of any rating of the Servicer, the
            Servicer shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
            entitled to the return of all funds previously invested thereunder,
            together with accrued interest thereon at the interest rate provided
            under such contract to the date of delivery of such funds to the
            Trustee;

                  (d) provide that the Servicer's interest therein shall be
            transferable to any successor servicer or the Master Servicer
            hereunder; and

                  (e) provide that the funds reinvested thereunder and accrued
            interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account, as the case
            may be, not later than the Business Day prior to any Determination
            Date.

14.   The definition of "Servicing Fee" in Article I is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            "Servicing Fee": An amount equal to one-twelfth the product of (a)
            the Servicing Fee Rate and (b) the outstanding principal balance of
            the Mortgage Loan. The Servicing Fee is payable solely from the
            interest portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from
            Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO
            Disposition Proceeds) of such Monthly Payment collected by the
            Servicer or as otherwise provided under this Agreement.

15.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.02 (Books and Records) of
      the Master Servicing Agreement shall be modified to indicate that the
      Servicer shall prepare and execute at the direction of the Bank any note
      endorsements in connection with transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the
      Trust Fund as the Owner of the Mortgage Loans and that the


                                       5
<PAGE>

      Bank shall pay for any fees associated with the preparation and execution
      of such note endorsements to the Trust Fund.

16.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.03 (Commencement of
      Servicing Responsibilities) shall be inapplicable to this Agreement.

17.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.04 (Custodial Agreement)
      shall be inapplicable to this Agreement, as superseded by the provisions
      of the Custodial Agreement and the Trust Agreement.

18.   Section 3.01 (Servicer to Service) is hereby amended and restated in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            Section 3.01 Servicer to Act as Servicer.

                  From the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loans to
            the related Closing Date, the Servicer shall have serviced the
            related Mortgage Loans in accordance with Accepted Servicing
            Practices. From and after the related Closing Date, the Servicer, as
            an independent contractor, shall service and administer the Mortgage
            Loans pursuant to this Agreement and shall have full power and
            authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with
            such servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem
            necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement
            and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may
            waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to
            the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any
            manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Servicer's
            reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
            postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Owner,
            provided, however, that (unless the Mortgagor is in default with
            respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of
            the Servicer, imminent and the Servicer has obtained the prior
            written consent of the Owner) the Servicer shall not permit any
            modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the
            Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of principal or
            interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance
            (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final
            maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. With respect to a
            Reconstitution Agreement, in the event of any such modification
            which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments on any
            Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day immediately
            preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
            principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the
            Custodial Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section
            3.04, the difference between (a) such month's principal and one
            month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid
            principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by
            the Mortgagor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Servicer shall


                                       6
<PAGE>

            continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and
            deliver on behalf of itself and the Owner, all instruments of
            satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release,
            discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the
            Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If
            reasonably required by the Servicer, the Owner shall furnish the
            Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents necessary
            or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
            administrative duties under this Agreement.

                  Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
            consolidation or extension of any Mortgage loan, the Servicer shall
            forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing
            such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
            Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any modification,
            waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would
            cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to fail to qualify
            as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under Section
            860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
            Servicer shall employ procedures (including collection procedures)
            and exercise the same care that it customarily employs and exercises
            in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account,
            giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices where such
            practices do not conflict with the requirements of this Agreement,
            and the Owner's reliance on the Servicer.

                  Absent written consultation and approval by the Owner, as
            specified in this Section 3.01, the Servicer may take actions
            relative to the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans
            that are consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices.

19.   The parties hereto acknowledge that references to the "Owner" in the
      second and third paragraphs of Section 3.02 shall refer to the Master
      Servicer, except that the expense of any environmental inspection or
      review at the request of the Master Servicer shall be an expense of the
      Trust Fund.

20.   The parties hereto acknowledge that the (i) the phrase "Commercial Federal
      Mortgage Corporation in trust for Centre Capital Group, Inc., owner of
      Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, and various Mortgagors" in the
      fourth and fifth lines of the first paragraph of Section 3.04 shall be
      revised to read "Commercial Federal Mortgage Corporation in trust for the
      SASCO 2003-7H Trust Fund" and (ii) reference to "Cut-off Date" in the
      second paragraph of Section 3.04 shall mean the "close of business on
      February 1, 2002."

21.   Section 3.06 (Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account) is hereby
      amended by changing the phrase "Commercial Federal Mortgage Corporation in
      trust for Centre Capital Group, Inc., owner of Fixed and Adjustable Rate
      Mortgage Loans, and various Mortgagors" appearing in the fourth, fifth and
      sixth lines of the first paragraph thereof to


                                       7
<PAGE>

      "Commercial Federal Mortgage Corporation in trust for the SASCO 2003-7H
      Trust Fund."

22.   Section 3.18 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is hereby
      amended by (i) replacing the reference to "one year" in the seventh line
      of the second paragraph thereof with "three years" and (ii) adding two new
      paragraphs after the second paragraph thereof to read as follows:

            In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property in
      connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan, the
      Servicer shall dispose of such REO Property not later than the end of the
      third taxable year after the year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund
      unless the Servicer has applied for and received a grant of extension from
      the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that, under the REMIC
      Provisions and any relevant proposed legislation and under applicable
      state law, the applicable Trust REMIC may hold REO Property for a longer
      period without adversely affecting the REMIC status of such REMIC or
      causing the imposition of a federal or state tax upon such REMIC. If the
      Servicer has received such an extension, then the Servicer shall continue
      to attempt to sell the REO Property for its fair market value for such
      period longer than three years as such extension permits (the "Extended
      Period"). If the Servicer has not received such an extension and the
      Servicer is unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending 3
      months before the end of such third taxable year after its acquisition by
      the Trust Fund or if the Servicer has received such an extension, and the
      Servicer is unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending three
      months before the close of the Extended Period, the Servicer shall, before
      the end of the three year period or the Extended Period, as applicable,
      (i) purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the REO Property's fair
      market value or (ii) auction the REO Property to the highest bidder (which
      may be the Servicer) in an auction reasonably designed to produce a fair
      price prior to the expiration of the three-year period or the Extended
      Period, as the case may be. The Trustee shall sign any document or take
      any other action reasonably requested by the Servicer which would enable
      the Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to request such grant of
      extension.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO
      Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to
      continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust Fund
      in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i) cause such REO
      Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning
      of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii) subject any Trust REMIC to the
      imposition of any federal income taxes on the income earned from such REO
      Property, including any taxes imposed by reason of Sections 860F or
      860G(c) of the Code, unless the Servicer has agreed to indemnify and hold
      harmless the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

      (iii) deleting the first sentence of the third paragraph thereof, and (iv)
      replacing the words "one and a half" and "sentence" with "three" and
      "paragraph", respectively, in the sixth and seventh lines of the third
      paragraph thereto; and,

            (v) by adding the following to the end of such Section:


                                       8
<PAGE>

            Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any REO
      Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of such offer in
      writing which notification shall set forth all material terms of said
      offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer shall be deemed to
      have approved the sale of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer
      notifies the Servicer in writing, within five (5) days after its receipt
      of the related Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the related sale, in
      which case the Servicer shall not proceed with such sale.

23.   Section 4.02 (Statements to Owner) is hereby amended in its entirety to
      read as follows:

            4.02 Statements to the Master Servicer.

                  (a) Not later than the tenth calendar day of each month or, if
            such calendar day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding
            Business Day, the Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer: (i)
            a monthly remittance advice in the format set forth in Exhibit D-1
            hereto and a monthly defaulted loan report in the format set forth
            in Exhibit D-2 hereto (or in such other format mutually agreed upon
            by the Interim Servicer and Master Servicer) (collectively, the
            "Monthly Remittance Advice") as to the accompanying remittance and
            the period ending on the last calendar day of the preceding month
            and (ii) all such information required pursuant to clause (i) above
            on a magnetic tape or other similar media reasonably accepted by the
            Master Servicer.

                  (b) Beginning with calendar year 2004, the Servicer shall
            prepare and file any and all tax returns, information statements or
            other filings for the portion of the tax year 2003 and the portion
            of subsequent tax years for which the Servicer has serviced some or
            all of the Mortgage Loans hereunder as such returns, information
            statements or other filings are required to be delivered to any
            governmental taxing authority or to the Master Servicer pursuant to
            any applicable law with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the
            transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Servicer shall
            provide the Master Servicer with such information concerning the
            Mortgage Loans as is necessary for the Master Servicer to prepare
            the Trust Fund's federal income tax return as the Master Servicer
            may reasonably request from time to time.

                  (c) The Monthly Remittance Advice shall also include on a
            current and cumulative basis the amount of any (i) claims filed,
            (ii) claim payments made, (iii) claims denied and (iv) policies
            cancelled with respect to those Serviced Mortgage Loans covered by
            any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy.

24.   Section 4.03 (Monthly Advances by Servicer) is hereby amended by adding
      the following new sentence immediately following the first sentence of
      such section:

                  Any amounts held for future distribution and so used to make
            Monthly Advances shall be replaced by the Servicer by deposit in the
            Custodial Account on or before any future Remittance Date if funds
            in the Custodial Account on


                                       9
<PAGE>

            such Remittance Date shall be less than payments to the Trust Fund
            required to be made on such Remittance Date.

25.   Section 5.01 (Servicing Compensation) is hereby amended by adding the
      following sentences at the end of such Section:

                  The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by
            it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall
            not be entitled to reimbursement thereof except as specifically
            provided for herein.

26.   Section 5.06 (Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report) is
      hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

            Section 5.06 Annual Audit Report.

                  On or before the last day of February of each year, beginning
            with February 28, 2004, the Servicer shall, at its own expense,
            cause a firm of independent public accountants (who may also render
            other services to Servicer), which is a member of the American
            Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to furnish to the Seller
            and Master Servicer (i) year-end audited (if available) financial
            statements of the Servicer and (ii) a statement to the effect that
            such firm has examined certain documents and records for the
            preceding fiscal year (or during the period from the date of
            commencement of such Servicer's duties hereunder until the end of
            such preceding fiscal year in the case of the first such
            certificate) and that, on the basis of such examination conducted
            substantially in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
            Program for Mortgage Bankers, such firm is of the opinion that
            Servicer's overall servicing operations have been conducted in
            compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
            Bankers except for such exceptions that, in the opinion of such
            firm, the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers
            requires it to report, in which case such exceptions shall be set
            forth in such statement.


27.   A new Section 5.07 is hereby added to the Master Servicing Agreement to
      read as follows:

            Section 5.07 Annual Officer's Certificate.

            On or before the last day of February of each year, beginning with
            February 28, 2004, the Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to
            the Bank and the Master Servicer a Servicing Officer's certificate
            stating, as to each signer thereof, that (i) a review of the
            activities of the Servicer during such preceding fiscal year and of
            performance under this Agreement has been made under such officers'
            supervision, and (ii) to the best of such officers' knowledge, based
            on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under
            this Agreement for such year, or, if there has been a default in the
            fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each such default
            known to such officer and the nature and status thereof including
            the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default.

28.   A new Section 5.08 is hereby added to the Master Servicing Agreement to
      read as follows:

            Section 5.08 SEC Certification.

            (a) By February 28th of each year (or if not a Business Day, the
      immediately preceding Business Day), or in connection with any additional
      such certifications directly filed by the Depositor upon thirty (30) days
      written request, an officer of the Servicer shall execute and deliver an
      Officer's Certificate in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto, signed by
      the senior officer in charge of servicing of the Servicer or any officer
      to whom that officer reports, to the Master Servicer and the Depositor for
      the benefit of such Master Servicer and such Depositor and their
      respective officers, directors and affiliates, certifying as to the
      following matters:

                  (1) I have reviewed the information required to be delivered
            to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Agreement (the "Servicing
            Information").

                  (2) Based on my knowledge, the information relating to the
            Mortgage Loans submitted by the Servicer in its monthly reporting
            packages delivered to the Master Servicer which is contained in the
            reports on Form 8-K and the annual report on Form 10-K with respect
            to the Transaction, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading as of the date
            of this certification;

                  (3) Based on my knowledge, the Servicing Information required
            to be provided to the Master Servicer by the Servicer under this
            Agreement has been provided to the Master Servicer;

                  (4) I am responsible for reviewing the activities performed by
            the Servicer under this Agreement and based upon the review required
            hereunder, and except as disclosed in the Annual Statement of
            Compliance, the Annual Independent Certified Public Accountant's
            Servicing Report and all servicing reports, officer's certificates
            and other information relating to the servicing of the Mortgage
            Loans submitted to the Master Servicer, the Servicer has, as of this
            certification fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement; and

                  (5) I have disclosed to the Master Servicer and the Depositor
            all significant deficiencies relating to the Servicer's compliance
            with the minimum servicing standards in accordance with a review
            conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program
            for Mortgage Bankers or similar standard as set forth in this
            Agreement.

            (b) The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master
      Servicer and the Depositor and their respective officers, directors,
      agents and affiliates from and against any losses, damages, penalties,
      fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments and
      other costs and expenses arising out of or based upon a breach by


                                       11
<PAGE>

      the Servicer or any of its officers, directors, agents or affiliates of
      its obligations under this Section 5.07 any material misstatement or
      omission in the Officer's Certificate required under this Section or the
      negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Servicer in connection
      therewith. If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or
      insufficient to hold harmless the Master Servicer and the Depositor, then
      the Servicer agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
      by the Master Servicer and the Depositor as a result of the losses,
      claims, damages or liabilities of the Master Servicer and the Depositor in
      such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
      Master Servicer and the Depositor on the one hand and the Servicer on the
      other in connection with a breach of the Servicer's obligations under this
      Section 5.07, any material misstatement or omission in the Officer's
      Certificate required under this Section or the Servicer's negligence, bad
      faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith.

29.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 6.03 (Representations and
      Warranties of the Owner), Section 6.04 (Remedies for Breach of
      Representations and Warranties of the Owner), Section 7.01 (Removal of
      Mortgage Loans from Inclusion Under this Agreement Upon a Pass-Through
      Transfer or a Whole Loan Transfer on One or More Reconstitution Dates) and
      Section 7.02 (Owner's Repurchase and Indemnification Obligations) are
      inapplicable to this Agreement.

30.   Section 7.03 (Indemnification; Third Party Claims) is hereby amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Trust Fund, the Trustee and
            the Master Servicer and hold each of them harmless against any and
            all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
            reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments,
            and any other costs, fees and expenses that any of such parties may
            sustain in any way related to the failure of the Servicer to perform
            its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with
            the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer immediately shall notify
            the Bank, the Master Servicer and the Trustee if a claim is made by
            a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans,
            assume (with the prior written consent of the indemnified party) the
            defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
            therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
            satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or
            any of such parties in respect of such claim. The Trustee from the
            assets of the Trust Fund promptly shall reimburse the Servicer for
            all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding sentence except
            when the claim is in any way related to the Servicer's
            indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the
            Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer shall
            follow any written instructions received from the Trustee in
            connection with such claim.

                  The Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold it
            harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
            fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
            costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and


                                       12
<PAGE>

            expenses that the Servicer may sustain in any way related to the
            failure of the Trustee or the Master Servicer to perform its duties
            in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  In the event a dispute arises between an indemnified party and
            the Servicer with respect to any of the rights and obligations of
            the parties pursuant to this Agreement and such dispute is
            adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any other
            judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify and
            reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs
            and expenses related to the adjudication of said dispute.

31.   Section 8.02 is hereby amended by changing the word "Owner" to "Trustee"
      where it appears in the proviso to the third sentence thereof and the word
      "Owner" to "Trust Fund" in the fourth sentence of such Section.

32.   The first paragraph of Section 8.03 (Limitation on Resignation and
      Assignment by Servicer) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
      follows:

                  The Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the
            servicing hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or
            any portion hereof (to other than a third party in the case of
            outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes, insurance and property
            inspection, in which case the Servicer shall fully liable for such
            tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself) or sell or otherwise
            dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets
            without the prior written consent of the Trustee and the Master
            Servicer, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the
            reasonable discretion of such parties, provided, however, that the
            Servicer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without
            prior written consent of the Trustee and the Master Servicer to any
            entity that is directly owned or controlled by the Servicer, and the
            Servicer guarantees the performance of such entity hereunder. In the
            event of such assignment by the Servicer, the Servicer shall provide
            the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a written statement
            guaranteeing the successor entity's performance of the Servicer's
            obligations under the Agreement.

      References to "Owner" in the second and third paragraph of Section 8.03
shall refer to the "Master Servicer acting at the direction, or with the prior
consent of, the Trustee".

33.   Section 9.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended in its entirety
      to read as follows:

            Section 9.02 Termination Without Cause.

            This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
      distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last
      Mortgage Loan to the Owner (or advances by the Servicer for the same), and
      (b) the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the
      last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii)
      mutual consent of the Servicer, the Bank and the Master Servicer in
      writing or (iii) at the sole option of the Bank, without


                                       13
<PAGE>

      cause, upon 30 days written notice. Any such notice of termination shall
      be in writing and delivered to the Servicer by registered mail to the
      address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Master Servicer,
      the Trustee and the Servicer shall comply with the termination procedures
      set forth in Section 10.03 hereof and the procedures set forth below,
      provided that, in the event the Bank terminates this Agreement without
      cause in accordance with subclause (iii) above, the Bank shall pay the
      Servicer a termination fee equal to 2.0% of the aggregate unpaid balance
      of the Mortgage Loans as of such termination date.

            In connection with any such termination referred to in clause (ii)
      or (iii) above, the Bank will be responsible for reimbursing the Servicer
      for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances within 15 Business
      Days following the date of termination and other reasonable and necessary
      out-of-pocket costs associated with any transfer of servicing.

            Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that
      (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of 90 days or more (a
      "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage Loan becomes an REO
      Property, the Bank may at its election terminate this Agreement (a) with
      respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or (b) REO Property, in each
      case, upon 15 days' written notice to the Servicer. In the event of such
      election, the Bank shall reimburse the Servicer for all unreimbursed
      out-of-pocket Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances on the date of
      termination and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs
      associated with any transfer of servicing, including, but not limited to,
      costs associated with the transfer of the related files to the Owner's
      designee.

34.   Section 10.01 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
      responsibilities and duties under this Agreement (a) pursuant to Sections
      6.02, 7.03, 8.03, 9.01 or 9.02, the Master Servicer shall, in accordance
      with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed to and assume all
      of the Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under
      this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor servicer meeting the
      eligibility requirements of this Agreement set forth in Sections 9.01(i)
      and (ii) and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the
      responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under this
      Agreement with the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties
      and liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer that
      is not at that time a servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund
      shall be subject to the approval of the Master Servicer, the Bank, the
      Trustee and each Rating Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust
      Agreement). Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of
      other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency must deliver
      to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such transfer of servicing will
      not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current
      rating of any of the Certificates. In connection with such appointment and
      assumption, the Master


                                       14
<PAGE>

      Servicer or the Depositor, as applicable, may make such arrangements for
      the compensation of such successor out of payments on the Mortgage Loans
      as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such
      compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Servicer under this
      Agreement. In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and
      liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
      aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
      responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of
      such termination until the effective date thereof with the same degree of
      diligence and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this
      Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might impair or
      prejudice the rights or financial condition of its successor. The
      resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned
      sections shall not become effective until a successor shall be appointed
      pursuant to this Section 10.01 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer
      of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Section 6.01 and
      the remedies available to the Trustee under Sections 6.02 and 7.03, it
      being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01,
      6.02 and 7.03 shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
      resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this
      Agreement.

            Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 30
      days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall prepare,
      execute and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and
      other instruments, place in such successor's possession all Servicing
      Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or
      appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination. The
      Servicer shall cooperate with the Trustee and the Master Servicer, as
      applicable, and such successor in effecting the termination of the
      Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder and the transfer of
      servicing responsibilities to the successor servicer, including without
      limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration by it of all
      cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to the
      Custodial Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter received with
      respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
      acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the Master
      Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
      successor shall make the representations and warranties set forth in
      Section 6.01 and (ii) an assumption of the due and punctual performance
      and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed and observed
      by the Servicer under this Agreement, whereupon such successor shall
      become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities,
      obligations and liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if
      originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or
      resignation of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
      Sections 10.01 shall not affect any claims that the Master Servicer or the
      Trustee may have against the Servicer arising out of the Servicer's
      actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or resignation.

            The Servicer shall deliver (i) within three (3) Business Days to the


                                       15
<PAGE>

      successor servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account
      and (ii) within 30 Business Days all Mortgage Loan Documents and related
      documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall
      account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and
      do such other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and
      definitively vest in the successor all such rights, powers, duties,
      responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer.

            Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the Servicer
      shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such appointment in
      accordance with the notice procedures set forth herein.

            Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable costs
      and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of servicing
      hereunder as a result of a termination of the Servicer for cause pursuant
      to Section 9.01 of the Agreement, including, without limitation, the costs
      and expenses of the Master Servicer or any other Person in appointing a
      successor servicer, or of the Master Servicer in assuming the
      responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder, or of transferring the
      Servicing Files and the other necessary data to the successor servicer
      shall be paid by the terminated, removed or resigning servicer from its
      own funds without reimbursement.

35.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 10.02 (Closing), Section 10.03
      (Closing Documents), Section 10.07 (Notices) and Section 10.16 (Exhibits)
      are inapplicable to this Agreement.

36.   A new Section 10.19 is hereby added to the Master Servicing Agreement to
      read as follows:

            Intended Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding any provision
            herein to the contrary, the parties to this Agreement agree that it
            is appropriate, in furtherance of the intent of such parties as set
            forth herein, that the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the
            benefit of the provisions of this Agreement as intended third party
            beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
            The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Master Servicer
            and the Trustee as if they were parties to this Agreement, and the
            Master Servicer and the Trustee shall have the same rights and
            remedies to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if they were
            parties to this Agreement. The Servicer shall only take direction
            from the Master Servicer (if direction by the Master Servicer is
            required under this Agreement) unless otherwise directed by this
            Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights and obligations
            of the Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder (other than the
            right to indemnification) shall terminate upon termination of the
            Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust
            Agreement.
