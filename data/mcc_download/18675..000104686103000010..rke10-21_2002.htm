<P ALIGN="CENTER">SEVERANCE AGREEMENT</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Severance Agreement is made, effective as of ________________________, by and between RGS Energy Group, Inc. (RGS) and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation (RG&amp;E), both New York corporations having their principal place of business in Rochester, New York (collectively the "Company"), and _________________________, an individual currently residing in ________________, New York (the "Employee").  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposes.</B>   The Company's Boards of Directors (the "Board") consider the creation and retention of a sound and vital management team to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company, its customers and its shareowners.  In this connection, the Company recognizes that if the possibility of a Change of Control arises, the uncertainty and discomfort it may raise could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel during the period leading up to and during a possible Change of Control to the detriment of the Company, its customers and its shareowners.  Furthermore, in addition to their regular duties management will be called upon during this period to assist in the assessment of third party proposals, to advise the Board as to whether such proposals would be in the best interests of the Company, its customers and its shareowners and to take such other action as the Board may determine appropriate.  Accordingly, to assure the Company that it will have the continued dedication of the Employee and the availability of his advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a bid to take over control of the Company, and to induce the Employee to remain in the employ of the Company, the Board has determined that it is in the Company 's best interests to provide the Employee with certain benefits in the event of the Employee's termination of employment under the terms and conditions below. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee's Services During Attempted or Actual Change of Control.</B>   In the event a third party takes any steps designed to effect a Change of Control, the Employee agrees not to effect a Voluntary Termination, and to render the services contemplated in paragraph 1, until the third party has abandoned or terminated efforts to effect a Change of Control or until three months after an actual Change of Control has occurred.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of Severance Amount</B>.  In the event of an Involuntary Termination of the Employee's employment by the Company or any subsidiary or successor of the Company occurring within three years after a Change of Control, then the Company shall pay the Employee a lump sum amount equal to the Severance Amount, payable within 15 business days after the Termination Date, plus such other benefits as may be provided in subsequent provisions of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</B>.  All the terms defined in this paragraph&nbsp;4 shall have the meanings given below throughout this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)<B>&#9;"Annual Salary"</B> shall, as determined on the Termination Date, be equal to the greater of:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not result from a resignation by the Employee (other than a resignation pursuant to clause&nbsp;ii of this subparagraph&nbsp;(d)), or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results from a resignation following any Change in Duties; provided, however, the term "Involuntary Termination" shall not include:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Termination for Cause, or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an Involuntary Termination;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Termination for Cause; or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the result of death, disability, or normal retirement pursuant to a retirement plan to which the Employee was subject prior to any Change of Control.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Payment for Excise Tax on Golden Parachute Payment</B>.    It is anticipated that the payments to be made and benefits to be provided to the Employee under this Agreement and other agreements (collectively, the "Change of Control Amounts") may become subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed), on account of "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code.  In the event such excise tax is payable, the Company shall pay to the Employee, in addition to the amounts payable pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Agreement and any other Change of Control Amounts, an additional amount which, together with any federal, state or local excise or income taxes payable by the Employee on such additional amount, will provide the Employee with a sum on a net after-tax basis equal to the amounts he would have received if the excise tax were not applicable to the Change of Control Amounts.  The determination of the amount to be paid hereunder shall be made at the expense of the Company by the independent certified public accounting firm acting as auditors for the Company on the date of a Change of Control (or another accounting firm designated by that firm).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Benefits</B>.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  <U>Health and Death Benefits</U>.  From the date benefits become payable under paragraph 3 through the end of the number of months used in determining the Employee's Severance Amount in paragraph 4(e), the Company shall continue to provide the Employee with life, accident, death and health insurance plans and benefits to the same extent such benefits are provided during this period to active employees holding positions equivalent to the position of the Employee immediately prior to his termination.  The Company's share of the cost of providing such benefits shall be the same as its share of the benefit costs for providing such benefits to other employees holding positions equivalent to the position the Employee held immediately prior to his termination.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  <U>Outplacement and Relocation</U>. The Company shall also reimburse the Employee the aggregate expenses the Employee incurs for outplacement assistance or relocation expenses in order to pursue other business opportunities within two (2) years of the Termination Date which are not reimbursed by another employer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  <U>Pension</U>.  To the extent that any Company supplemental executive retirement plan benefit formula(s) takes into account service, age and annual compensation, the Employee shall be given credit under the formula(s) for (i) the same number of months used in determining the Employee's Severance Amount in paragraph 4(e), and (ii) annual compensation increases equal to the highest base salary increases received by the Employee in the three years prior to the Termination Date and bonus payouts at target.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  <U>Benefits of General Applicability</U>.  The Employee shall remain eligible to receive other Company benefits that apply by their terms to persons who terminate employment with RGS.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Incentive Compensation</U>.  Any awards previously made shall vest on the Termination Date and be computed and paid notwithstanding any contrary plan provisions provided that, if the plan providing for any such award stipulates an earlier date for vesting, such provision shall control.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Fees</B>.  The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses the Employee may incur as a result of any litigation brought to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement, regardless of outcome.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obligations of Employee</B>.   Employee agrees that upon termination of employment he will turn over to the Company all materials and documents, whether written or electronic, that pertain to the operation, products, services, processes, plans, business or customers of the Company.  Employee also agrees not to disclose to any person any confidential information of the Company.  If the Employee fails to return materials required to be returned or discloses confidential information of the Company to any person, all payments and benefits still remaining to be paid or offered to the Employee under this Agreement shall be forfeited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices</B>.  Notices and all other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when personally delivered or when mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:</P>
