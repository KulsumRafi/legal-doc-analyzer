certificates  (collectively,  the  "Certificates"),  to be issued  hereunder  in
multiple  classes,  which in the aggregate  will evidence the entire  beneficial

Administrator  will make an  election  to treat the  entire  segregated  pool of
assets  described in the definition of Trust Fund, and subject to this Agreement
(including the Mortgage Loans but excluding  Reserve Fund I, Reserve Fund II and
the  Initial  Monthly  Payment  Fund),  as two real estate  mortgage  investment
conduits (each, a "REMIC") for federal income tax purposes.

        The terms and provisions of the Standard  Terms are hereby  incorporated
by reference herein as though set forth in full herein. If any term or provision
contained  herein shall  conflict  with or be  inconsistent  with any  provision
contained  in the  Standard  Terms,  the terms  and  provisions  of this  Series
Supplement  shall govern.  All  capitalized  terms not otherwise  defined herein
shall  have the  meanings  set forth in the  Standard  Terms.  The  Pooling  and

          Percentages of the Maturing Class or Classes pursuant to clause (a) of

          allocated  among  the  Non-Maturing  Classes  in  proportion  to their
          respective  Recalculated  Percentages  (the portion of such  aggregate


                                       12
<PAGE>

          reduction so  allocated to any  Non-Maturing  Class,  the  "Adjustment
          Percentage");  and (d) for  purposes of such  Distribution  Date,  the
          Prepayment Distribution Percentage of each Non-Maturing Class shall be
          equal  to the  sum  of  (1)  the  Prepayment  Distribution  Percentage
          thereof,  calculated  in accordance  with the  provisions in paragraph
          (ii) above as if the  Certificate  Principal  Balance of each Maturing

anniversary.

        The Special Hazard Amount may be further  reduced by the Master Servicer
(including  accelerating the manner in which coverage is reduced)  provided that
prior to any such  reduction,  the  Master  Servicer  shall (i)  obtain  written
confirmation  from each Rating Agency that such  reduction  shall not reduce the
rating  assigned to any Class of  Certificates  by such Rating  Agency  (without

the product of (x) the related  Subordinate  Class Percentage for such Class and

the Certificate Principal Balance of each Class of Subordinate Certificates then
outstanding,    of   the    principal    collections    described   in   Section
4.02(a)(ii)(Y)(B)(b)   (without   giving   effect  to  the  Senior   Accelerated
Distribution  Percentage)  to the  extent  such  collections  are not  otherwise
distributed  to the Senior  Certificates;  (iii) the  product of (x) the related
Prepayment  Distribution  Percentage  and (y)  the  aggregate  of all  Principal
Prepayments in Full received in the related  Prepayment  Period and Curtailments

a Discount Mortgage Loan) to the extent not payable to the Senior  Certificates;
(iv) if such Class is the Class of  Subordinate  Certificates  with the  Highest
Priority,  any Excess  Subordinate  Principal Amount for such Distribution Date;
and (v) any amounts  described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) as determined  for
any previous  Distribution  Date, that remain  undistributed  to the extent that
such amounts are not  attributable  to Realized Losses which have been allocated
to a Class of  Subordinate  Certificates  minus (b) with respect to the Class of
Subordinate  Certificates  with the  Lowest  Priority,  any  Excess  Subordinate
Principal  Amount  for  such  Distribution  Date;  provided,  however,  that the
Subordinate   Principal   Distribution  Amount  for  any  Class  of  Subordinate
Certificates on any  Distribution  Date shall in no event exceed the outstanding
Certificate Principal Balance of such Class of Certificates immediately prior to
such date.

Section 1.02.  Use of Words and Phrases.

        "Herein," "hereby," "hereunder," "hereof," "hereinbefore," "hereinafter"
and other  equivalent  words refer to the Pooling and  Servicing  Agreement as a
whole. All references herein to Articles, Sections or Subsections shall mean the
corresponding  Articles,  Sections and  Subsections in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.  The  definitions  set forth herein include both the singular and the
plural.

        Section 1.03. Determination of LIBOR.

        LIBOR  applicable to the  calculation of the  Pass-Through  Rates on the
Floater Certificates and Inverse Floater Certificates,  if any, for any Interest
Accrual  Period  (other  than  the  initial  Interest  Accrual  Period)  will be
determined as described below:

        On each  Distribution  Date,  LIBOR shall be  established by the Trustee
and, as to any Interest Accrual Period, will equal the rate for one month United
States  dollar  deposits  that appears on the  Telerate  Screen Page 3750 of the
Moneyline  Telerate Capital Markets Report as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the
second LIBOR Business Day prior to the first day of such Interest Accrual Period
("LIBOR Rate Adjustment  Date").  "Telerate  Screen Page 3750" means the display
designated  as page 3750 on the  Telerate  Service  (or such  other  page as may
replace page 3750 on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank
offered  rates of major  banks).  If such rate does not  appear on such page (or
such other page as may replace that page on that service,  or if such service is
no longer offered, any other service for displaying LIBOR or comparable rates as
may be selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Master Servicer), the
rate  will be the  Reference  Bank  Rate.  The  "Reference  Bank  Rate"  will be
determined  on the  basis of the rates at which  deposits  in U.S.  Dollars  are
offered by the  reference  banks  (which shall be any three major banks that are
engaged in transactions in the London interbank market,  selected by the Trustee
after  consultation  with the Master Servicer) as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on


                                       19
<PAGE>

the day  that is one  LIBOR  Business  Day  prior to the  immediately  preceding
Distribution  Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for a period of
one month in amounts  approximately equal to the aggregate Certificate Principal
Balance of the Adjustable Rate Certificates  then outstanding.  The Trustee will
request the principal  London office of each of the reference banks to provide a
quotation of its rate. If at least two such  quotations  are provided,  the rate
will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations rounded up to the next multiple of
1/16%. If on such date fewer than two quotations are provided as requested,  the
rate will be the arithmetic  mean of the rates quoted by one or more major banks
in New York City,  selected by the Trustee  after  consultation  with the Master
Servicer,  as of 11:00 a.m.,  New York City time, on such date for loans in U.S.
Dollars  to  leading  European  banks  for a  period  of one  month  in  amounts
approximately  equal  to the  aggregate  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the
Adjustable  Rate  Certificates  then  outstanding.  If no such quotations can be
obtained,  the rate will be LIBOR for the prior  Distribution  Date,  or, in the
case of the first LIBOR Rate Adjustment Date, 1.42%; provided however, if, under
the priorities  described above, LIBOR for a Distribution Date would be based on
LIBOR for the previous Distribution Date for the third consecutive  Distribution
Date, the Trustee shall, after consultation with the Master Servicer,  select an
alternative  comparable index (over which the Trustee has no control),  used for
determining  one-month Eurodollar lending rates that is calculated and published
(or otherwise made  available) by an  independent  party.  "LIBOR  Business Day"
means  any day  other  than (i) a  Saturday  or a Sunday  or (ii) a day on which
banking  institutions in the city of London,  England are required or authorized
by law to be closed.

        The  establishment  of LIBOR by the Trustee on any LIBOR Rate Adjustment
Date and the Master Servicer's subsequent  calculation of the Pass-Through Rates
applicable to each of the Floater  Certificates and Inverse Floater Certificates
for the relevant Interest Accrual Period, in the absence of manifest error, will
be final and binding.

        Promptly  following  each LIBOR Rate  Adjustment  Date the Trustee shall
supply the Master  Servicer  with the results of its  determination  of LIBOR on
such date.  Furthermore,  the Trustee will supply the Pass-Through Rates on each
of the Floater Certificates and Inverse Floater Certificates for the current and
the immediately  preceding  Interest  Accrual Period via the Trustee's  internet
website, which may be obtained by telephoning the Trustee at (800) 735-7777.

          Standard Terms)

     Section 2.02.  Acceptance  by Trustee.  (See  Section  2.02 of the Standard

          Servicer and the Company.

(a)     For  representations,  warranties and covenants of the Master  Servicer,
        see Section 2.03(a) of the Standard Terms.

(b)     The  Company  hereby  represents  and  warrants  to the  Trustee for the
        benefit  of  Certificateholders  that as of the  Closing  Date  (or,  if
        otherwise specified below, as of the date so specified):

(i)     No Mortgage  Loan is 30 or more days  Delinquent in payment of principal
        and  interest  as of the Cut-off  Date and no Mortgage  Loan has been so
        Delinquent  more than once in the  12-month  period prior to the Cut-off
        Date;

(ii)    The  information  set forth in Exhibit One hereto  with  respect to each
        Mortgage  Loan or the  Mortgage  Loans,  as the case may be, is true and
        correct in all material  respects at the date or dates  respecting which
        such information is furnished;

(iii)   The Mortgage Loans are fully-amortizing,  fixed-rate mortgage loans with
        level  Monthly  Payments due, with respect to a majority of the Mortgage
        Loans,  on the  first  day of  each  month  and  terms  to  maturity  at
        origination or modification of not more than 30 years;

(iv) To the  best of the  Company's  knowledge,  except  with  respect  to eight
     Mortgage Loans representing  approximately 0.2% of the principal balance of
     the  Mortgage  Loans at  origination,  if a  Mortgage  Loan is secured by a
     Mortgaged  Property with a Loan-to-Value  Ratio at origination in excess of
     80%, such Mortgage Loan is the subject of a Primary  Insurance  Policy that
     insures (a) at least 35% of the Stated  Principal  Balance of the  Mortgage
     Loan at  origination  if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio is between  100.00%  and
     95.01%,  (b) at least 30% of the Stated  Principal  Balance of the Mortgage
     Loan at  origination  if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio is  between  95.00%  and
     90.01%,  (c) at least 25% of such  balance  if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio is
     between  90.00%  and  85.01%  and (d) at least 12% of such  balance  if the
     Loan-to-Value  Ratio  is  between  85.00%  and  80.01%.  To the best of the
     Company's  knowledge,  each such Primary  Insurance Policy is in full force
     and effect and the Trustee is entitled to the benefits thereunder;

(v)  The issuers of the Primary Insurance Policies are insurance companies whose
     claims-paying abilities are currently acceptable to each Rating Agency;

                                       21
<PAGE>

(vi)    No more than 0.5% of the Mortgage  Loans by aggregate  Stated  Principal
        Balance  as of the  Cut-off  Date are  secured by  Mortgaged  Properties
        located in any one zip code area in California  and no more than 0.4% of
        the  Mortgage  Loans by  aggregate  Stated  Principal  Balance as of the
        Cut-off Date are secured by Mortgaged  Properties located in any one zip
        code area outside California;

(vii)   The improvements upon the Mortgaged  Properties are insured against loss
        by fire and other  hazards as required by the Program  Guide,  including
        flood  insurance if required under the National  Flood  Insurance Act of
        1968, as amended.  The Mortgage  requires the Mortgagor to maintain such
        casualty  insurance at the Mortgagor's  expense,  and on the Mortgagor's
        failure to do so,  authorizes  the holder of the  Mortgage to obtain and
        maintain  such  insurance  at  the  Mortgagor's   expense  and  to  seek
        reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor;

(viii)  Immediately  prior  to the  assignment  of  the  Mortgage  Loans  to the
        Trustee,  the Company had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each
        Mortgage  Loan  free  and  clear of any  pledge,  lien,  encumbrance  or
        security   interest   (other  than  rights  to  servicing   and  related
        compensation)  and such assignment  validly  transfers  ownership of the
        Mortgage  Loans to the  Trustee  free and  clear  of any  pledge,  lien,
        encumbrance or security interest;

(ix)    Approximately 51.19% of the Mortgage Loans by aggregate Stated Principal
        Balance as of the Cut-off  Date were  underwritten  under a reduced loan
        documentation  program,  approximately  14.49% of the Mortgage  Loans by
        aggregate  Stated  Principal   Balance  as  of  the  Cut-off  Date  were
        underwritten under a no-stated income program,  and approximately  2.39%
        of the Mortgage Loans by aggregate  Stated  Principal  Balance as of the
        Cut-off Date were underwritten under a no income/no asset program;

(x)     Except with respect to  approximately  19.43% of the  Mortgage  Loans by
        aggregate Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgagor

        Loan that the Mortgaged Property would be owner-occupied;

(xi)    None of the Mortgage Loans is a Buy-Down Mortgage Loan;

        860G(a)(3)(A)   of   the   Code   and   Treasury   Regulations   Section
        1.860G-2(a)(1);

(xiii)  A policy of title  insurance  was  effective  as of the  closing of each
        Mortgage  Loan and is valid and  binding  and  remains in full force and
        effect, unless the Mortgaged Properties are located in the State of Iowa
        and an  attorney's  certificate  has been  provided as  described in the
        Program Guide;

(xiv)   None of the  Mortgage  Loans is a  Cooperative  Loan;  with respect to a
        Mortgage Loan that is a Cooperative  Loan, the Cooperative Stock that is
        pledged  as  security  for the  Mortgage  Loan is held by a person  as a
        tenant-stockholder  (as  defined  in  Section  216  of  the  Code)  in a
        cooperative housing corporation (as defined in Section 216 of the Code);

(xv)    With respect to each  Mortgage  Loan  originated  under a  "streamlined"
        Mortgage  Loan program  (through  which no new or updated  appraisals of
        Mortgaged  Properties  are obtained in connection  with the  refinancing
        thereof),  the related Seller has represented  that either (a) the value
        of the related  Mortgaged  Property as of the date the Mortgage Loan was
        originated was not less than the appraised value of such property at the
        time  of  origination  of  the  refinanced  Mortgage  Loan  or  (b)  the
        Loan-to-Value  Ratio of the Mortgage Loan as of the date of  origination
        of  the  Mortgage  Loan  generally  meets  the  Company's   underwriting
        guidelines;

(xvi)   Interest on each  Mortgage  Loan is calculated on the basis of a 360-day

        Destroyed Mortgage Note;

(xviii) None  of the  Mortgage  Loans  will  have  been  made  to  International

        mission with diplomatic rank;

(xix)   No Mortgage  Loan provides for payments that are subject to reduction by
        withholding  taxes levied by any foreign  (non-United  States) sovereign
        government; and

It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.03(b) shall survive delivery of the respective  Mortgage Files to
the Trustee or any Custodian.

        Upon discovery by any of the Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee
or any Custodian of a breach of any of the  representations  and  warranties set
forth  in this  Section  2.03(b)  that  materially  and  adversely  affects  the
interests of the  Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering
such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties (any Custodian
being so obligated under a Custodial Agreement);  provided, however, that in the
event of a breach  of the  representation  and  warranty  set  forth in  Section
2.03(b)(xii),  the party  discovering  such breach shall give such notice within
five days of discovery. Within 90 days of its discovery or its receipt of notice
of  breach,  the  Company  shall  either  (i) cure such  breach in all  material
respects or (ii) purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase
Price and in the manner set forth in Section  2.02;  provided  that the  Company
shall have the option to  substitute  a Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or
Loans  for such  Mortgage  Loan if such  substitution  occurs  within  two years
following the Closing Date;  provided that if the omission or defect would cause
the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code,  any such cure or  repurchase  must occur within 90 days
from the date  such  breach  was  discovered.  Any  such  substitution  shall be
effected  by the  Company  under the same terms and  conditions  as  provided in
Section 2.04 for  substitutions  by  Residential  Funding.  It is understood and


                                       23
<PAGE>

agreed that the  obligation of the Company to cure such breach or to so purchase
or  substitute  for any Mortgage Loan as to which such a breach has occurred and
is continuing shall constitute the sole remedy  respecting such breach available
to the  Certificateholders  or the Trustee on behalf of the  Certificateholders.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  shall  not be  required  to cure
breaches  or  purchase  or  substitute  for  Mortgage  Loans as provided in this
Section  2.03(b) if the  substance of the breach of a  representation  set forth
above also constitutes fraud in the origination of the Mortgage Loan.

     the Standard Terms)

subject to any exceptions noted, together with the assignment to it of all other
assets included in the Trust Fund and/or the applicable REMIC,  receipt of which
is  hereby  acknowledged.  Concurrently  with  such  delivery  and  in  exchange

by an officer of the Company,  has executed and caused to be  authenticated  and
delivered  to or upon the order of the  Company  the Class R-I  Certificates  in
authorized  denominations which together with the Uncertificated REMIC I Regular
Interests, evidence the beneficial interest in REMIC I.

Interests; Acceptance by the Trustee.

        The Company, as of the Closing Date, and concurrently with the execution

and  interest  of the  Company  in and to the  Uncertificated  REMIC  I  Regular
Interests  to the  Trustee  for the  benefit  of the  Holders  of each  Class of
Certificates (other than the Class R-I Certificates).  The Trustee  acknowledges

holds and will hold the same in trust for the  exclusive  use and benefit of all
present and future Holders of each Class of  Certificates  (other than the Class

(other  than the Class  R-I  Certificates)  to  receive  distributions  from the
proceeds of REMIC II in respect of such Classes,  and all ownership interests of
the Holders of such Classes in such distributions, shall be as set forth in this
Agreement.

Company,  the Trustee has executed and caused to be authenticated  and delivered
to or upon the order of the Company, all Classes of Certificates (other than the
Class  R-I  Certificates)  in  authorized  denominations,   which  evidence  the

Section  3.07.  Collection  of  Certain  Mortgage  Loan  Payments;  Deposits  to
     Custodial Account.


(a) The Master  Servicer shall make  reasonable  efforts to collect all payments
called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage  Loans,  and shall, to
the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and the terms
and provisions of any related Primary Insurance  Policy,  follow such collection
procedures as it would employ in its good faith business  judgment and which are
normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing  activities.  Consistent with
the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer may in its  discretion  (i) waive any late
payment charge or any prepayment  charge or penalty  interest in connection with
the  prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the Due Date for payments due
on a Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Program Guide; provided, however, that
the Master Servicer shall first determine that any such waiver or extension will
not impair the coverage of any related  Primary  Insurance  Policy or materially
adversely  affect  the lien of the  related  Mortgage.  In the event of any such
arrangement,  the Master  Servicer  shall make  timely  advances  on the related
Mortgage Loan during the scheduled  period in accordance  with the  amortization
schedule of such  Mortgage Loan without  modification  thereof by reason of such
arrangements  unless  otherwise  agreed  to by the  Holders  of the  Classes  of
Certificates affected thereby;  provided,  however, that no such extension shall
be made if any such advance would be a Nonrecoverable  Advance.  Consistent with
the terms of this Agreement,  the Master Servicer may also waive, modify or vary
any  term  of any  Mortgage  Loan  or  consent  to the  postponement  of  strict
compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor
if  in  the  Master   Servicer's   determination   such  waiver,   modification,
postponement  or  indulgence is not  materially  adverse to the interests of the
Certificateholders  (taking into account any estimated  Realized Loss that might
result absent such action); provided,  however, that the Master Servicer may not


                                       25
<PAGE>

modify  materially  or permit  any  Subservicer  to modify  any  Mortgage  Loan,
including  without  limitation any  modification  that would change the Mortgage
Rate,  forgive the payment of any  principal or interest  (unless in  connection
with the  liquidation of the related  Mortgage Loan or except in connection with
prepayments to the extent that such  reamortization is not inconsistent with the
terms of the Mortgage  Loan), or extend the final maturity date of such Mortgage
Loan,  unless such Mortgage Loan is in default or, in the judgment of the Master
Servicer, such default is reasonably foreseeable; and provided, further, that no
such  modification  shall reduce the interest  rate on a Mortgage Loan below the
sum of the  rates at  which  the  Servicing  Fee and the  Subservicing  Fee with
respect to such Mortgage Loan accrue and the rate at which the Insurance Premium
accrues.  The final  maturity  date for any Mortgage  Loan shall not be extended
beyond the Maturity Date. In connection with any Curtailment of a Mortgage Loan,
the  Master  Servicer,  to the  extent  not  inconsistent  with the terms of the
Mortgage  Note and local law and  practice,  may permit the Mortgage  Loan to be
reamortized such that the Monthly Payment is recalculated as an amount that will
fully amortize the remaining  Stated  Principal  Balance thereof by the original
Maturity  Date  based  on  the  original  Mortgage  Rate;  provided,  that  such
re-amortization  shall not be permitted if it would  constitute a reissuance  of
the Mortgage Loan for federal income tax purposes,  except if such reissuance is
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(b)(3).

                      (ii) to reimburse  itself or the related  Subservicer  for

               expenses made pursuant to Sections  3.01,  3.07(a),  3.08,  3.11,
               3.12(a), 3.14 and 4.04 or otherwise  reimbursable pursuant to the
               terms of this Agreement,  such withdrawal  right being limited to
               amounts  received on particular  Mortgage Loans  (including,  for
               this  purpose,  REO  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds,  Liquidation
               Proceeds  and  proceeds  from the  purchase  of a  Mortgage  Loan
               pursuant to Section 2.02, 2.03, 2.04 or 4.07) which represent (A)
               Late  Collections of Monthly  Payments for which any such advance
               was made in the case of Subservicer Advances or Advances pursuant
               to Section 4.04 and (B) recoveries of amounts in respect of which

                      (vii) to reimburse  itself or the related  Subservicer for
               any  Nonrecoverable  Advance or Advances in the manner and to the
               extent  provided  in  subsection  (c) below,  and any  Advance or
               Servicing  Advance made in  connection  with a modified  Mortgage

               Loan  that  is in  default  or,  in the  judgment  of the  Master
               Servicer,  default is reasonably  foreseeable pursuant to Section
               3.07(a),  to the extent the amount of the  Advance has been added
               to the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, or any
               Advance  reimbursable to the Master Servicer  pursuant to Section
               4.02(a);

     Section 3.14. Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

               (a)  The  Master  Servicer  shall  foreclose  upon  or  otherwise
        comparably  convert (which may include an REO Acquisition) the ownership
        of  properties  securing  such of the  Mortgage  Loans as come  into and
        continue in default and as to which no satisfactory  arrangements can be
        made for  collection  of delinquent  payments  pursuant to Section 3.07.
        Alternatively,  the Master Servicer may take other actions in respect of
        a defaulted  Mortgage Loan, which may include (i) accepting a short sale
        (a payoff of the Mortgage  Loan for an amount less than the total amount
        contractually  owed in  order  to  facilitate  a sale  of the  Mortgaged
        Property by the  Mortgagor) or permitting a short  refinancing (a payoff
        of  the  Mortgage  Loan  for  an  amount  less  than  the  total  amount
        contractually  owed in order to facilitate  refinancing  transactions by
        the  Mortgagor not  involving a sale of the  Mortgaged  Property),  (ii)
        arranging for a repayment plan or (iii)  agreeing to a  modification  in
        accordance  with Section 3.07. In connection  with such  foreclosure  or
        other  conversion,  the Master Servicer  shall,  consistent with Section
        3.11, follow such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
        advisable,  as  shall  be  normal  and  usual  in its  general  mortgage
        servicing  activities  and as  shall be  required  or  permitted  by the
        Program Guide;  provided that the Master Servicer shall not be liable in
        any respect  hereunder  if the Master  Servicer is acting in  connection
        with  any  such  foreclosure  or other  conversion  in a manner  that is
        consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.  The Master  Servicer,
        however,  shall not be  required  to expend its own funds or incur other
        reimbursable  charges in connection with any  foreclosure,  or attempted
        foreclosure  which is not completed,  or towards the  restoration of any
        property  unless it shall  determine  (i) that such  restoration  and/or
        foreclosure  will increase the proceeds of  liquidation  of the Mortgage
        Loan  to  Holders  of   Certificates   of  one  or  more  Classes  after
        reimbursement  to itself for such expenses or charges and (ii) that such
        expenses  or  charges  will be  recoverable  to it  through  Liquidation
        Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, or REO Proceeds (respecting which it shall
        have priority for purposes of  withdrawals  from the  Custodial  Account
        pursuant to Section  3.10,  whether or not such expenses and charges are
        actually  recoverable  from  related  Liquidation  Proceeds,   Insurance
        Proceeds or REO Proceeds).  In the event of such a determination  by the
        Master Servicer  pursuant to this Section  3.14(a),  the Master Servicer
        shall be entitled to  reimbursement  of such amounts pursuant to Section
        3.10.

                                       27
<PAGE>

               In addition to the foregoing,  the Master  Servicer shall use its
        best  reasonable  efforts to realize upon any Additional  Collateral for
        such of the  Additional  Collateral  Loans as come into and  continue in
        default  and as to which no  satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for
        collection of  delinquent  payments  pursuant to Section 3.07;  provided
        that the Master  Servicer  shall not, on behalf of the  Trustee,  obtain
        title to any such Additional Collateral as a result of or in lieu of the
        disposition  thereof or  otherwise;  and  provided  further that (i) the
        Master  Servicer  shall not  proceed  with  respect  to such  Additional
        Collateral  in any  manner  that  would  impair  the  ability to recover
        against the related  Mortgaged  Property,  and (ii) the Master  Servicer
        shall proceed with any REO  Acquisition  in a manner that  preserves the
        ability to apply the  proceeds  of such  Additional  Collateral  against
        amounts owed under the defaulted  Mortgage Loan.  Any proceeds  realized
        from such  Additional  Collateral  (other than amounts to be released to
        the  Mortgagor or the related  guarantor in accordance  with  procedures
        that the Master  Servicer  would follow in servicing  loans held for its
        own account, subject to the terms and conditions of the related Mortgage
        and  Mortgage  Note and to the  terms  and  conditions  of any  security
        agreement,  guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other agreement governing
        the disposition of the proceeds of such Additional  Collateral) shall be
        deposited in the Custodial  Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to
        Section  3.10.  Any other  payment  received  by the Master  Servicer in
        respect  of  such  Additional  Collateral  shall  be  deposited  in  the
        Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

               For so long as the Master  Servicer is the Master  Servicer under
        the Credit Support Pledge  Agreement,  the Master Servicer shall perform
        its obligations  under the Credit Support Pledge Agreement in accordance
        with such Agreement and in a manner that is in the best interests of the
        Certificateholders.  Further,  the  Master  Servicer  shall use its best
        reasonable  efforts to realize  upon any Pledged  Assets for such of the
        Pledged Asset Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which
        no  satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for collection of delinquent
        payments  pursuant to Section 3.07;  provided  that the Master  Servicer
        shall not, on behalf of the  Trustee,  obtain  title to any such Pledged
        Assets  as a  result  of  or in  lieu  of  the  disposition  thereof  or
        otherwise;  and provided  further that (i) the Master Servicer shall not
        proceed  with  respect to such  Pledged  Assets in any manner that would
        impair the ability to recover  against the related  Mortgaged  Property,
        and (ii) the Master Servicer shall proceed with any REO Acquisition in a
        manner that  preserves the ability to apply the proceeds of such Pledged
        Assets  against  amounts owed under the  defaulted  Mortgage  Loan.  Any
        proceeds  realized  from such Pledged  Assets  (other than amounts to be
        released to the Mortgagor or the related  guarantor in  accordance  with
        procedures that the Master Servicer would follow in servicing loans held
        for its own account,  subject to the terms and conditions of the related
        Mortgage  and  Mortgage  Note and to the  terms  and  conditions  of any
        security  agreement,  guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other agreement
        governing the  disposition of the proceeds of such Pledged Assets) shall
        be deposited in the Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to


                                       28
<PAGE>

        Section  3.10.  Any other  payment  received  by the Master  Servicer in
        respect of such  Pledged  Assets  shall be  deposited  in the  Custodial
        Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

               Concurrently  with the foregoing,  the Master Servicer may pursue
        any  remedies  that may be available  in  connection  with a breach of a
        representation  and warranty  with respect to any such  Mortgage Loan in
        accordance with Sections 2.03 and 2.04. However,  the Master Servicer is
        not  required  to  continue  to  pursue  both  foreclosure  (or  similar
        remedies)  with respect to the Mortgage Loans and remedies in connection
        with a breach of a  representation  and warranty if the Master  Servicer
        determines  in its  reasonable  discretion  that one such remedy is more
        likely to result in a greater recovery as to the Mortgage Loan. Upon the
        occurrence  of a Cash  Liquidation  or REO  Disposition,  following  the
        deposit in the Custodial Account of all Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation
        Proceeds and other payments and recoveries referred to in the definition
        of "Cash Liquidation" or "REO Disposition," as applicable,  upon receipt
        by the  Trustee  of written  notification  of such  deposit  signed by a
        Servicing  Officer,  the Trustee or any  Custodian,  as the case may be,
        shall release to the Master  Servicer the related  Mortgage File and the
        Trustee  shall  execute  and  deliver  such  instruments  of transfer or
        assignment  prepared  by the  Master  Servicer,  in  each  case  without
        recourse,  as shall be necessary  to vest in the Master  Servicer or its
        designee,  as the case may be, the related Mortgage Loan, and thereafter
        such Mortgage Loan shall not be part of the Trust Fund.  Notwithstanding
        the foregoing or any other  provision of this  Agreement,  in the Master
        Servicer's sole  discretion with respect to any defaulted  Mortgage Loan
        or REO  Property as to either of the  following  provisions,  (i) a Cash
        Liquidation  or REO  Disposition  may be  deemed  to  have  occurred  if
        substantially all amounts expected by the Master Servicer to be received
        in connection with the related  defaulted  Mortgage Loan or REO Property
        have been received,  and (ii) for purposes of determining  the amount of
        any Liquidation Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds, REO Proceeds or any other
        unscheduled  collections  or the amount of any Realized Loss, the Master
        Servicer may take into account  minimal  amounts of additional  receipts
        expected to be received or any estimated additional liquidation expenses
        expected  to be  incurred  in  connection  with  the  related  defaulted
        Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

(i) any  investment in the  institution  with which the  Certificate  Account is
maintained may mature or be payable on demand on such Distribution Date and (ii)
any other  investment  may mature or be  payable on demand on such  Distribution

in February  2003, the Master  Servicer shall deposit with the Trustee,  and the
Trustee shall cause to be deposited into the Certificate  Account, an additional
amount  equal to  $2,633.77,  which  amount will be  included  in the  Available

                      Class A-P  Certificates)  will be disregarded,  and (i) an
                      amount  equal to the  Discount  Fraction of the  principal
                      portion of scheduled payments and unscheduled  collections
                      received or advanced in respect of the  Discount  Mortgage

                      4.02(a)(i) will be distributed as set forth therein.

(d)                   After the reduction of the Certificate  Principal Balances
                      of the  Senior  Certificates  (other  than the  Class  A-P
                      Certificates)  to zero  but  prior to the  Credit  Support
                      Depletion  Date, the Senior  Certificates  (other than the
                      Class A-P  Certificates)  will be  entitled  to no further
                      distributions  of  principal  thereon  and  the  Available
                      Distribution  Amount will be paid solely to the holders of
                      the Class A-P, Class A-V and Subordinate Certificates,  in
                      each case as described herein.

(e)                   In addition to the foregoing  distributions,  with respect
                      to any Subsequent  Recoveries,  the Master  Servicer shall
                      deposit such funds into the Custodial  Account pursuant to
                      Section  3.07(b)(iii).  If, after taking into account such
                      Subsequent  Recoveries,  the amount of a Realized  Loss is
                      reduced, the amount of such Subsequent  Recoveries will be
                      applied to increase the Certificate  Principal  Balance of
                      the Class of Subordinate  Certificates  with a Certificate
                      Principal  Balance  greater  than  zero  with the  highest
                      payment  priority  to which  Realized  Losses,  other than
                      Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess Fraud  Losses,  Excess
                      Special Hazard Losses and Extraordinary  Losses, have been

                      allocated,  but not by more than the  amount  of  Realized
                      Losses previously  allocated to that Class of Certificates
                      pursuant  to Section  4.05.  The  amount of any  remaining
                      Subsequent  Recoveries  will be applied to  increase  from
                      zero the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the Class of
                      Certificates with the next lower payment  priority,  up to
                      the amount of Realized Losses previously allocated to that
                      Class  of  Certificates  pursuant  to  Section  4.05.  Any
                      remaining Subsequent Recoveries will in turn be applied to
                      increase from zero the  Certificate  Principal  Balance of
                      the  Class of  Certificates  with the next  lower  payment
                      priority  up to the amount of Realized  Losses  previously
                      allocated  to  that  Class  of  Certificates  pursuant  to
                      Section 4.05, and so on. Holders of such Certificates will
                      not be  entitled  to any  payment  in  respect  of Accrued
                      Certificate  Interest on the amount of such  increases for
                      any Interest Accrual Period preceding the Interest Accrual
                      Period that relates to the Distribution Date on which such
                      increase  occurs.  Any such increases  shall be applied to
                      the Certificate  Principal  Balance of each Certificate of
                      such Class in accordance  with its  respective  Percentage
                      Interest.

(f)                   Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate
                      shall be paid to the Depository,  as Holder  thereof,  and
                      the Depository  shall be solely  responsible for crediting
                      the amount of such  distribution  to the  accounts  of its
                      Depository  Participants  in  accordance  with its  normal
                      procedures.   Each   Depository   Participant   shall   be
                      responsible  for  disbursing  such   distribution  to  the
                      Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect
                      participating  brokerage  firm (a  "brokerage  firm")  for
                      which  it acts as  agent.  Each  brokerage  firm  shall be
                      responsible for disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners
                      that it represents.  None of the Trustee,  the Certificate
                      Registrar,  the Company or the Master  Servicer shall have
                      any responsibility therefor.

(g)                   Except as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  9.01,  if the
                      Master Servicer anticipates that a final distribution with
                      respect to any Class of  Certificates  will be made on the
                      next  Distribution  Date, the Master  Servicer  shall,  no
                      later  than the  Determination  Date in the  month of such
                      final  distribution,  notify the  Trustee  and the Trustee
                      shall,  no later  than two (2)  Business  Days  after such
                      Determination  Date,  mail on such date to each  Holder of
                      such Class of  Certificates  a notice to the effect  that:
                      (i) the Trustee  anticipates  that the final  distribution
                      with respect to such Class of Certificates will be made on
                      such  Distribution  Date but only  upon  presentation  and
                      surrender  of  such  Certificates  at  the  office  of the
                      Trustee or as  otherwise  specified  therein,  and (ii) no
                      interest shall accrue on such  Certificates from and after
                      the end of the related  Interest  Accrual  Period.  In the
                      event that Certificateholders  required to surrender their
                      Certificates  pursuant to Section 9.01(c) do not surrender
                      their  Certificates  for final  cancellation,  the Trustee
                      shall  cause  funds  distributable  with  respect  to such
                      Certificates to be withdrawn from the Certificate  Account
                      and credited to a separate  escrow account for the benefit
                      of such Certificateholders as provided in Section 9.01(d).

(h)                   Notwithstanding  the priorities  relating to distributions
                      of  principal  to the  holders of the Retail  Certificates
                      described above, on any Distribution  Date,  distributions
                      in respect of principal on the Retail Certificates will be
                      allocated  among  the  Certificate  Owners  of the  Retail
                      Certificates  as  set  forth  in  Section  4.10.  On  each
                      Distribution  Date on  which  amounts  are  available  for
                      distributions  in reduction of the  Certificate  Principal
                      Balance of the Retail  Certificates,  the aggregate amount
                      available for such distributions will be rounded upward by
                      the Rounding Amount. Such rounding will be accomplished on
                      the  first  Distribution  Date on which  distributions  in
                      reduction  of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the
                      Retail  Certificates  are  made by  withdrawing  from  the
                      Rounding  Account the Rounding Amount for deposit into the


                                       40

                      Certificate  Account,  and such  Rounding  Amount  will be
                      added to the amount that is available for distributions in
                      reduction  of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the
                      Retail Certificates.  On each succeeding Distribution Date
                      on which  distributions  in reduction  of the  Certificate
                      Principal  Balance  of the Retail  Certificates  are made,
                      first,  the aggregate amount available for distribution in
                      reduction  of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the
                      Retail  Certificates will be applied to repay the Rounding
                      Amount  withdrawn  from the Rounding  Account on the prior
                      Distribution   Date  and  then,   the  remainder  of  such
                      allocable amount, if any, will be similarly rounded upward
                      through another  withdrawal from the Rounding  Account and
                      such  determined  Rounding  Amount  will be  added  to the
                      amount that is available for distributions in reduction of
                      the   Certificate   Principal   Balance   of  the   Retail
                      Certificates.  Any funds remaining in the Rounding Account
                      after the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the  Retail
                      Certificates  is reduced to zero shall be  distributed  to
                      the Class R Certificateholders.

(i)                   On  each   Distribution   Date   preceding  the  Accretion
                      Termination Date, Accrued Certificate  Interest that would
                      otherwise be distributed to the Accrual  Certificates will
                      be  added  to the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the
                      Accrual  Certificates  and  such  amount  will  thereafter
                      accrue  interest  at a rate of  5.75%  per  annum.  On the
                      Accretion   Termination  Date,  the  Accrued   Certificate
                      Interest on the Accrual Certificates for such date will be
                      payable  to  the   holders  of  the   Accretion   Directed
                      Certificates  as a distribution  of principal  pursuant to
                      Section   4.02(b)(ii)  until  the  Certificate   Principal
                      Balances  thereof  have  been  reduced  to zero,  any such
                      amount will be added to the Certificate  Principal Balance
                      of the Accrual  Certificates,  and any remaining amount of
                      Accrued  Certificate  Interest will be paid to the holders
                      of the Accrual  Certificates as a distribution of interest
                      and will not be added to the Certificate Principal Balance
                      thereof;  provided,  however, if the Accretion Termination
                      Date is the  Credit  Support  Depletion  Date,  the entire
                      amount of  Accrued  Certificate  Interest  on the  Accrual
                      Certificates  for such date will be payable to the holders
                      of the Accrual  Certificates as a distribution of interest
                      and will not be added to the Certificate Principal Balance
                      thereof.

Section 4.03.  Statements to Certificateholders; Exchange Act Reporting.

        (a) - (d). (See Section 4.03(a) - (d) of the Standard Terms).

        (e) The Master Servicer shall, on behalf of the Depositor and in respect
of the Trust Fund,  sign and cause to be filed with the  Commission any periodic
reports  required to be filed under the  provisions of the Exchange Act, and the
rules and  regulations  of the  Commission  thereunder.  In connection  with the
preparation  and filing of such  periodic  reports,  the  Trustee  shall  timely
provide to the Master Servicer (I) a list of  Certificateholders as shown on the
Certificate  Register as of the end of each  calendar  year,  (II) copies of all
pleadings,  other legal process and any other documents  relating to any claims,
charges or complaints involving the Trustee, as trustee hereunder,  or the Trust
Fund that are received by the Trustee,  (III) notice of all matters that, to the
actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, have been submitted to
a vote of the  Certificateholders,  other  than  those  matters  that  have been
submitted to a vote of the Certificateholders at the request of the Depositor or
the Master  Servicer,  and (IV) notice of any failure of the Trustee to make any
distribution  to the  Certificateholders  as  required  pursuant  to this Series
Supplement. Neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any liability
with respect to the Master  Servicer's  failure to properly prepare or file such


                                       41
<PAGE>

periodic reports resulting from or relating to the Master  Servicer's  inability
or failure to obtain any  information  not resulting from the Master  Servicer's
own negligence or willful misconduct. Any Form 10-K filed with the Commission in
connection  with this Section 4.03(e) shall include a  certification,  signed by
the senior officer in charge of the servicing  functions of the Master Servicer,
in the form  attached  as  Exhibit  Seven  hereto or such  other  form as may be
required or  permitted by the  Commission  (the "Form 10-K  Certification"),  in
compliance  with  Rules  13a-14  and  15d-14  under  the  Exchange  Act  and any
additional  directives  of the  Commission.  In  connection  with the Form  10-K
Certification,  the Trustee  shall  provide the Master  Servicer  with a back-up
certification  substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit Eight.  This
Section  4.03(e) may be amended in accordance  with this  Agreement  without the
consent of the Certificateholders.

Section 4.04.  Distribution of Reports to the Trustee and the Company;  Advances
by the Master Servicer.

        (a) Prior to the close of business on the Determination Date, the Master
Servicer  shall  furnish a written  statement  to the Trustee,  the  Certificate
Insurer,  any Paying Agent and the Company (the information in such statement to
be made  available  to  Certificateholders  by the Master  Servicer  on request)
setting forth (i) the Available  Distribution  Amount, (ii) the amounts required
to be withdrawn from the Custodial  Account,  Reserve Fund I, Reserve Fund II or
the  Rounding  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Certificate  Account  on  the
immediately  succeeding  Certificate  Account Deposit Date,  (iii) the amount of
Cumulative  Insurance  Payments  as of such  Determination  Date,  and  (iv) the
amounts required to be deposited into the Rounding Account;  provided,  however,
that the  Master  Servicer  shall  provide  to the  Trustee a written  statement
setting  forth  the  portion  of  the  Senior  Principal   Distribution   Amount
distributable to the Retail  Certificates on any Distribution Date no later than
12:00  Noon  New  York  time on the  Business  Day  immediately  preceding  each
Determination  Date to enable the Trustee to notify the  Certificate  Insurer in
accordance with Section 12.02.

        The  determination  by the Master Servicer of such amounts shall, in the
absence of obvious error, be presumptively deemed to be correct for all purposes
hereunder  and the Trustee  shall be  protected in relying upon the same without
any independent check or verification.

        (b) (See Section 4.04(b) of the Standard Terms)

Section 4.05.  Allocation of Realized Losses.

        Prior to each Distribution Date, the Master Servicer shall determine the
total  amount  of  Realized  Losses,   if  any,  that  resulted  from  any  Cash
Liquidation, Servicing Modification, Debt Service Reduction, Deficient Valuation
or REO Disposition that occurred during the related Prepayment Period or, in the
case of a Servicing  Modification  that  constitutes a reduction of the interest
rate on a Mortgage Loan, the amount of the reduction in the interest  portion of
the  Monthly  Payment  due during the  related  Due  Period.  The amount of each
Realized  Loss shall be  evidenced  by an  Officers'  Certificate.  All Realized
Losses, other than Excess Special Hazard Losses,  Extraordinary  Losses,  Excess
Bankruptcy Losses or Excess Fraud Losses, shall be allocated as follows:  first,
to the Class B-3 Certificates,  until the Certificate  Principal Balance thereof
has been  reduced  to zero;  second,  to the  Class B-2  Certificates  until the


                                       42
<PAGE>

Certificate  Principal  Balance thereof has been reduced to zero;  third, to the
Class B-1 Certificates until the Certificate  Principal Balance thereof has been
reduced to zero;  fourth,  to the Class M-3  Certificates  until the Certificate
Principal  Balance  thereof has been  reduced to zero;  fifth,  to the Class M-2
Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to
zero;  sixth,  to the Class M-1  Certificates  until the  Certificate  Principal
Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; and, thereafter,  if any such Realized
Losses are on a Discount  Mortgage  Loan,  to the Class A-P  Certificates  in an
amount equal to the Discount Fraction of the principal portion thereof,  and the
remainder of such Realized Losses on the Discount  Mortgage Loans and the entire
amount of such Realized Losses on Non-Discount  Mortgage Loans will be allocated
among all Senior  Certificates  (other than the Class A-P Certificates) on a pro
rata basis,  as described  below.  The principal  portion of any Excess  Special
Hazard Losses,  Excess Bankruptcy Losses,  Excess Fraud Losses and Extraordinary
Losses  on  Discount   Mortgage  Loans  will  be  allocated  to  the  Class  A-P
Certificates  in an  amount  equal  to the  Discount  Fraction  thereof  and the
remainder of the principal  portion of such Realized Losses on Discount Mortgage
Loans and the entire amount of such  Realized  Losses on  Non-Discount  Mortgage
Loans will be allocated among the Senior  Certificates (other than the Class A-P
Certificates)  and Subordinate  Certificates,  on a pro rata basis, as described
below.  The  interest  portion  of any  Excess  Special  Hazard  Losses,  Excess
Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess  Fraud  Losses  and  Extraordinary  Losses  will  be
allocated to all the Certificates on a pro rata basis.

        As used herein,  an  allocation of a Realized Loss on a "pro rata basis"
among two or more specified Classes of Certificates means an allocation on a pro
rata  basis,  among the  various  Classes  so  specified,  to each such Class of
Certificates,  on the  basis of their  then  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
Balances prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such Distribution
Date in the case of the  principal  portion of a  Realized  Loss or based on the
Accrued Certificate  Interest thereon payable on such Distribution Date (without
regard to any Compensating  Interest for such Distribution  Date) in the case of
an interest  portion of a Realized  Loss.  Except as  provided in the  following
sentence, any allocation of the principal portion of Realized Losses (other than
Debt Service  Reductions) to a Class of  Certificates  shall be made by reducing
the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  thereof by the amount so allocated,  which
allocation shall be deemed to have occurred on such Distribution Date;  provided
that the Certificate  Principal Balance of the Accrual Certificates for purposes
of this  Section  4.05  shall be the  lesser  of (a) the  Certificate  Principal
Balance of Accrual  Certificates as of the Closing Date, and (b) the Certificate
Principal  Balance of the Accrual  Certificates as of the date of determination.
Any  allocation  of the  principal  portion of Realized  Losses (other than Debt
Service  Reductions) to the Subordinate  Certificates  then outstanding with the
Lowest  Priority  shall be made by operation of the  definition of  "Certificate
Principal  Balance"  and by  operation  of the  provisions  of Section  4.02(a).
Allocations  of the  interest  portions  of  Realized  Losses  shall  be made in
proportion to the amount of Accrued Certificate Interest and by operation of the


                                       43
<PAGE>

definition of "Accrued Certificate  Interest" and by operation of the provisions
of  Section  4.02(a).  Allocations  of the  principal  portion  of Debt  Service
Reductions shall be made by operation of the provisions of Section 4.02(a).  All
Realized  Losses  and all  other  losses  allocated  to a Class of  Certificates
hereunder will be allocated  among the  Certificates of such Class in proportion
to the Percentage  Interests evidenced thereby;  provided that if any Subclasses
of the Class A-V Certificates have been issued pursuant to Section 5.01(c), such
Realized Losses and other losses allocated to the Class A-V  Certificates  shall
be allocated  among such  Subclasses in proportion to the respective  amounts of
Accrued  Certificate  Interest payable on such Distribution Date that would have
resulted absent such reductions.

     Section  4.06.   Reports  of  Foreclosures  and  Abandonment  of  Mortgaged
          Property. (See Section 4.06 of the Standard Terms)

     Section 4.07.  Optional Purchase of Defaulted  Mortgage Loans. (See Section
          4.07 of the Standard Terms)

     Section 4.08. Surety Bond. (See Section 4.08 of the Standard Terms)

     Section 4.09. Reserve Funds.

        No later than the Closing Date,  the Trustee will establish and maintain
Reserve Fund I and Reserve  Fund II. On the Closing Date the Senior  Underwriter
shall deposit with the Trustee,  and the Trustee shall deposit into Reserve Fund
I, cash in an  amount  equal to the  Reserve  Fund I Deposit  and  deposit  into
Reserve Fund II, cash in an amount equal to the Reserve Fund II Deposit.

        The  Master  Servicer  shall  direct  the  Trustee  in  writing  on each
Distribution  Date to withdraw  amounts on deposit in Reserve Fund I for deposit
into  the  Certificate  Account,  and  to  pay to  the  holders  of  any  Retail
Certificates  pursuant to Section  4.02(a),  the amount of  Prepayment  Interest
Shortfalls  otherwise  allocable  to any  Retail  Certificates  pursuant  to the
definition  of  Accrued  Certificate  Interest  (to the extent not offset by the
Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.16(e) of this Series  Supplement),  to the
extent of funds on deposit in Reserve Fund I (the amount of such  withdrawal for
any Distribution Date, the "Reserve Fund I Withdrawal"). In addition, the Master
Servicer  shall  direct the  Trustee in  writing  on each  Distribution  Date to
withdraw  amounts on deposit in Reserve Fund II for deposit into the Certificate
Account,  and to pay to the  holders  of any  Retail  Certificates  pursuant  to
Section 4.02(a),  the amount of any Relief Act Shortfalls otherwise allocable to
any Retail  Certificates  pursuant  to the  definition  of  Accrued  Certificate
Interest,  to the extent of funds on deposit in Reserve  Fund II (the  amount of
such withdrawal for any Distribution Date, the "Reserve Fund II Withdrawal").

               For federal income tax purposes,  the Senior Underwriter shall be
the owner of Reserve  Fund I and Reserve  Fund II and shall  report all items of
income,  deduction,  gain or loss arising  therefrom.  Notwithstanding  anything
herein to the contrary, Reserve Fund I and Reserve Fund II shall not be an asset
of any REMIC.  Reserve Fund I and Reserve Fund II shall be invested in Permitted
Investments  at the  direction  of the Senior  Underwriter.  All income and gain
realized  from  investment  of funds  deposited  in the Reserve  Fund I shall be
deposited  in the Reserve Fund I for the sole use and  exclusive  benefit of the
Reserve Fund I. Similarly, all income and gain realized from investment of funds
deposited  in the Reserve  Fund II shall be deposited in the Reserve Fund II for
the sole use and  exclusive  benefit of the  Reserve  Fund II. The amount of any
loss  incurred  in respect of any such  investments  shall be  deposited  in the
related Reserve Fund by the Senior  Underwriter out of its own funds immediately
as realized without any right of reimbursement.  The balance,  if any, remaining
in  Reserve  Fund I or  Reserve  Fund II on the  Distribution  Date on which the
Certificate Principal Balance of the Retail Certificates is reduced to zero will
be  distributed  by the  Trustee to the Senior  Underwriter.  To the extent that


                                       44
<PAGE>

Reserve Fund I or Reserve Fund II  constitutes a reserve fund for federal income
tax  purposes,  (1) it shall be an outside  reserve fund and not an asset of any
REMIC  and (2) it shall  be owned by the  Senior  Underwriter,  all  within  the
meaning of Section 1.860G-2(h) of the Treasury  Regulations.  Reserve Fund I and
Reserve Fund II may not be owned by more than one person.

Section 4.10.  Rounding Account.

        No later than the Closing Date,  the Trustee will establish and maintain
with itself a segregated trust account that is an Eligible Account,  which shall
be titled "Rounding  Account,  Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,  as trustee
for the  registered  holders  of  Residential  Accredit  Loans,  Inc.,  Mortgage
Asset-Backed  Pass-Through  Certificates,  Series  2003-QS1,  Class A-8." On the
Closing Date,  the Senior  Underwriter  shall deposit with the Trustee,  and the
Trustee  shall  deposit  into the Rounding  Account,  cash in an amount equal to
$999.99.  The  Trustee  shall  hold such  amount  uninvested,  unless  otherwise
directed by the Master Servicer.

        The  Trustee on each  Distribution  Date shall,  based upon  information
provided by the Master  Servicer  for the related  Distribution  Date,  withdraw
funds from the Rounding Account to pay the Rounding Amount to the Holders of the
Retail  Certificates  pursuant to Section 4.02(h).  In addition,  the Trustee on
each  Distribution  Date shall,  based upon  information  provided by the Master
Servicer for the related  Distribution Date, withdraw funds from the Certificate
Account to repay to the  Rounding  Account  the  Rounding  Amount from the prior
Distribution Date as contemplated in Section 4.02(h).
Section 4.11.  Principal Distributions on the Retail Certificates.

        Distributions in reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of the
Retail  Certificates will be made in integral multiples of $1,000 at the request
of  the  appropriate   representatives   of  Deceased  Holders  of  such  Retail
Certificates and at the request of Living Owners of such Retail  Certificates or
by mandatory distributions by Random Lot, pursuant to clauses (a) and (d) below,
or on a pro rata basis pursuant to clause (e) below.

(a) On each  Distribution  Date  on  which  distributions  in  reduction  of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of  the  Retail  Certificates  are  made,  such
distributions  will be made in the  following  priority  among  the  Certificate
Owners of the Retail Certificates:

               (i) any  request by the  personal  representatives  of a Deceased
        Holder or by a surviving  tenant by the entirety,  by a surviving  joint
        tenant  or by a  surviving  tenant  in  common,  but  not  exceeding  an
        aggregate amount of $100,000 per request; and

          (ii) any request by a Living  Owner,  but not  exceeding  an aggregate
     amount of $10,000 per request.

        Thereafter,  distributions  will be made,  with  respect  to the  Retail
Certificates,  as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above up to a second $100,000
and $10,000, respectively. This sequence of priorities will be repeated for each
request for principal distributions made by the Certificate Owners of the Retail
Certificates until all such requests have been honored.

                                       45
<PAGE>

        Requests for  distributions  in reduction of the  Certificate  Principal
Balance of the Retail  Certificates  presented on behalf of Deceased  Holders in
accordance  with the provisions of clause (i) above will be accepted in order of
their receipt by the Depository.  Requests for distributions in reduction of the
Certificate  Principal Balance of the Retail Certificate presented in accordance
with the  provisions of clause (ii) above will be accepted in the order of their
receipt by the Depository after all requests presented in accordance with clause
(i) have been  honored.  All  requests  for  distributions  in  reduction of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance of the Retail  Certificates  will be accepted in
accordance  with the provisions set forth in Section  4.11(c).  All requests for
distributions  in reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of the Retail
Certificates  with  respect to any  Distribution  Date must be  received  by the
Depository and on the Depository's "participant terminal system" and received by
the  Trustee no later than the close of business  on the  related  Record  Date.
Requests for  distributions  that are on the Depository's  participant  terminal
system and received by the Trustee  after the related  Record Date and requests,
in either case, for  distributions not accepted with respect to any Distribution
Date,  will be  treated  as  requests  for  distributions  in  reduction  of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance of Retail  Certificates  on the next  succeeding
Distribution Date, and each succeeding Distribution Date thereafter,  until such
request is  accepted  or is  withdrawn  as  provided  in Section  4.11(c).  Such
requests as are not so withdrawn  shall  retain their order of priority  without
the need for any further action on the part of the appropriate Certificate Owner
of the related Retail Certificate,  all in accordance with the procedures of the
Depository and the Trustee. Upon the transfer of the beneficial ownership of any
Retail Certificate,  any distribution  request previously submitted with respect
to such  Certificate will be deemed to have been withdrawn only upon the receipt
by the  Trustee  on or before  the  Record  Date for such  Distribution  Date of
notification  of such  withdrawal in the manner set forth in Section  4.11(c) on
the Depository's participant terminal system.

        Distributions in reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of the
Retail  Certificates  will be applied in an amount equal to the Senior Principal
Distribution  Amount allocable to such Class pursuant to Section 4.02(b),  plus,
with respect to the Retail Certificates,  any amounts available for distribution
from the Rounding Account established as provided in Section 4.10, provided that
the aggregate  distribution in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balance of
the Retail  Certificates on any  Distribution  Date shall be made in an integral
multiple of $1,000.

        To the extent  that the  portion of the  Senior  Principal  Distribution
Amount  allocable to  distributions  in reduction of the  Certificate  Principal
Balance  of  the  Retail  Certificates  on any  Distribution  Date  exceeds  the
aggregate  Certificate Principal Balance of the Retail Certificates with respect
to which distribution requests, as set forth above, have been received (plus any
amounts required to be distributed pursuant to the Rounding Account with respect
to the Retail  Certificates),  distributions  in  reduction  of the  Certificate
Principal  Balance  of  the  Retail  Certificates  will  be  made  by  mandatory
distribution pursuant to Section 4.11(d).

(b) A Retail  Certificate  shall be deemed to be held by a  Deceased  Holder for
purposes of this Section 4.11 if the death of the  Certificate  Owner thereof is
deemed to have occurred.  Retail  Certificates  beneficially owned by tenants by
the  entirety,  joint  tenants  or tenants in common  will be  considered  to be
beneficially  owned by a single  owner.  The death of a tenant by the  entirety,
joint  tenant  or  tenant  in  common  will be  deemed  to be the  death  of the
Certificate  Owner,  and the Retail  Certificates so beneficially  owned will be


                                       46
<PAGE>

eligible  for  priority  with  respect  to  distributions  in  reduction  of the
Certificate Principal Balance thereof,  subject to the limitations stated above.
Retail  Certificates  beneficially  owned by a trust  will be  considered  to be
beneficially  owned  by each  beneficiary  of the  trust to the  extent  of such
beneficiary's  beneficial  interest  therein,  but in no  event  will a  trust's
beneficiaries  collectively  be deemed to be  Certificate  Owners of a number of
Individual Retail  Certificates of which such trust is the owner. The death of a
beneficiary of a trust will be deemed to be the death of a Certificate  Owner of
the Retail Certificates, as applicable, owned by the trust to the extent of such
beneficiary's  beneficial interest in such trust. The death of an individual who
was a tenant  by the  entirety,  joint  tenant  or tenant in common in a tenancy
which  is the  beneficiary  of a trust  will be  deemed  to be the  death of the
beneficiary  of such  trust.  The  death  of a  person  who,  during  his or her
lifetime,  was  entitled  to  substantially  all  of  the  beneficial  ownership
interests in Individual  Retail  Certificates  will be deemed to be the death of
the Certificate Owner of the Retail Certificates  regardless of the registration
of ownership, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction
of the Depository Participant.  Such beneficial interest will be deemed to exist
in typical  cases of street name or nominee  ownership,  ownership by a trustee,
ownership under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act and community  property or other
joint ownership  arrangements between a husband and wife. Certificate beneficial
interests  shall include the power to sell,  transfer or otherwise  dispose of a
Retail Certificate and the right to receive the proceeds  therefrom,  as well as
interest and distributions in reduction of the Certificate  Principal Balance of
the Retail  Certificates,  as  applicable,  payable  with respect  thereto.  The
Trustee shall not be under any duty to determine independently the occurrence of
the death of any deceased  Certificate Owner. The Trustee may rely entirely upon
documentation  delivered to it pursuant to Section 4.10(c) in  establishing  the
eligibility of any Certificate  Owner to receive the priority  accorded Deceased
Holders in Section 4.11(a).

(c) Requests for distributions in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balance
of Retail  Certificates must be made by delivering a written request therefor to
the Depository Participant or Indirect Depository Participant that maintains the
account evidencing such Certificate Owner's interest in Retail Certificates.  In
the case of a request on behalf of a Deceased  Holder,  appropriate  evidence of
death  and any tax  waivers  are  required  to be  forwarded  to the  Depository
Participant  under separate cover.  The Depository  Participant  shall forward a
certification, satisfactory to the Trustee, certifying the death of the Deceased
Holder and the receipt of the appropriate evidence of death and tax waivers. The
Depository Participant should in turn make the request of the Depository (or, in
the  case  of an  Indirect  Depository  Participant,  such  Indirect  Depository
Participant  must notify the related  Depository  Participant  of such  request,
which Depository  Participant  should make the request of the Depository) on the
Depository's  participant  terminal  system.  The  Depository may establish such
procedures  as it deems fair and  equitable to establish the order of receipt of
requests  for such  distributions  received  by it on the same day.  None of the
Company,  the Master  Servicer or the  Trustee  shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of requests for  distributions  or  withdrawals of such requests by the
Depository, a Depository Participant or any Indirect Depository Participant.

        The Depository  shall maintain a list of those  Depository  Participants
representing the appropriate Certificate Owners of Retail Certificates that have
submitted  requests for distributions in reduction of the Certificate  Principal
Balance  of Retail  Certificates,  together  with the order of  receipt  and the
amounts of such requests on the Depository's  participant  terminal system.  The
Depository will honor requests for  distributions  in the order of their receipt


                                       47
<PAGE>

(subject to the  priorities  described in Section  4.11(a)  above).  The Trustee
shall  notify  the  Depository  as to which  requests  should be honored on each
Distribution  Date at least two Business  Days prior to such  Distribution  Date
based on the report  received by the Trustee  pursuant to Section 4.04 and shall
notify the  Depository  as to the amount of the  Senior  Principal  Distribution
Amount to be  distributed to the Retail  Certificates  by Random Lot pursuant to
Section 4.11(d).  Requests shall be honored by the Depository in accordance with
the procedures, and subject to the priorities and limitations, described in this
Section  4.11.  The exact  procedures  to be  followed  by the  Trustee  and the
Depository for purposes of determining  such priorities and limitations  will be
those  established  from time to time by the Trustee or the  Depository,  as the
case may be. The  decisions of the Trustee and the  Depository  concerning  such
matters will be final and binding on all affected persons.

        Individual   Retail   Certificates   that  have  been   accepted  for  a
distribution shall be due and payable on the applicable  Distribution Date. Such
Certificates  shall  cease to bear  interest  after  the  last day of the  month
preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.

        Any  Certificate  Owner of a Retail  Certificate  that has  requested  a
distribution  may withdraw its request by so notifying in writing the Depository
Participant or Indirect  Depository  Participant that maintains such Certificate
Owner's  account.  In the event that such account is  maintained  by an Indirect
Depository  Participant,  such Indirect  Depository  Participant must notify the
related Depository Participant which in turn must forward the withdrawal of such
request on the Depository's participant terminal system. If such withdrawal of a
request for distribution  has not been received on the Depository's  participant
terminal system on or before the Record Date for the next Distribution Date, the
previously made request for distribution will be irrevocable with respect to the
making of distributions in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balance of the
Retail Certificates on such Distribution Date.

        In  the  event  any  requests  for  distributions  in  reduction  of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance of the Retail  Certificates  are rejected by the
Trustee for failure to comply with the  requirements  of this Section 4.11,  the
Trustee shall return such request to the appropriate Depository Participant with
a copy  to  the  Depository  with  an  explanation  as to the  reason  for  such
rejection.

(d) To the extent,  if any, that  distributions  in reduction of the Certificate
Principal  Balance of the Retail  Certificates on a Distribution Date exceed the
outstanding  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the  Retail  Certificates  with
respect to which distribution  requests have been received by the related Record
Date, as provided in Section  4.10(a)  above,  the additional  distributions  in
reduction of the Certificate  Principal Balance of the Retail  Certificates will
be  made  by  mandatory  distributions  in  reduction  thereof.  Such  mandatory
distributions on Individual  Retail  Certificates  will be made by Random Lot in
accordance with the then-applicable Random Lot procedures of the Depository, the
Depository  Participants and the Indirect Depository  Participants  representing
the Certificate Owners. The Trustee shall notify the Depository of the aggregate
amount of the mandatory  distribution in reduction of the Certificate  Principal
Balance of the Retail Certificates to be made on any such Distribution Date. The
Depository  shall then  allocate  such  aggregate  amount  among its  Depository
Participants on a Random Lot basis.  Each Depository  Participant  and, in turn,
each Indirect  Depository  Participant will then select,  in accordance with its
own  procedures,  Individual  Retail  Certificates  from among those held in its


                                       48
<PAGE>

accounts to receive  mandatory  distributions  in reduction  of the  Certificate
Principal  Balance of the  Retail  Certificates,  such that the total  amount so
selected  is equal  to the  aggregate  amount  of such  mandatory  distributions
allocated to such Depository  Participant by the Depository and to such Indirect
Depository  Participant by its related Depository  Participant,  as the case may
be.  Depository  Participants  and Indirect  Depository  Participants  that hold
Retail  Certificates  selected for mandatory  distributions  in reduction of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance  thereof are required to provide  notice of such
mandatory  distributions to the affected Certificate Owners. The Master Servicer
agrees to notify the Trustee of the amount of  distributions in reduction of the
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the Retail  Certificates  to be made on each
Distribution  Date in a timely  manner  such that the  Trustee  may  fulfill its
obligations  pursuant to the letter of  representations  dated the Closing  Date
among the Company, the Trustee and the Depository.

(e) Notwithstanding  any provisions herein to the contrary,  on any Distribution
Date on which any  Realized  Losses are  allocated  to the Retail  Certificates,
distributions  in reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of the Retail
Certificates  will be made pro rata on the basis of their respective  Percentage
Interests  with the  respect to the Retail  Certificates  among the  Certificate
Owners of the Retail  Certificates and will not be made in integral multiples of
$1,000 nor  pursuant to requests for  distribution  as permitted by this Section
4.11 or mandatory distributions by Random Lot.

(f)  In  the  event  that  Definitive   Certificates   representing  the  Retail
Certificates  are issued  pursuant to Section  5.01 of the  Standard  Terms,  an
amendment to this  Agreement,  which may be approved  without the consent of any
Certificateholders,  shall establish  procedures relating to the manner in which
distributions in reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of such Retail
Certificates are to be made;  provided that such procedures shall be consistent,
to the extent  practicable and customary for certificates  similar to the Retail
Certificates, with the provisions of this Section 4.11.

Section 10.03..Designation of REMICs.

        The REMIC  Administrator  will  make an  election  to treat  the  entire
segregated pool of assets  described in the definition of Trust Fund (except for
Reserve Fund I,  Reserve  Fund II and the Initial  Monthly  Payment  Fund),  and
subject to this  Agreement  (including  the  Mortgage  Loans but  excluding  the
Initial  Monthly  Payment Fund) as a REMIC ("REMIC I") and will make an election
to treat  the pool of assets  comprised  of the  Uncertificated  REMIC I Regular
Interests as a REMIC ("REMIC II") for federal income tax purposes.

        The Uncertificated REMIC I Regular Interests will be "regular interests"
in REMIC I and the Class R-I  Certificates  will be the sole class of  "residual
interests" in REMIC I for purposes of the REMIC  Provisions (as defined  herein)
under the federal income tax law.

        The Class A-1,  Class A-2,  Class A-3,  Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-6,

be "regular  interests" in REMIC II, and the Class R-II Certificates will be the
sole class of "residual  interests" therein for purposes of the REMIC Provisions
(as  defined  herein)  under  federal  income tax law.  On and after the date of
issuance of any Subclass of Class A-V Certificates  pursuant to Section 5.01(c),

Interests  Z  specified  by the  initial  Holder of the  Class A-V  Certificates
pursuant to said Section.

               CERTAIN MATTERS REGARDING THE CERTIFICATE INSURER

Section 12.01.  Rights of the  Certificate  Insurer To Exercise Rights of Retail
     Certificateholders.

               By  accepting  its  Certificate,  each  Retail  Certificateholder
agrees that unless a Certificate Insurer Default exists, the Certificate Insurer
shall  have the right to  exercise  all  consent,  voting,  direction  and other
control rights of the Retail Certificateholders under this Agreement without any
further consent of the Retail Certificateholders.

Section 12.02.Claims Upon the Certificate Policy; Certificate Insurance Account.

        (a) If, on any Determination  Date, the Master Servicer  determines that
(i) the funds that will be on deposit in the Certificate  Account on the related
Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date, to the extent  distributable  to any Retail
Certificateholders  pursuant to Section  4.02(a)(i),  together  with any Reserve
Fund I Withdrawal  and Reserve Fund II Withdrawal  for the related  Distribution
Date,  are  insufficient  to pay the full  amount of  interest  for the  related
Interest  Accrual  Period on the  Certificate  Principal  Balance  of the Retail
Certificates at the related  Pass-Through  Rate (net of any Prepayment  Interest
Shortfalls  allocated to the Retail  Certificates  and any Relief Act Shortfalls
allocated to the Retail Certificates that were otherwise covered by Reserve Fund
II) on such Distribution Date, (ii) the principal portion of any Realized Losses
are allocated to the Retail  Certificates on such Distribution Date or (iii) the
funds  that  will  be on  deposit  in the  Certificate  Account,  to the  extent
distributable to the Retail  Certificateholders with respect to principal on the
Scheduled Final Distribution Date will be insufficient to reduce the Certificate
Principal Balance of the Retail  Certificates to zero, the Master Servicer shall
deliver to the  Trustee  not later  than  11:00  a.m.  New York City time on the
Determination  Date a certificate  signed by a Servicing  Officer  directing the
Trustee to draw on the Certificate Policy and stating the amount to be drawn and
stating the Insured Payment for each Retail  Certificate,  and the Trustee shall
give notice by telephone or telecopy of the aggregate amount of such deficiency,
confirmed  in  writing  in the form set forth as  Exhibit  A to the  Certificate
Policy,  to the  Certificate  Insurer  and the Fiscal  Agent (as  defined in the
Certificate Policy), if any, at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
second  Business Day prior to such  Distribution  Date.  If,  subsequent to such
notice, and prior to payment by the Certificate Insurer pursuant to such notice,
additional amounts are deposited in the Certificate  Account,  the Trustee shall
reasonably  promptly notify the  Certificate  Insurer and withdraw the notice or
reduce the amount claimed, as appropriate.

        (b) The Trustee shall establish a separate special purpose trust account
for the  benefit  of  Holders of any  Retail  Certificates  and the  Certificate
Insurer referred to herein as the Certificate  Insurance  Account over which the
Trustee shall have exclusive  control and sole right of withdrawal.  The Trustee
shall deposit any amount paid under the  Certificate  Policy in the  Certificate
Insurance  Account and  distribute  such amount only for  purposes of payment to
Holders of Retail  Certificates  of the  Insured  Payment  for which a claim was
made.  Such  amount  may not be  applied  to  satisfy  any  costs,  expenses  or
liabilities of the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the Trust Fund. Amounts paid
under the Certificate Policy shall be transferred to the Certificate  Account in

<PAGE>

accordance with the second succeeding  paragraph and disbursed by the Trustee to
Holders  of Retail  Certificates  in  accordance  with  Section  4.02 or Section
9.01(c),  as applicable.  It shall not be necessary for such payments to be made
by checks or wire  transfers  separate from the checks or wire transfers used to
pay the Insured Payment with other funds available to make such payment.

        However,  the amount of any payment of  principal  of or interest on the
Retail  Certificates  to be paid from  funds  transferred  from the  Certificate
Insurance  Account  shall be noted as provided in paragraph (c) below and in the
statement  to be furnished  to Holders of the  Certificates  pursuant to Section
4.03. Funds held in the Certificate  Insurance  Account shall not be invested by
the Master Servicer, the Company or the Trustee.

        On any  Distribution  Date with  respect  to which a claim has been made
under the Certificate Policy, the amount of any funds received by the Trustee as
a result of any claim under the  Certificate  Policy,  to the extent required to
make the Insured Payment on such Distribution  Date, shall be withdrawn from the
Certificate  Insurance  Account and  deposited  in the  Certificate  Account and
applied by the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee, together with the other
funds to be  distributed  to the Retail  Certificateholders  pursuant to Section
4.02,  directly to the payment in full of the Insured  Payment due on the Retail
Certificates.  Any funds remaining in the Certificate  Insurance  Account on the
first  Business  Day  following  a  Distribution  Date shall be  remitted to the
Certificate Insurer, pursuant to the instructions of the Certificate Insurer, by
the end of such Business Day.

        (c) The Trustee shall keep a complete and accurate  record of the amount
of interest and principal paid into the Certificate Insurance Account in respect
of any Retail Certificate from moneys received under the Certificate Policy. The
Certificate  Insurer  shall have the right to inspect such records at reasonable
times during normal  business  hours upon two Business Day's prior notice to the
Trustee.

        (d) In accordance with the terms of the Certificate Policy, any claim on
the  Certificate  Policy in respect of a Preference  Amount,  shall  require the
Trustee  to obtain a  certified  copy of the  order  requiring  the  return of a
preference  payment,  an  opinion  of counsel  satisfactory  to the  Certificate
Insurer  that  the  order  is  final  and  not  subject  to  appeal,  and  other
documentation as required by the Certificate Policy. Any such opinion of counsel
shall be provided at the sole expense of the Senior  Underwriter,  in accordance
with the terms of the Commitment Letter.

          Section   12.03.Effect  of  Payments  by  the   Certificate   Insurer;
     Subrogation.

        Anything  herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  for purposes of this
Section  12.03,  any payment  with  respect to  principal  of or interest on any
Retail  Certificates which is made with monies received pursuant to the terms of
the  Certificate   Policy  shall  not  be  considered   payment  of  any  Retail
Certificates  from the Trust  Fund.  The Master  Servicer,  the  Company and the
Trustee acknowledge,  and each Holder by its acceptance of an Retail Certificate
agrees,  that  without  the  need  for any  further  action  on the  part of the
Certificate  Insurer,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Company,  the  Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar,  to the extent the  Certificate  Insurer makes payments,
directly or  indirectly,  on account of  principal  of or interest on any Retail

be fully subrogated to, and each Retail Certificateholder,  the Master Servicer,
the  Company  and the  Trustee  hereby  delegate  and assign to the  Certificate
Insurer,  to the fullest extent  permitted by law, the rights of such Holders to
receive such  principal  and  interest  from the Trust Fund;  provided  that the
Certificate  Insurer shall be paid such amounts only from the sources and in the
manner explicitly provided for herein.

        The Trustee and the Master Servicer shall cooperate in all respects with
any  reasonable  request by the  Certificate  Insurer  for action to preserve or
enforce the  Certificate  Insurer's  rights or  interests  under this  Agreement
without  limiting  the  rights or  affecting  the  interests  of the  Holders as
otherwise set forth herein.

        Section 12.04.Notices and Information to the Certificate Insurer.

by this Agreement to be sent to any other party hereto,  to the Rating  Agencies

to the Certificate Insurer to provide reasonable access to information regarding
the Mortgage Loans.

        Section 12.05.Trustee to Hold Certificate Policy.

Retail   Certificateholders  for  the  purpose  of  making  claims  thereof  and
distributing the proceeds thereof. Each Retail  Certificateholder,  by accepting
its  Certificate,  appoints the Trustee as  attorney-in-fact  for the purpose of
making  claims on the  Certificate  Policy.  The  Trustee  shall  surrender  the
Certificate  Policy  to  the  Certificate  Insurer  for  cancellation  upon  the
expiration of the term of the Certificate  Policy as provided in the Certificate
Policy following the retirement of any Retail Certificates.

        Section 12.06.Ratings.

        The parties  hereto agree that  references  in this  Agreement or in the
Standard   Terms  to  ratings  on  the   Certificates   or   interests   of  the
Certificateholders shall be determined without regard to the Certificate Policy.

        Section 12.07.Third-Party Beneficiary.

        The Certificate Insurer shall be an express  third-party  beneficiary of
this Agreement to the extent of its express  subrogation  rights and its express
rights,  including its rights to receive Insurance Premiums set forth in Section
4.02(a)  of the  Agreement  and shall  have the  right to  enforce  the  related
provisions of this Agreement as if it were a party hereto.

<PAGE>

(iv), (vii), (ix) and (x) (or copies thereof as permitted by Section 2.01(b)) to
the Trustee or the Custodian or Custodians, deliver such documents to the Master
Servicer, and the Master Servicer shall hold such documents in trust for the use
and benefit of all present and future  Certificateholders  until such time as is
set forth in the next  sentence.  Within  thirty  Business  Days  following  the
earlier  of (i)  the  receipt  of the  original  of  all  of  the  documents  or
instruments set forth in Section 2.01(b)(I)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) and Section

Section)  for any  Mortgage  Loan and (ii) a written  request by the  Trustee to
deliver those  documents  with respect to any or all of the Mortgage  Loans then
being held by the Master Servicer,  the Master Servicer shall deliver a complete
set of such documents to the Trustee or the Custodian or Custodians that are the
duly appointed agent or agents of the Trustee.

(d)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 2.01(c),  in connection with any
Mortgage Loan, if the Company  cannot deliver the original of the Mortgage,  any
assignment,  modification,  assumption agreement or preferred loan agreement (or
copy thereof as permitted by Section 2.01(b)) with evidence of recording thereon
concurrently  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement because of (i) a
delay caused by the public  recording  office where such  Mortgage,  assignment,
modification,  assumption  agreement or preferred loan agreement as the case may
be,  has been  delivered  for  recordation,  or (ii) a delay in the  receipt  of
certain information  necessary to prepare the related  assignments,  the Company
shall  deliver  or  cause  to be  delivered  to the  Trustee  or the  respective
Custodian  a  copy  of  such  Mortgage,  assignment,  modification,   assumption
agreement or preferred loan agreement.

        The Company  shall  promptly  cause to be  recorded  in the  appropriate
public office for real  property  records the  Assignment  referred to in clause
(I)(iii)  of Section  2.01(b),  except (a) in states  where,  in the  opinion of
counsel acceptable to the Trustee and the Master Servicer, such recording is not
required to protect the  Trustee's  interests in the  Mortgage  Loan against the
claim of any  subsequent  transferee  or any  successor  to or  creditor  of the
Company or the  originator of such Mortgage Loan or (b) if MERS is identified on
the  Mortgage  or on a  properly  recorded  assignment  of the  Mortgage  as the
mortgagee  of record  solely as nominee  for the Seller and its  successors  and
assigns,  and shall  promptly  cause to be filed the Form UCC-3  assignment  and
UCC-1 financing statement referred to in clause (II)(vii) and (x), respectively,
of Section 2.01(b). If any Assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1, as applicable,
is lost or returned unrecorded to the Company because of any defect therein, the
Company  shall  prepare a substitute  Assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1,  as
applicable,  or cure such defect,  as the case may be, and cause such Assignment
to be recorded in accordance  with this  paragraph.  The Company shall  promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the respective Custodian such
Mortgage or  Assignment  or Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1,  as  applicable,  (or copy
thereof as permitted by Section  2.01(b)) with  evidence of recording  indicated
thereon  at the time  specified  in  Section  2.01(c).  In  connection  with its
servicing of Cooperative Loans, the Master Servicer will use its best efforts to
file timely continuation  statements with regard to each financing statement and
assignment  relating to  Cooperative  Loans as to which the related  Cooperative
Apartment is located outside of the State of New York.

        If the Company delivers to the Trustee or Custodian any Mortgage Note or
Assignment of Mortgage in blank, the Company shall, or shall cause the Custodian
to, complete the endorsement of the Mortgage Note and the Assignment of Mortgage
in the name of the Trustee in conjunction with the Interim  Certification issued
by the Custodian, as contemplated by Section 2.02.

        Any of the items set forth in Sections  2.01(b)(I)(ii),  (iii), (iv) and
(v) and  (II)(vi)  and (vii) and that may be delivered as a copy rather than the
original may be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian.

        In connection with the assignment of any Mortgage Loan registered on the
MERS(R) System,  the Company further agrees that it will cause, at the Company's
own expense,  within 30 Business Days after the Closing Date, the MERS(R) System
to indicate  that such  Mortgage  Loans have been assigned by the Company to the
Trustee   in   accordance   with  this   Agreement   for  the   benefit  of  the
Certificateholders  by including  (or  deleting,  in the case of Mortgage  Loans
which are  repurchased in accordance with this Agreement) in such computer files
(a) the code in the field which identifies the specific Trustee and (b) the code
in the field "Pool Field" which identifies the series of the Certificates issued
in connection with such Mortgage Loans.  The Company further agrees that it will
not, and will not permit the Master  Servicer to, and the Master Servicer agrees
that it will not,  alter the codes  referenced in this paragraph with respect to
any  Mortgage  Loan  during  the term of this  Agreement  unless  and until such
Mortgage Loan is repurchased in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


(e) Residential  Funding hereby assigns to the Trustee its security  interest in

due or to become due in respect of any  Additional  Collateral or Pledged Assets
pursuant to the related  Subservicing  Agreement  and its rights as  beneficiary
under the Surety  Bond in  respect  of any  Additional  Collateral  Loans.  With
respect to any  Additional  Collateral  Loan or Pledged Asset Loan,  Residential
Funding  shall  cause to be filed in the  appropriate  recording  office a UCC-3
statement  giving notice of the assignment of the related  security  interest to
the Trust Fund and shall  thereafter  cause the timely  filing of all  necessary
continuation statements with regard to such financing statements.

(f) It is  intended  that the  conveyance  by the  Company to the Trustee of the
Mortgage  Loans as provided for in this  Section 2.01 be and the  Uncertificated
REMIC Regular Interests,  if any (as provided for in Section 2.06), be construed
as a  sale  by the  Company  to  the  Trustee  of the  Mortgage  Loans  and  any
Uncertificated    REMIC    Regular    Interests   for   the   benefit   of   the
Certificateholders.  Further,  it is not intended that such conveyance be deemed
to be a pledge  of the  Mortgage  Loans  and any  Uncertificated  REMIC  Regular
Interests by the Company to the Trustee to secure a debt or other  obligation of
the Company.  Nonetheless,  (a) this Agreement is intended to be and hereby is a
security  agreement  within  the  meaning  of  Articles  8 and 9 of the New York
Uniform  Commercial Code and the Uniform Commercial Code of any other applicable
jurisdiction; (b) the conveyance provided for in Section 2.01 shall be deemed to
be,  and hereby  is,  (1) a grant by the  Company  to the  Trustee of a security
interest in all of the  Company's  right  (including  the power to convey  title
thereto), title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to
any and all general intangibles,  payment intangibles,  accounts, chattel paper,
instruments, documents, money, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, goods,
letters of credit,  advices of credit and investment property and other property

insurance policies and all other documents in the related Mortgage File, (B) all
amounts  payable  pursuant to the Mortgage  Loans in  accordance  with the terms
thereof,  (C) any Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests and (D) all proceeds of
the  conversion,   voluntary  or  involuntary,   of  the  foregoing  into  cash,
instruments,  securities or other  property,  including  without  limitation all
amounts  from time to time held or  invested in the  Certificate  Account or the
Custodial Account, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other
property  and (2) an  assignment  by the Company to the Trustee of any  security
interest in any and all of Residential  Funding's right  (including the power to
convey  title  thereto),  title and  interest,  whether  now owned or  hereafter
acquired, in and to the property described in the foregoing clauses (1)(A), (B),
(C) and (D)  granted by  Residential  Funding  to the  Company  pursuant  to the
Assignment  Agreement;  (c) the possession by the Trustee,  the Custodian or any
other agent of the Trustee of Mortgage  Notes or such other items of property as
constitute instruments, money, payment intangibles, negotiable documents, goods,
deposit accounts,  letters of credit,  advices of credit,  investment  property,
certificated  securities or chattel paper shall be deemed to be  "possession  by
the secured party," or possession by a purchaser or a person  designated by such
secured party, for purposes of perfecting the security  interest pursuant to the
Minnesota Uniform  Commercial Code and the Uniform  Commercial Code of any other
applicable  jurisdiction as in effect (including,  without limitation,  Sections
8-106,  9-313 and 9-106 thereof);  and (d) notifications to persons holding such
property,  and  acknowledgments,  receipts or confirmations from persons holding
such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, securities intermediaries,  bailees or agents of, or persons
holding for (as  applicable)  the Trustee  for the  purpose of  perfecting  such
security interest under applicable law.

        The Company and, at the Company's direction, Residential Funding and the
Trustee  shall,  to  the  extent  consistent  with  this  Agreement,  take  such
reasonable  actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this  Agreement  were
determined  to  create  a  security   interest  in  the  Mortgage   Loans,   any
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interests and the other property  described above,
such security  interest would be determined to be a perfected  security interest
of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout
the term of this  Agreement.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior
to any filing date and, the Trustee shall forward for filing,  or shall cause to
be forwarded for filing, at the expense of the Company, all filings necessary to
maintain the  effectiveness of any original filings  necessary under the Uniform
Commercial  Code as in effect  in any  jurisdiction  to  perfect  the  Trustee's
security interest in or lien on the Mortgage Loans and any Uncertificated  REMIC
Regular  Interests,  as evidenced by an  Officers'  Certificate  of the Company,
including  without  limitation (x) continuation  statements,  and (y) such other
statements  as may be  occasioned  by (1) any  change  of  name  of  Residential
Funding, the Company or the Trustee (such preparation and filing shall be at the
expense of the Trustee,  if occasioned by a change in the Trustee's  name),  (2)
any change of location of the place of business or the chief executive office of
Residential  Funding  or the  Company,  (3)  any  transfer  of any  interest  of
Residential  Funding or the Company in any Mortgage  Loan or (4) any transfer of
any interest of Residential  Funding or the Company in any Uncertificated  REMIC
Regular Interest.

(g) The Master  Servicer  hereby  acknowledges  the receipt by it of the Initial
Monthly  Payment  Fund.  The Master  Servicer  shall hold such  Initial  Monthly
Payment Fund in the  Custodial  Account and shall  include such Initial  Monthly
Payment Fund in the Available  Distribution Amount for the initial  Distribution
Date.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the  contrary,  the Initial  Monthly
Payment Fund shall not be an asset of any REMIC.  To the extent that the Initial
Monthly Payment Fund constitutes a reserve fund for federal income tax purposes,
(1) it shall be an outside  reserve  fund and not an asset of any REMIC,  (2) it
shall be owned by the Seller  and (3)  amounts  transferred  by any REMIC to the
Initial  Monthly  Payment Fund shall be treated as  transferred to the Seller or
any  successor,  all within the meaning of Section  1.860G-2(h)  of the Treasury
Regulations.

(h) The Company agrees that the sale of each Pledged Asset Loan pursuant to this
Agreement will also constitute the assignment, sale, setting-over,  transfer and
conveyance  to the  Trustee,  without  recourse  (but  subject to the  Company's
covenants,  representations and warranties specifically provided herein), of all
of the Company's  obligations and all of the Company's right, title and interest
in, to and under,  whether now  existing or  hereafter  acquired as owner of the
Mortgage  Loan  with  respect  to  any  and  all  money,  securities,   security
entitlements,  accounts, general intangibles, payment intangibles,  instruments,
documents, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, commodities contracts, and
other  investment  property and other  property of whatever kind or  description
consisting of, arising from or related to (i) the Assigned  Contracts,  (ii) all
rights,  powers and remedies of the Company as owner of such Mortgage Loan under
or in connection with the Assigned Contracts, whether arising under the terms of
such Assigned  Contracts,  by statute, at law or in equity, or otherwise arising
out of any default by the  Mortgagor  under or in  connection  with the Assigned
Contracts,  including  all rights to exercise  any election or option or to make
any  decision  or  determination  or to give or  receive  any  notice,  consent,

securities,  security  entitlements,   accounts,  general  intangibles,  payment

or substitutions therefor, proceeds of proceeds and the conversion, voluntary or

person  in  connection  with the  Pledged  Assets  or  under  any  agreement  or
instrument  relating thereto,  including any obligation to the Mortgagor,  other
than as owner of the Mortgage Loan.

Section 2.02.  Acceptance by Trustee.
               ---------------------

        The Trustee  acknowledges  receipt (or,  with respect to Mortgage  Loans
subject  to  a  Custodial  Agreement,   and  based  solely  upon  a  receipt  or
certification executed by the Custodian,  receipt by the respective Custodian as


                                       36
<PAGE>

the duly appointed agent of the Trustee) of the documents referred to in Section
2.01(b)(i)  above  (except  that for  purposes of such  acknowledgement  only, a
Mortgage  Note may be endorsed in blank) and declares that it, or a Custodian as
its  agent,  holds  and  will  hold  such  documents  and  the  other  documents
constituting a part of the Mortgage Files delivered to it, or a Custodian as its
agent, and the rights of Residential Funding with respect to any Pledged Assets,
Additional  Collateral  and the Surety Bond assigned to the Trustee  pursuant to
Section  2.01,  in trust  for the use and  benefit  of all  present  and  future
Certificateholders.  The Trustee or Custodian (such Custodian being so obligated
under a Custodial Agreement) agrees, for the benefit of  Certificateholders,  to
review each Mortgage File delivered to it pursuant to Section  2.01(b) within 45
days  after  the  Closing  Date  to  ascertain   that  all  required   documents
(specifically as set forth in Section 2.01(b)), have been executed and received,
and that such documents  relate to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage
Loan Schedule, as supplemented, that have been conveyed to it, and to deliver to
the Trustee a certificate (the "Interim  Certification")  to the effect that all
documents  required to be delivered  pursuant to Section 2.01(b) above have been
executed  and  received and that such  documents  relate to the  Mortgage  Loans
identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule,  except for any  exceptions  listed on
Schedule A attached to such Interim Certification. Upon delivery of the Mortgage
Files by the  Company or the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  shall  acknowledge
receipt (or, with respect to Mortgage  Loans  subject to a Custodial  Agreement,
and based  solely upon a receipt or  certification  executed  by the  Custodian,
receipt by the respective  Custodian as the duly appointed agent of the Trustee)
of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(c) above.

        If  the  Custodian,  as the  Trustee's  agent,  finds  any  document  or
documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be missing or defective, the
Trustee shall promptly so notify the Master  Servicer and the Company.  Pursuant
to Section 2.3 of the Custodial Agreement,  the Custodian will notify the Master
Servicer, the Company and the Trustee of any such omission or defect found by it
in respect of any Mortgage  File held by it in respect of the items  reviewed by
it pursuant to the Custodial  Agreement.  If such omission or defect  materially
and  adversely  affects  the  interests  of the  Certificateholders,  the Master
Servicer  shall  promptly  notify  the  related  Subservicer  or  Seller of such
omission or defect and request that such  Subservicer  or Seller correct or cure
such  omission or defect  within 60 days from the date the Master  Servicer  was
notified of such omission or defect and, if such  Subservicer or Seller does not
correct  or  cure  such  omission  or  defect  within  such  period,  that  such
Subservicer  or Seller  purchase  such  Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at its
Purchase  Price, in either case within 90 days from the date the Master Servicer
was notified of such omission or defect; provided that if the omission or defect
would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" as defined
in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, any such cure or repurchase must occur within
90 days from the date such breach was  discovered.  The  Purchase  Price for any
such Mortgage Loan, whether purchased by the Seller or the Subservicer, shall be
deposited  or caused to be  deposited  by the Master  Servicer in the  Custodial
Account  maintained  by it pursuant  to Section  3.07 and,  upon  receipt by the
Trustee of written  notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,
the Trustee or any  Custodian,  as the case may be, shall  release to the Master
Servicer the related  Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver
such instruments of transfer or assignment  prepared by the Master Servicer,  in
each case without  recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller or its
designee or the  Subservicer  or its designee,  as the case may be, any Mortgage
Loan released  pursuant  hereto and  thereafter  such Mortgage Loan shall not be
part of the Trust Fund. In furtherance of the foregoing,  if the  Subservicer or
Seller  that  repurchases  the  Mortgage  Loan is not a  member  of MERS and the


                                       37
<PAGE>

Mortgage is registered on the MERS(R) System,  the Master  Servicer,  at its own
expense and without any right of reimbursement,  shall cause MERS to execute and
deliver an  assignment  of the  Mortgage  in  recordable  form to  transfer  the
Mortgage from MERS to such  Subservicer  or Seller and shall cause such Mortgage
to be removed from  registration  on the MERS(R) System in accordance with MERS'
rules and  regulations.  It is understood  and agreed that the obligation of the
Seller  or the  Subservicer,  as the case  may be,  to so cure or  purchase  any
Mortgage  Loan as to which a material  and  adverse  defect in or  omission of a
constituent  document  exists shall  constitute the sole remedy  respecting such
defect or omission available to  Certificateholders  or the Trustee on behalf of
the Certificateholders.

Section 2.03.  Representations, Warranties and Covenants
                      of the Master Servicer and the Company.

(a) The Master  Servicer  hereby  represents and warrants to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders that:

(i)     The Master Servicer is a corporation  duly organized,  validly  existing
        and in good standing under the laws governing its creation and existence
        and is or will be in compliance with the laws of each state in which any
        Mortgaged  Property  is located to the  extent  necessary  to ensure the
        enforceability  of each Mortgage  Loan in  accordance  with the terms of
        this Agreement;

(ii)    The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Master  Servicer and
        its performance and compliance with the terms of this Agreement will not
        violate the Master Servicer's  Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
        constitute a material  default (or an event which,  with notice or lapse
        of time, or both, would constitute a material  default) under, or result
        in the  material  breach of, any material  contract,  agreement or other
        instrument  to which  the  Master  Servicer  is a party or which  may be
        applicable to the Master Servicer or any of its assets;

(iii)   This Agreement,  assuming due  authorization,  execution and delivery by
        the  Trustee and the  Company,  constitutes  a valid,  legal and binding
        obligation of the Master Servicer,  enforceable against it in accordance
        with the terms  hereof  subject to  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
        reorganization,  moratorium and other laws affecting the  enforcement of
        creditors'  rights  generally  and  to  general  principles  of  equity,
        regardless of whether such  enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
        equity or at law;

(iv)    The  Master  Servicer  is not in  default  with  respect to any order or
        decree of any court or any order,  regulation  or demand of any federal,
        state,  municipal  or  governmental  agency,  which  default  might have
        consequences  that would  materially and adversely  affect the condition
        (financial  or  other)  or  operations  of the  Master  Servicer  or its
        properties or might have  consequences  that would materially  adversely
        affect its performance hereunder;

                                       38
<PAGE>

(v)     No  litigation  is  pending  or,  to the best of the  Master  Servicer's
        knowledge,  threatened  against the Master Servicer which would prohibit
        its entering into this  Agreement or performing  its  obligations  under
        this Agreement;

(vi)    The  Master  Servicer  will  comply  in  all  material  respects  in the
        performance of this Agreement with all reasonable rules and requirements
        of each insurer under each Required Insurance Policy;

(vii)   No  information,  certificate  of an  officer,  statement  furnished  in
        writing or report delivered to the Company, any Affiliate of the Company
        or the Trustee by the Master  Servicer  will,  to the  knowledge  of the
        Master Servicer, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
        a  material  fact  necessary  to  make  the  information,   certificate,
        statement or report not misleading;

(viii)  The Master  Servicer has examined each  existing,  and will examine each
        new,  Subservicing  Agreement  and is or will be familiar with the terms
        thereof.  The terms of each  existing  Subservicing  Agreement  and each
        designated Subservicer are acceptable to the Master Servicer and any new
        Subservicing Agreements will comply with the provisions of Section 3.02;
        and

(ix)    The  Master  Servicer  is a member  of MERS in good  standing,  and will
        comply in all material respects with the rules and procedures of MERS in
        connection  with the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are registered
        with MERS.

It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.03(a) shall survive delivery of the respective  Mortgage Files to
the Trustee or any Custodian.

        Upon discovery by either the Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee
or any Custodian of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Section  2.03(a) which  materially  and  adversely  affects the interests of the
Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall
give  prompt  written  notice  to the  other  parties  (any  Custodian  being so
obligated under a Custodial  Agreement).  Within 90 days of its discovery or its
receipt of notice of such breach, the Master Servicer shall either (i) cure such
breach in all  material  respects or (ii) to the extent that such breach is with
respect to a Mortgage  Loan or a related  document,  purchase such Mortgage Loan
from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the manner set forth in Section
2.02;  provided  that if the omission or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to
be other than a  "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the
Code,  any such cure or repurchase  must occur within 90 days from the date such
breach was discovered. The obligation of the Master Servicer to cure such breach
or to so purchase such Mortgage Loan shall constitute the sole remedy in respect
of a breach of a  representation  and warranty set forth in this Section 2.03(a)
available   to  the   Certificateholders   or  the  Trustee  on  behalf  of  the
Certificateholders.

(b)  Representations and warranties relating to the Mortgage Loans are set forth
in Section 2.03(b) of the Series Supplement.

Section 2.04.  Representations and Warranties of Sellers.

        The Company,  as assignee of  Residential  Funding under the  Assignment
Agreement,  hereby assigns to the Trustee for the benefit of  Certificateholders
all of its right, title and interest in respect of the Assignment  Agreement and
each Seller's Agreement applicable to a Mortgage Loan. Insofar as the Assignment
Agreement or the Company's  rights under such Seller's  Agreement  relate to the
representations and warranties made by Residential Funding or the related Seller
in respect of such Mortgage Loan and any remedies  provided  thereunder  for any
breach of such  representations  and warranties,  such right, title and interest
may be  enforced  by the  Master  Servicer  on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and the
Certificateholders.  Upon the discovery by the Company, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee  or  any  Custodian  of a  breach  of any  of  the  representations  and
warranties  made in a Seller's  Agreement that have been assigned to the Trustee
pursuant to this Section 2.04 or of a breach of any of the  representations  and
warranties made in the Assignment Agreement (which, for purposes hereof, will be
deemed to include any other cause giving rise to a repurchase  obligation  under
the Assignment  Agreement) in respect of any Mortgage Loan which  materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan,
the party  discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other
parties (any  Custodian  being so obligated  under a Custodial  Agreement).  The
Master Servicer shall promptly notify the related Seller or Residential Funding,
as the case may be, of such breach and request  that such Seller or  Residential
Funding,  as the case  may be,  either  (i) cure  such  breach  in all  material
respects  within 90 days from the date the Master  Servicer was notified of such
breach or (ii)  purchase  such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase
Price and in the manner set forth in Section 2.02;  provided that in the case of
a breach  under the  Assignment  Agreement  Residential  Funding  shall have the
option to  substitute  a Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans for such
Mortgage Loan if such substitution occurs within two years following the Closing
Date; provided that if the breach would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than
a "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3) of the Code,  any such
cure,  repurchase  or  substitution  must occur within 90 days from the date the
breach  was  discovered.  In  the  event  that  Residential  Funding  elects  to
substitute a Qualified  Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans for a Deleted Mortgage
Loan  pursuant to this Section  2.04,  Residential  Funding shall deliver to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders with respect to such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the original Mortgage Note, the Mortgage,  an
Assignment of the Mortgage in recordable  form, if required  pursuant to Section
2.01,  and such other  documents and agreements as are required by Section 2.01,
with the Mortgage Note  endorsed as required by Section  2.01.  No  substitution
will be made in any calendar month after the Determination  Date for such month.
Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified  Substitute Mortgage Loans in the
month of  substitution  shall not be part of the Trust Fund and will be retained
by the Master  Servicer  and  remitted  by the Master  Servicer  to  Residential
Funding on the next succeeding Distribution Date. For the month of substitution,
distributions to the Certificateholders  will include the Monthly Payment due on
a Deleted Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter  Residential Funding shall
be entitled to retain all amounts  received in respect of such Deleted  Mortgage
Loan.  The Master  Servicer shall amend or cause to be amended the Mortgage Loan
Schedule,  and, if the Deleted  Mortgage Loan was a Discount  Mortgage Loan, the
Schedule of Discount  Fractions,  for the benefit of the  Certificateholders  to
reflect the removal of such Deleted  Mortgage Loan and the  substitution  of the
Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans  and the  Master  Servicer  shall
deliver the amended  Mortgage Loan Schedule,  and, if the Deleted  Mortgage Loan
was a Discount Mortgage Loan, the amended Schedule of Discount Fractions, to the
Trustee. Upon such substitution, the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans
shall be subject to the terms of this  Agreement  and the  related  Subservicing


                                       40
<PAGE>

Agreement in all respects,  the related  Seller shall be deemed to have made the
representations and warranties with respect to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan contained in the related Seller's Agreement as of the date of substitution,
insofar as Residential  Funding's rights in respect of such  representations and
warranties are assigned to the Company pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, and
the Company and the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have made with respect to
any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, as of the date of substitution,
the covenants, representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.04, in
Section 2.03 hereof and in Section 4 of the Assignment Agreement, and the Master
Servicer  shall be obligated  to  repurchase  or  substitute  for any  Qualified
Substitute  Mortgage  Loan as to which a  Repurchase  Event (as  defined  in the
Assignment  Agreement)  has  occurred  pursuant  to Section 4 of the  Assignment
Agreement.

        In connection with the substitution of one or more Qualified  Substitute
Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted  Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer will
determine  the amount (if any) by which the aggregate  principal  balance of all
such Qualified  Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less
than the aggregate Stated  Principal  Balance of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans
(in each case after application of the principal portion of the Monthly Payments
due  in  the  month  of   substitution   that  are  to  be  distributed  to  the
Certificateholders  in the month of  substitution).  Residential  Funding  shall
deposit the amount of such  shortfall  into the Custodial  Account on the day of
substitution, without any reimbursement therefor. Residential Funding shall give
notice  in  writing  to the  Trustee  of  such  event,  which  notice  shall  be
accompanied by an Officers'  Certificate as to the calculation of such shortfall
and  (subject to Section  10.01(f))  by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such  substitution will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust
Fund,  including  without  limitation,  any federal  tax imposed on  "prohibited
transactions"  under Section  860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions  after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code or (b) any portion of any
REMIC  to  fail  to  qualify  as  such  at any  time  that  any  Certificate  is
outstanding.

        It is  understood  and  agreed  that the  obligation  of the  Seller  or
Residential  Funding, as the case may be, to cure such breach or purchase (or in
the case of  Residential  Funding to  substitute  for) such  Mortgage Loan as to
which such a breach has occurred and is  continuing  shall  constitute  the sole
remedy respecting such breach available to the Certificateholders or the Trustee
on behalf of Certificateholders.  If the Master Servicer is Residential Funding,
then the Trustee shall also have the right to give the  notification and require
the purchase or substitution  provided for in the second preceding  paragraph in
the event of such a breach of a  representation  or warranty made by Residential
Funding in the  Assignment  Agreement.  In  connection  with the  purchase of or
substitution  for any such Mortgage  Loan by  Residential  Funding,  the Trustee
shall  assign to  Residential  Funding  all of the  Trustee's  right,  title and
interest  in respect of the  Seller's  Agreement  and the  Assignment  Agreement
applicable to such Mortgage Loan.

     Certificates Evidencing Interests in REMIC I Certificates.

               As provided in Section 2.05 of the Series Supplement.

               As provided in Section 2.07 of the Series Supplement.

Section 2.08.  Purposes and Powers of the Trust.

        The  purpose of the trust,  as  created  hereunder,  is to engage in the
following activities:

(a) to sell the Certificates to the Company in exchange for the Mortgage Loans;

(b)     to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement;

(c) to engage in those activities that are necessary,  suitable or convenient to
accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or connected therewith; and

(d)  subject  to  compliance  with  this  Agreement,  to  engage  in such  other
activities as may be required in connection with  conservation of the Trust Fund
and the making of distributions to the Certificateholders.

               The  trust  is  hereby  authorized  to  engage  in the  foregoing
activities. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.01, the trust shall not
engage in any activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than
as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement  while any  Certificate
is outstanding, and this Section 2.08 may not be amended, without the consent of
the  Certificateholders  evidencing a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights of
the Certificates.

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING

                                OF MORTGAGE LOANS

Section 3.01.  Master Servicer to Act as Servicer.

(a) The Master  Servicer  shall  service and  administer  the Mortgage  Loans in
accordance  with the terms of this Agreement and the  respective  Mortgage Loans
and shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through Subservicers as
provided in Section 3.02,  to do any and all things which it may deem  necessary
or desirable in  connection  with such  servicing  and  administration.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer in its own name or
in the name of a Subservicer  is hereby  authorized and empowered by the Trustee
when the Master  Servicer or the  Subservicer,  as the case may be,  believes it
appropriate  in its best  judgment,  to execute  and  deliver,  on behalf of the
Certificateholders  and the Trustee or any of them,  any and all  instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation,  or of partial or full release or discharge, or of
consent to assumption or modification in connection with a proposed  conveyance,
or of  assignment  of any  Mortgage  and Mortgage  Note in  connection  with the
repurchase  of a Mortgage  Loan and all other  comparable  instruments,  or with
respect to the  modification  or  re-recording  of a Mortgage for the purpose of
correcting the Mortgage,  the subordination of the lien of the Mortgage in favor
of a public utility company or government  agency or unit with powers of eminent
domain,  the  taking  of a  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  the  commencement,
prosecution  or  completion  of  judicial  or  non-judicial   foreclosure,   the
conveyance of a Mortgaged  Property to the related  Insurer,  the acquisition of
any property  acquired by  foreclosure  or deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  or the
management,  marketing and conveyance of any property acquired by foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure  with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect
to the Mortgaged  Properties.  The Master  Servicer  further is  authorized  and
empowered by the Trustee, on behalf of the  Certificateholders  and the Trustee,
in its own name or in the name of the  Subservicer,  when the Master Servicer or
the  Subservicer,  as the  case  may be,  believes  it  appropriate  in its best
judgment to register  any  Mortgage  Loan on the  MERS(R)  System,  or cause the
removal from the  registration  of any Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)  System,  to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee and the  Certificateholders or any
of them, any and all instruments of assignment and other comparable  instruments
with respect to such  assignment  or  re-recording  of a Mortgage in the name of
MERS,  solely as nominee for the Trustee and its  successors  and  assigns.  Any
expenses  incurred in  connection  with the actions  described in the  preceding
sentence  shall be borne by the  Master  Servicer  in  accordance  with  Section
3.16(c), with no right of reimbursement;  provided, that if, as a result of MERS
discontinuing  or becoming unable to continue  operations in connection with the
MERS System,  it becomes necessary to remove any Mortgage Loan from registration
on the MERS System and to arrange for the assignment of the related Mortgages to
the  Trustee,  then any related  expenses  shall be  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 3.07(a), the Master
Servicer  shall not permit any  modification  with respect to any Mortgage  Loan
that would both  constitute a sale or exchange of such  Mortgage Loan within the
meaning  of  Section  1001 of the  Code  and any  proposed,  temporary  or final
regulations  promulgated  thereunder  (other than in connection  with a proposed
conveyance  or  assumption  of such Mortgage Loan that is treated as a Principal
Prepayment  in Full  pursuant  to Section  3.13(d)  hereof)  and cause any REMIC
formed under the Series Supplement to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code.
The Trustee  shall  furnish the Master  Servicer with any powers of attorney and
other  documents  necessary  or  appropriate  to enable the Master  Servicer  to


                                       43
<PAGE>

service and administer the Mortgage  Loans.  The Trustee shall not be liable for
any action  taken by the Master  Servicer  or any  Subservicer  pursuant to such
powers of attorney.  In servicing and administering any Nonsubserviced  Mortgage
Loan,  the Master  Servicer  shall,  to the extent  not  inconsistent  with this
Agreement,  comply with the Program  Guide as if it were the  originator of such
Mortgage Loan and had retained the servicing  rights and  obligations in respect
thereof.  In connection with servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
Master  Servicer  and any  Affiliate  of the  Master  Servicer  (i) may  perform
services such as  appraisals  and  brokerage  services that are not  customarily
provided by servicers  of mortgage  loans,  and shall be entitled to  reasonable
compensation  therefor in accordance  with Section 3.10 and (ii) may, at its own
discretion and on behalf of the Trustee,  obtain credit  information in the form
of a "credit score" from a credit repository.

(b) All costs incurred by the Master  Servicer or by  Subservicers  in effecting
the timely payment of taxes and  assessments  on the  properties  subject to the
Mortgage Loans shall not, for the purpose of calculating  monthly  distributions
to the  Certificateholders,  be added to the  amount  owing  under  the  related
Mortgage Loans,  notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit,
and  such  costs  shall  be  recoverable  to the  extent  permitted  by  Section
3.10(a)(ii).

(c) The Master Servicer may enter into one or more agreements in connection with
the offering of pass-through certificates evidencing interests in one or more of
the  Certificates  providing  for the payment by the Master  Servicer of amounts
received by the Master Servicer as servicing compensation hereunder and required
to cover certain  Prepayment  Interest  Shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans,  which
payment  obligation  will  thereafter be an  obligation  of the Master  Servicer
hereunder.

Section 3.02.  Subservicing Agreements Between Master Servicer and Subservicers;
     Enforcement of Subservicers' and Sellers' Obligations.

(a) The Master Servicer may continue in effect  Subservicing  Agreements entered
into by Residential Funding and Subservicers prior to the execution and delivery
of  this  Agreement,  and  may  enter  into  new  Subservicing  Agreements  with
Subservicers,  for  the  servicing  and  administration  of all or  some  of the
Mortgage Loans. Each Subservicer of a Mortgage Loan shall be entitled to receive
and retain,  as provided in the related  Subservicing  Agreement  and in Section
3.07, the related  Subservicing  Fee from payments of interest  received on such
Mortgage Loan after payment of all amounts required to be remitted to the Master
Servicer  in respect of such  Mortgage  Loan.  For any  Mortgage  Loan that is a
Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer shall be entitled to receive
and retain an amount equal to the  Subservicing  Fee from  payments of interest.
Unless the context otherwise  requires,  references in this Agreement to actions
taken or to be taken by the Master  Servicer in  servicing  the  Mortgage  Loans
include  actions taken or to be taken by a  Subservicer  on behalf of the Master
Servicer.  Each Subservicing Agreement will be upon such terms and conditions as
are  generally   required  or  permitted  by  the  Program  Guide  and  are  not
inconsistent  with this Agreement and as the Master Servicer and the Subservicer
have agreed. A representative form of Subservicing Agreement is attached to this


                                       44
<PAGE>

Agreement as Exhibit E. With the approval of the Master Servicer,  a Subservicer
may  delegate its  servicing  obligations  to  third-party  servicers,  but such
Subservicer will remain obligated under the related Subservicing Agreement.  The
Master  Servicer  and a  Subservicer  may enter  into  amendments  thereto  or a
different form of Subservicing  Agreement,  and the form referred to or included
in the Program Guide is merely  provided for information and shall not be deemed
to limit in any respect the discretion of the Master Servicer to modify or enter
into  different  Subservicing  Agreements;  provided,  however,  that  any  such
amendments  or  different  forms  shall be  consistent  with and not violate the
provisions of either this Agreement or the Program Guide in a manner which would
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders.

(b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder,  the Master Servicer, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders, shall use its best reasonable
efforts  to  enforce  the  obligations  of each  Subservicer  under the  related
Subservicing  Agreement and of each Seller under the related Seller's  Agreement
insofar as the  Company's  rights with respect to Seller's  obligation  has been
assigned to the Trustee hereunder, to the extent that the non-performance of any
such Seller's  obligation would have a material and adverse effect on a Mortgage
Loan, including,  without limitation, the obligation to purchase a Mortgage Loan
on account of  defective  documentation,  as described  in Section  2.02,  or on
account of a breach of a  representation  or  warranty,  as described in Section
2.04. Such enforcement,  including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of
claims,  termination  of  Subservicing  Agreements  or Seller's  Agreements,  as
appropriate,  and the pursuit of other  appropriate  remedies,  shall be in such
form and carried  out to such an extent and at such time as the Master  Servicer
would employ in its good faith business  judgment and which are normal and usual
in its general mortgage servicing activities.  The Master Servicer shall pay the
costs of such enforcement at its own expense,  and shall be reimbursed  therefor
only (i) from a general recovery  resulting from such enforcement to the extent,
if any,  that such  recovery  exceeds  all amounts due in respect of the related
Mortgage Loan or (ii) from a specific  recovery of costs,  expenses or attorneys
fees against the party against whom such  enforcement is directed.  For purposes
of clarification  only, the parties agree that the foregoing is not intended to,
and does not,  limit the  ability of the Master  Servicer to be  reimbursed  for
expenses  that are incurred in  connection  with the  enforcement  of a Seller's
obligations  (insofar  as the  Company's  rights with  respect to such  Seller's
obligations  have been assigned to the Trustee  hereunder) and are  reimbursable
pursuant to Section 3.10(a)(viii).

Section 3.03.  Successor Subservicers.

        The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  terminate  any  Subservicing
Agreement  that may exist in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions of such
Subservicing  Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that  in the  event  of  termination  of  any  Subservicing
Agreement by the Master Servicer or the  Subservicer,  the Master Servicer shall
either act as servicer of the related Mortgage Loan or enter into a Subservicing
Agreement with a successor  Subservicer  which will be bound by the terms of the
related  Subservicing  Agreement.  If the Master  Servicer or any  Affiliate  of
Residential  Funding  acts as  servicer,  it will not assume  liability  for the
representations  and  warranties of the  Subservicer  which it replaces.  If the
Master  Servicer   enters  into  a  Subservicing   Agreement  with  a  successor
Subservicer,  the  Master  Servicer  shall use  reasonable  efforts  to have the
successor  Subservicer assume liability for the  representations  and warranties
made by the terminated Subservicer in respect of the related Mortgage Loans and,


                                       45
<PAGE>

in the event of any such  assumption  by the successor  Subservicer,  the Master
Servicer may, in the exercise of its business  judgment,  release the terminated
Subservicer from liability for such representations and warranties.

Section 3.04.  Liability of the Master Servicer.
               --------------------------------

        Notwithstanding  any  Subservicing  Agreement,  any of the provisions of
this  Agreement  relating  to  agreements  or  arrangements  between  the Master
Servicer or a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or
otherwise,  the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trustee
and the  Certificateholders  for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage
Loans in accordance  with the  provisions of Section 3.01 without  diminution of
such  obligation  or  liability  by virtue of such  Subservicing  Agreements  or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Subservicer or the Company
and to the same extent and under the same terms and  conditions as if the Master
Servicer alone were servicing and  administering  the Mortgage Loans. The Master
Servicer  shall be entitled to enter into any agreement  with a  Subservicer  or
Seller for  indemnification of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

Section 3.05.  No Contractual Relationship Between Subservicer and
                      Trustee or Certificateholders.
                      -----------------------------

        Any  Subservicing  Agreement  that may be  entered  into  and any  other
transactions or services  relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Subservicer
in its capacity as such and not as an  originator  shall be deemed to be between
the  Subservicer  and  the  Master  Servicer  alone  and  the  Trustee  and  the
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights,  obligations,  duties or liabilities  with respect to the Subservicer in
its  capacity  as such  except  as set  forth in  Section  3.06.  The  foregoing
provision  shall  not in any way  limit a  Subservicer's  obligation  to cure an
omission or defect or to  repurchase  a Mortgage  Loan as referred to in Section
2.02 hereof.

Section 3.06.  Assumption or Termination of Subservicing Agreements by Trustee.
               ---------------------------------------------------------------

(a) If the Master Servicer shall for any reason no longer be the master servicer
(including by reason of an Event of Default),  the Trustee,  its designee or its
successor shall thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the Master
Servicer under each Subservicing  Agreement that may have been entered into. The
Trustee,  its designee or the successor servicer for the Trustee shall be deemed
to have  assumed  all of the  Master  Servicer's  interest  therein  and to have
replaced  the Master  Servicer as a party to the  Subservicing  Agreement to the
same extent as if the  Subservicing  Agreement had been assigned to the assuming
party  except  that the Master  Servicer  shall not  thereby be  relieved of any
liability or obligations under the Subservicing Agreement.

(b) The Master Servicer shall, upon request of the Trustee but at the expense of
the Master  Servicer,  deliver to the assuming  party all  documents and records
relating  to each  Subservicing  Agreement  and the  Mortgage  Loans  then being
serviced and an accounting of amounts collected and held by it and otherwise use
its  best  efforts  to  effect  the  orderly  and  efficient  transfer  of  each
Subservicing Agreement to the assuming party.

Section  3.07.  Collection  of  Certain  Mortgage  Loan  Payments;  Deposits  to
     Custodial Account.

(a) The Master  Servicer shall make  reasonable  efforts to collect all payments
called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage  Loans,  and shall, to
the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and the terms
and provisions of any related Primary Insurance  Policy,  follow such collection
procedures as it would employ in its good faith business  judgment and which are
normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing  activities.  Consistent with
the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer may in its  discretion  (i) waive any late
payment charge or any prepayment  charge or penalty  interest in connection with
the  prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the Due Date for payments due
on a Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Program Guide; provided, however, that
the Master Servicer shall first determine that any such waiver or extension will
not impair the coverage of any related  Primary  Insurance  Policy or materially
adversely  affect  the lien of the  related  Mortgage.  In the event of any such
arrangement,  the Master  Servicer  shall make  timely  advances  on the related
Mortgage Loan during the scheduled  period in accordance  with the  amortization
schedule of such  Mortgage Loan without  modification  thereof by reason of such
arrangements  unless  otherwise  agreed  to by the  Holders  of the  Classes  of
Certificates affected thereby;  provided,  however, that no such extension shall
be made if any such advance would be a Nonrecoverable  Advance.  Consistent with
the terms of this Agreement,  the Master Servicer may also waive, modify or vary
any  term  of any  Mortgage  Loan  or  consent  to the  postponement  of  strict
compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor
if  in  the  Master   Servicer's   determination   such  waiver,   modification,
postponement  or  indulgence is not  materially  adverse to the interests of the
Certificateholders  (taking into account any estimated  Realized Loss that might
result absent such action); provided,  however, that the Master Servicer may not
modify  materially  or permit  any  Subservicer  to modify  any  Mortgage  Loan,
including  without  limitation any  modification  that would change the Mortgage
Rate,  forgive the payment of any  principal or interest  (unless in  connection
with the  liquidation of the related  Mortgage Loan or except in connection with
prepayments to the extent that such  reamortization is not inconsistent with the
terms of the Mortgage  Loan), or extend the final maturity date of such Mortgage
Loan,  unless such Mortgage Loan is in default or, in the judgment of the Master
Servicer, such default is reasonably foreseeable; and provided, further, that no
such  modification  shall reduce the interest  rate on a Mortgage Loan below the
sum of the Pool Strip Rate and the sum of the rates at which the  Servicing  Fee
and the  Subservicing  Fee  with  respect  to such  Mortgage  Loan  accrues.  In
connection with any Curtailment of a Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer,  to the
extent not  inconsistent  with the terms of the Mortgage  Note and local law and
practice,  may permit the Mortgage Loan to be reamortized  such that the Monthly
Payment is  recalculated  as an amount that will fully  amortize  the  remaining
Stated  Principal  Balance  thereof by the original  Maturity  Date based on the
original  Mortgage  Rate;  provided,  that  such  re-amortization  shall  not be
permitted if it would  constitute a reissuance  of the Mortgage Loan for federal
income  tax  purposes,  except  if such  reissuance  is  described  in  Treasury
Regulation Section 1.860G-2(b)(3).

(b) The Master  Servicer  shall  establish  and maintain a Custodial  Account in
which the Master  Servicer  shall  deposit or cause to be  deposited  on a daily
basis, except as otherwise  specifically provided herein, the following payments
and  collections  remitted by  Subservicers  or received by it in respect of the
Mortgage  Loans  subsequent  to the  Cut-off  Date  (other  than in  respect  of
principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date):

                                       47
<PAGE>

(i)     All payments on account of principal,  including  Principal  Prepayments
        made by Mortgagors on the Mortgage Loans and the principal  component of
        any  Subservicer  Advance or of any REO Proceeds  received in connection
        with an REO Property for which an REO Disposition has occurred;

(ii)    All payments on account of interest at the Adjusted Mortgage Rate on the
        Mortgage  Loans,  including  Buydown  Funds,  if any,  and the  interest
        component of any Subservicer  Advance or of any REO Proceeds received in
        connection  with  an REO  Property  for  which  an REO  Disposition  has
        occurred;

(iii)Insurance Proceeds,  Subsequent Recoveries and Liquidation Proceeds (net of
     any related expenses of the Subservicer);

(iv)    All proceeds of any Mortgage Loans  purchased  pursuant to Section 2.02,
        2.03,  2.04  or  4.07  and  all  amounts  required  to be  deposited  in
        connection with the substitution of a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan
        pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04;

(v)  Any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section 3.07(c) or 3.21;

(vi) All  amounts  transferred  from the  Certificate  Account to the  Custodial
     Account in accordance with Section 4.02(a);

(vii)Any  amounts  realized  by the  Subservicer  and  received  by  the  Master
     Servicer in respect of any Additional Collateral; and

(viii) Any amounts received by the Master Servicer in respect of Pledged Assets.

The  foregoing  requirements  for  deposit  in the  Custodial  Account  shall be
exclusive,  it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments on the Mortgage Loans which are not part of the Trust
Fund  (consisting  of  payments  in respect of  principal  and  interest  on the
Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date) and payments or collections in
the nature of prepayment  charges or late payment charges or assumption fees may
but need not be deposited by the Master  Servicer in the Custodial  Account.  In
the event any amount not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account is so
deposited,  the Master  Servicer may at any time  withdraw  such amount from the
Custodial  Account,  any provision herein to the contrary  notwithstanding.  The
Custodial  Account  may  contain  funds that  belong to one or more trust  funds
created for mortgage  pass-through  certificates of other series and may contain
other  funds  respecting  payments  on mortgage  loans  belonging  to the Master
Servicer  or   serviced   or  master   serviced  by  it  on  behalf  of  others.
Notwithstanding  such  commingling  of funds,  the  Master  Servicer  shall keep
records that  accurately  reflect the funds on deposit in the Custodial  Account
that have been identified by it as being attributable to the Mortgage Loans.

        With respect to Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds,  REO Proceeds
and the proceeds of the purchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Sections 2.02,
2.03,  2.04 and 4.07  received in any calendar  month,  the Master  Servicer may
elect to treat such amounts as included in the Available Distribution Amount for
the Distribution Date in the month of receipt, but is not obligated to do so. If
the Master Servicer so elects, such amounts will be deemed to have been received
(and any related Realized Loss shall be deemed to have occurred) on the last day
of the month prior to the receipt thereof.

                                       48
<PAGE>

(c) The Master  Servicer  shall use its best  efforts  to cause the  institution
maintaining the Custodial  Account to invest the funds in the Custodial  Account
attributable to the Mortgage Loans in Permitted  Investments  which shall mature
not later than the  Certificate  Account Deposit Date next following the date of
such investment (with the exception of the Amount Held for Future  Distribution)
and which shall not be sold or disposed of prior to their maturities. All income
and gain  realized  from any such  investment  shall be for the  benefit  of the
Master Servicer as additional servicing compensation and shall be subject to its
withdrawal  or order from time to time.  The amount of any  losses  incurred  in
respect of any such  investments  attributable  to the  investment of amounts in
respect of the Mortgage Loans shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the
Master Servicer out of its own funds  immediately as realized  without any right
of reimbursement.

(d) The Master  Servicer shall give notice to the Trustee and the Company of any
change  in the  location  of the  Custodial  Account  and  the  location  of the
Certificate Account prior to the use thereof.

Section 3.08.  Subservicing Accounts; Servicing Accounts.

(a) In those cases where a Subservicer  is servicing a Mortgage Loan pursuant to
a  Subservicing  Agreement,  the Master  Servicer  shall cause the  Subservicer,
pursuant to the  Subservicing  Agreement,  to establish and maintain one or more
Subservicing  Accounts which shall be an Eligible Account or, if such account is
not an Eligible Account, shall generally satisfy the requirements of the Program
Guide and be otherwise acceptable to the Master Servicer and each Rating Agency.
The  Subservicer  will be  required  thereby  to deposit  into the  Subservicing
Account  on a daily  basis  all  proceeds  of  Mortgage  Loans  received  by the
Subservicer,  less its Subservicing Fees and unreimbursed advances and expenses,
to the extent  permitted  by the  Subservicing  Agreement.  If the  Subservicing
Account is not an Eligible Account,  the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have
received such monies upon receipt  thereof by the  Subservicer.  The Subservicer
shall not be  required  to  deposit  in the  Subservicing  Account  payments  or
collections  in the nature of  prepayment  charges or late charges or assumption
fees.  On or before the date  specified  in the Program  Guide,  but in no event
later  than  the  Determination  Date,  the  Master  Servicer  shall  cause  the
Subservicer,  pursuant  to the  Subservicing  Agreement,  to remit to the Master
Servicer for deposit in the Custodial Account all funds held in the Subservicing
Account with respect to each Mortgage Loan serviced by such Subservicer that are
required to be remitted to the Master  Servicer.  The  Subservicer  will also be
required,  pursuant to the Subservicing  Agreement, to advance on such scheduled
date of  remittance  amounts  equal to any  scheduled  monthly  installments  of
principal  and interest  less its  Subservicing  Fees on any Mortgage  Loans for
which payment was not received by the  Subservicer.  This  obligation to advance
with respect to each  Mortgage  Loan will continue up to and including the first
of the month following the date on which the related Mortgaged  Property is sold
at a  foreclosure  sale  or is  acquired  by the  Trust  Fund by deed in lieu of
foreclosure  or  otherwise.  All such advances  received by the Master  Servicer
shall be deposited promptly by it in the Custodial Account.

                                       49
<PAGE>

(b)  The  Subservicer  may  also  be  required,  pursuant  to  the  Subservicing
Agreement,  to remit to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Custodial Account
interest at the Adjusted  Mortgage  Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate plus the
rate per annum at which the  Servicing  Fee  accrues  in the case of a  Modified
Mortgage Loan) on any Curtailment  received by such  Subservicer in respect of a
Mortgage Loan from the related  Mortgagor during any month that is to be applied
by the  Subservicer  to reduce  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of the  related
Mortgage Loan as of the first day of such month, from the date of application of
such  Curtailment to the first day of the following month. Any amounts paid by a
Subservicer  pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall be for the benefit of the
Master Servicer as additional servicing compensation and shall be subject to its
withdrawal or order from time to time pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(iv) and (v).

(c) In addition to the Custodial Account and the Certificate Account, the Master
Servicer  shall  for any  Nonsubserviced  Mortgage  Loan,  and  shall  cause the
Subservicers  for Subserviced  Mortgage Loans to,  establish and maintain one or
more Servicing  Accounts and deposit and retain therein all collections from the
Mortgagors   (or  advances  from   Subservicers)   for  the  payment  of  taxes,
assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,  Primary Insurance Policy premiums,  if
applicable,  or  comparable  items  for  the  account  of the  Mortgagors.  Each
Servicing Account shall satisfy the requirements for a Subservicing Account and,
to the extent  permitted by the Program  Guide or as is otherwise  acceptable to
the Master Servicer, may also function as a Subservicing Account. Withdrawals of
amounts  related to the Mortgage  Loans from the Servicing  Accounts may be made
only to effect timely payment of taxes, assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,
Primary  Insurance  Policy  premiums,  if applicable,  or comparable  items,  to
reimburse the Master Servicer or Subservicer out of related  collections for any
payments made  pursuant to Sections 3.11 (with respect to the Primary  Insurance
Policy)  and  3.12(a)  (with  respect  to  hazard  insurance),  to refund to any
Mortgagors  any sums as may be  determined to be overages,  to pay interest,  if
required,  to Mortgagors  on balances in the  Servicing  Account or to clear and
terminate  the  Servicing  Account  at the  termination  of  this  Agreement  in
accordance with Section 9.01 or in accordance with the Program Guide. As part of
its servicing  duties,  the Master Servicer shall,  and the  Subservicers  will,
pursuant to the  Subservicing  Agreements,  be required to pay to the Mortgagors
interest on funds in this account to the extent required by law.

(d) The Master Servicer shall advance the payments  referred to in the preceding
subsection  that  are not  timely  paid by the  Mortgagors  or  advanced  by the
Subservicers  on the date when the tax,  premium  or other  cost for which  such
payment is  intended  is due,  but the Master  Servicer  shall be required so to
advance only to the extent that such advances, in the good faith judgment of the
Master  Servicer,  will be recoverable  by the Master  Servicer out of Insurance
Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or otherwise.

Section 3.09.  Access to Certain Documentation and
                      Information Regarding the Mortgage Loans.
                      ----------------------------------------

        If   compliance   with  this  Section  3.09  shall  make  any  Class  of
Certificates  legal  for  investment  by  federally  insured  savings  and  loan
associations,  the Master Servicer shall provide,  or cause the  Subservicers to
provide,  to the Trustee,  the Office of Thrift  Supervision or the FDIC and the
supervisory  agents and examiners thereof access to the documentation  regarding
the Mortgage  Loans  required by applicable  regulations of the Office of Thrift


                                       50
<PAGE>

Supervision,  such access being afforded without charge but only upon reasonable
request and during normal business hours at the offices designated by the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer shall permit such representatives to photocopy any
such  documentation  and shall  provide  equipment  for that purpose at a charge
reasonably approximating the cost of such photocopying to the Master Servicer.

Section 3.10.  Permitted Withdrawals from the Custodial Account.

(a) The  Master  Servicer  may,  from  time to time  as  provided  herein,  make
withdrawals from the Custodial Account of amounts on deposit therein pursuant to
Section  3.07 that are  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans for the  following
purposes:

(i)  to make  deposits  into the  Certificate  Account in the amounts and in the
     manner provided for in Section 4.01;

(ii) to reimburse itself or the related Subservicer for previously  unreimbursed
     advances or expenses made pursuant to Sections 3.01,  3.07(a),  3.08, 3.11,
     3.12(a),  3.14 and 4.04 or otherwise  reimbursable pursuant to the terms of
     this Agreement,  such withdrawal right being limited to amounts received on
     particular  Mortgage  Loans  (including,  for this  purpose,  REO Proceeds,
     Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds and proceeds from the purchase of
     a  Mortgage  Loan  pursuant  to Section  2.02,  2.03,  2.04 or 4.07)  which
     represent  (A) Late  Collections  of  Monthly  Payments  for which any such
     advance was made in the case of Subservicer  Advances or Advances  pursuant
     to  Section  4.04 and (B)  recoveries  of  amounts in respect of which such
     advances were made in the case of Servicing Advances;

(iii)to pay to itself or the related  Subservicer (if not previously retained by
     such  Subservicer)  out of each payment  received by the Master Servicer on
     account of interest on a Mortgage Loan as contemplated by Sections 3.14 and
     3.16, an amount equal to that  remaining  portion of any such payment as to
     interest (but not in excess of the Servicing Fee and the Subservicing  Fee,
     if not  previously  retained)  which,  when  deducted,  will  result in the
     remaining  amount of such interest  being interest at the Net Mortgage Rate
     (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan) on
     the amount specified in the  amortization  schedule of the related Mortgage
     Loan as the  principal  balance  thereof  at the  beginning  of the  period
     respecting which such interest was paid after giving effect to any previous
     Curtailments;

(iv)    to pay to itself as additional  servicing  compensation  any interest or
        investment  income  earned on funds and other  property  deposited in or
        credited  to the  Custodial  Account  that it is  entitled  to  withdraw
        pursuant to Section 3.07(c);

(v)     to pay to itself as additional  servicing  compensation  any Foreclosure
        Profits,  any amounts remitted by Subservicers as interest in respect of
        Curtailments  pursuant to Section  3.08(b),  and any  amounts  paid by a
        Mortgagor in connection  with a Principal  Prepayment in Full in respect
        of  interest  for any  period  during the  calendar  month in which such
        Principal   Prepayment   in   Full   is  to  be   distributed   to   the
        Certificateholders;

                                       51
<PAGE>

(vi)    to pay to itself,  a Subservicer,  a Seller,  Residential  Funding,  the
        Company  or any  other  appropriate  Person,  as the case  may be,  with
        respect to each  Mortgage Loan or property  acquired in respect  thereof
        that has been  purchased  or otherwise  transferred  pursuant to Section
        2.02,  2.03,  2.04, 4.07 or 9.01, all amounts  received  thereon and not
        required to be distributed to the  Certificateholders  as of the date on
        which  the  related  Stated  Principal  Balance  or  Purchase  Price  is
        determined;

(vii)   to reimburse  itself or the related  Subservicer for any  Nonrecoverable
        Advance  or  Advances  in  the  manner  and to the  extent  provided  in
        subsection (c) below, any Advance made in connection with a modification
        of a Mortgage  Loan that is in default or, in the judgment of the Master
        Servicer, default is reasonably foreseeable pursuant to Section 3.07(a),
        to  the  extent  the  amount  of  the  Advance  has  been  added  to the
        outstanding  principal  balance of the  Mortgage  Loan,  or any  Advance
        reimbursable to the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(a);

(viii)  to  reimburse  itself  or  the  Company  for  expenses  incurred  by and
        reimbursable to it or the Company  pursuant to Sections  3.01(a),  3.11,
        3.13,  3.14(c),  6.03,  10.01  or  otherwise,   or  in  connection  with
        enforcing,   in  accordance   with  this   Agreement,   any  repurchase,
        substitution or indemnification  obligation of any Seller (other than an
        Affiliate of the Company) pursuant to the related Seller's Agreement;

(ix)    to reimburse itself for Servicing  Advances  expended by it (a) pursuant
        to Section  3.14 in good faith in  connection  with the  restoration  of
        property  damaged by an Uninsured  Cause, and (b) in connection with the
        liquidation  of a Mortgage Loan or disposition of an REO Property to the
        extent not otherwise reimbursed pursuant to clause (ii) or (viii) above;
        and

(x)  to withdraw  any amount  deposited  in the  Custodial  Account that was not
     required to be deposited therein pursuant to Section 3.07.

(b) Since, in connection with withdrawals  pursuant to clauses (ii),  (iii), (v)
and (vi), the Master Servicer's entitlement thereto is limited to collections or
other  recoveries on the related  Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer shall keep
and maintain separate accounting, on a Mortgage Loan by Mortgage Loan basis, for
the purpose of justifying any withdrawal from the Custodial  Account pursuant to
such clauses.

(c) The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  reimburse  itself or the related
Subservicer  for any advance made in respect of a Mortgage  Loan that the Master
Servicer  determines  to be a  Nonrecoverable  Advance  by  withdrawal  from the
Custodial  Account of amounts on deposit  therein  attributable  to the Mortgage
Loans  on any  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date  succeeding  the date of such
determination.  Such  right of  reimbursement  in  respect  of a  Nonrecoverable
Advance  on any such  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date shall be limited to an
amount  not   exceeding  the  portion  of  such  advance   previously   paid  to
Certificateholders (and not theretofore reimbursed to the Master Servicer or the
related Subservicer).

Section 3.11.  Maintenance of the Primary Insurance
                      Policies; Collections Thereunder.

(a) The Master  Servicer shall not take, or permit any  Subservicer to take, any
action which would result in non-coverage under any applicable Primary Insurance
Policy  of any  loss  which,  but for the  actions  of the  Master  Servicer  or
Subservicer,  would have been  covered  thereunder.  To the extent  coverage  is
available,  the Master Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and
effect each such Primary  Insurance  Policy until the  principal  balance of the
related Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged  Property is reduced to 80% or less
of  the  Appraised  Value  in  the  case  of  such  a  Mortgage  Loan  having  a
Loan-to-Value  Ratio at origination in excess of 80%, provided that such Primary
Insurance  Policy  was in  place as of the  Cut-off  Date  and the  Company  had
knowledge  of such  Primary  Insurance  Policy.  The  Master  Servicer  shall be
entitled to cancel or permit the discontinuation of any Primary Insurance Policy
as to any Mortgage Loan, if the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan is
reduced  below an  amount  equal to 80% of the  appraised  value of the  related
Mortgaged  Property as  determined  in any  appraisal  thereof after the Closing
Date,  or if the  Loan-to-Value  Ratio  is  reduced  below  80% as a  result  of
principal  payments on the Mortgage  Loan after the Closing  Date.  In the event
that the Company  gains  knowledge  that as of the Closing Date, a Mortgage Loan
had a Loan-to-Value Ratio at origination in excess of 80% and is not the subject
of a Primary  Insurance  Policy (and was not  included in any  exception  to the
representation in Section 2.03(b)(iv)) and that such Mortgage Loan has a current
Loan-to-Value  Ratio in excess  of 80% then the  Master  Servicer  shall use its
reasonable  efforts to obtain and  maintain  a Primary  Insurance  Policy to the
extent  that such a policy is  obtainable  at a  reasonable  price.  The  Master
Servicer shall not cancel or refuse to renew any such Primary  Insurance  Policy
applicable to a  Nonsubserviced  Mortgage  Loan,  or consent to any  Subservicer
canceling or refusing to renew any such Primary Insurance Policy applicable to a
Mortgage  Loan  subserviced  by it, that is in effect at the date of the initial
issuance  of the  Certificates  and is  required  to be kept in force  hereunder
unless the replacement Primary Insurance Policy for such canceled or non-renewed
policy is maintained with an insurer whose  claims-paying  ability is acceptable
to each Rating  Agency for mortgage  pass-through  certificates  having a rating
equal to or better  than the  lower of the  then-current  rating  or the  rating
assigned to the Certificates as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency.

(b) In  connection  with its  activities  as  administrator  and servicer of the
Mortgage  Loans,  the Master  Servicer agrees to present or to cause the related
Subservicer to present,  on behalf of the Master Servicer,  the Subservicer,  if
any, the Trustee and Certificateholders, claims to the related Insurer under any
Primary Insurance Policies, in a timely manner in accordance with such policies,
and,  in this  regard,  to take or cause to be taken such  reasonable  action as
shall be  necessary  to permit  recovery  under any Primary  Insurance  Policies
respecting  defaulted  Mortgage  Loans.  Pursuant to Section 3.07, any Insurance
Proceeds  collected  by or  remitted  to the Master  Servicer  under any Primary
Insurance  Policies  shall be deposited  in the  Custodial  Account,  subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

Section 3.12.  Maintenance of Fire Insurance and
                      Omissions and Fidelity Coverage.

(a) The Master  Servicer  shall cause to be  maintained  for each  Mortgage Loan
(other than a Cooperative  Loan) fire  insurance  with  extended  coverage in an
amount  which is equal to the  lesser  of the  principal  balance  owing on such
Mortgage  Loan  or 100  percent  of the  insurable  value  of the  improvements;


                                       53
<PAGE>

provided,  however,  that such coverage may not be less than the minimum  amount
required to fully compensate for any loss or damage on a replacement cost basis.
To the extent it may do so without breaching the related Subservicing Agreement,
the Master  Servicer  shall  replace  any  Subservicer  that does not cause such
insurance, to the extent it is available, to be maintained.  The Master Servicer
shall also cause to be maintained on property acquired upon foreclosure, or deed
in lieu of  foreclosure,  of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Cooperative  Loan),
fire  insurance  with extended  coverage in an amount which is at least equal to
the  amount  necessary  to avoid  the  application  of any  co-insurance  clause
contained in the related hazard insurance policy.  Pursuant to Section 3.07, any
amounts  collected by the Master  Servicer  under any such policies  (other than
amounts to be  applied to the  restoration  or repair of the  related  Mortgaged
Property  or property  thus  acquired or amounts  released to the  Mortgagor  in
accordance with the Master  Servicer's  normal  servicing  procedures)  shall be
deposited in the Custodial  Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section
3.10. Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer in maintaining any such insurance
shall  not,  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  monthly  distributions  to  the
Certificateholders,  be added to the  amount  owing  under  the  Mortgage  Loan,
notwithstanding  that the terms of the Mortgage Loan so permit. Such costs shall
be  recoverable  by the Master  Servicer  out of related  late  payments  by the
Mortgagor or out of Insurance  Proceeds and  Liquidation  Proceeds to the extent
permitted by Section  3.10.  It is  understood  and agreed that no earthquake or
other  additional  insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor or maintained on
property  acquired  in respect of a Mortgage  Loan other than  pursuant  to such
applicable  laws and  regulations  as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance. Whenever the improvements securing a Mortgage
Loan (other than a Cooperative  Loan) are located at the time of  origination of
such Mortgage  Loan in a federally  designated  special  flood hazard area,  the
Master  Servicer  shall cause flood  insurance  (to the extent  available) to be
maintained in respect thereof.  Such flood insurance shall be in an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount required to compensate for any loss or damage to
the Mortgaged  Property on a replacement  cost basis and (ii) the maximum amount
of such  insurance  available  for the  related  Mortgaged  Property  under  the
national flood insurance program (assuming that the area in which such Mortgaged
Property is located is participating in such program).

        If the  Master  Servicer  shall  obtain  and  maintain  a  blanket  fire
insurance policy with extended coverage insuring against hazard losses on all of
the  Mortgage  Loans,  it shall  conclusively  be deemed to have  satisfied  its
obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 3.12(a), it being
understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which
case the Master  Servicer  shall,  in the event  that there  shall not have been
maintained on the related  Mortgaged  Property a policy complying with the first
sentence  of this  Section  3.12(a) and there shall have been a loss which would
have been covered by such policy,  deposit in the Certificate Account the amount
not  otherwise  payable  under the  blanket  policy  because of such  deductible
clause. Any such deposit by the Master Servicer shall be made on the Certificate
Account  Deposit Date next preceding the  Distribution  Date which occurs in the
month  following  the month in which  payments  under any such policy would have
been deposited in the Custodial  Account.  In connection  with its activities as
administrator  and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer agrees to
present,  on behalf of itself,  the Trustee and the  Certificateholders,  claims
under any such blanket policy.

                                       54
<PAGE>

(b) The Master Servicer shall obtain and maintain at its own expense and keep in
full force and effect  throughout the term of this Agreement a blanket  fidelity
bond and an errors and omissions insurance policy covering the Master Servicer's
officers and employees and other persons acting on behalf of the Master Servicer
in connection with its activities  under this Agreement.  The amount of coverage
shall be at least equal to the coverage  that would be required by Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac,  whichever is greater,  with respect to the Master  Servicer if the
Master Servicer were servicing and  administering  the Mortgage Loans for Fannie
Mae or Freddie  Mac.  In the event that any such bond or policy  ceases to be in
effect, the Master Servicer shall obtain a comparable replacement bond or policy
from an issuer or insurer, as the case may be, meeting the requirements, if any,
of the  Program  Guide and  acceptable  to the  Company.  Coverage of the Master
Servicer under a policy or bond obtained by an Affiliate of the Master  Servicer
and  providing the coverage  required by this Section  3.12(b) shall satisfy the
requirements of this Section 3.12(b).

Section 3.13.  Enforcement of Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption and
                      Modification Agreements; Certain Assignments.
                      ---------------------------------------------

(a) When any  Mortgaged  Property  is  conveyed  by the  Mortgagor,  the  Master
Servicer or  Subservicer,  to the extent it has  knowledge  of such  conveyance,
shall enforce any due-on-sale clause contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,
to the extent permitted under applicable law and governmental  regulations,  but
only to the extent that such enforcement will not adversely affect or jeopardize
coverage under any Required Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i)     the  Master  Servicer  shall not be deemed to be in  default  under this
        Section 3.13(a) by reason of any transfer or assumption which the Master
        Servicer is restricted by law from preventing; and

(ii)    if the Master Servicer  determines that it is reasonably likely that any
        Mortgagor will bring,  or if any Mortgagor  does bring,  legal action to
        declare invalid or otherwise avoid  enforcement of a due-on-sale  clause
        contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,  the Master  Servicer  shall
        not be  required to enforce the  due-on-sale  clause or to contest  such
        action.

(b) Subject to the Master  Servicer's duty to enforce any due-on-sale  clause to
the  extent  set  forth in  Section  3.13(a),  in any case in which a  Mortgaged
Property  is to be conveyed  to a Person by a  Mortgagor,  and such Person is to
enter into an assumption or modification agreement or supplement to the Mortgage
Note  or  Mortgage  which  requires  the  signature  of  the  Trustee,  or if an
instrument of release signed by the Trustee is required  releasing the Mortgagor
from liability on the Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer is authorized,  subject
to the requirements of the sentence next following,  to execute and deliver,  on
behalf of the  Trustee,  the  assumption  agreement  with the Person to whom the
Mortgaged  Property  is  to be  conveyed  and  such  modification  agreement  or
supplement  to the  Mortgage  Note  or  Mortgage  or  other  instruments  as are
reasonable  or necessary to carry out the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage
or otherwise to comply with any  applicable  laws  regarding  assumptions or the
transfer of the Mortgaged Property to such Person;  provided,  however,  none of
such terms and requirements  shall either (i) both (A) constitute a "significant
modification"  effecting an exchange or  reissuance  of such Mortgage Loan under
the REMIC  Provisions  and (B) cause any portion of any REMIC  formed  under the
Series  Supplement  to fail to qualify as a REMIC  under the Code or (subject to
Section  10.01(f)),   result  in  the  imposition  of  any  tax  on  "prohibited
transactions" or (ii) constitute  "contributions"  after the start-up date under
the REMIC  Provisions.  The Master  Servicer  shall  execute  and  deliver  such
documents only if it reasonably  determines  that (i) its execution and delivery
thereof will not conflict  with or violate any terms of this  Agreement or cause


                                       55
<PAGE>

the unpaid  balance and interest on the  Mortgage  Loan to be  uncollectible  in
whole or in part,  (ii) any  required  consents of insurers  under any  Required
Insurance Policies have been obtained and (iii) subsequent to the closing of the
transaction  involving  the  assumption  or transfer (A) the Mortgage  Loan will
continue  to be secured by a first  mortgage  lien  pursuant to the terms of the
Mortgage,  (B) such transaction will not adversely affect the coverage under any
Required Insurance Policies,  (C) the Mortgage Loan will fully amortize over the
remaining term thereof, (D) no material term of the Mortgage Loan (including the
interest  rate on the  Mortgage  Loan) will be altered  nor will the term of the
Mortgage  Loan be  changed  and (E) if the  seller/transferor  of the  Mortgaged
Property is to be released  from  liability on the Mortgage  Loan,  such release
will  not  (based  on  the  Master   Servicer's  or  Subservicer's   good  faith
determination)  adversely affect the  collectability  of the Mortgage Loan. Upon
receipt of appropriate  instructions from the Master Servicer in accordance with
the  foregoing,  the Trustee shall execute any  necessary  instruments  for such
assumption  or  substitution  of  liability as directed in writing by the Master
Servicer.  Upon the closing of the transactions  contemplated by such documents,
the Master  Servicer shall cause the originals or true and correct copies of the
assumption agreement, the release (if any), or the modification or supplement to
the Mortgage  Note or Mortgage to be  delivered to the Trustee or the  Custodian
and deposited  with the Mortgage File for such Mortgage  Loan. Any fee collected
by the  Master  Servicer  or  such  related  Subservicer  for  entering  into an
assumption or substitution of liability agreement will be retained by the Master
Servicer or such Subservicer as additional servicing compensation.

(c) The Master Servicer or the related Subservicer, as the case may be, shall be
entitled  to approve a request  from a  Mortgagor  for a partial  release of the
related  Mortgaged  Property,  the  granting of an easement  thereon in favor of
another Person,  any alteration or demolition of the related Mortgaged  Property
(or,  with respect to a Cooperative  Loan,  the related  Cooperative  Apartment)
without  any  right  of  reimbursement  or  other  similar  matters  if  it  has
determined, exercising its good faith business judgment in the same manner as it
would if it were the owner of the related  Mortgage Loan, that the security for,
and the timely  and full  collectability  of,  such  Mortgage  Loan would not be
adversely  affected  thereby and that any portion of any REMIC  formed under the
Series  Supplement  would not fail to  continue  to qualify as a REMIC under the
Code as a result  thereof  and  (subject  to  Section  10.01(f))  that no tax on
"prohibited  transactions"  or  "contributions"  after the  startup day would be
imposed on any such REMIC as a result  thereof.  Any fee collected by the Master
Servicer  or the  related  Subservicer  for  processing  such a request  will be
retained by the Master  Servicer or such  Subservicer  as  additional  servicing
compensation.

(d) Subject to any other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement,  the
Trustee and Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to approve an assignment in lieu
of  satisfaction  with respect to any Mortgage  Loan,  provided the obligee with
respect to such Mortgage Loan  following such proposed  assignment  provides the
Trustee and Master  Servicer  with a "Lender  Certification  for  Assignment  of
Mortgage  Loan" in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit M, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee and Master  Servicer,  providing the following:  (i)
that the substance of the assignment is, and is intended to be, a refinancing of


                                       56
<PAGE>

such  Mortgage;  (ii) that the Mortgage Loan  following the proposed  assignment
will have a rate of  interest at least 0.25  percent  below or above the rate of
interest on such Mortgage Loan prior to such proposed assignment; and (iii) that
such  assignment  is at the request of the borrower  under the related  Mortgage
Loan. Upon approval of an assignment in lieu of satisfaction with respect to any
Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer shall receive cash in an amount equal to the
unpaid  principal  balance of and accrued interest on such Mortgage Loan and the
Master  Servicer shall treat such amount as a Principal  Prepayment in Full with
respect to such Mortgage Loan for all purposes hereof.

Section 3.14.  Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.
               -----------------------------------------

(a) The Master  Servicer shall  foreclose upon or otherwise  comparably  convert
(which may include an REO Acquisition) the ownership of properties securing such
of the  Mortgage  Loans as come into and  continue in default and as to which no
satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for  collection of  delinquent  payments
pursuant  to  Section  3.07.  In  connection  with  such  foreclosure  or  other
conversion, the Master Servicer shall, consistent with Section 3.11, follow such
practices and  procedures as it shall deem  necessary or advisable,  as shall be
normal and usual in its general  mortgage  servicing  activities and as shall be
required or permitted by the Program  Guide;  provided that the Master  Servicer
shall not be liable in any respect hereunder if the Master Servicer is acting in
connection  with any such  foreclosure  or other  conversion in a manner that is
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The Master Servicer,  however,
shall not be  required  to  expend  its own  funds or incur  other  reimbursable
charges in connection with any foreclosure,  or attempted  foreclosure  which is
not  completed,  or towards  the  restoration  of any  property  unless it shall
determine  (i) that  such  restoration  and/or  foreclosure  will  increase  the
proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Holders of  Certificates  of one
or more Classes after  reimbursement  to itself for such expenses or charges and
(ii) that such expenses or charges will be recoverable to it through Liquidation
Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds,  or REO Proceeds  (respecting which it shall have
priority for purposes of  withdrawals  from the  Custodial  Account  pursuant to
Section 3.10, whether or not such expenses and charges are actually  recoverable
from related Liquidation Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds or REO Proceeds).  In the
event of such a determination  by the Master  Servicer  pursuant to this Section
3.14(a),  the Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of such amounts
pursuant to Section 3.10.

               In addition to the foregoing,  the Master  Servicer shall use its
best  reasonable  efforts to realize upon any Additional  Collateral for such of
the Additional  Collateral  Loans as come into and continue in default and as to
which no  satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for  collection  of delinquent
payments pursuant to Section 3.07;  provided that the Master Servicer shall not,
on behalf of the Trustee,  obtain title to any such  Additional  Collateral as a
result of or in lieu of the  disposition  thereof  or  otherwise;  and  provided
further  that (i) the Master  Servicer  shall not proceed  with  respect to such
Additional  Collateral  in any manner  that would  impair the ability to recover
against the  related  Mortgaged  Property,  and (ii) the Master  Servicer  shall
proceed with any REO Acquisition in a manner that preserves the ability to apply
the  proceeds  of such  Additional  Collateral  against  amounts  owed under the
defaulted  Mortgage Loan. Any proceeds realized from such Additional  Collateral
(other than amounts to be released to the Mortgagor or the related  guarantor in


                                       57
<PAGE>

accordance  with  procedures  that the Master Servicer would follow in servicing
loans  held for its own  account,  subject  to the terms and  conditions  of the
related  Mortgage  and  Mortgage  Note and to the  terms and  conditions  of any
security agreement,  guarantee agreement,  mortgage or other agreement governing
the  disposition  of the  proceeds  of  such  Additional  Collateral)  shall  be
deposited in the Custodial  Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section
3.10.  Any other  payment  received  by the Master  Servicer  in respect of such
Additional  Collateral  shall be deposited in the Custodial  Account  subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

               For so long as the Master  Servicer is the Master  Servicer under
the Credit  Support  Pledge  Agreement,  the Master  Servicer  shall perform its
obligations  under the Credit Support Pledge  Agreement in accordance  with such
Agreement   and  in  a   manner   that  is  in  the   best   interests   of  the
Certificateholders.  Further,  the Master Servicer shall use its best reasonable
efforts to realize upon any Pledged  Assets for such of the Pledged  Asset Loans
as  come  into  and  continue  in  default  and  as  to  which  no  satisfactory
arrangements  can be made for  collection  of  delinquent  payments  pursuant to
Section  3.07;  provided  that the Master  Servicer  shall not, on behalf of the
Trustee,  obtain title to any such  Pledged  Assets as a result of or in lieu of
the disposition  thereof or otherwise;  and provided further that (i) the Master
Servicer  shall not proceed with  respect to such  Pledged  Assets in any manner
that would impair the ability to recover against the related Mortgaged Property,
and (ii) the Master  Servicer shall proceed with any REO Acquisition in a manner
that  preserves the ability to apply the proceeds of such Pledged Assets against
amounts owed under the defaulted  Mortgage Loan. Any proceeds realized from such
Pledged  Assets  (other  than  amounts to be released  to the  Mortgagor  or the
related  guarantor in accordance  with procedures that the Master Servicer would
follow in  servicing  loans held for its own  account,  subject to the terms and
conditions  of the  related  Mortgage  and  Mortgage  Note and to the  terms and
conditions of any security  agreement,  guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other
agreement  governing  the  disposition  of the proceeds of such Pledged  Assets)
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to
Section 3.10.  Any other payment  received by the Master  Servicer in respect of
such  Pledged  Assets shall be deposited  in the  Custodial  Account  subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

               Concurrently  with the foregoing,  the Master Servicer may pursue
any  remedies  that  may  be  available  in  connection   with  a  breach  of  a
representation and warranty with respect to any such Mortgage Loan in accordance
with Sections  2.03 and 2.04.  However,  the Master  Servicer is not required to
continue to pursue both  foreclosure  (or similar  remedies) with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and remedies in connection with a breach of a representation  and
warranty if the Master Servicer determines in its reasonable discretion that one
such  remedy is more likely to result in a greater  recovery as to the  Mortgage
Loan. Upon the occurrence of a Cash  Liquidation or REO  Disposition,  following
the deposit in the  Custodial  Account of all  Insurance  Proceeds,  Liquidation
Proceeds and other  payments and  recoveries  referred to in the  definition  of
"Cash  Liquidation"  or "REO  Disposition,"  as applicable,  upon receipt by the
Trustee of written  notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,
the Trustee or any  Custodian,  as the case may be, shall  release to the Master
Servicer the related  Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver
such instruments of transfer or assignment  prepared by the Master Servicer,  in
each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the Master Servicer
or its designee,  as the case may be, the related  Mortgage Loan, and thereafter
such  Mortgage  Loan shall not be part of the Trust  Fund.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing or any other  provision of this  Agreement,  in the Master  Servicer's
sole discretion  with respect to any defaulted  Mortgage Loan or REO Property as


                                       58
<PAGE>

to either of the following provisions, (i) a Cash Liquidation or REO Disposition
may be deemed to have  occurred if  substantially  all  amounts  expected by the
Master Servicer to be received in connection with the related defaulted Mortgage
Loan or REO Property have been  received,  and (ii) for purposes of  determining
the amount of any Liquidation Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds, REO Proceeds or any
other  unscheduled  collections  or the amount of any Realized  Loss, the Master
Servicer may take into account minimal amounts of additional  receipts  expected
to be received or any estimated  additional  liquidation expenses expected to be
incurred in connection with the related defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

(b) If title to any  Mortgaged  Property is acquired by the Trust Fund as an REO
Property  by  foreclosure  or by  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  the  deed or
certificate  of sale shall be issued to the  Trustee or to its nominee on behalf
of  Certificateholders.  Notwithstanding  any  such  acquisition  of  title  and
cancellation  of the related  Mortgage Loan,  such REO Property shall (except as
otherwise expressly provided herein) be considered to be an Outstanding Mortgage
Loan held in the Trust Fund until such time as the REO  Property  shall be sold.
Consistent with the foregoing for purposes of all calculations hereunder so long
as such REO Property shall be considered to be an  Outstanding  Mortgage Loan it
shall be assumed that,  notwithstanding  that the indebtedness  evidenced by the
related  Mortgage  Note shall have been  discharged,  such Mortgage Note and the
related  amortization  schedule in effect at the time of any such acquisition of
title  (after  giving  effect  to  any  previous  Curtailments  and  before  any
adjustment  thereto by reason of any  bankruptcy  or similar  proceeding  or any
moratorium or similar waiver or grace period) remain in effect.

(c) If the Trust Fund  acquires  any REO  Property as  aforesaid or otherwise in
connection  with a default or imminent  default on a Mortgage  Loan,  the Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund shall  dispose of such REO Property as soon
as   practicable,   giving   due   consideration   to  the   interests   of  the
Certificateholders,  but in all cases  within three full years after the taxable
year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund for purposes of Section  860G(a)(8) of
the Code (or such shorter  period as may be  necessary  under  applicable  state
(including  any state in which such  property  is located)  law to maintain  the
status of any portion of any REMIC formed under the Series Supplement as a REMIC
under  applicable state law and avoid taxes resulting from such property failing
to be foreclosure property under applicable state law) or, at the expense of the
Trust Fund, request, more than 60 days before the day on which such grace period
would  otherwise  expire,  an extension  of such grace period  unless the Master
Servicer  (subject  to Section  10.01(f))  obtains for the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel,  addressed to the Trustee and the Master  Servicer,  to the effect that
the  holding by the Trust Fund of such REO  Property  subsequent  to such period
will not  result in the  imposition  of taxes on  "prohibited  transactions"  as
defined in Section  860F of the Code or cause any REMIC  formed under the Series
Supplement to fail to qualify as a REMIC (for federal (or any  applicable  State
or  local)  income  tax  purposes)  at  any  time  that  any   Certificates  are
outstanding, in which case the Trust Fund may continue to hold such REO Property
(subject to any  conditions  contained in such  Opinion of Counsel).  The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed  from the Custodial  Account for any
costs  incurred in  obtaining  such  Opinion of Counsel,  as provided in Section
3.10.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  no REO Property


                                       59
<PAGE>

acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be rented)
or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust Fund in such a manner or pursuant
to any terms  that  would (i) cause  such REO  Property  to fail to  qualify  as
"foreclosure  property" within the meaning of Section  860G(a)(8) of the Code or
(ii) subject the Trust Fund to the imposition of any federal income taxes on the
income earned from such REO  Property,  including any taxes imposed by reason of
Section 860G(c) of the Code,  unless the Master Servicer has agreed to indemnify
and hold  harmless  the Trust Fund with  respect to the  imposition  of any such
taxes.

(d) The  proceeds  of any Cash  Liquidation,  REO  Disposition  or  purchase  or
repurchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, as well
as any recovery resulting from a collection of Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance
Proceeds or REO Proceeds,  will be applied in the  following  order of priority:
first, to reimburse the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer in accordance
with Section  3.10(a)(ii);  second, to the  Certificateholders  to the extent of
accrued and unpaid  interest on the Mortgage  Loan,  and any related REO Imputed
Interest,  at the Net Mortgage  Rate (or the  Modified Net Mortgage  Rate in the
case of a Modified Mortgage Loan) to the Due Date prior to the Distribution Date
on which such amounts are to be distributed; third, to the Certificateholders as
a recovery of principal on the Mortgage Loan (or REO Property);  fourth,  to all
Servicing Fees and Subservicing  Fees payable therefrom (and the Master Servicer
and the Subservicer  shall have no claims for any  deficiencies  with respect to
such fees which result from the foregoing allocation); and fifth, to Foreclosure
Profits.

(e) In the event of a default on a Mortgage  Loan one or more of whose  obligors
is not a United States Person, in connection with any foreclosure or acquisition
of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  (together,  "foreclosure")  in respect of such
Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer will cause  compliance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Section  1.1445-2(d)(3) (or any successor thereto) necessary
to assure that no withholding tax obligation arises with respect to the proceeds
of such  foreclosure  except  to the  extent,  if  any,  that  proceeds  of such
foreclosure are required to be remitted to the obligors on such Mortgage Loan.

Section 3.15.  Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.
               -----------------------------------------------

(a) Upon becoming aware of the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or upon the
receipt by the Master  Servicer of a  notification  that payment in full will be
escrowed in a manner  customary  for such  purposes,  the Master  Servicer  will
immediately  notify the Trustee (if it holds the related  Mortgage  File) or the
Custodian by a certification of a Servicing Officer (which  certification  shall
include a statement to the effect that all amounts received or to be received in
connection with such payment which are required to be deposited in the Custodial
Account   pursuant  to  Section  3.07  have  been  or  will  be  so  deposited),
substantially  in one of the forms attached hereto as Exhibit F, or, in the case
of the Custodian,  an electronic  request in a form acceptable to the Custodian,
requesting  delivery to it of the Mortgage  File.  Within two  Business  Days of
receipt of such certification and request,  the Trustee shall release,  or cause
the Custodian to release, the related Mortgage File to the Master Servicer.  The
Master  Servicer  is  authorized  to execute and  deliver to the  Mortgagor  the
request for  reconveyance,  deed of  reconveyance  or release or satisfaction of
mortgage or such  instrument  releasing the lien of the Mortgage,  together with
the Mortgage Note with, as appropriate, written evidence of cancellation thereon
and to cause the removal  from the  registration  on the MERS(R)  System of such


                                       60
<PAGE>

Mortgage  and to  execute  and  deliver,  on  behalf  of  the  Trustee  and  the
Certificateholders  or any of them, any and all  instruments of  satisfaction or
cancellation or of partial or full release.  No expenses  incurred in connection
with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance  shall be chargeable
to the Custodial Account or the Certificate Account.

(b) From time to time as is appropriate  for the servicing or foreclosure of any
Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer shall deliver to the Custodian,  with a copy
to the Trustee, a certificate of a Servicing Officer substantially in one of the
forms  attached  as  Exhibit F  hereto,  or,  in the case of the  Custodian,  an
electronic  request  in a form  acceptable  to the  Custodian,  requesting  that
possession  of all, or any document  constituting  part of, the Mortgage File be
released to the Master Servicer and certifying as to the reason for such release
and that such release will not  invalidate  any insurance  coverage  provided in
respect of the Mortgage Loan under any Required  Insurance Policy.  Upon receipt
of the foregoing,  the Trustee shall deliver, or cause the Custodian to deliver,
the Mortgage  File or any document  therein to the Master  Servicer.  The Master
Servicer  shall cause each Mortgage File or any document  therein so released to
be returned to the Trustee,  or the  Custodian as agent for the Trustee when the
need therefor by the Master  Servicer no longer exists,  unless (i) the Mortgage
Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation  Proceeds  relating to the Mortgage
Loan have been  deposited in the Custodial  Account or (ii) the Mortgage File or
such  document  has been  delivered  directly  or  through a  Subservicer  to an
attorney,  or to a public  trustee or other public  official as required by law,
for purposes of initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the
foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property either judicially or  non-judicially,  and
the Master  Servicer  has  delivered  directly or through a  Subservicer  to the
Trustee a  certificate  of a  Servicing  Officer  certifying  as to the name and
address of the Person to which such Mortgage File or such document was delivered
and the purpose or purposes of such delivery. In the event of the liquidation of
a Mortgage  Loan, the Trustee shall deliver the Request for Release with respect
thereto to the Master Servicer upon deposit of the related Liquidation  Proceeds
in the Custodial Account.

(c) The Trustee or the Master Servicer on the Trustee's behalf shall execute and
deliver to the Master Servicer, if necessary, any court pleadings,  requests for
trustee's sale or other documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale
in respect of a  Mortgaged  Property  or to any legal  action  brought to obtain
judgment  against any  Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or to obtain a
deficiency judgment,  or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the
Mortgage Note or Mortgage or otherwise  available at law or in equity.  Together
with such documents or pleadings (if signed by the Trustee), the Master Servicer
shall deliver to the Trustee a  certificate  of a Servicing  Officer  requesting
that such pleadings or documents be executed by the Trustee and certifying as to
the reason such  documents or pleadings  are required and that the execution and
delivery thereof by the Trustee will not invalidate any insurance coverage under
any Required  Insurance Policy or invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the
Mortgage,  except  for the  termination  of such a lien upon  completion  of the
foreclosure or trustee's sale.

entitled  to receive  on each  Distribution  Date the  amounts  provided  for by
clauses  (iii),  (iv),  (v) and (vi) of Section  3.10(a),  subject to clause (e)
below. The amount of servicing  compensation  provided for in such clauses shall
be accounted for on a Mortgage  Loan-by-Mortgage  Loan basis.  In the event that


                                       61
<PAGE>

Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds  and REO  Proceeds  (net of  amounts
reimbursable  therefrom  pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(ii))  in respect of a Cash
Liquidation  or REO  Disposition  exceed  the unpaid  principal  balance of such
Mortgage  Loan plus  unpaid  interest  accrued  thereon  (including  REO Imputed
Interest)  at a per annum rate equal to the  related Net  Mortgage  Rate (or the
Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan), the Master
Servicer  shall be entitled to retain  therefrom and to pay to itself and/or the
related   Subservicer,   any  Foreclosure  Profits  and  any  Servicing  Fee  or
Subservicing Fee considered to be accrued but unpaid.

(b)  Additional  servicing  compensation  in the  form  of  prepayment  charges,
assumption  fees,  late  payment  charges,  investment  income on amounts in the
Custodial  Account or the Certificate  Account or otherwise shall be retained by
the Master Servicer or the Subservicer to the extent provided herein, subject to
clause (e) below.

expenses  incurred by it in connection with its servicing  activities  hereunder
(including  payment of premiums for the Primary Insurance  Policies,  if any, to
the extent such premiums are not required to be paid by the related  Mortgagors,
and the fees and  expenses of the Trustee  and any  Custodian)  and shall not be
entitled to reimbursement  therefor except as specifically  provided in Sections
3.10 and 3.14.

transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of all of
its   responsibilities  and  obligations  of  the  Master  Servicer  under  this
Agreement.

(e)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  herein,  the  amount  of  servicing
compensation  that the Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to receive  for its
activities  hereunder for the period ending on each  Distribution  Date shall be
reduced  (but not below zero) by an amount  equal to  Compensating  Interest (if
any) for such  Distribution  Date.  Such reduction  shall be applied during such
period as follows:  first, to any Servicing Fee or Subservicing Fee to which the
Master Servicer is entitled pursuant to Section 3.10(a)(iii), and second, to any
income or gain  realized  from any  investment  of funds  held in the  Custodial
Account or the  Certificate  Account to which the Master  Servicer  is  entitled
pursuant to Sections 3.07(c) or 4.01(b), respectively. In making such reduction,
the Master  Servicer (i) will not withdraw from the  Custodial  Account any such
amount  representing  all or a  portion  of the  Servicing  Fee to  which  it is
entitled pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(iii),  and (ii) will not withdraw from the
Custodial Account or Certificate Account any such amount to which it is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.07(c) or 4.01(b).

its expense shall cause a firm of independent public accountants, which shall be
members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,  to furnish a
report to the Company and the Trustee  stating its opinion that, on the basis of
an examination conducted by such firm substantially in accordance with standards

assertions  made pursuant to Section 3.18 regarding  compliance with the minimum
servicing  standards  set forth in the Uniform  Single  Attestation  Program for
Mortgage  Bankers  during the  preceding  calendar year are fairly stated in all
material respects,  subject to such exceptions and other qualifications that, in
the opinion of such firm, such  accounting  standards  require it to report.  In
rendering  such  statement,  such firm may rely,  as to matters  relating to the
direct servicing of mortgage loans by Subservicers,  upon comparable  statements

Section 3.20.  Rights of the Company in Respect of the Master Servicer.
               --------------------------------------------------------

        The Master Servicer shall afford the Company,  upon  reasonable  notice,
during  normal  business  hours access to all records  maintained  by the Master
Servicer  in  respect  of its rights  and  obligations  hereunder  and access to
officers of the Master Servicer responsible for such obligations.  Upon request,
the Master  Servicer  shall  furnish the Company with its most recent  financial
statements and such other information as the Master Servicer possesses regarding
its business,  affairs,  property and  condition,  financial or  otherwise.  The
Master   Servicer  shall  also  cooperate  with  all  reasonable   requests  for
information  including,  but not limited to, notices, tapes and copies of files,
regarding  itself,  the Mortgage  Loans or the  Certificates  from any Person or
Persons identified by the Company or Residential  Funding.  The Company may, but
is not obligated to, enforce the  obligations of the Master  Servicer  hereunder
and may, but is not obligated to, perform,  or cause a designee to perform,  any
defaulted  obligation of the Master Servicer hereunder or exercise the rights of
the Master  Servicer  hereunder;  provided that the Master Servicer shall not be
relieved of any of its  obligations  hereunder by virtue of such  performance by
the Company or its designee.  The Company shall not have any  responsibility  or
liability  for any action or failure  to act by the Master  Servicer  and is not
obligated  to  supervise  the  performance  of the  Master  Servicer  under this
Agreement or otherwise.

Section 3.21.  Administration of Buydown Funds

(a) With respect to any Buydown  Mortgage  Loan, the  Subservicer  has deposited
Buydown Funds in an account that satisfies the  requirements  for a Subservicing
Account  (the  "Buydown   Account").   The  Master   Servicer  shall  cause  the
Subservicing  Agreement to require  that upon receipt from the  Mortgagor of the
amount due on a Due Date for each Buydown  Mortgage Loan, the  Subservicer  will
withdraw from the Buydown Account the  predetermined  amount that, when added to
the amount due on such date from the Mortgagor,  equals the full Monthly Payment
and  transmit  that  amount in  accordance  with the  terms of the  Subservicing
Agreement to the Master  Servicer  together with the related payment made by the
Mortgagor or advanced by the Subservicer.

(b) If the  Mortgagor  on a  Buydown  Mortgage  Loan  prepays  such  loan in its
entirety  during  the period  (the  "Buydown  Period")  when  Buydown  Funds are
required to be applied to such Buydown  Mortgage Loan, the Subservicer  shall be
required to  withdraw  from the  Buydown  Account  and remit any  Buydown  Funds
remaining  in the  Buydown  Account  in  accordance  with  the  related  buydown
agreement.  The amount of Buydown Funds which may be remitted in accordance with
the related  buydown  agreement may reduce the amount required to be paid by the
Mortgagor  to fully  prepay the related  Mortgage  Loan.  If the  Mortgagor on a
Buydown  Mortgage Loan defaults on such Mortgage Loan during the Buydown  Period
and the property  securing such Buydown Mortgage Loan is sold in the liquidation
thereof  (either by the Master Servicer or the insurer under any related Primary
Insurance  Policy),  the  Subservicer  shall be required  to  withdraw  from the
Buydown  Account the Buydown Funds for such Buydown  Mortgage Loan still held in
the Buydown Account and remit the same to the Master Servicer in accordance with
the terms of the Subservicing Agreement for deposit in the Custodial Account or,
if  instructed  by the Master  Servicer,  pay to the  insurer  under any related


                                      64
<PAGE>

Primary  Insurance  Policy if the  Mortgaged  Property  is  transferred  to such
insurer  and such  insurer  pays all of the loss  incurred  in  respect  of such
default.  Any amount so remitted  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence  will be
deemed to reduce the amount owed on the Mortgage Loan.

Section 4.01.  Certificate Account.
               -------------------

(a) The Master  Servicer on behalf of the Trustee shall establish and maintain a
Certificate  Account in which the Master Servicer shall cause to be deposited on
behalf of the Trustee on or before 2:00 P.M.  New York time on each  Certificate
Account  Deposit Date by wire transfer of immediately  available funds an amount
equal to the sum of (i) any Advance for the immediately succeeding  Distribution
Date,  (ii) any amount  required  to be  deposited  in the  Certificate  Account
pursuant to Section  3.12(a),  (iii) any amount  required to be deposited in the
Certificate Account pursuant to Section 3.16(e) or Section 4.07, (iv) any amount
required  to be  paid  pursuant  to  Section  9.01  and (v)  all  other  amounts
constituting the Available  Distribution  Amount for the immediately  succeeding
Distribution Date.

(b) The Trustee shall, upon written request from the Master Servicer,  invest or
cause the institution maintaining the Certificate Account to invest the funds in
the Certificate Account in Permitted  Investments  designated in the name of the
Trustee for the  benefit of the  Certificateholders,  which  shall  mature or be
payable  on  demand  not  later  than  the  Business  Day  next   preceding  the
Distribution  Date next following the date of such  investment  (except that (i)
any  investment  in the  institution  with  which  the  Certificate  Account  is
maintained may mature or be payable on demand on such Distribution Date and (ii)
any other  investment  may mature or be  payable on demand on such  Distribution
Date  if the  Trustee  shall  advance  funds  on such  Distribution  Date to the
Certificate   Account  in  the  amount  payable  on  such   investment  on  such
Distribution  Date,  pending  receipt  thereof to the extent  necessary  to make
distributions on the Certificates) and shall not be sold or disposed of prior to
maturity. Subject to Section 3.16(e), all income and gain realized from any such
investment  shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer and shall be subject
to its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any losses  incurred
in respect of any such investments shall be deposited in the Certificate Account
by the Master Servicer out of its own funds  immediately as realized without any
right of reimbursement.

     (a) Concurrently with each distribution  charged to the Certificate Account

distribution  procedures set forth in this Section provided that such procedures
are no less  convenient  for the  Certificateholders.  The Trustee shall provide


                                       66
<PAGE>

prior   notification   to   the   Company,   the   Master   Servicer   and   the
Certificateholders  regarding  any such  modification.  In addition,  the Master
Servicer shall provide to any manager of a trust fund  consisting of some or all
of the Certificates,  upon reasonable request, such additional information as is
reasonably  obtainable by the Master  Servicer at no  additional  expense to the
Master Servicer.

     (b) Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year,
the Master Servicer shall prepare,  or cause to be prepared,  and shall forward,
or cause to be  forwarded,  to each Person who at any time  during the  calendar
year was the  Holder  of a  Certificate,  other  than a Class R  Certificate,  a
statement  containing the  information  set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
exhibit to the Series Supplement  referred to in subsection (a) above aggregated
for such calendar year or applicable  portion  thereof  during which such Person
was a Certificateholder.  Such obligation of the Master Servicer shall be deemed
to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially  comparable  information
shall be provided by the Master  Servicer  pursuant to any  requirements  of the
Code.

     (c) Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year,
the Master Servicer shall prepare,  or cause to be prepared,  and shall forward,
or cause to be  forwarded,  to each Person who at any time  during the  calendar
year  was the  Holder  of a Class R  Certificate,  a  statement  containing  the
applicable  distribution  information  provided  pursuant to this  Section  4.03
aggregated  for such calendar year or applicable  portion  thereof  during which
such  Person was the Holder of a Class R  Certificate.  Such  obligation  of the
Master  Servicer  shall be deemed  to have been  satisfied  to the  extent  that
substantially  comparable  information  shall be provided by the Master Servicer
pursuant to any requirements of the Code.

     (d) Upon the written request of any Certificateholder, the Master Servicer,
as   soon   as   reasonably   practicable,    shall   provide   the   requesting
Certificateholder with such information as is necessary and appropriate,  in the
Master  Servicer's  sole  discretion,  for  purposes  of  satisfying  applicable

Section               4.04.  Distribution  of  Reports  to the  Trustee  and the
                      Company; Advances by the Master Servicer.

(a)  Prior to the  close of  business  on the  Determination  Date,  the  Master
Servicer  shall  furnish a written  statement  to the Trustee,  any  Certificate
Insurer,  any Paying Agent and the Company (the information in such statement to
be made  available  to  Certificateholders  by the Master  Servicer  on request)
setting  forth  (i) the  Available  Distribution  Amount  and (ii)  the  amounts
required to be  withdrawn  from the  Custodial  Account and  deposited  into the
Certificate  Account on the immediately  succeeding  Certificate Account Deposit
Date  pursuant to clause  (iii) of Section  4.01(a).  The  determination  by the
Master  Servicer of such  amounts  shall,  in the absence of obvious  error,  be
presumptively  deemed to be correct for all purposes  hereunder  and the Trustee
shall be protected in relying  upon the same  without any  independent  check or
verification.

                                       67
<PAGE>

(b) On or before 2:00 P.M.  New York time on each  Certificate  Account  Deposit
Date, the Master  Servicer shall either (i) deposit in the  Certificate  Account
from its own funds, or funds received therefor from the Subservicers,  an amount
equal to the  Advances  to be made by the  Master  Servicer  in  respect  of the
related  Distribution  Date,  which shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the
aggregate  amount of  Monthly  Payments  (with  each  interest  portion  thereof
adjusted to the Net  Mortgage  Rate),  less the amount of any related  Servicing
Modifications,  Debt Service  Reductions or reductions in the amount of interest
collectable  from the Mortgagor  pursuant to the  Soldiers'  and Sailors'  Civil
Relief Act of 1940, as amended,  or similar  legislation or regulations  then in
effect,  on the  Outstanding  Mortgage  Loans as of the related Due Date,  which
Monthly  Payments were  delinquent as of the close of business as of the related
Determination  Date;  provided  that no  Advance  shall be made if it would be a
Nonrecoverable  Advance,  (ii) withdraw from amounts on deposit in the Custodial
Account  and deposit in the  Certificate  Account all or a portion of the Amount
Held for Future  Distribution  in discharge of any such  Advance,  or (iii) make
advances in the form of any  combination of (i) and (ii)  aggregating the amount
of such Advance.  Any portion of the Amount Held for Future Distribution so used
shall be replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the  Certificate  Account
on or before 11:00 A.M. New York time on any future Certificate  Account Deposit
Date to the  extent  that  funds  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans that are
available in the  Custodial  Account for deposit in the  Certificate  Account on
such   Certificate   Account  Deposit  Date  shall  be  less  than  payments  to
Certificateholders  required to be made on the following  Distribution Date. The
Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to use any Advance made by a Subservicer  as
described in Section 3.07(b) that has been deposited in the Custodial Account on
or before  such  Distribution  Date as part of the  Advance  made by the  Master
Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.04. The amount of any reimbursement pursuant
to Section 4.02(a) in respect of outstanding  Advances on any Distribution  Date
shall be allocated to specific  Monthly Payments due but delinquent for previous
Due Periods,  which  allocation  shall be made,  to the extent  practicable,  to
Monthly Payments which have been delinquent for the longest period of time. Such
allocations  shall be  conclusive  for purposes of  reimbursement  to the Master
Servicer from recoveries on related Mortgage Loans pursuant to Section 3.10.

        The   determination   by  the  Master   Servicer  that  it  has  made  a
Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute a
Nonrecoverable  Advance,  shall be evidenced by an Officers'  Certificate of the
Master Servicer delivered to the Company and the Trustee.

        If the Master  Servicer  determines as of the Business Day preceding any
Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date  that it will be unable  to  deposit  in the
Certificate  Account an amount equal to the Advance  required to be made for the
immediately succeeding Distribution Date, it shall give notice to the Trustee of
its inability to advance (such notice may be given by telecopy),  not later than
3:00 P.M.,  New York time, on such Business Day,  specifying the portion of such
amount  that it will be unable to  deposit.  Not later than 3:00 P.M.,  New York
time, on the Certificate Account Deposit Date the Trustee shall, unless by 12:00
Noon, New York time, on such day the Trustee shall have been notified in writing
(by  telecopy)  that the Master  Servicer  shall  have  directly  or  indirectly
deposited in the  Certificate  Account such portion of the amount of the Advance
as to which  the  Master  Servicer  shall  have  given  notice  pursuant  to the
preceding  sentence,  pursuant to Section 7.01,  (a) terminate all of the rights
and  obligations of the Master  Servicer under this Agreement in accordance with


                                       68

Section 7.01 and (b) assume the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer
hereunder,  including the  obligation to deposit in the  Certificate  Account an
amount equal to the Advance for the immediately succeeding Distribution Date.

        The Trustee shall deposit all funds it receives pursuant to this Section
4.04 into the Certificate Account.

Section 4.05.  Allocation of Realized Losses.
               -----------------------------

                             As   provided   in  Section   4.05  of  the  Series
Supplement.

Section 4.06.  Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonment of Mortgaged Property.
               --------------------------------------------------------------

        The Master Servicer or the Subservicers  shall file information  returns
with  respect  to the  receipt  of  mortgage  interests  received  in a trade or
business, the reports of foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property
and the information returns relating to cancellation of indebtedness income with
respect to any Mortgaged  Property required by Sections 6050H,  6050J and 6050P,
respectively,  of the Code, and deliver to the Trustee an Officers'  Certificate
on or before  March 31 of each year  stating  that such reports have been filed.
Such reports  shall be in form and  substance  sufficient  to meet the reporting
requirements imposed by Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P of the Code.

Section 4.07.  Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.
               ----------------------------------------------

        As to any  Mortgage  Loan which is  delinquent  in payment by 90 days or
more, the Master  Servicer may, at its option,  purchase such Mortgage Loan from
the Trustee at the Purchase Price  therefor.  If at any time the Master Servicer
makes a payment to the Certificate  Account  covering the amount of the Purchase
Price for such a Mortgage Loan, and the Master Servicer  provides to the Trustee
a  certification  signed by a Servicing  Officer stating that the amount of such
payment has been deposited in the  Certificate  Account,  then the Trustee shall
execute  the  assignment  of such  Mortgage  Loan at the  request  of the Master
Servicer without recourse to the Master Servicer, which shall succeed to all the
Trustee's  right,  title and  interest  in and to such  Mortgage  Loan,  and all
security and documents relative thereto.  Such assignment shall be an assignment
outright and not for  security.  The Master  Servicer  will  thereupon  own such
Mortgage, and all such security and documents, free of any further obligation to
the Trustee or the Certificateholders with respect thereto.

        If,  however,  the Master  Servicer  shall have  exercised  its right to
repurchase  a Mortgage  Loan  pursuant  to this  Section  4.07 upon the  written
request of and with funds provided by the Junior Certificateholder and thereupon
transferred  such  Mortgage  Loan to the  Junior  Certificateholder,  the Master
Servicer shall so notify the Trustee in writing.

therewith.

                                THE CERTIFICATES

Section 5.01.  The Certificates.
               ----------------

(a) The Senior, Class M, Class B and Class R Certificates shall be substantially
in the forms set forth in Exhibits A, B, C and D,  respectively,  and shall,  on
original  issue,  be executed and  delivered  by the Trustee to the  Certificate
Registrar  for  authentication  and delivery to or upon the order of the Company
upon receipt by the Trustee or one or more Custodians of the documents specified
in Section 2.01. The Certificates shall be issuable in the minimum denominations
designated in the Preliminary Statement to the Series Supplement.

        The Certificates  shall be executed by manual or facsimile  signature on
behalf of an authorized officer of the Trustee.  Certificates bearing the manual
or facsimile  signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers
of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee,  notwithstanding that such individuals or
any of them have ceased to hold such  offices  prior to the  authentication  and
delivery of such  Certificate  or did not hold such  offices at the date of such
Certificates.  No  Certificate  shall be  entitled  to any  benefit  under  this
Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate
a certificate of  authentication  substantially  in the form provided for herein
executed by the Certificate Registrar by manual signature,  and such certificate
upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence,  and the only evidence,  that
such  Certificate  has been duly  authenticated  and  delivered  hereunder.  All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

(b) Except as provided below, registration of Book-Entry Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository that agrees to hold such
Certificates  for the respective  Certificate  Owners with  Ownership  Interests
therein. The Holders of the Book-Entry  Certificates shall hold their respective
Ownership  Interests in and to each of such Certificates  through the book-entry
facilities  of the  Depository  and,  except  as  provided  below,  shall not be
entitled to Definitive Certificates in respect of such Ownership Interests.  All
transfers by Certificate Owners of their respective  Ownership  Interests in the
Book-Entry  Certificates  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  procedures
established by the Depository  Participant or brokerage firm  representing  such
Certificate  Owner.  Each  Depository  Participant  shall transfer the Ownership
Interests  only  in  the  Book-Entry   Certificates  of  Certificate  Owners  it
represents or of brokerage  firms for which it acts as agent in accordance  with
the Depository's normal procedures.

        The  Trustee,  the Master  Servicer and the Company may for all purposes
(including  the making of payments due on the  respective  Classes of Book-Entry
Certificates)  deal with the Depository as the authorized  representative of the
Certificate  Owners  with  respect  to  the  respective  Classes  of  Book-Entry
Certificates  for the purposes of  exercising  the rights of  Certificateholders
hereunder.  The rights of  Certificate  Owners  with  respect to the  respective
Classes of Book-Entry  Certificates shall be limited to those established by law
and agreements between such Certificate  Owners and the Depository  Participants
and brokerage firms representing such Certificate Owners.  Multiple requests and


                                       71
<PAGE>

directions  from,  and  votes  of,  the  Depository  as  Holder  of any Class of
Book-Entry  Certificates  with  respect to any  particular  matter  shall not be
deemed  inconsistent  if they are made with  respect  to  different  Certificate
Owners.  The Trustee may establish a reasonable  record date in connection  with
solicitations  of consents from or voting by  Certificateholders  and shall give
notice to the Depository of such record date.

        If (i)(A) the Company advises the Trustee in writing that the Depository
is no longer  willing or able to  properly  discharge  its  responsibilities  as
Depository and (B) the Company is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii)
the  Company  at its option  advises  the  Trustee in writing  that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Depository, the Trustee shall notify
all Certificate  Owners,  through the Depository,  of the occurrence of any such
event and of the availability of Definitive  Certificates to Certificate  Owners
requesting   the  same.   Upon  surrender  to  the  Trustee  of  the  Book-Entry
Certificates by the Depository,  accompanied by registration  instructions  from
the  Depository  for  registration  of  transfer,  the  Trustee  shall issue the
Definitive  Certificates.  Neither  the  Company,  the Master  Servicer  nor the
Trustee shall be liable for any actions taken by the  Depository or its nominee,
including,  without  limitation,  any delay in delivery of such instructions and
may  conclusively   rely  on,  and  shall  be  protected  in  relying  on,  such
instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates all references herein
to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Company in connection with
the issuance of the Definitive  Certificates pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall
be deemed to be imposed upon and  performed by the Trustee,  and the Trustee and
the Master Servicer shall  recognize the Holders of the Definitive  Certificates
as Certificateholders hereunder.

(c) From time to time  Residential  Funding,  as the initial Holder of the Class
A-V  Certificates,  may  exchange  such  Holder's  Class  A-V  Certificates  for
Subclasses  of Class A-V  Certificates  to be issued  under  this  Agreement  by
delivering a "Request for Exchange" substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit N executed by an authorized officer, which Subclasses, in the aggregate,
will   represent  the   Uncertificated   Class  A-V  REMIC   Regular   Interests
corresponding  to the Class A-V  Certificates so surrendered  for exchange.  Any
Subclass so issued  shall bear a  numerical  designation  commencing  with Class
A-V-1 and continuing sequentially thereafter, and will evidence ownership of the
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interest or Interests specified in writing by such
initial  Holder to the  Trustee.  The  Trustee  may  conclusively,  without  any
independent  verification,  rely on,  and  shall be  protected  in  relying  on,
Residential  Funding's  determinations  of the  Uncertificated  Class  A-V REMIC
Regular Interests corresponding to any Subclass, the Initial Notional Amount and
the initial  Pass-Through  Rate on a Subclass  as set forth in such  Request for
Exchange and the Trustee  shall have no duty to determine if any  Uncertificated
Class  A-V  REMIC  Regular  Interest   designated  on  a  Request  for  Exchange
corresponds  to a Subclass which has  previously  been issued.  Each Subclass so
issued shall be  substantially  in the form set forth in Exhibit A and shall, on
original  issue,  be executed and  delivered  by the Trustee to the  Certificate
Registrar for  authentication  and delivery in accordance with Section  5.01(a).
Every  Certificate  presented or surrendered  for exchange by the initial Holder
shall (if so  required  by the  Trustee or the  Certificate  Registrar)  be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written  instrument of transfer  attached to
such  Certificate and shall be completed to the  satisfaction of the Trustee and
the  Certificate  Registrar  duly executed by, the initial Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.  The  Certificates of any Subclass of Class
A-V  Certificates  may be transferred  in whole,  but not in part, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.02.

Section 5.02.  Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.
               ------------------------------------------------------

(a) The  Trustee  shall cause to be kept at one of the offices or agencies to be
appointed by the Trustee in  accordance  with the  provisions  of Section 8.12 a
Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable  regulations as it may
prescribe, the Trustee shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of
transfers  and  exchanges of  Certificates  as herein  provided.  The Trustee is
initially  appointed  Certificate  Registrar  for  the  purpose  of  registering
Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The
Certificate Registrar,  or the Trustee, shall provide the Master Servicer with a
certified list of Certificateholders as of each Record Date prior to the related
Determination Date.

(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at any office
or agency of the Trustee  maintained  for such purpose  pursuant to Section 8.12
and,  in the  case  of any  Class  M,  Class  B or  Class  R  Certificate,  upon
satisfaction  of the conditions  set forth below,  the Trustee shall execute and
the Certificate  Registrar shall  authenticate  and deliver,  in the name of the
designated  transferee or  transferees,  one or more new  Certificates of a like
Class (or Subclass) and aggregate Percentage Interest.

(c) At the option of the  Certificateholders,  Certificates may be exchanged for
other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like Class (or Subclass) and
aggregate  Percentage  Interest,  upon  surrender  of  the  Certificates  to  be
exchanged  at any such  office  or  agency.  Whenever  any  Certificates  are so
surrendered for exchange the Trustee shall execute and the Certificate Registrar
shall  authenticate  and  deliver  the  Certificates  of such  Class  which  the
Certificateholder  making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate
presented or  surrendered  for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the
Trustee or the Certificate  Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by
a written  instrument  of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

(d) No transfer,  sale,  pledge or other  disposition  of a Class B  Certificate
shall be made unless such transfer,  sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt
from the  registration  requirements  of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and any applicable  state securities laws or is made in accordance with said Act
and laws.  In the event that a transfer of a Class B  Certificate  is to be made
either (i)(A) the Trustee shall require a written Opinion of Counsel  acceptable
to and in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the Company that
such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption,  describing  the  applicable
exemption  and the  basis  therefor,  from  said Act and  laws or is being  made
pursuant to said Act and laws,  which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense
of the  Trustee,  the  Company  or the Master  Servicer  (except  that,  if such
transfer is made by the Company or the Master Servicer or any Affiliate thereof,
the Company or the Master  Servicer  shall  provide  such  Opinion of Counsel at
their own  expense);  provided that such Opinion of Counsel will not be required
in connection with the initial  transfer of any such  Certificate by the Company
or any  Affiliate  thereof to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and (B)
the Trustee shall require the  transferee  to execute a  representation  letter,
substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto, and the Trustee shall require the
transferor  to execute a  representation  letter,  substantially  in the form of
Exhibit I hereto,  each acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee  certifying to the Company and the Trustee the facts
surrounding such transfer,  which representation letters shall not be an expense
of the Trustee, the Company or the Master Servicer; provided, however, that such
representation  letters will not be required in connection  with any transfer of
any such  Certificate by the Company or any Affiliate  thereof to the Company or
an Affiliate of the Company,  and the Trustee shall be entitled to  conclusively


                                       73
<PAGE>

rely upon a representation  (which, upon the request of the Trustee,  shall be a
written representation) from the Company, of the status of such transferee as an
Affiliate  of  the  Company  or  (ii)  the  prospective  transferee  of  such  a
Certificate shall be required to provide the Trustee, the Company and the Master
Servicer  with an  investment  letter  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit  J
attached hereto (or such other form as the Company in its sole discretion  deems
acceptable), which investment letter shall not be an expense of the Trustee, the
Company or the Master Servicer,  and which investment  letter states that, among
other  things,  such  transferee  (A) is a  "qualified  institutional  buyer" as
defined  under Rule 144A,  acting for its own  account or the  accounts of other
"qualified  institutional  buyers" as defined under Rule 144A,  and (B) is aware
that the proposed  transferor intends to rely on the exemption from registration
requirements  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  provided by Rule
144A. The Holder of any such  Certificate  desiring to effect any such transfer,
sale, pledge or other disposition shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee, the Company, the Master Servicer and the Certificate  Registrar against
any liability that may result if the transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition
is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

(e)  (i) In the  case  of any  Class  B or  Class R  Certificate  presented  for
     registration  in the  name of any  Person,  either  (A) the  Trustee  shall
     require  an  Opinion of  Counsel  acceptable  to and in form and  substance
     satisfactory  to the  Trustee,  the Company and the Master  Servicer to the
     effect that the purchase or holding of such Class B or Class R  Certificate
     is permissible  under  applicable law, will not constitute or result in any
     non-exempt  prohibited  transaction  under  Section  406  of  the  Employee
     Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA"),  or Section
     4975 of the Code (or comparable  provisions of any subsequent  enactments),
     and will not subject the Trustee, the Company or the Master Servicer to any
     obligation or liability  (including  obligations or liabilities under ERISA
     or  Section  4975 of the  Code) in  addition  to those  undertaken  in this
     Agreement, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee,
     the Company or the Master Servicer or (B) the prospective  Transferee shall
     be  required to provide the  Trustee,  the Company and the Master  Servicer
     with a certification  to the effect set forth in paragraph six of Exhibit H
     (with respect to any Class B Certificate) or paragraph  fourteen of Exhibit
     G-1 (with respect to any Class R  Certificate),  which the Trustee may rely
     upon without further inquiry or investigation, or such other certifications
     as the Trustee may deem  desirable or necessary in order to establish  that
     such Transferee or the Person in whose name such  registration is requested
     either (a) is not an  employee  benefit  plan or other plan  subject to the
     prohibited  transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or
     any Person (including an investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee
     of any such  plan) who is using  "plan  assets"  of any such plan to effect
     such acquisition  (each, a "Plan Investor") or (b) in the case of any Class
     B Certificate,  the following conditions are satisfied: (i) such Transferee
     is an insurance company,  (ii) the source of funds used to purchase or hold
     such  Certificate  (or interest  therein) is an "insurance  company general

     account" (as defined in U.S.  Department  of Labor  Prohibited  Transaction
     Class  Exemption  ("PTCE")  95-60,  and (iii) the  conditions  set forth in
     Sections I and III of PTCE  95-60 have been  satisfied  (each  entity  that
     satisfies this clause (b), a "Complying Insurance Company").

               (ii) Any  Transferee of a Class M  Certificate  will be deemed to
               have  represented  by virtue of its  purchase  or holding of such
               Certificate (or interest therein) that either (a) such Transferee
               is not a Plan  Investor,  (b) it has acquired and is holding such
               Certificate  in  reliance  on  Prohibited  Transaction  Exemption
               ("PTE") 94-29, 59 Fed. Reg. 14674 (March 29, 1994), as amended by
               PTE 97-34,  62 Fed. Reg. 39021 (July 21, 1997),  and PTE 2000-58,
               65 Fed. Reg. 67765 (November 13, 2000) (the "RFC Exemption"), and
               that it  understands  that there are  certain  conditions  to the
               availability of the RFC Exemption including that such Certificate
               must be rated, at the time of purchase, not lower than "BBB-" (or
               its  equivalent)  by  Standard & Poor's,  Fitch or Moody's or (c)
               such Transferee is a Complying Insurance Company.

               (iii) (A) If any Class M Certificate (or any interest therein) is
               acquired  or  held  by any  Person  that  does  not  satisfy  the
               conditions  described  in  paragraph  (ii)  above,  then the last
               preceding Transferee that either (i) is not a Plan Investor, (ii)
               acquired such  Certificate in compliance  with the RFC Exemption,
               or (iii) is a Complying  Insurance Company shall be restored,  to
               the extent  permitted  by law, to all rights and  obligations  as
               Certificate  Owner  thereof  retroactive  to  the  date  of  such
               Transfer of such Class M Certificate.  The Trustee shall be under
               no  liability  to any Person for making any  payments due on such
               Certificate to such preceding Transferee.

                      (B) Any purported  Certificate  Owner whose acquisition or
               holding of any Class M  Certificate  (or  interest  therein)  was
               effected in violation of the restrictions in this Section 5.02(e)
               shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,  the Trustee,  the
               Master Servicer, any Subservicer,  the Underwriters and the Trust
               Fund from and against any and all liabilities,  claims,  costs or
               expenses incurred by such parties as a result of such acquisition
               or holding.

(f) (i) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership  Interest in a Class R
Certificate  shall be deemed by the  acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership
Interest  to have  agreed to be bound by the  following  provisions  and to have
irrevocably  authorized the Trustee or its designee under clause  (iii)(A) below
to deliver  payments  to a Person  other than such Person and to  negotiate  the
terms of any  mandatory  sale under  clause  (iii)(B)  below and to execute  all
instruments of transfer and to do all other things  necessary in connection with
any such sale. The rights of each Person  acquiring any Ownership  Interest in a
Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:

(A)  Each  Person  holding or  acquiring  any  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
     Certificate  shall be a Permitted  Transferee and shall promptly notify the
     Trustee of any  change or  impending  change in its  status as a  Permitted
     Transferee.

                                       75
<PAGE>

(B)  In connection  with any proposed  Transfer of any  Ownership  Interest in a
     Class R  Certificate,  the Trustee shall require  delivery to it, and shall
     not register the Transfer of any Class R Certificate  until its receipt of,
     (I) an affidavit and agreement (a "Transfer  Affidavit and  Agreement,"  in
     the form attached hereto as Exhibit G-1) from the proposed  Transferee,  in
     form and substance  satisfactory to the Master  Servicer,  representing and
     warranting,  among other things, that it is a Permitted Transferee, that it
     is not acquiring its Ownership  Interest in the Class R Certificate that is
     the subject of the proposed Transfer as a nominee, trustee or agent for any
     Person who is not a  Permitted  Transferee,  that for so long as it retains
     its Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, it will endeavor to remain
     a Permitted  Transferee,  and that it has reviewed the  provisions  of this
     Section 5.02(f) and agrees to be bound by them, and (II) a certificate,  in
     the form  attached  hereto as  Exhibit  G-2,  from the  Holder  wishing  to
     transfer the Class R Certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to the
     Master Servicer,  representing and warranting,  among other things, that no
     purpose of the proposed  Transfer is to impede the assessment or collection
     of tax.

(C)  Notwithstanding  the delivery of a Transfer  Affidavit  and  Agreement by a
     proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible Officer of the
     Trustee who is assigned to this  Agreement  has actual  knowledge  that the
     proposed  Transferee  is not a  Permitted  Transferee,  no  Transfer  of an
     Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate  to such  proposed  Transferee
     shall be effected.

(D)  Each  Person  holding or  acquiring  any  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
     Certificate  shall agree (x) to require a Transfer  Affidavit and Agreement
     from any  other  Person  to whom  such  Person  attempts  to  transfer  its
     Ownership  Interest in a Class R  Certificate  and (y) not to transfer  its
     Ownership  Interest  unless it provides a certificate to the Trustee in the
     form attached hereto as Exhibit G-2.

(E)  Each  Person  holding  or  acquiring  an  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
     Certificate,  by  purchasing  an  Ownership  Interest in such  Certificate,
     agrees  to give  the  Trustee  written  notice  that it is a  "pass-through
     interest  holder"  within the  meaning of  Temporary  Treasury  Regulations
     Section   1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A)   immediately  upon  acquiring  an  Ownership
     Interest  in a Class R  Certificate,  if it is, or is holding an  Ownership
     Interest in a Class R Certificate  on behalf of, a  "pass-through  interest
     holder."

(ii)    The Trustee will register the Transfer of any Class R  Certificate  only
        if it shall have  received  the  Transfer  Affidavit  and  Agreement,  a
        certificate of the Holder  requesting such transfer in the form attached
        hereto as Exhibit G-2 and all of such other documents as shall have been
        reasonably  required by the Trustee as a condition to such registration.
        Transfers of the Class R Certificates  to Non-United  States Persons and
        Disqualified  Organizations  (as  defined in Section  860E(e)(5)  of the
        Code) are prohibited.

                                       76
<PAGE>

(iii)(A) If any  Disqualified  Organization  shall  become a holder of a Class R
     Certificate,   then  the  last  preceding  Permitted  Transferee  shall  be
     restored,  to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and obligations as
     Holder thereof  retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of
     such Class R  Certificate.  If a  Non-United  States  Person shall become a
     holder of a Class R  Certificate,  then the last  preceding  United  States
     Person shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and
     obligations as Holder thereof  retroactive to the date of  registration  of
     such  Transfer  of such Class R  Certificate.  If a  transfer  of a Class R
     Certificate  is   disregarded   pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Treasury
     Regulations  Section 1.860E-1 or Section 1.860G-3,  then the last preceding
     Permitted Transferee shall be restored,  to the extent permitted by law, to
     all rights and  obligations  as Holder  thereof  retroactive to the date of
     registration  of such  Transfer  of such Class R  Certificate.  The Trustee
     shall be under no liability to any Person for any  registration of Transfer
     of a Class R  Certificate  that is in fact not  permitted  by this  Section
     5.02(f) or for making any  payments due on such  Certificate  to the holder
     thereof or for taking any other  action with  respect to such holder  under
     the provisions of this Agreement.

     (B)  If any  purported  Transferee  shall  become  a  Holder  of a  Class R
          Certificate in violation of the  restrictions  in this Section 5.02(f)
          and to the extent that the  retroactive  restoration  of the rights of
          the Holder of such Class R Certificate as described in clause (iii)(A)
          above  shall be  invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable,  then the Master
          Servicer  shall  have the right,  without  notice to the holder or any
          prior  holder  of such  Class R  Certificate,  to  sell  such  Class R
          Certificate  to a purchaser  selected  by the Master  Servicer on such
          terms as the Master  Servicer may choose.  Such  purported  Transferee
          shall  promptly  endorse  and  deliver  each  Class R  Certificate  in
          accordance  with  the  instructions  of  the  Master  Servicer.   Such
          purchaser  may be the Master  Servicer  itself or any Affiliate of the
          Master  Servicer.  The proceeds of such sale,  net of the  commissions
          (which may include  commissions  payable to the Master Servicer or its
          Affiliates),  expenses and taxes due, if any,  will be remitted by the
          Master Servicer to such purported Transferee. The terms and conditions
          of any sale under this clause (iii)(B) shall be determined in the sole
          discretion of the Master  Servicer,  and the Master Servicer shall not
          be liable to any  Person  having an  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
          Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.

(iv) The Master Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee,  shall make available,  upon
     written request from the Trustee, all information  necessary to compute any
     tax imposed (A) as a result of the Transfer of an  Ownership  Interest in a
     Class R  Certificate  to any  Person  who is a  Disqualified  Organization,
     including the  information  regarding  "excess  inclusions" of such Class R
     Certificates  required to be provided to the Internal  Revenue  Service and
     certain   Persons   as   described   in   Treasury   Regulations   Sections
     1.860D-1(b)(5)  and  1.860E-2(a)(5),  and (B) as a result of any  regulated
     investment  company,  real  estate  investment  trust,  common  trust fund,
     partnership, trust, estate or organization described in Section 1381 of the
     Code that holds an Ownership  Interest in a Class R  Certificate  having as
     among its  record  holders  at any time any  Person  who is a  Disqualified
     Organization. Reasonable compensation for providing such information may be
     required by the Master Servicer from such Person.

(v)     The  provisions  of this Section  5.02(f) set forth prior to this clause
        (v) may be modified,  added to or eliminated,  provided that there shall
        have been delivered to the Trustee the following:

     (A)  written  notification  from each Rating  Agency to the effect that the
          modification,  addition to or elimination of such  provisions will not
          cause such Rating Agency to downgrade  its  then-current  ratings,  if
          any, of any Class of the Senior, Class M or Class B Certificates below
          the lower of the  then-current  rating or the rating  assigned to such
          Certificates as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency; and

     (B)  subject to Section  10.01(f),  an Officers'  Certificate of the Master
          Servicer  stating that the Master  Servicer has received an Opinion of
          Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Master Servicer, to
          the  effect  that such  modification,  addition  to or absence of such
          provisions  will not cause any portion of any REMIC  formed  under the
          Series  Supplement  to cease to  qualify as a REMIC and will not cause
          (x) any portion of any REMIC formed under the Series  Supplement to be
          subject to an  entity-level  tax caused by the Transfer of any Class R
          Certificate to a Person that is a Disqualified  Organization  or (y) a
          Certificateholder  or another Person to be subject to a  REMIC-related
          tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R  Certificate  to a Person that
          is not a Permitted Transferee.

     (g) No  service  charge  shall  be made for any  transfer  or  exchange  of
Certificates  of any  Class,  but  the  Trustee  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover  any tax or  governmental  charge  that may be  imposed  in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

     (h) All  Certificates  surrendered  for  transfer  and  exchange  shall  be
destroyed by the Certificate Registrar.

Section 5.03.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.
               --------------------------------------------------

        If (i) any  mutilated  Certificate  is  surrendered  to the  Certificate
Registrar,  or the Trustee and the  Certificate  Registrar  receive  evidence to
their  satisfaction of the destruction,  loss or theft of any  Certificate,  and
(ii) there is  delivered  to the  Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar  such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them  harmless,
then, in the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate  Registrar that
such  Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,  the Trustee shall
execute  and the  Certificate  Registrar  shall  authenticate  and  deliver,  in
exchange  for or in lieu  of any  such  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Certificate,  a new Certificate of like tenor, Class and Percentage Interest but
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate  under this  Section,  the  Trustee may require the payment of a sum


                                       78
<PAGE>

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental  charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the
Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar)  connected  therewith.  Any  duplicate
Certificate  issued  pursuant to this  Section  shall  constitute  complete  and
indefeasible  evidence of ownership in the Trust Fund, as if originally  issued,
whether or not the lost,  stolen or destroyed  Certificate shall be found at any
time.

Section 5.04.  Persons Deemed Owners.
               ---------------------

        Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Company,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee,  any Certificate  Insurer,  the
Certificate  Registrar and any agent of the Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the
Trustee,  any  Certificate  Insurer or the  Certificate  Registrar may treat the
Person  in  whose  name  any  Certificate  is  registered  as the  owner of such
Certificate for the purpose of receiving  distributions pursuant to Section 4.02
and for all other purposes  whatsoever,  except as and to the extent provided in
the  definition  of  "Certificateholder,"  and neither the  Company,  the Master
Servicer,  the Trustee, any Certificate  Insurer, the Certificate  Registrar nor
any agent of the Company,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee,  any  Certificate
Insurer or the Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary
except as provided in Section 5.02(f).

Section 5.05.  Appointment of Paying Agent.
               ---------------------------

        The  Trustee  may  appoint  a Paying  Agent  for the  purpose  of making
distributions to the  Certificateholders  pursuant to Section 4.02. In the event
of any  such  appointment,  on or  prior to each  Distribution  Date the  Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trustee  shall  deposit or cause to be deposited  with
the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to make the payments to the Certificateholders
in the amounts and in the manner  provided for in Section  4.02,  such sum to be
held in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

        The Trustee  shall cause each Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying  Agent shall agree with the Trustee
that such  Paying  Agent  will hold all sums held by it for the  payment  to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the  Certificateholders  entitled
thereto  until such sums shall be paid to such  Certificateholders.  Any sums so
held by such Paying Agent shall be held only in Eligible  Accounts to the extent
such sums are not distributed to the  Certificateholders  on the date of receipt
by such Paying Agent.

                       THE COMPANY AND THE MASTER SERVICER

Section 6.01.  Respective Liabilities of the Company and the Master Servicer.
               --------------------------------------------------------------

        The Company and the Master  Servicer  shall each be liable in accordance
herewith only to the extent of the  obligations  specifically  and  respectively
imposed upon and undertaken by the Company and the Master  Servicer  herein.  By
way of  illustration  and not  limitation,  the  Company  is not  liable for the
servicing  and  administration  of the  Mortgage  Loans,  nor is it obligated by
Section 7.01 or Section 10.01 to assume any  obligations of the Master  Servicer
or to appoint a designee  to assume such  obligations,  nor is it liable for any
other  obligation  hereunder that it may, but is not obligated to, assume unless
it elects to assume such obligation in accordance herewith.

Section 6.02.  Merger or  Consolidation  of the Company or the Master  Servicer;
     Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties by Master Servicer.

(a) The  Company  and the  Master  Servicer  will each keep in full  effect  its
existence, rights and franchises as a corporation under the laws of the state of
its  incorporation,  and will each obtain and preserve its  qualification  to do
business  as  a  foreign   corporation  in  each   jurisdiction  in  which  such
qualification   is  or  shall  be   necessary   to  protect  the   validity  and
enforceability of this Agreement,  the Certificates or any of the Mortgage Loans
and to perform its respective duties under this Agreement.

(b) Any Person  into which the Company or the Master  Servicer  may be merged or
consolidated,  or any corporation  resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which  the  Company  or the  Master  Servicer  shall be a party,  or any  Person
succeeding to the business of the Company or the Master  Servicer,  shall be the
successor of the Company or the Master Servicer,  as the case may be, hereunder,
without the  execution  or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties  hereto,  anything  herein to the  contrary  notwithstanding;
provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person to the Master Servicer
shall be qualified to service  mortgage loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac; and  provided  further that each Rating  Agency's  ratings,  if any, of the
Senior,  Class M or Class B  Certificates  in effect  immediately  prior to such
merger or consolidation will not be qualified,  reduced or withdrawn as a result
thereof (as evidenced by a letter to such effect from each Rating Agency).

(c)  Notwithstanding  anything else in this Section 6.02 and Section 6.04 to the
contrary,  the Master Servicer may assign its rights and delegate its duties and
obligations  under  this  Agreement;  provided  that the Person  accepting  such
assignment  or  delegation  shall be a  Person  which is  qualified  to  service
mortgage   loans  on  behalf  of  Fannie  Mae  or  Freddie  Mac,  is  reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company,  is willing to service the Mortgage
Loans and executes and delivers to the Company and the Trustee an agreement,  in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, which
contains an  assumption by such Person of the due and punctual  performance  and
observance  of each  covenant  and  condition to be performed or observed by the
Master Servicer under this Agreement; provided further that each Rating Agency's


                                       80
<PAGE>

rating of the Classes of Certificates that have been rated in effect immediately
prior to such  assignment  and  delegation  will not be  qualified,  reduced  or
withdrawn  as a result of such  assignment  and  delegation  (as  evidenced by a
letter  to such  effect  from  each  Rating  Agency).  In the  case of any  such
assignment  and  delegation,  the Master  Servicer  shall be  released  from its
obligations  under this Agreement,  except that the Master Servicer shall remain
liable for all  liabilities  and  obligations  incurred by it as Master Servicer
hereunder  prior to the  satisfaction  of the conditions to such  assignment and
delegation set forth in the next preceding sentence.

Section 6.03.  Limitation on Liability of the Company,
                      the Master Servicer and Others.

        Neither  the  Company,  the Master  Servicer  nor any of the  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents of the Company or the Master  Servicer  shall be
under any liability to the Trust Fund or the  Certificateholders  for any action
taken or for refraining  from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to
this  Agreement,  or for  errors  in  judgment;  provided,  however,  that  this
provision shall not protect the Company,  the Master Servicer or any such Person
against any breach of warranties or representations made herein or any liability
which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance,  bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard
of obligations and duties  hereunder.  The Company,  the Master Servicer and any
director,  officer,  employee or agent of the Company or the Master Servicer may
rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and
submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising  hereunder.  The Company,
the Master Servicer and any director,  officer, employee or agent of the Company
or the Master  Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trust Fund and held harmless
against any loss,  liability or expense  incurred in  connection  with any legal
action  relating to this  Agreement  or the  Certificates,  other than any loss,
liability or expense  related to any specific  Mortgage  Loan or Mortgage  Loans
(except as any such loss,  liability or expense shall be otherwise  reimbursable
pursuant  to this  Agreement)  and any loss,  liability  or expense  incurred by
reason of willful misfeasance,  bad faith or gross negligence in the performance
of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties
hereunder.

        Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Master  Servicer  shall  be  under  any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal or administrative action,
proceeding,  hearing or  examination  that is not  incidental to its  respective
duties  under this  Agreement  and which in its  opinion  may  involve it in any
expense or liability; provided, however, that the Company or the Master Servicer
may  in its  discretion  undertake  any  such  action,  proceeding,  hearing  or
examination that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement
and the  rights  and  duties of the  parties  hereto  and the  interests  of the
Certificateholders  hereunder.  In such event,  the legal  expenses and costs of
such action,  proceeding,  hearing or  examination  and any liability  resulting
therefrom  shall be expenses,  costs and  liabilities of the Trust Fund, and the
Company and the Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed  therefor out
of amounts  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans on  deposit  in the  Custodial
Account as provided by Section 3.10 and, on the Distribution  Date(s)  following
such reimbursement,  the aggregate of such expenses and costs shall be allocated
in reduction of the Accrued Certificate  Interest on each Class entitled thereto
in the same  manner as if such  expenses  and  costs  constituted  a  Prepayment
Interest Shortfall.

Section 6.04.  Company and Master Servicer Not to Resign.
               -----------------------------------------

        Subject to the  provisions of Section 6.02,  neither the Company nor the
Master  Servicer shall resign from its respective  obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon  determination that its duties hereunder are no longer
permissible  under  applicable  law.  Any  such  determination   permitting  the
resignation  of the  Company or the Master  Servicer  shall be  evidenced  by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Trustee.  No such resignation
by the Master  Servicer shall become  effective until the Trustee or a successor
servicer  shall  have  assumed  the  Master  Servicer's   responsibilities   and
obligations in accordance with Section 7.02.

Section 7.01.  Events of Default.
               -----------------

        Event of Default,  wherever used herein,  means any one of the following
events  (whatever  reason  for such  Event of  Default  and  whether it shall be

        Agreement and, in either case,  such failure shall  continue  unremedied
        for a period of 5 days after the date upon which written  notice of such
        failure, requiring such failure to be remedied, shall have been given to
        the  Master  Servicer  by the  Trustee  or the  Company or to the Master
        Servicer,  the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of Certificates of
        such Class  evidencing  Percentage  Interests  aggregating not less than
        25%; or

(ii) the Master  Servicer  shall  fail to  observe  or  perform in any  material
     respect any other of the  covenants or agreements on the part of the Master
     Servicer  contained in the  Certificates  of any Class or in this Agreement
     and such failure shall continue  unremedied for a period of 30 days (except
     that such  number of days  shall be 15 in the case of a failure  to pay the
     premium for any Required  Insurance Policy) after the date on which written
     notice of such failure,  requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been
     given to the  Master  Servicer  by the  Trustee or the  Company,  or to the
     Master Servicer, the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of Certificates
     of  any  Class  evidencing,  in the  case  of any  such  Class,  Percentage
     Interests aggregating not less than 25%; or

(iii)   a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory  authority  having
        jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or
        future  federal  or  state  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  similar  law or
        appointing a conservator  or receiver or  liquidator in any  insolvency,
        readjustment  of debt,  marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar
        proceedings,  or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall
        have been entered  against the Master  Servicer and such decree or order
        shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
        days; or

(iv)    the Master Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator or
        receiver  or  liquidator  in  any  insolvency,   readjustment  of  debt,
        marshalling of assets and  liabilities,  or similar  proceedings  of, or
        relating  to,  the  Master  Servicer  or  of,  or  relating  to,  all or
        substantially all of the property of the Master Servicer; or

(v)     the Master  Servicer  shall  admit in writing its  inability  to pay its
        debts  generally as they become due,  file a petition to take  advantage
        of, or commence a voluntary  case under,  any  applicable  insolvency or
        reorganization  statute,  make  an  assignment  for the  benefit  of its
        creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations; or

                                       83
<PAGE>

(vi)    the Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.04(b)
        that it is unable to deposit in the Certificate  Account an amount equal
        to the Advance.

        If an Event of  Default  described  in clauses  (i)-(v) of this  Section
shall  occur,  then,  and in each and every such case,  so long as such Event of
Default shall not have been remedied, either the Company or the Trustee may, and
at the  direction  of Holders of  Certificates  entitled  to at least 51% of the
Voting Rights,  the Trustee shall,  by notice in writing to the Master  Servicer
(and to the  Company if given by the  Trustee or to the  Trustee if given by the
Company),  terminate all of the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer
under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds  thereof,
other than its rights as a Certificateholder  hereunder.  If an Event of Default
described in clause (vi) hereof shall occur, the Trustee shall, by notice to the
Master  Servicer and the Company,  immediately  terminate  all of the rights and
obligations  of the  Master  Servicer  under  this  Agreement  and in and to the
Mortgage  Loans  and  the  proceeds   thereof,   other  than  its  rights  as  a
Certificateholder  hereunder  as  provided in Section  4.04(b).  On or after the
receipt by the Master Servicer of such written  notice,  all authority and power
of the  Master  Servicer  under  this  Agreement,  whether  with  respect to the
Certificates  (other  than  as a  Holder  thereof)  or  the  Mortgage  Loans  or
otherwise, shall subject to Section 7.02 pass to and be vested in the Trustee or
the  Trustee's  designee  appointed  pursuant  to  Section  7.02;  and,  without
limitation,  the  Trustee is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to execute  and
deliver, on behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any
and all documents and other instruments,  and to do or accomplish all other acts
or things  necessary  or  appropriate  to effect the  purposes of such notice of
termination,  whether to complete the transfer and  endorsement or assignment of
the Mortgage  Loans and related  documents,  or otherwise.  The Master  Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the  termination of the Master
Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation,
the transfer to the Trustee or its designee for administration by it of all cash
amounts  which  shall at the time be credited  to the  Custodial  Account or the
Certificate  Account or  thereafter  be received  with  respect to the  Mortgage
Loans. No such  termination  shall release the Master Servicer for any liability
that it would  otherwise  have  hereunder  for any act or omission  prior to the
effective time of such termination.

        Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of Residential Funding
in its  capacity as Master  Servicer  hereunder,  Residential  Funding  shall be
entitled  to  receive,  out of any late  collection  of a Monthly  Payment  on a
Mortgage  Loan  which  was  due  prior  to the  notice  terminating  Residential
Funding's rights and obligations as Master Servicer hereunder and received after
such notice,  that portion to which Residential Funding would have been entitled
pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(ii), (vi) and (vii) as well as its Servicing Fee in
respect thereof,  and any other amounts payable to Residential Funding hereunder
the  entitlement  to which  arose  prior to the  termination  of its  activities
hereunder.  Upon the  termination  of  Residential  Funding  as Master  Servicer
hereunder the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a copy of the Program Guide.

Section 7.02.  Trustee or Company to Act; Appointment of Successor.
               ----------------------------------------------------

(a) On and after the time the Master  Servicer  receives a notice of termination
pursuant to Section 7.01 or resigns in accordance with Section 6.04, the Trustee
or, upon notice to the Company and with the Company's  consent  (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld) a designee (which meets the standards set forth below)
of the Trustee, shall be the successor in all respects to the Master Servicer in
its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the  transactions set forth or
provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities  relating  thereto  placed on the Master  Servicer  (except  for the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities contained in Sections 2.02 and 2.03(a),
excluding  the duty to notify  related  Subservicers  or Sellers as set forth in
such  Sections,  and its  obligations  to  deposit  amounts in respect of losses
incurred  prior to such notice or  termination on the investment of funds in the
Custodial  Account or the Certificate  Account  pursuant to Sections 3.07(c) and
4.01(b) by the terms and provisions hereof); provided, however, that any failure
to  perform  such  duties or  responsibilities  caused by the  preceding  Master
Servicer's failure to provide information  required by Section 4.04 shall not be
considered a default by the Trustee  hereunder.  As compensation  therefor,  the
Trustee shall be entitled to all funds  relating to the Mortgage Loans which the
Master  Servicer would have been entitled to charge to the Custodial  Account or
the  Certificate  Account if the Master  Servicer had continued to act hereunder
and, in addition, shall be entitled to the income from any Permitted Investments
made with  amounts  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans held in the  Custodial
Account or the Certificate  Account.  If the Trustee has become the successor to
the Master  Servicer in  accordance  with  Section  6.04 or Section  7.01,  then
notwithstanding  the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to so act,
or shall, if it is unable to so act,  appoint,  or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint,  any established housing and home finance  institution,
which  is  also  a  Fannie  Mae-  or  Freddie  Mac-approved  mortgage  servicing
institution, having a net worth of not less than $10,000,000 as the successor to
the  Master  Servicer  hereunder  in the  assumption  of all or any  part of the
responsibilities,  duties  or  liabilities  of the  Master  Servicer  hereunder.
Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder, the Trustee
shall become  successor to the Master Servicer and shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove  provided.  In connection with such appointment and assumption,  the
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on  Mortgage  Loans as it and such  successor  shall  agree;  provided,
however,  that no such  compensation  shall be in excess of that  permitted  the
initial Master Servicer hereunder.  The Company,  the Trustee, the Custodian and
such successor shall take such action,  consistent with this Agreement, as shall
be  necessary to  effectuate  any such  succession.  The  Servicing  Fee for any
successor  Master  Servicer  appointed  pursuant  to this  Section  7.02 will be
lowered with respect to those Mortgage Loans, if any, where the Subservicing Fee
accrues at a rate of less than  0.20% per annum in the event that the  successor
Master  Servicer  is  not  servicing  such  Mortgage  Loans  directly  and it is
necessary to raise the related  Subservicing Fee to a rate of 0.20% per annum in
order to hire a Subservicer with respect to such Mortgage Loans.

        (b) In connection  with the  termination  or  resignation  of the Master
Servicer  hereunder,  either (i) the successor  Master  Servicer,  including the
Trustee if the Trustee is acting as successor Master  Servicer,  shall represent
and  warrant  that it is a member of MERS in good  standing  and shall  agree to
comply  in all  material  respects  with the  rules  and  procedures  of MERS in
connection  with the servicing of the Mortgage  Loans that are  registered  with
MERS, in which case the  predecessor  Master  Servicer shall  cooperate with the
successor  Master  Servicer in causing MERS to revise its records to reflect the
transfer of servicing to the successor  Master Servicer as necessary under MERS'
rules and regulations,  or (ii) the predecessor  Master Servicer shall cooperate
with the  successor  Master  Servicer in causing  MERS to execute and deliver an

the Trustee and to execute and deliver such other  notices,  documents and other
instruments  as may be  necessary  or  desirable  to effect a  transfer  of such
Mortgage Loan or servicing of such  Mortgage  Loan on the MERS(R)  System to the
successor Master Servicer.  The predecessor  Master Servicer shall file or cause
to be  filed  any such  assignment  in the  appropriate  recording  office.  The
predecessor  Master  Servicer  shall  bear any and all  fees of  MERS,  costs of
preparing  any  assignments  of  Mortgage,  and fees and  costs  of  filing  any
assignments  of Mortgage  that may be required  under this  subsection  (b). The
successor  Master  Servicer  shall cause such  assignment to be delivered to the
Trustee or the Custodian  promptly upon receipt of the original with evidence of
recording  thereon or a copy certified by the public  recording  office in which
such assignment was recorded.

Section 7.03.  Notification to Certificateholders.
               -----------------------------------

(a) Upon any such  termination  or  appointment  of a  successor  to the  Master
Servicer,   the  Trustee  shall  give  prompt  written  notice  thereof  to  the
Certificateholders  at their respective  addresses  appearing in the Certificate
Register.

(b) Within 60 days after the  occurrence  of any Event of  Default,  the Trustee
shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Certificates  notice of each such Event
of Default  hereunder  known to the Trustee,  unless such Event of Default shall
have been cured or waived.

Section 7.04.  Waiver of Events of Default.
               ----------------------------

        The Holders representing at least 66% of the Voting Rights affected by a
default  or Event of  Default  hereunder  may  waive  such  default  or Event of
Default; provided,  however, that (a) a default or Event of Default under clause
(i) of Section  7.01 may be waived  only by all of the  Holders of  Certificates
affected by such default or Event of Default and (b) no waiver  pursuant to this
Section 7.04 shall affect the Holders of Certificates in the manner set forth in
Section  11.01(b)(i)  or (ii).  Upon any such  waiver of a  default  or Event of
Default by the Holders  representing  the requisite  percentage of Voting Rights
affected by such  default or Event of Default,  such default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose
hereunder.  No such waiver shall extend to any  subsequent  or other  default or
Event of  Default or impair any right  consequent  thereon  except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

Section 8.01.  Duties of Trustee.
               -----------------

(a) The Trustee,  prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default and after the
curing or waiver of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are  specifically  set forth in this
Agreement. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or
waived),  the Trustee shall  exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this  Agreement,  and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise
as a prudent  investor  would  exercise  or use under the  circumstances  in the
conduct of such investor's own affairs.

(b) The Trustee,  upon  receipt of all  resolutions,  certificates,  statements,
opinions,  reports,  documents,  orders or other  instruments  furnished  to the
Trustee  which  are  specifically  required  to be  furnished  pursuant  to  any
provision  of this  Agreement,  shall  examine  them to  determine  whether they
conform to the  requirements  of this  Agreement.  The Trustee  shall notify the
Certificateholders  of any such documents which do not materially conform to the
requirements  of  this  Agreement  in the  event  that  the  Trustee,  after  so
requesting, does not receive satisfactorily corrected documents.

        The Trustee shall  forward or cause to be forwarded in a timely  fashion
the  notices,  reports and  statements  required to be  forwarded by the Trustee
pursuant to Sections 4.03,  4.06, 7.03 and 10.01. The Trustee shall furnish in a
timely fashion to the Master  Servicer such  information as the Master  Servicer
may reasonably  request from time to time for the Master Servicer to fulfill its
duties as set forth in this Agreement.  The Trustee covenants and agrees that it
shall perform its obligations hereunder in a manner so as to maintain the status
of any portion of any REMIC formed under the Series  Supplement as a REMIC under
the REMIC Provisions and (subject to Section 10.01(f)) to prevent the imposition
of any federal, state or local income,  prohibited transaction,  contribution or
other tax on the Trust  Fund to the  extent  that  maintaining  such  status and
avoiding  such taxes are  reasonably  within the  control of the Trustee and are
reasonably within the scope of its duties under this Agreement.

(c) No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be construed to relieve the Trustee
from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or
its own willful misconduct; provided, however, that:

(i)  Prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  and after the curing or
     waiver of all such Events of Default  which may have  occurred,  the duties
     and  obligations  of the Trustee shall be determined  solely by the express
     provisions  of this  Agreement,  the Trustee shall not be liable except for
     the  performance  of such duties and  obligations as are  specifically  set
     forth in this Agreement,  no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
     into this Agreement against the Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on
     the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
     of the statements and the  correctness of the opinions  expressed  therein,
     upon any  certificates or opinions  furnished to the Trustee by the Company
     or the Master  Servicer  and which on their  face,  do not  contradict  the
     requirements of this Agreement;

                                       87
<PAGE>

(ii)    The Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error of judgment made
        in good faith by a Responsible  Officer or  Responsible  Officers of the
        Trustee,  unless it shall be proved that the Trustee  was  negligent  in
        ascertaining the pertinent facts;

(iii)   The Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable with respect to any action
        taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
        with  the   direction  of   Certificateholders   of  any  Class  holding
        Certificates  which  evidence,  as to such Class,  Percentage  Interests
        aggregating  not  less  than 25% as to the  time,  method  and  place of
        conducting any proceeding  for any remedy  available to the Trustee,  or
        exercising  any trust or power  conferred  upon the Trustee,  under this
        Agreement;

(iv)    The Trustee  shall not be charged with  knowledge of any default  (other
        than a default in payment to the  Trustee)  specified in clauses (i) and
        (ii) of Section 7.01 or an Event of Default  under clauses  (iii),  (iv)
        and (v) of Section  7.01  unless a  Responsible  Officer of the  Trustee
        assigned to and working in the  Corporate  Trust Office  obtains  actual
        knowledge  of such  failure  or event or the  Trustee  receives  written
        notice of such failure or event at its  Corporate  Trust Office from the
        Master Servicer, the Company or any Certificateholder; and

(v)     Except to the extent  provided in Section  7.02,  no  provision  in this
        Agreement  shall  require  the  Trustee  to expend or risk its own funds
        (including,  without limitation, the making of any Advance) or otherwise
        incur any personal financial  liability in the performance of any of its
        duties as Trustee hereunder,  or in the exercise of any of its rights or
        powers, if the Trustee shall have reasonable  grounds for believing that
        repayment of funds or adequate  indemnity against such risk or liability
        is not reasonably assured to it.

(d) The Trustee shall timely pay, from its own funds,  the amount of any and all
federal,  state and local  taxes  imposed  on the  Trust  Fund or its  assets or
transactions including, without limitation, (A) "prohibited transaction" penalty
taxes as defined in Section 860F of the Code,  if, when and as the same shall be
due and payable,  (B) any tax on contributions to a REMIC after the Closing Date
imposed  by  Section  860G(d)  of the Code and (C) any tax on "net  income  from
foreclosure  property"  as defined in Section  860G(c) of the Code,  but only if
such taxes  arise out of a breach by the Trustee of its  obligations  hereunder,
which breach constitutes negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee.

Section 8.02.  Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

(a)     Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

(i)     The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from
        acting  upon  any  resolution,  Officers'  Certificate,  certificate  of
        auditors  or any  other  certificate,  statement,  instrument,  opinion,
        report, notice, request,  consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper
        or  document  believed  by it to be genuine  and to have been  signed or
        presented by the proper party or parties;

                                       88
<PAGE>

(ii) The Trustee may consult  with  counsel and any Opinion of Counsel  shall be
     full and complete  authorization  and  protection  in respect of any action
     taken  or  suffered  or  omitted  by it  hereunder  in  good  faith  and in
     accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

(iii)The Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of the trusts or
     powers vested in it by this  Agreement or to  institute,  conduct or defend
     any  litigation  hereunder or in relation  hereto at the request,  order or
     direction of any of the  Certificateholders,  pursuant to the provisions of
     this Agreement,  unless such  Certificateholders  shall have offered to the
     Trustee  reasonable  security or indemnity against the costs,  expenses and
     liabilities  which may be incurred  therein or thereby;  nothing  contained
     herein  shall,  however,  relieve the Trustee of the  obligation,  upon the
     occurrence of an Event of Default (which has not been cured or waived),  to
     exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement,  and
     to use the same  degree  of care and skill in their  exercise  as a prudent
     investor  would exercise or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of
     such investor's own affairs;

(iv) The Trustee shall not be personally  liable for any action taken,  suffered
     or omitted  by it in good  faith and  believed  by it to be  authorized  or
     within  the  discretion  or  rights  or  powers  conferred  upon it by this
     Agreement;

(v)  Prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  hereunder  and after the
     curing or waiver of all  Events of  Default  which may have  occurred,  the
     Trustee  shall  not be bound to make any  investigation  into the  facts or
     matters  stated  in any  resolution,  certificate,  statement,  instrument,
     opinion,  report, notice, request,  consent, order, approval, bond or other
     paper or  document,  unless  requested  in  writing  so to do by Holders of
     Certificates  of  any  Class  evidencing,  as  to  such  Class,  Percentage
     Interests,  aggregating not less than 50%; provided,  however,  that if the
     payment within a reasonable  time to the Trustee of the costs,  expenses or
     liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation
     is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by
     the security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee may
     require  reasonable  indemnity  against  such  expense  or  liability  as a
     condition  to  so  proceeding.   The  reasonable   expense  of  every  such
     examination  shall be paid by the Master  Servicer,  if an Event of Default
     shall   have   occurred   and  is   continuing,   and   otherwise   by  the
     Certificateholder requesting the investigation;

(vi)    The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform
        any  duties  hereunder  either  directly  or by  or  through  agents  or
        attorneys; and

(vii)To the extent  authorized  under the Code and the  regulations  promulgated
     thereunder,  each  Holder  of a  Class  R  Certificate  hereby  irrevocably
     appoints and authorizes the Trustee to be its attorney-in-fact for purposes
     of  signing  any Tax  Returns  required  to be filed on behalf of the Trust
     Fund. The Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust Fund and deliver to the
     Master Servicer in a timely manner any Tax Returns prepared by or on behalf
     of the Master  Servicer  that the Trustee is required to sign as determined
     by the Master Servicer pursuant to applicable  federal,  state or local tax
     laws,  provided that the Master  Servicer  shall  indemnify the Trustee for
     signing any such Tax Returns that contain errors or omissions.

                                       89
<PAGE>

(b) Following the issuance of the Certificates, the Trustee shall not accept any
contribution of assets to the Trust Fund unless (subject to Section 10.01(f)) it
shall have obtained or been  furnished  with an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such  contribution will not (i) cause any portion of any REMIC formed under
the  Series  Supplement  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  at any  time  that any
Certificates  are  outstanding or (ii) cause the Trust Fund to be subject to any
federal tax as a result of such  contribution  (including  the imposition of any
federal tax on "prohibited  transactions"  imposed under Section  860F(a) of the
Code).

Section 8.03.  Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Mortgage Loans.

        The recitals  contained herein and in the  Certificates  (other than the
execution of the  Certificates and relating to the acceptance and receipt of the
Mortgage  Loans) shall be taken as the  statements  of the Company or the Master
Servicer as the case may be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.  The  Trustee  makes  no  representations  as to  the  validity  or
sufficiency  of  this  Agreement  or  of  the  Certificates   (except  that  the
Certificates  shall be duly and  validly  executed  and  authenticated  by it as
Certificate  Registrar) or of any Mortgage Loan or related document,  or of MERS
or the MERS(R) System.  Except as otherwise  provided herein,  the Trustee shall
not be  accountable  for the use or  application  by the  Company  or the Master
Servicer of any of the Certificates or of the proceeds of such Certificates,  or
for the use or  application  of any  funds  paid to the  Company  or the  Master
Servicer in respect of the Mortgage  Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from the
Custodial  Account  or the  Certificate  Account  by the  Company  or the Master
Servicer.

Section 8.04.  Trustee May Own Certificates.

        The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee  of  Certificates  with the same  rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

Section 8.05.  Master Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees
                      and Expenses; Indemnification.

(a) The  Master  Servicer  covenants  and agrees to pay to the  Trustee  and any
co-trustee  from  time to time,  and the  Trustee  and any  co-trustee  shall be
entitled  to,  reasonable  compensation  (which  shall  not  be  limited  by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust)
for all services  rendered by each of them in the execution of the trusts hereby
created  and in the  exercise  and  performance  of any of the powers and duties
hereunder of the Trustee and any co-trustee, and the Master Servicer will pay or
reimburse  the  Trustee  and any  co-trustee  upon  request  for all  reasonable
expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  incurred  or made by the Trustee or any
co-trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including
the reasonable  compensation  and the expenses and  disbursements of its counsel
and of all persons not regularly in its employ, and the expenses incurred by the
Trustee or any  co-trustee in connection  with the  appointment  of an office or
agency  pursuant  to Section  8.12)  except any such  expense,  disbursement  or
advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith.

                                       90
<PAGE>

(b) The Master  Servicer  agrees to  indemnify  the Trustee for, and to hold the
Trustee  harmless  against,  any loss,  liability  or expense  incurred  without
negligence or willful  misconduct on the Trustee's  part,  arising out of, or in
connection with, the acceptance and administration of the Trust Fund,  including
the costs  and  expenses  (including  reasonable  legal  fees and  expenses)  of
defending   itself  against  any  claim  in  connection  with  the  exercise  or
performance  of any of its  powers  or  duties  under  this  Agreement  and  the
Custodial Agreement, provided that:

(i)     with respect to any such claim,  the Trustee shall have given the Master
        Servicer  written notice  thereof  promptly after the Trustee shall have
        actual knowledge thereof;

(ii)    while  maintaining  control  over its own  defense,  the  Trustee  shall
        cooperate and consult fully with the Master  Servicer in preparing  such
        defense; and

(iii)   notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  the Master
        Servicer  shall not be liable for settlement of any claim by the Trustee
        entered  into  without the prior  consent of the Master  Servicer  which
        consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

No termination of this Agreement  shall affect the  obligations  created by this
Section  8.05(b) of the Master  Servicer  to  indemnify  the  Trustee  under the
conditions and to the extent set forth herein.

        Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  indemnification  provided  by the
Master Servicer in this Section 8.05(b) shall not pertain to any loss, liability
or expense of the Trustee,  including the costs and expenses of defending itself
against any claim,  incurred in connection with any actions taken by the Trustee
at the  direction  of the  Certificateholders  pursuant  to the  terms  of  this
Agreement.

Section 8.06.  Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.
               ------------------------------------

        The Trustee  hereunder shall at all times be a corporation or a national
banking  association  having its principal office in a state and city acceptable
to the Company and organized and doing  business under the laws of such state or
the United States of America,  authorized under such laws to exercise  corporate
trust powers,  having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or  examination  by federal or state  authority.  If such
corporation or national banking  association  publishes  reports of condition at
least  annually,  pursuant  to  law  or to the  requirements  of  the  aforesaid
supervising  or examining  authority,  then for the purposes of this Section the
combined  capital  and  surplus  of such  corporation  shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so  published.  In case at any time the  Trustee  shall  cease to be eligible in
accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Section,  the  Trustee  shall  resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07.

Section 8.07.  Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.
               --------------------------------------

(a) The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged  from the trusts hereby
created by giving  written  notice  thereof to the Company.  Upon receiving such
notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by


                                       91
<PAGE>

written  instrument,  in  duplicate,  one  copy of  which  instrument  shall  be
delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee.  If no
successor  trustee shall have been so appointed  and have  accepted  appointment
within 30 days after the giving of such  notice of  resignation,  the  resigning
Trustee may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor trustee.

(b) If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions  of  Section  8.06 and shall  fail to resign  after  written  request
therefor by the Company, or if at any time the Trustee shall become incapable of
acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee
or of its property  shall be appointed,  or any public officer shall take charge
or  control of the  Trustee or of its  property  or affairs  for the  purpose of
rehabilitation,  conservation  or  liquidation,  then the Company may remove the
Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one
copy of which  instrument  shall be  delivered to the Trustee so removed and one
copy to the  successor  trustee.  In  addition,  in the event  that the  Company
determines  that  the  Trustee  has  failed  (i) to  distribute  or  cause to be
distributed  to the  Certificateholders  any amount  required to be  distributed
hereunder, if such amount is held by the Trustee or its Paying Agent (other than
the Master  Servicer  or the  Company)  for  distribution  or (ii) to  otherwise
observe or perform in any material  respect any of its covenants,  agreements or
obligations  hereunder,  and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period
of 5 days (in respect of clause (i) above) or 30 days (in respect of clause (ii)
above) after the date on which written  notice of such failure,  requiring  that
the same be remedied,  shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company, then
the Company  may remove the  Trustee and appoint a successor  trustee by written
instrument  delivered as provided in the preceding sentence.  In connection with
the appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to the preceding  sentence,  the
Company  shall,  on or  before  the date on which any such  appointment  becomes
effective,  obtain  from  each  Rating  Agency  written  confirmation  that  the
appointment  of any such  successor  trustee will not result in the reduction of
the  ratings  on any  class of the  Certificates  below  the  lesser of the then
current or original ratings on such Certificates.

(c) The Holders of  Certificates  entitled to at least 51% of the Voting  Rights
may at any time remove the  Trustee  and appoint a successor  trustee by written
instrument  or  instruments,  in  triplicate,  signed by such  Holders  or their
attorneys-in-fact  duly authorized,  one complete set of which instruments shall
be delivered to the Company,  one complete set to the Trustee so removed and one
complete set to the successor so appointed.

(d) Any  resignation  or removal of the Trustee and  appointment  of a successor
trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective
upon  acceptance of appointment by the successor  trustee as provided in Section
8.08.

Section 8.08.  Successor Trustee.
               -----------------

(a) Any successor  trustee  appointed as provided in Section 8.07 shall execute,
acknowledge  and  deliver  to the  Company  and to its  predecessor  trustee  an
instrument accepting such appointment  hereunder,  and thereupon the resignation
or removal of the predecessor  trustee shall become effective and such successor
trustee shall become effective and such successor  trustee,  without any further
act, deed or conveyance,  shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers,


                                       92
<PAGE>

duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder,  with the like effect as if
originally named as trustee herein. The predecessor trustee shall deliver to the
successor  trustee all Mortgage Files and related  documents and statements held
by it hereunder  (other than any Mortgage Files at the time held by a Custodian,
which  shall  become  the agent of any  successor  trustee  hereunder),  and the
Company,  the Master  Servicer and the  predecessor  trustee  shall  execute and
deliver such  instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required
for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor trustee all
such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

(b) No successor  trustee shall accept  appointment  as provided in this Section
unless at the time of such acceptance  such successor  trustee shall be eligible
under the provisions of Section 8.06.

(c) Upon  acceptance of appointment  by a successor  trustee as provided in this
Section,  the  Company  shall  mail  notice of the  succession  of such  trustee
hereunder  to all Holders of  Certificates  at their  addresses  as shown in the
Certificate  Register.  If the Company  fails to mail such notice within 10 days
after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee,  the successor trustee
shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.

Section 8.09.  Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.
               ----------------------------------

        Any corporation or national  banking  association into which the Trustee
may be  merged  or  converted  or  with  which  it may  be  consolidated  or any
corporation  or  national  banking   association   resulting  from  any  merger,
conversion  or  consolidation  to which  the  Trustee  shall be a party,  or any
corporation or national  banking  association  succeeding to the business of the
Trustee,  shall  be  the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,  provided  such
corporation  or  national  banking  association  shall  be  eligible  under  the
provisions of Section 8.06,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the  parties  hereto,  anything  herein to the
contrary  notwithstanding.  The Trustee  shall mail notice of any such merger or
consolidation  to the  Certificateholders  at  their  address  as  shown  in the
Certificate Register.

Section 8.10.  Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.
               ---------------------------------------------

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose of
meeting  any legal  requirements  of any  jurisdiction  in which any part of the
Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located,  the Master
Servicer and the Trustee  acting  jointly shall have the power and shall execute
and  deliver all  instruments  to appoint  one or more  Persons  approved by the
Trustee to act as  co-trustee  or  co-trustees,  jointly  with the  Trustee,  or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and
to vest in such Person or  Persons,  in such  capacity,  such title to the Trust
Fund, or any part thereof,  and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Master Servicer
and the Trustee may consider  necessary  or  desirable.  If the Master  Servicer
shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it
of a request so to do, or in case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.  No
co-trustee or separate trustee  hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06 hereunder and no notice to
Holders  of  Certificates  of  the  appointment  of  co-trustee(s)  or  separate
trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08 hereof.

(b) In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate  trustee pursuant
to this Section 8.10 all rights,  powers,  duties and  obligations  conferred or
imposed upon the Trustee  shall be  conferred  or imposed upon and  exercised or
performed by the  Trustee,  and such  separate  trustee or  co-trustee  jointly,
except  to the  extent  that  under  any law of any  jurisdiction  in which  any
particular act or acts are to be performed  (whether as Trustee  hereunder or as
successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified  to perform such act or acts,  in which event such  rights,  powers,
duties and obligations  (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any
portion  thereof in any such  jurisdiction)  shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed to
have  been  given to each of the then  separate  trustees  and  co-trustees,  as
effectively  as if  given  to each of  them.  Every  instrument  appointing  any
separate  trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee,  upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred,  shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately,
as may be provided  therein,  subject to all the  provisions of this  Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording  protection to, the Trustee.  Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.

(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the Trustee,
its agent or attorney-in-fact,  with full power and authority, to the extent not
prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on
its behalf and in its name.  If any separate  trustee or  co-trustee  shall die,
become  incapable  of  acting,  resign  or  be  removed,  all  of  its  estates,
properties,  rights,  remedies  and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee,  to the extent  permitted by law,  without the  appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

Section 8.11.  Appointment of Custodians.
               -------------------------

        The  Trustee  may,  with the  consent  of the  Master  Servicer  and the
Company,  appoint one or more  Custodians who are not Affiliates of the Company,
the Master Servicer or any Seller to hold all or a portion of the Mortgage Files
as agent for the Trustee,  by entering  into a Custodial  Agreement.  Subject to
Article  VIII,  the Trustee  agrees to comply  with the terms of each  Custodial
Agreement and to enforce the terms and provisions  thereof against the Custodian
for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each Custodian shall be a depository
institution  subject to supervision by federal or state authority,  shall have a
combined  capital and surplus of at least  $15,000,000 and shall be qualified to
do  business  in the  jurisdiction  in which it holds any  Mortgage  File.  Each
Custodial  Agreement  may be amended  only as  provided  in Section  11.01.  The
Trustee shall notify the  Certificateholders of the appointment of any Custodian
(other than the  Custodian  appointed as of the Closing  Date)  pursuant to this
Section 8.11.

Section 8.12.  Appointment of Office or Agency.
               -------------------------------

        The Trustee will maintain an office or agency in the City of New York at

                                       94

                                   ARTICLE IX


              TERMINATION OR OPTIONAL PURCHASE OF ALL CERTIFICATES

Section 9.01.  Optional  Purchase by the Master  Servicer  of All  Certificates;
     Termination  Upon  Purchase by the Master  Servicer or  Liquidation  of All
     Mortgage Loans


(a) Subject to Section 9.02, the respective  obligations and responsibilities of
the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee  created hereby in respect of
the  Certificates  (other than the  obligation  of the  Trustee to make  certain
payments  after  the  Final  Distribution  Date  to  Certificateholders  and the
obligation  of the Company to send  certain  notices as  hereinafter  set forth)
shall  terminate upon the last action required to be taken by the Trustee on the
Final Distribution Date pursuant to this Article IX following the earlier of:

(i)  the later of the final  payment or other  liquidation  (or any Advance with
     respect  thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan  remaining in the Trust Fund or
     the disposition of all property  acquired upon  foreclosure or deed in lieu
     of foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, or

(ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer of all Mortgage Loans and all property
     acquired in respect of any Mortgage  Loan  remaining in the Trust Fund at a
     price equal to 100% of the unpaid  principal  balance of each Mortgage Loan
     or, if less than such unpaid  principal  balance,  the fair market value of
     the related  underlying  property  of such  Mortgage  Loan with  respect to
     Mortgage  Loans as to which  title has been  acquired  if such fair  market
     value is less than such unpaid  principal  balance (net of any unreimbursed
     Advances  attributable  to principal) on the day of repurchase plus accrued
     interest thereon at the Net Mortgage Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate in
     the case of any Modified  Mortgage Loan) to, but not  including,  the first
     day of the month in which such repurchase  price is distributed,  provided,
     however,  that in no event shall the trust created hereby  continue  beyond
     the  expiration  of 21 years  from the  death of the last  survivor  of the
     descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy,  the late ambassador of the United States
     to the Court of St. James,  living on the date hereof and provided  further
     that the purchase price set forth above shall be increased as is necessary,
     as  determined by the Master  Servicer,  to avoid  disqualification  of any
     portion of any REMIC formed under the Series Supplement as a REMIC.

        The right of the Master Servicer to purchase all the assets of the Trust
Fund pursuant to clause (ii) above is conditioned upon the Pool Stated Principal
Balance  as  of  the  Final   Distribution  Date,  prior  to  giving  effect  to
distributions to be made on such Distribution  Date, being less than ten percent
of the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

        If such right is exercised by the Master  Servicer,  the Master Servicer
shall be deemed to have been reimbursed for the full amount of any  unreimbursed
Advances theretofore made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans. In addition,
the Master Servicer shall provide to the Trustee the  certification  required by
Section 3.15 and the Trustee and any Custodian shall, promptly following payment
of the  purchase  price,  release  to the Master  Servicer  the  Mortgage  Files
pertaining to the Mortgage Loans being purchased.

                                       96
<PAGE>

        In addition to the foregoing, on any Distribution Date on which the Pool
Stated Principal Balance,  prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on
such  Distribution  Date, is less than ten percent of the Cut-off Date Principal
Balance of the Mortgage Loans,  the Master Servicer shall have the right, at its
option, to purchase the Certificates in whole, but not in part, at a price equal
to the outstanding  Certificate  Principal Balance of such Certificates plus the
sum of Accrued  Certificate  Interest  thereon for the related  Interest Accrual
Period and any previously  unpaid Accrued  Certificate  Interest.  If the Master
Servicer  exercises  this right to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates,  the
Master  Servicer  will  promptly   terminate  the  respective   obligations  and
responsibilities  created hereby in respect of the Certificates pursuant to this
Article IX.

(b) The Master  Servicer  shall give the  Trustee  not less than 60 days'  prior
notice of the  Distribution  Date on which the Master Servicer  anticipates that
the final distribution will be made to  Certificateholders  (whether as a result
of the  exercise by the Master  Servicer of its right to purchase  the assets of
the Trust Fund or otherwise) or on which the Master  Servicer  anticipates  that
the  Certificates  will be purchased  (as a result of the exercise by the Master
Servicer to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates).  Notice of any termination
specifying the anticipated  Final  Distribution Date (which shall be a date that
would otherwise be a Distribution  Date) upon which the  Certificateholders  may
surrender their Certificates to the Trustee (if so required by the terms hereof)
for payment of the final distribution and cancellation or notice of any purchase
of the outstanding Certificates, specifying the Distribution Date upon which the
Holders may surrender their  Certificates  to the Trustee for payment,  shall be
given promptly by the Master Servicer (if it is exercising its right to purchase
the assets of the Trust Fund or to purchase the outstanding Certificates), or by
the Trustee (in any other case) by letter to the  Certificateholders  mailed not
earlier  than the 15th day and not  later  than the 25th day of the  month  next
preceding the month of such final distribution specifying:

(i)     the anticipated Final  Distribution Date upon which final payment of the
        Certificates is anticipated to be made upon  presentation  and surrender
        of  Certificates  at  the  office  or  agency  of  the  Trustee  therein
        designated where required  pursuant to this Agreement or, in the case of
        the purchase by the Master Servicer of the outstanding Certificates, the
        Distribution Date on which such purchase is to be made,

(ii)    the amount of any such final payment,  or in the case of the purchase of
        the  outstanding  Certificates,  the purchase  price, in either case, if
        known, and

(iii)   that the Record Date otherwise  applicable to such  Distribution Date is
        not applicable,  and in the case of the Senior  Certificates,  or in the
        case of all of the  Certificates  in connection with the exercise by the
        Master Servicer of its right to purchase the Certificates,  that payment
        will be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at
        the office or agency of the Trustee therein specified.

If the Master  Servicer is  obligated  to give notice to  Certificateholders  as
aforesaid,  it shall give such notice to the  Certificate  Registrar at the time
such  notice is given to  Certificateholders  and,  if the  Master  Servicer  is
exercising its rights to purchase the  outstanding  Certificates,  it shall give
such  notice  to each  Rating  Agency  at the  time  such  notice  is  given  to


                                       97
<PAGE>

Certificateholders.  As a result of the  exercise by the Master  Servicer of its
right to  purchase  the  assets of the Trust  Fund,  the Master  Servicer  shall
deposit  in the  Certificate  Account,  before  the Final  Distribution  Date in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the purchase price for the assets
of the Trust Fund,  computed as provided  above.  As a result of the exercise by
the Master Servicer of its right to purchase the outstanding  Certificates,  the
Master Servicer shall deposit in an Eligible Account,  established by the Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trustee and separate from the  Certificate  Account in
the name of the Trustee in trust for the registered holders of the Certificates,
before the  Distribution  Date on which such purchase is to occur in immediately
available  funds an amount  equal to the  purchase  price for the  Certificates,
computed as above  provided,  and provide notice of such deposit to the Trustee.
The Trustee will withdraw  from such account the amount  specified in subsection
(c) below.

(c) In the case of the Senior  Certificates,  upon presentation and surrender of
the Certificates by the Certificateholders thereof, and in the case of the Class
M and Class B Certificates,  upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates
by the Certificateholders  thereof in connection with the exercise by the Master
Servicer of its right to purchase the Certificates,  and otherwise in accordance
with Section 4.01(a), the Trustee shall distribute to the Certificateholders (i)
the  amount  otherwise  distributable  on  such  Distribution  Date,  if  not in
connection with the Master  Servicer's  election to repurchase the assets of the
Trust  Fund or the  outstanding  Certificates,  or (ii) if the  Master  Servicer
elected  to so  repurchase  the  assets  of the  Trust  Fund or the  outstanding
Certificates,  an  amount  determined  as  follows:  (A)  with  respect  to each
Certificate the outstanding  Certificate Principal Balance thereof, plus Accrued
Certificate  Interest for the related  Interest  Accrual  Period thereon and any
previously  unpaid  Accrued  Certificate  Interest,  subject to the priority set
forth in Section 4.02(a), and (B) with respect to the Class R Certificates,  any
excess of the amounts available for distribution (including the repurchase price
specified  in clause  (ii) of  subsection  (a) of this  Section)  over the total
amount distributed under the immediately  preceding clause (A).  Notwithstanding
the reduction of the Certificate  Principal  Balance of any Class of Subordinate
Certificates  to zero,  such  Class  will be  outstanding  hereunder  until  the
termination of the respective  obligations and  responsibilities of the Company,
the Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder in accordance with Article IX.

(d) If any  Certificateholders  shall not surrender their Certificates for final
payment  and  cancellation  on or  before  the  Final  Distribution  Date (if so
required by the terms hereof), the Trustee shall on such date cause all funds in
the   Certificate   Account   not   distributed   in   final   distribution   to
Certificateholders  to be  withdrawn  therefrom  and  credited to the  remaining
Certificateholders by depositing such funds in a separate escrow account for the
benefit of such Certificateholders, and the Master Servicer (if it exercised its
right to purchase  the assets of the Trust  Fund),  or the Trustee (in any other
case) shall give a second written notice to the remaining  Certificateholders to
surrender their Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution
with  respect  thereto.  If within  six  months  after  the  second  notice  any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered for cancellation,  the Trustee shall
take  appropriate  steps as  directed  by the Master  Servicer  to  contact  the
remaining  Certificateholders  concerning  surrender of their Certificates.  The
costs  and  expenses  of  maintaining  the  escrow  account  and  of  contacting
Certificateholders  shall be paid out of the assets  which  remain in the escrow
account.  If within nine months after the second notice any  Certificates  shall


                                       98
<PAGE>

not have been surrendered for cancellation,  the Trustee shall pay to the Master
Servicer  all  amounts  distributable  to the  holders  thereof  and the  Master
Servicer shall  thereafter hold such amounts until  distributed to such Holders.
No interest  shall accrue or be payable to any  Certificateholder  on any amount
held in the  escrow  account  or by the  Master  Servicer  as a  result  of such
Certificateholder's  failure to surrender its  Certificate(s)  for final payment
thereof in accordance with this Section 9.01.

(e) If any  Certificateholders  do not surrender their Certificates on or before
the Distribution Date on which a purchase of the outstanding  Certificates is to
be made,  the  Trustee  shall on such date  cause  all funds in the  Certificate
Account  deposited therein by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 9.01(b) to
be  withdrawn  therefrom  and  deposited  in a separate  escrow  account for the
benefit of such Certificateholders,  and the Master Servicer shall give a second
written notice to such  Certificateholders  to surrender their  Certificates for
payment of the purchase  price  therefor.  If within six months after the second
notice any Certificate  shall not have been  surrendered for  cancellation,  the
Trustee  shall take  appropriate  steps as  directed  by the Master  Servicer to
contact  the  Holders  of  such  Certificates   concerning  surrender  of  their
Certificates.  The costs and expenses of  maintaining  the escrow account and of
contacting  Certificateholders  shall be paid out of the assets  which remain in
the  escrow  account.  If  within  nine  months  after  the  second  notice  any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation in accordance with
this  Section  9.01,  the Trustee  shall pay to the Master  Servicer all amounts
distributable  to the Holders thereof and the Master  Servicer shall  thereafter
hold such amounts until distributed to such Holders. No interest shall accrue or
be payable to any  Certificateholder on any amount held in the escrow account or
by the  Master  Servicer  as a result  of such  Certificateholder's  failure  to
surrender its  Certificate(s)  for payment in accordance with this Section 9.01.
Any  Certificate  that is not  surrendered on the  Distribution  Date on which a
purchase  pursuant to this Section 9.01 occurs as provided  above will be deemed
to have been  purchased  and the Holder as of such date will have no rights with
respect  thereto  except to receive the purchase  price therefor minus any costs
and expenses  associated with such escrow account and notices allocated thereto.
Any  Certificates  so  purchased  or  deemed  to  have  been  purchased  on such
Distribution Date shall remain  outstanding  hereunder until the Master Servicer
has terminated the respective obligations and responsibilities created hereby in
respect of the  Certificates  pursuant to this  Article IX. The Master  Servicer
shall be for all purposes the Holder thereof as of such date.

Section 9.02.  Additional Termination Requirements.
               -----------------------------------

(a) Each REMIC that  comprises  the Trust Fund shall be terminated in accordance
with the following additional requirements, unless (subject to Section 10.01(f))
the Trustee and the Master  Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel  (which
Opinion of Counsel  shall not be an expense of the  Trustee)  to the effect that
the failure of each such REMIC to comply with the  requirements  of this Section
9.02 will not (i) result in the  imposition on the Trust of taxes on "prohibited
transactions,"  as described in Section 860F of the Code, or (ii) cause any such
REMIC  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  at any  time  that  any  Certificate  is
outstanding:

(i)     The Master Servicer shall establish a 90-day liquidation period for each
        such  REMIC and  specify  the first  day of such  period in a  statement
        attached  to the Trust  Fund's  final Tax Return  pursuant  to  Treasury
        regulations Section 1.860F-1. The Master Servicer also shall satisfy all
        of the requirements of a qualified liquidation for a REMIC under Section
        860F of the Code and regulations thereunder;

                                       99
<PAGE>

(ii)    The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee at the commencement of such
        90-day  liquidation period and, at or prior to the time of making of the
        final payment on the  Certificates,  the Trustee shall sell or otherwise
        dispose of all of the  remaining  assets of the Trust Fund in accordance
        with the terms hereof; and

(iii)   If the  Master  Servicer  or the  Company  is  exercising  its  right to
        purchase the assets of the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer shall, during
        the 90-day  liquidation period and at or prior to the Final Distribution
        Date, purchase all of the assets of the Trust Fund for cash.

(b) Each Holder of a Certificate and the Trustee hereby irrevocably approves and
appoints the Master Servicer as its attorney-in-fact to adopt a plan of complete
liquidation  for each REMIC at the expense of the Trust Fund in accordance  with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 9.03.  Termination of Multiple REMICs.
               -------------------------------

        If the REMIC  Administrator  makes two or more separate REMIC elections,
the  applicable   REMIC  shall  be  terminated  on  the  earlier  of  the  Final
Distribution  Date and the date on which it is deemed to receive the last deemed
distributions on the related Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests and the last
distribution due on the Certificates is made.

                                REMIC PROVISIONS

Section 10.01. REMIC Administration.

(a) The REMIC  Administrator  shall make an  election to treat the Trust Fund as
one or more REMICs under the Code and, if necessary, under applicable state law.
The assets of each such REMIC will be set forth in the Series  Supplement.  Such
election  will be  made  on  Form  1066  or  other  appropriate  federal  tax or
information return (including Form 8811) or any appropriate state return for the
taxable  year  ending  on the  last  day of  the  calendar  year  in  which  the
Certificates  are issued.  For the purposes of each REMIC election in respect of
the Trust Fund,  Certificates  and  interests to be  designated  as the "regular
interests"  and the sole class of "residual  interests" in the REMIC will be set
forth in Section 10.03 of the Series Supplement. The REMIC Administrator and the
Trustee shall not permit the creation of any "interests"  (within the meaning of
Section  860G of the Code) in any REMIC  elected  in  respect  of the Trust Fund
other than the "regular interests" and "residual interests" so designated.

(b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "startup day" of the Trust Fund
within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

(c) The REMIC  Administrator  shall hold a Class R  Certificate  representing  a
0.01%  Percentage  Interest each Class of the Class R Certificates  and shall be
designated as "the tax matters  person" with respect to each REMIC in the manner
provided under Treasury regulations section 1.860F-4(d) and Treasury regulations
section 301.6231(a)(7)-1.  The REMIC Administrator, as tax matters person, shall
(i) act on behalf of each REMIC in  relation  to any tax  matter or  controversy
involving the Trust Fund and (ii) represent the Trust Fund in any administrative
or judicial  proceeding  relating to an examination or audit by any governmental
taxing authority with respect  thereto.  The legal expenses,  including  without
limitation attorneys' or accountants' fees, and costs of any such proceeding and
any liability  resulting  therefrom  shall be expenses of the Trust Fund and the
REMIC Administrator  shall be entitled to reimbursement  therefor out of amounts
attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans on  deposit  in the  Custodial  Account as
provided by Section  3.10 unless such legal  expenses  and costs are incurred by
reason  of the REMIC  Administrator's  willful  misfeasance,  bad faith or gross
negligence.  If  the  REMIC  Administrator  is no  longer  the  Master  Servicer
hereunder,  at its option the REMIC  Administrator  may  continue  its duties as
REMIC  Administrator  and shall be paid  reasonable  compensation  not to exceed
$3,000 per year by any successor Master Servicer  hereunder for so acting as the
REMIC Administrator.

(d) The REMIC Administrator shall prepare or cause to be prepared all of the Tax
Returns  that it  determines  are required  with  respect to each REMIC  created
hereunder and deliver such Tax Returns in a timely manner to the Trustee and the
Trustee shall sign and file such Tax Returns in a timely manner. The expenses of
preparing  such returns  shall be borne by the REMIC  Administrator  without any
right of reimbursement therefor. The REMIC Administrator agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Trustee with respect to any tax or liability  arising from the
Trustee's  signing of Tax Returns that contain errors or omissions.  The Trustee
and Master  Servicer shall promptly  provide the REMIC  Administrator  with such
information  as the REMIC  Administrator  may from time to time  request for the
purpose of enabling the REMIC Administrator to prepare Tax Returns.

                                      101
<PAGE>

(e) The REMIC  Administrator  shall  provide (i) to any  Transferor of a Class R
Certificate  such  information  as is necessary for the  application  of any tax
relating  to the  transfer of a Class R  Certificate  to any Person who is not a
Permitted Transferee,  (ii) to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall forward to the
Certificateholders,  such  information or reports as are required by the Code or
the REMIC  Provisions  including  reports  relating to interest,  original issue
discount and market  discount or premium (using the Prepayment  Assumption)  and
(iii) to the Internal  Revenue  Service the name,  title,  address and telephone
number of the person who will serve as the representative of each REMIC.

(f) The Master Servicer and the REMIC  Administrator shall take such actions and
shall cause each REMIC created  hereunder to take such actions as are reasonably
within the Master Servicer's or the REMIC Administrator's  control and the scope
of its  duties  more  specifically  set forth  herein as shall be  necessary  or
desirable  to  maintain  the  status  of each  REMIC as a REMIC  under the REMIC
Provisions  (and the  Trustee  shall  assist the Master  Servicer  and the REMIC
Administrator, to the extent reasonably requested by the Master Servicer and the
REMIC  Administrator to do so). The Master Servicer and the REMIC  Administrator
shall not knowingly or  intentionally  take any action,  cause the Trust Fund to
take any  action  or fail to take (or fail to  cause  to be  taken)  any  action
reasonably within their respective control that, under the REMIC Provisions,  if
taken or not taken,  as the case may be,  could (i)  endanger  the status of any
portion  of any REMIC  formed  under the  Series  Supplement  as a REMIC or (ii)
result in the imposition of a tax upon any such REMIC (including but not limited
to the tax on prohibited  transactions  as defined in Section  860F(a)(2) of the
Code and the tax on contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the
Code)  (either  such  event,  in the  absence  of an  Opinion  of Counsel or the
indemnification  referred to in this sentence,  an "Adverse REMIC Event") unless
the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator,  as applicable,  has received an
Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party  seeking to take such action or,
if such party fails to pay such  expense,  and the Master  Servicer or the REMIC
Administrator, as applicable,  determines that taking such action is in the best
interest  of the Trust Fund and the  Certificateholders,  at the  expense of the
Trust  Fund,  but in no event at the expense of the Master  Servicer,  the REMIC
Administrator  or the Trustee) to the effect that the  contemplated  action will
not,  with respect to each REMIC  created  hereunder,  endanger  such status or,
unless the Master  Servicer,  the REMIC  Administrator  or both, as  applicable,
determine in its or their sole  discretion  to indemnify  the Trust Fund against
the imposition of such a tax,  result in the imposition of such a tax.  Wherever
in this Agreement a  contemplated  action may not be taken because the timing of
such action might result in the  imposition  of a tax on the Trust Fund,  or may
only be taken  pursuant  to an  Opinion of Counsel  that such  action  would not
impose a tax on the Trust Fund,  such action may  nonetheless  be taken provided
that the  indemnity  given in the  preceding  sentence with respect to any taxes
that  might be  imposed  on the  Trust  Fund has been  given  and that all other
preconditions  to the taking of such  action  have been  satisfied.  The Trustee
shall not take or fail to take any action (whether or not authorized  hereunder)
as to which the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator,  as applicable,  has
advised it in writing  that it has  received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that an Adverse  REMIC  Event  could  occur  with  respect  to such  action.  In
addition, prior to taking any action with respect to any REMIC created hereunder
or any  related  assets  thereof,  or causing any such REMIC to take any action,
which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement,  the Trustee


                                      102
<PAGE>

will consult with the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as applicable,
or its designee,  in writing, with respect to whether such action could cause an
Adverse  REMIC Event to occur with  respect to any such  REMIC,  and the Trustee
shall not take any such  action or cause any such REMIC to take any such  action
as to which the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator,  as applicable,  has
advised it in writing  that an  Adverse  REMIC  Event  could  occur.  The Master
Servicer or the REMIC Administrator,  as applicable, may consult with counsel to
make  such  written  advice,  and the cost of same  shall be borne by the  party
seeking to take the action not expressly permitted by this Agreement,  but in no
event at the expense of the Master Servicer or the REMIC  Administrator.  At all
times as may be required  by the Code,  the Master  Servicer  will to the extent
within its  control  and the scope of its  duties  more  specifically  set forth
herein, maintain substantially all of the assets of each REMIC created hereunder
as  "qualified  mortgages"  as  defined in  Section  860G(a)(3)  of the Code and
"permitted investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.

(g) In the event  that any tax is imposed on  "prohibited  transactions"  of any
REMIC  created  hereunder as defined in Section  860F(a)(2) of the Code, on "net
income  from  foreclosure  property"  of any such  REMIC as  defined  in Section
860G(c) of the Code,  on any  contributions  to any such REMIC after the Startup
Day  therefor  pursuant  to  Section  860G(d)  of the Code,  or any other tax is
imposed  by the Code or any  applicable  provisions  of state or local tax laws,
such tax shall be charged (i) to the Master Servicer,  if such tax arises out of
or results from a breach by the Master Servicer of any of its obligations  under
this Agreement or the Master Servicer has in its sole  discretion  determined to
indemnify  the Trust Fund  against such tax,  (ii) to the  Trustee,  if such tax
arises out of or results from a breach by the Trustee of any of its  obligations
under  this  Article  X, or (iii)  otherwise  against  amounts on deposit in the
Custodial  Account as provided by Section 3.10 and on the  Distribution  Date(s)
following such  reimbursement  the aggregate of such taxes shall be allocated in
reduction of the Accrued Certificate  Interest on each Class entitled thereto in
the same manner as if such taxes constituted a Prepayment Interest Shortfall.

(h) The Trustee and the Master Servicer shall,  for federal income tax purposes,
maintain  books and records  with respect to each REMIC  created  hereunder on a
calendar  year and on an accrual  basis or as  otherwise  may be required by the
REMIC Provisions.

(i) Following the Startup Day, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall
accept  any  contributions  of  assets  to any REMIC  created  hereunder  unless
(subject to Section  10.01(f))  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee  shall have
received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to make such
contribution) to the effect that the inclusion of such assets in such REMIC will
not  cause  the  REMIC  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  at any  time  that  any
Certificates  are  outstanding  or subject  the REMIC to any tax under the REMIC
Provisions or other  applicable  provisions  of federal,  state and local law or
ordinances.

(j)  Neither  the Master  Servicer  nor the  Trustee  shall  (subject to Section
10.01(f)) enter into any  arrangement by which any REMIC created  hereunder will
receive a fee or other  compensation  for  services nor permit any such REMIC to
receive any income from assets other than  "qualified  mortgages"  as defined in
Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code or "permitted  investments" as defined in Section
860G(a)(5) of the Code.

(k)  Solely for the  purposes  of Section  1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii)  of the  Treasury
Regulations,  the  "latest  possible  maturity  date" by which  the  Certificate
Principal  Balance of each Class of  Certificates  (other than the Interest Only
Certificates)  representing a regular  interest in the applicable  REMIC and the
Uncertificated  Principal Balance of each Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interest
(other than each  Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interest  represented by a Class
A-V  Certificate,  if any) and the rights to the Interest Only  Certificates and
Uncertificated  REMIC Regular  Interest  represented by a Class A-V  Certificate
would be  reduced to zero is the  Maturity  Date for each such  Certificate  and
Interest.

(l) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the REMIC Administrator shall prepare
and file with the Internal  Revenue Service Form 8811,  "Information  Return for
Real Estate Mortgage  Investment  Conduits (REMIC) and Issuers of Collateralized
Debt Obligations" for each REMIC created hereunder.

(m)  Neither  the Trustee  nor the Master  Servicer  shall  sell,  dispose of or
substitute  for any of the Mortgage  Loans  (except in  connection  with (i) the
default,  imminent default or foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan,  including but not
limited to, the acquisition or sale of a Mortgaged  Property acquired by deed in
lieu of foreclosure,  (ii) the bankruptcy of any REMIC created hereunder,  (iii)
the  termination  of any such REMIC  pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement or
(iv) a  purchase  of  Mortgage  Loans  pursuant  to  Article  II or III of  this
Agreement) nor acquire any assets for any such REMIC, nor sell or dispose of any
investments  in the Custodial  Account or the  Certificate  Account for gain nor
accept any  contributions to any such REMIC after the Closing Date unless it has
received  an Opinion of Counsel  that such sale,  disposition,  substitution  or
acquisition will not (a) affect adversely the status of such REMIC as a REMIC or
(b)  unless  the  Master  Servicer  has  determined  in its sole  discretion  to
indemnify  the Trust Fund against such tax,  cause such REMIC to be subject to a
tax on  "prohibited  transactions"  or  "contributions"  pursuant  to the  REMIC
Provisions.

by the Company, the Master Servicer and the Trustee,  without the consent of any
of the Certificateholders:

        inconsistent  with any other provisions  herein or therein or to correct
        any error,

(iii)to modify,  eliminate  or add to any of its  provisions  to such  extent as
     shall be necessary or desirable to maintain the  qualification of the Trust
     Fund as a REMIC at all times  that any  Certificate  is  outstanding  or to
     avoid or minimize the risk of the  imposition  of any tax on the Trust Fund
     pursuant to the Code that would be a claim against the Trust Fund, provided
     that the Trustee has  received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A)
     such action is necessary or desirable to maintain such  qualification or to
     avoid or minimize the risk of the  imposition  of any such tax and (B) such
     action will not adversely  affect in any material  respect the interests of
     any Certificateholder,

(iv) to change the timing and/or  nature of deposits into the Custodial  Account
     or the  Certificate  Account or to change  the name in which the  Custodial
     Account is maintained,  provided that (A) the  Certificate  Account Deposit
     Date shall in no event be later than the  related  Distribution  Date,  (B)
     such change  shall not, as  evidenced  by an Opinion of Counsel,  adversely
     affect in any material respect the interests of any  Certificateholder  and
     (C) such change shall not result in a reduction  of the rating  assigned to
     any Class of Certificates below the lower of the then-current rating or the
     rating  assigned to such  Certificates as of the Closing Date, as evidenced
     by a letter from each Rating Agency to such effect,

(v)  to modify,  eliminate or add to the  provisions  of Section  5.02(f) or any
     other provision hereof restricting transfer of the Class R Certificates, by

     (A) such change shall not result in reduction of the rating assigned to any
     such Class of Certificates  below the lower of the  then-current  rating or
     the  rating  assigned  to such  Certificates  as of the  Closing  Date,  as
     evidenced by a letter from each Rating Agency to such effect,  and (B) such
     change shall not (subject to Section 10.01(f)),  as evidenced by an Opinion

     Certificateholders  (other than the  transferor) to be subject to a federal
     tax caused by a transfer to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee,

(vi) to make any other  provisions with respect to matters or questions  arising
     under  this  Agreement  or such  Custodial  Agreement  which  shall  not be
     materially  inconsistent  with the provisions of this  Agreement,  provided
     that such  action  shall  not,  as  evidenced  by an  Opinion  of  Counsel,
     adversely   affect  in  any   material   respect  the   interests   of  any
     Certificateholder or

                                      106
<PAGE>

(vii)to amend any  provision  herein or therein  that is not  material to any of
     the Certificateholders.

(b) This  Agreement or any Custodial  Agreement may also be amended from time to
time by the Company, the Master Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the
Holders of  Certificates  evidencing  in the  aggregate not less than 66% of the
Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates with a Certificate  Principal
Balance  greater  than zero  affected  thereby  for the  purpose  of adding  any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating  any of the provisions of
this  Agreement  or such  Custodial  Agreement or of modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of Certificates of such Class; provided,  however, that no
such amendment shall:

(i)  reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of,  payments which
     are required to be  distributed on any  Certificate  without the consent of
     the Holder of such Certificate,

(ii)    reduce the aforesaid percentage of Certificates of any Class the Holders
        of which are required to consent to any such amendment, in any such case
        without  the consent of the  Holders of all  Certificates  of such Class
        then outstanding.

(c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement,  the Trustee shall
not  consent  to any  amendment  to this  Agreement  unless it shall  have first
received an Opinion of Counsel  (subject to Section  10.01(f) and at the expense
of the party seeking such  amendment)  to the effect that such  amendment or the
exercise of any power granted to the Master Servicer, the Company or the Trustee
in accordance with such amendment will not result in the imposition of a federal
tax on the Trust Fund or cause any REMIC created under the Series  Supplement to
fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.

(d) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee shall furnish
written  notification  of the  substance of such  amendment to the Custodian and
each   Certificateholder.   It  shall  not  be  necessary  for  the  consent  of
Certificateholders  under this Section 11.01 to approve the  particular  form of
any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance  thereof.  The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing
the  authorization  of the  execution  thereof  by  Certificateholders  shall be
subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

(e) The Company  shall have the option,  in its sole  discretion,  to obtain and
deliver to the Trustee any corporate guaranty,  payment obligation,  irrevocable
letter of credit,  surety  bond,  insurance  policy or similar  instrument  or a
reserve fund, or any combination of the foregoing, for the purpose of protecting
the Holders of the Class B  Certificates  against any or all Realized  Losses or
other  shortfalls.  Any such instrument or fund shall be held by the Trustee for
the benefit of the Class B Certificateholders, but shall not be and shall not be
deemed to be under any  circumstances  included in the Trust Fund. To the extent
that any such  instrument or fund  constitutes a reserve fund for federal income
tax purposes,  (i) any reserve fund so established  shall be an outside  reserve
fund and not an asset of the Trust  Fund,  (ii) any such  reserve  fund shall be


                                      107
<PAGE>

owned by the Company,  and (iii)  amounts  transferred  by the Trust Fund to any
such reserve fund shall be treated as amounts  distributed  by the Trust Fund to
the Company or any  successor,  all within the  meaning of Treasury  Regulations
Section  1.860G-2(h) as it reads as of the Cut-off Date. In connection  with the
provision of any such  instrument  or fund,  this  Agreement  and any  provision
hereof may be modified,  added to,  deleted or  otherwise  amended in any manner
that is related or incidental to such instrument or fund or the establishment or
administration thereof, such amendment to be made by written instrument executed
or consented to by the Company but without the consent of any  Certificateholder
and  without the consent of the Master  Servicer or the Trustee  being  required
unless  any such  amendment  would  impose  any  additional  obligation  on,  or
otherwise adversely affect the interests of the Senior  Certificateholders,  the
Class M  Certificateholders,  the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable;
provided that the Company  obtains  (subject to Section  10.01(f)) an Opinion of
Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent counsel) to the effect that
any such amendment will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust
Fund,  including  without  limitation,  any federal  tax imposed on  "prohibited
transactions"  under Section  860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions  after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code and (b) any REMIC created
hereunder  to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC at any time that any  Certificate  is
outstanding.  In the event that the Company  elects to provide such  coverage in
the  form  of  a  limited  guaranty   provided  by  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation,  the  Company  may elect  that the text of such  amendment  to this
Agreement  shall be  substantially  in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (in
which case  Residential  Funding's  Subordinate  Certificate  Loss Obligation as
described in such exhibit shall be established by Residential  Funding's consent
to such  amendment) and that the limited  guaranty shall be executed in the form
attached  hereto as Exhibit L, with such changes as the Company shall deem to be
appropriate;  it being understood that the Trustee has reviewed and approved the
content of such forms and that the  Trustee's  consent  or  approval  to the use
thereof is not required.

               ---------------------------------------

(a) To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  this  Agreement is subject to
recordation in all appropriate  public offices for real property  records in all
the  counties  or other  comparable  jurisdictions  in  which  any or all of the
properties  subject to the Mortgages are situated,  and in any other appropriate
public  recording  office or elsewhere,  such  recordation to be effected by the
Master Servicer and at its expense on direction by the Trustee  (pursuant to the
request  of  Holders  of  Certificates  entitled  to at least 25% of the  Voting
Rights),  but only upon  direction  accompanied  by an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such recordation  materially and beneficially  affects the interests
of the Certificateholders.

(b) For the purpose of facilitating  the recordation of this Agreement as herein
provided and for other purposes,  this Agreement may be executed  simultaneously
in any number of counterparts,  each of which counterparts shall be deemed to be
an  original,  and  such  counterparts  shall  constitute  but one and the  same
instrument.

proceeding  in any court for a partition  or winding up of the Trust  Fund,  nor
otherwise  affect the rights,  obligations and liabilities of any of the parties
hereto.

third  person by reason of any action  taken by the  parties  to this  Agreement
pursuant to any provision hereof.

(c) No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any provision of this
Agreement to institute  any suit,  action or proceeding in equity or at law upon
or under or with respect to this Agreement,  unless such Holder previously shall
have given to the  Trustee a written  notice of default  and of the  continuance
thereof, as hereinbefore  provided,  and unless also the Holders of Certificates
of any  Class  evidencing  in the  aggregate  not less  than 25% of the  related
Percentage  Interests of such Class,  shall have made  written  request upon the
Trustee to institute such action,  suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee
hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable  indemnity as it
may require against the costs,  expenses and liabilities to be incurred  therein
or  thereby,  and the  Trustee,  for 60 days after its  receipt of such  notice,
request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any
such action,  suit or proceeding  it being  understood  and intended,  and being
expressly    covenanted   by   each    Certificateholder    with   every   other
Certificateholder  and the Trustee,  that no one or more Holders of Certificates
of any  Class  shall  have any  right in any  manner  whatever  by virtue of any

herein provided and for the common benefit of  Certificateholders  of such Class
or all Classes,  as the case may be. For the protection  and  enforcement of the
provisions  of this  Section  11.03,  each and every  Certificateholder  and the
Trustee  shall be entitled  to such  relief as can be given  either at law or in
equity.

Section 11.04. Governing Law.

        This agreement and the  Certificates  shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the obligations, rights

Section 11.08. Supplemental Provisions for Resecuritization.
               ---------------------------------------------

        This  Agreement  may be  supplemented  by  means  of the  addition  of a
separate  Article  hereto  (a   "Supplemental   Article")  for  the  purpose  of
resecuritizing  any of the Certificates  issued  hereunder,  under the following
circumstances.  With  respect  to any Class or Classes  of  Certificates  issued
hereunder,  or any portion of any such Class,  as to which the Company or any of
its  Affiliates  (or  any  designee  thereof)  is  the  registered  Holder  (the
"Resecuritized  Certificates"),  the  Company  may  deposit  such  Resecuritized
Certificates into a new REMIC, grantor trust, FASIT or custodial  arrangement (a
"Restructuring  Vehicle") to be held by the Trustee  pursuant to a  Supplemental
Article.  The instrument adopting such Supplemental Article shall be executed by
the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee;  provided,  that neither the
Master  Servicer nor the Trustee shall withhold  their consent  thereto if their
respective  interests would not be materially adversely affected thereby. To the
extent that the terms of the  Supplemental  Article do not in any way affect any
provisions  of this  Agreement as to any of the  Certificates  initially  issued
hereunder,  the adoption of the  Supplemental  Article  shall not  constitute an
"amendment" of this Agreement.

        Each  Supplemental  Article  shall set forth  all  necessary  provisions
relating to the holding of the  Resecuritized  Certificates by the Trustee,  the
establishment of the  Restructuring  Vehicle,  the issuing of various classes of
new certificates by the  Restructuring  Vehicle and the distributions to be made
thereon,  and any  other  provisions  necessary  for the  purposes  thereof.  In
connection  with each  Supplemental  Article,  the Company  shall deliver to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (i) the  Restructuring  Vehicle
will  qualify as a REMIC,  grantor  trust,  FASIT or other entity not subject to
taxation  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  and  (ii)  the  adoption  of  the
Supplemental  Article  will not endanger the status of the Trust Fund as a REMIC
or  (subject to Section  10.01(f))  result in the  imposition  of a tax upon the
Trust Fund  (including but not limited to the tax on prohibited  transactions as
defined  in Section  860F(a)(2)  of the Code and the tax on  contributions  to a
REMIC as set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code).

               four-family  fixed  interest rate first mortgage loans formed and
               sold by RESIDENTIAL ACCREDIT LOANS, INC.

     This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust Fund, and
does not represent an obligation of or interest in Residential  Accredit  Loans,
Inc., the Master Servicer, the Trustee referred to below or GMAC Mortgage Group,
Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this  Certificate  nor the underlying
Mortgage  Loans  are  guaranteed  or  insured  by  any  governmental  agency  or

Trustee or GMAC Mortgage  Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  None of the
Company,  the  Master  Servicer,  GMAC  Mortgage  Group,  Inc.  or any of  their

     This  certifies  that____________________  is the  registered  owner of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  [(obtained by dividing the
[Initial  Certificate  Principal  Balance]  [Initial  [Interest  Only/Class A-V]

Principal Balance of all Class A- Certificates]  [Initial  [Interest  Only/Class

specified  above)]  in  certain  distributions  with  respect  to the Trust Fund
consisting  primarily  of  an  interest  in  a  pool  of  conventional  one-  to

<PAGE>

formed and sold by Residential  Accredit  Loans,  Inc.  (hereinafter  called the
"Company," which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement referred
to below).  The Trust  Fund was  created  pursuant  to a Pooling  and  Servicing
Agreement  dated as specified  above (the  "Agreement")  among the Company,  the
Master Servicer and __________________, as trustee (the "Trustee"), a summary of
certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the
extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings
assigned in the  Agreement.  This  Certificate is issued under and is subject to
the terms,  provisions and conditions of the Agreement,  to which  Agreement the
Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by
which such Holder is bound.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this Certificate and the amount [(of interest
and  principal,  if any)]  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders of Class A-
Certificates on such Distribution Date. [The [Interest  Only/Class A-V] Notional
Amount  of  the  [Interest  Only/Class  A-V]  Certificates  as of  any  date  of
determination is equal to the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loans corresponding to the Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests represented by
such [Interest  Only/Class A-V]  Certificates.] [The Subclass Notional Amount of
the [Interest  Only/Class A-V]-  Certificates as of any date of determination is
equal  to  the  aggregate  Stated  Principal   Balance  of  the  Mortgage  Loans
corresponding to the Uncertificated REMIC Regular Interests  represented by such
[Interest  Only/Class A-V]-  Certificates  immediately prior to such date.] [The
[Interest  Only/Class  A-V][-  ]  Certificates  have  no  Certificate  Principal
Balance.]

               Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either  by the
Master  Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent appointed
by the Trustee in  immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise)
for the  account of the Person  entitled  thereto if such  Person  shall have so
notified  the Master  Servicer or such Paying  Agent,  or by check mailed to the
address of the Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on
the Certificate Register.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or
agency  appointed  by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New
York. The [Initial Certificate  Principal Balance] [Initial [Interest Only/Class
A-V] Notional Amount] [initial  Subclass Notional Amount] of this Certificate is
set forth above.] [The Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof will be reduced to
the extent of  distributions  allocable  to principal  and any  Realized  Losses
allocable hereto.]

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates  issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed
Pass-Through  Certificates of the Series specified  hereon (herein  collectively
called the "Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. In the event Master Servicer
funds  are  advanced  with  respect  to  any  Mortgage  Loan,  such  advance  is
reimbursable  to the Master  Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,
from related recoveries on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have
been distributable to Certificateholders.
<PAGE>

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account   and/or  the   Certificate   Account   created   for  the   benefit  of
Certificateholders  may be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time for
purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders, such purposes including
without  limitation  reimbursement  to the  Company  and the Master  Servicer of
advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations of the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee and the rights
of the  Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City and
State of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The Company, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.
<PAGE>

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

               Reference  is  hereby  made  to the  further  provisions  of this
Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof,  which further provisions shall for
all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

               Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be

the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount (of interest
and  principal,  if any)  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of Class M-
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

               Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either  by the
Master  Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent appointed
by the Trustee in  immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise)

notified  the Master  Servicer or such Paying  Agent,  or by check mailed to the
address of the Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on
the Certificate Register.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or

               As described  above, no transfer of this Class M Certificate will

representation  letter,  each as  described  in the  Agreement,  relating to the
permissibility  of such  transfer  under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,  or

be deemed to have made  representations  relating to the  permissibility of such
transfer  under  ERISA and Section  4975 of the Code,  as  described  in Section

acquisition or holding of this  Certificate (or interest herein) was effected in
violation  of  the  restrictions  in  Section  5.02(e)  of the  Agreement  shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trustee,  the Master Servicer,  any
Subservicer,  and the  Trust  Fund  from and  against  any and all  liabilities,
claims,  costs  or  expenses  incurred  by  such  parties  as a  result  of such
acquisition or holding.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates  issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed
Pass-Through  Certificates of the Series specified  hereon (herein  collectively
called the "Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. In the event Master Servicer
funds  are  advanced  with  respect  to  any  Mortgage  Loan,  such  advance  is
reimbursable  to the Master  Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,
from related recoveries on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have
been distributable to Certificateholders.
<PAGE>

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account   and/or  the   Certificate   Account   created   for  the   benefit  of
Certificateholders  may be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time for
purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders, such purposes including
without  limitation  reimbursement  to the  Company  and the Master  Servicer of
advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations of the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee and the rights
of the  Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City and
State of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The Company, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.
<PAGE>

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

               Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

the first  Distribution  Date specified  above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate  is  registered at the close of business on the last day (or if such

day) of the month next  preceding  the month of such  distribution  (the "Record
Date"), from the Available Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product
of the  Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  and the amount (of

notified  the Master  Servicer or such Paying  Agent,  or by check mailed to the

transfer is exempt from the  registration  requirements of the Securities Act of
1933,  as  amended,  and  any  applicable  state  securities  laws or is made in
accordance  with said Act and laws.  In the event that such a transfer  is to be
made,  (i) the  Trustee  or the  Company  may  require  an  opinion  of  counsel
acceptable  to and in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the  Trustee and the
Company that such transfer is exempt  (describing  the applicable  exemption and
the  basis  therefor)  from  or is  being  made  pursuant  to  the  registration
requirements  of the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended,  and of any applicable
statute of any state and (ii) the transferee shall execute an investment  letter
in the form  described by the  Agreement.  The Holder hereof  desiring to effect
such  transfer  shall,  and does hereby agree to,  indemnify  the  Trustee,  the
Company,  the Master Servicer and the Certificate  Registrar acting on behalf of
the Trustee  against  any  liability  that may result if the  transfer is not so
exempt  or is not made in  accordance  with such  Federal  and  state  laws.  In
connection  with any such transfer,  the Trustee will also require either (i) an
opinion of counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer with respect to the permissibility
of such transfer under the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended  ("ERISA"),  and Section 4975 of the Internal  Revenue Code (the "Code")
and stating, among other things, that the transferee's  acquisition of a Class B
Certificate will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) a  representation
letter,  in the form as described by Section  5.02(e) of the  Agreement,  either

or a trustee  of any  Plan)  acting,  directly  or  indirectly,  on behalf of or
purchasing any  Certificate  with "plan assets" of any Plan, or stating that the
transferee  is an  insurance  company,  the  source of funds to be used by it to
purchase the Certificate is an "insurance  company general  account" (within the
meaning of Department of Labor Prohibited  Transaction Class Exemption  ("PTCE")
95-60),  and the purchase is being made in reliance upon the availability of the
exemptive relief afforded under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60.

collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. In the event Master Servicer
funds  are  advanced  with  respect  to  any  Mortgage  Loan,  such  advance  is
reimbursable  to the Master  Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,
from related recoveries on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have
been distributable to Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account   and/or  the   Certificate   Account   created   for  the   benefit  of
Certificateholders  may be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time for
purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders, such purposes including
without  limitation  reimbursement  to the  Company  and the Master  Servicer of
advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations of the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee and the rights
of the  Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of

Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

                                 SERIES ____-___

        evidencing a percentage  interest in any distributions  allocable to the
        Class R Certificates with respect to the Trust Fund consisting primarily
        of a pool of conventional  one- to four-family fixed interest rate first
        mortgage loans formed and sold by RESIDENTIAL ACCREDIT LOANS, INC.

     This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust Fund, and
does not represent an obligation of or interest in Residential  Accredit  Loans,
Inc., the Master Servicer, the Trustee referred to below or GMAC Mortgage Group,
Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this  Certificate  nor the underlying
Mortgage  Loans  are  guaranteed  or  insured  by  any  governmental  agency  or
instrumentality or by Residential Accredit Loans, Inc., the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or GMAC Mortgage  Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  None of the
Company,  the  Master  Servicer,  GMAC  Mortgage  Group,  Inc.  or any of  their
affiliates  will have any  obligation  with respect to any  certificate or other
obligation secured by or payable from payments on the Certificates.

               This  certifies  that is the  registered  owner of the Percentage
Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained  by  dividing  the  Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance of this  Certificate  by the  aggregate  Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance of all Class R  Certificates,  both as specified
above) in  certain  distributions  with  respect  to the Trust  Fund  consisting
primarily of a pool of  conventional  one- to  four-family  fixed  interest rate
first  mortgage  loans (the  "Mortgage  Loans"),  formed and sold by Residential
Accredit Loans, Inc.  (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any
successor  entity  under the  Agreement  referred to below).  The Trust Fund was
created  pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing  Agreement dated as specified above
(the "Agreement") among the Company, the Master Servicer and __________________,
as trustee (the "Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of
which is set forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined herein, the capitalized
terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.  This Certificate
is issued under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and  conditions of the
Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount (of interest
and  principal,  if any)  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of  Class R
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

               Each Holder of this  Certificate will be deemed to have agreed to
be bound by the  restrictions  set forth in the Agreement to the effect that (i)
each person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate must
be a United States Person and a Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) the transfer of any
Ownership  Interest in this Certificate will be conditioned upon the delivery to
the Trustee of,  among other  things,  an  affidavit  to the effect that it is a
United States Person and Permitted Transferee,  (iii) any attempted or purported
transfer of any  Ownership  Interest in this  Certificate  in  violation of such
restrictions  will be  absolutely  null and void and will  vest no rights in the
purported  transferee,  and (iv) if any person other than a United States Person
and a Permitted  Transferee  acquires any Ownership Interest in this Certificate
in violation of such restrictions,  then the Company will have the right, in its
sole  discretion and without notice to the Holder of this  Certificate,  to sell
this Certificate to a purchaser selected by the Company,  which purchaser may be
the Company,  or any affiliate of the Company,  on such terms and  conditions as
the Company may choose.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or
agency  appointed  by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New
York. The Initial Certificate Principal Balance of this Certificate is set forth
above. The Certificate Principal Balance hereof will be reduced to the extent of
distributions  allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable  hereto.
Notwithstanding  the reduction of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof to
zero,  this  Certificate  will remain  outstanding  under the  Agreement and the
Holder hereof may have additional  obligations with respect to this Certificate,
including  tax   liabilities,   and  may  be  entitled  to  certain   additional
distributions  hereon,  in  accordance  with the  terms  and  provisions  of the
Agreement.
<PAGE>

               No transfer of this Class R  Certificate  will be made unless the
Trustee has received either (i) an opinion of counsel  acceptable to and in form
and substance  satisfactory to the Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer
with  respect  to  the  permissibility  of  such  transfer  under  the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA"),  and Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and stating,  among other things, that
the  transferee's  acquisition  of a Class R Certificate  will not constitute or
result in a  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction  under  Section 406 of ERISA or
Section  4975 of the  Code  or  (ii) a  representation  letter,  in the  form as
described  by the  Agreement,  stating  that the  transferee  is not an employee
benefit or other plan subject to the prohibited  transaction provisions of ERISA
or  Section  4975 of the Code (a  "Plan"),  or any other  person  (including  an
investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee of any Plan) acting, directly
or indirectly,  on behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with "plan assets" of
any Plan.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates  issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed
Pass-Through  Certificates of the Series specified  hereon (herein  collectively
called the "Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. In the event Master Servicer
funds  are  advanced  with  respect  to  any  Mortgage  Loan,  such  advance  is
reimbursable  to the Master  Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,
from related recoveries on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have
been distributable to Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account   and/or  the   Certificate   Account   created   for  the   benefit  of
Certificateholders  may be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time for
purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders, such purposes including
without  limitation  reimbursement  to the  Company  and the Master  Servicer of
advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations of the Company,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee and the rights
of the  Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.
<PAGE>

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City and
State of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The Company, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Master Servicer,  the Trustee or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Master  Servicer
from the Trust Fund of all remaining Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in
respect of such  Mortgage  Loans,  thereby  effecting  early  retirement  of the
Certificates.  The Agreement permits,  but does not require, the Master Servicer
to (i) purchase at a price determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining
Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii)
purchase in whole,  but not in part,  all of the  Certificates  from the Holders
thereof; provided, that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated
Principal  Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution  Date upon which
the proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of
the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

               Reference  is  hereby  made  to the  further  provisions  of this
Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof,  which further provisions shall for
all purpose have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

               Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

amended or  supplemented  by  Residential  Funding  from time to time.  Any such
amendment(s) to the Guides shall be binding upon the parties hereto.

3.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

a.      Reciprocal Representations and Warranties.

               The  Seller/Servicer  and Residential Funding each represents and
warrants to the other that as of the date of this Contract:
<PAGE>

(1)                   Each party is duly  organized,  validly  existing,  and in

                      validity of this Contract.

(4)  Insofar as its capacity to carry out any obligation  under this Contract is
     concerned,  neither  party is in  violation  of any  charter,  articles  of
     incorporation,   bylaws,  mortgage,  indenture,  indebtedness,   agreement,

b.      Seller/Servicer's Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

                                 )    ss.:
COUNTY OF                        )
               [NAME OF OFFICER], being first duly sworn, deposes and says:

1. That he is [Title of Officer] of [Name of Owner] (record or beneficial  owner
of the Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series ____-___, Class R
(the  "Owner")),  a  [savings  institution]  [corporation]  duly  organized  and
existing  under the laws of [the State  of__________ ] [the United  States],  on
behalf of which he makes this affidavit and agreement.

2. That the Owner (i) is not and will not be a "disqualified organization" or an
electing  large  partnership  as of [date of  transfer]  within  the  meaning of
Sections 860E(e)(5) and 775, respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code") or an electing large partnership under Section 775(a) of
the Code,  (ii) will endeavor to remain other than a  disqualified  organization
for so long as it retains its  ownership  interest in the Class R  Certificates,
and (iii) is acquiring the Class R  Certificates  for its own account or for the
account of another  Owner from which it has received an affidavit  and agreement
in  substantially  the same  form as this  affidavit  and  agreement.  (For this
purpose, a "disqualified organization" means an electing large partnership under
Section 775 of the Code, the United States,  any state or political  subdivision
thereof,  any agency or  instrumentality  of any of the foregoing (other than an
instrumentality  all of the  activities of which are subject to tax and,  except
for the Federal  Home Loan  Mortgage  Corporation,  a majority of whose board of
directors  is not  selected  by any such  governmental  entity)  or any  foreign
government,  international organization or any agency or instrumentality of such
foreign government or organization, any rural electric or telephone cooperative,
or any organization (other than certain farmers' cooperatives) that is generally
exempt from federal income tax unless such organization is subject to the tax on
unrelated business taxable income).

3. That the Owner is aware (i) of the tax that would be imposed on  transfers of
Class  R  Certificates   to   disqualified   organizations   or  electing  large
partnerships,  under  the  Code,  that  applies  to all  transfers  of  Class  R
Certificates after March 31, 1988; (ii) that such tax would be on the transferor
(or,  with  respect to transfers to electing  large  partnerships,  on each such
partnership),  or, if such transfer is through an agent (which person includes a
broker,  nominee or middleman)  for a disqualified  organization,  on the agent;
(iii) that the person  (other than with respect to  transfers to electing  large
partnerships)  otherwise  liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability  for
the tax if the  transferee  furnishes  to such  person  an  affidavit  that  the
transferee is not a disqualified organization and, at the time of transfer, such
person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false; and (iv) that
the Class R Certificates  may be  "noneconomic  residual  interests"  within the
meaning of Treasury  regulations  promulgated  pursuant to the Code and that the
transferor of a noneconomic  residual  interest will remain liable for any taxes
due with respect to the income on such residual interest,  unless no significant
purpose of the transfer was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.
<PAGE>

4. That the Owner is aware of the tax imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding
Class R  Certificates  if either the  pass-through  entity is an electing  large
partnership  under  Section 775 of the if at any time during the taxable year of

interest in such entity.  (For this purpose,  a "pass through entity" includes a

fund, a partnership, trust or estate, and certain cooperatives.)

5. The Owner is either (i) a citizen or  resident of the United  States,  (ii) a
corporation,  partnership  or  other  entity  treated  as  a  corporation  or  a
partnership for U.S.  federal income tax purposes and created or organized in or
under the laws of the  United  States,  any state  thereof  or the  District  of
Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States person
under any applicable Treasury regulations), (iii) an estate that is described in
Section 7701(a)(30)(D) of the Code, or (iv) a trust that is described in Section
7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code.

6. The  Owner  hereby  agrees  that it will not  cause  income  from the Class R
Certificates to be attributable to a foreign  permanent  establishment  or fixed
base  (within  the meaning of an  applicable  income tax treaty) of the Owner or
another United States taxpayer.

7. That the Owner is aware that the Trustee  will not  register  the transfer of
any Class R  Certificates  unless the  transferee,  or the  transferee's  agent,
delivers to it an affidavit and agreement,  among other things, in substantially
the same form as this affidavit and agreement.  The Owner expressly  agrees that
it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows or believes that any of the
representations contained in such affidavit and agreement are false.

8. That the Owner has  reviewed  the  restrictions  set forth on the face of the
Class R Certificates  and the  provisions of Section  5.02(f) of the Pooling and
Servicing  Agreement  under  which  the Class R  Certificates  were  issued  (in
particular,  clause (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) of Section 5.02(f) which authorize the
Trustee to deliver  payments  to a person  other than the Owner and  negotiate a
mandatory sale by the Trustee in the event the Owner holds such  Certificates in
violation of Section 5.02(f)).  The Owner expressly agrees to be bound by and to
comply with such restrictions and provisions.

9. That the Owner consents to any additional  restrictions or arrangements  that
shall be deemed  necessary  upon advice of counsel to  constitute  a  reasonable
arrangement to ensure that the Class R Certificates will only be owned, directly
or indirectly, by an Owner that is not a disqualified organization.

10.     The Owner's Taxpayer Identification Number is  ______________________.

11. This affidavit and agreement  relates only to the Class R Certificates  held
by the Owner and not to any other holder of the Class R Certificates.  The Owner
understands  that the  liabilities  described  herein relate only to the Class R
Certificates.
<PAGE>

12. That no purpose of the Owner  relating to the transfer of any of the Class R
Certificates  by the Owner is or will be to impede the  assessment or collection
of any tax; in making this representation,  the Owner warrants that the Owner is
familiar with (i) Treasury  Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c) and recent amendments
thereto,  effective as of July 19, 2002,  and (ii) the preamble  describing  the
adoption of the  amendments  to such  regulation,  which is  attached  hereto as
Exhibit 1.

13.  That the Owner has no  present  knowledge  or  expectation  that it will be
unable  to  pay  any  United  States  taxes  owed  by it so  long  as any of the
Certificates remain outstanding.  In this regard, the Owner hereby represents to
and for the benefit of the person from whom it acquired the Class R  Certificate
that the Owner  intends  to pay  taxes  associated  with  holding  such  Class R
Certificate  as they  become  due,  fully  understanding  that it may  incur tax
liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the Class R Certificate.

14. That the Owner has no present  knowledge or expectation  that it will become
insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy  proceeding for so long as any of the Class
R Certificates remain outstanding.

15. The  Purchaser is not an employee  benefit plan or other plan subject to the
prohibited transaction provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA"),  or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"),  or an investment  manager,  named fiduciary or a
trustee of any such plan, or any other Person acting, directly or indirectly, on
behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with "plan assets" of any such plan.

Background

    This document contains final regulations  regarding the proposed  amendments
to 26 CFR part 1 under  section  860E of the Internal  Revenue Code (Code).  The
regulations  provide the circumstances under which a transferor of a noneconomic
REMIC  residual   interest   meeting  the   investigation   and   representation
requirements  may avail  itself  of the safe  harbor by  satisfying  either  the
formula test or the asset test.

    Final regulations  governing REMICs, issued in 1992, contain rules governing
the transfer of noneconomic REMIC residual interests.  In general, a transfer of
a  noneconomic  residual  interest  is  disregarded  for all tax  purposes  if a
significant purpose of the transfer is to

[[Page 47452]]

enable the  transferor to impede the  assessment or collection of tax. A purpose
to impede the assessment or collection of tax (a wrongful purpose) exists if the
transferor,  at the time of the transfer,  either knew or should have known that
the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the
REMIC's taxable income.

<PAGE>

    Under a safe harbor, the transferor of a REMIC noneconomic residual interest
is presumed not to have a wrongful  purpose if two  requirements  are satisfied:
(1) the  transferor  conducts a  reasonable  investigation  of the  transferee's
financial  condition  (the  investigation  requirement);  and (2) the transferor
secures a  representation  from the transferee to the effect that the transferee
understands the tax obligations  associated with holding a residual interest and
intends to pay those taxes (the representation requirement).

    The  IRS  and  Treasury  have  been  concerned  that  some   transferors  of
noneconomic  residual  interests  claim they  satisfy  the safe  harbor  even in
situations  where the economics of the transfer  clearly indicate the transferee
is unwilling or unable to pay the tax associated with holding the interest.  For
this reason,  on February 7, 2000, the IRS published in the Federal Register (65
FR 5807) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-100276-97; REG-122450-98) designed
to clarify the safe harbor by adding the "formula  test," an economic  test. The
proposed  regulation  provides  that the safe harbor is  unavailable  unless the
present value of the  anticipated  tax  liabilities  associated with holding the
residual  interest  does not  exceed the sum of:  (1) The  present  value of any
consideration  given to the transferee to acquire the interest;  (2) the present
value of the expected future distributions on the interest;  and (3) the present
value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding the interest as the
REMIC generates losses.

    The notice of proposed  rulemaking also contained rules for FASITs.  Section
1.860H-6(g) of the proposed regulations  provides  requirements for transfers of
FASIT  ownership  interests  and adopts a safe harbor by  reference  to the safe
harbor provisions of the REMIC regulations.

    In January 2001, the IRS published Rev. Proc. 2001-12 (2001-3 I.R.B. 335) to
set forth an alternative  safe harbor that taxpayers could use while the IRS and
the  Treasury  considered  comments  on  the  proposed  regulations.  Under  the
alternative safe harbor, if a transferor meets the investigation requirement and
the representation  requirement but the transfer fails to meet the formula test,
the transferor  may invoke the safe harbor if the transferee  meets a two- prong
test (the asset test). A transferee generally meets the first prong of this test
if, at the time of the transfer, and in each of the two years preceding the year
of  transfer,  the  transferee's  gross  assets  exceed $100 million and its net
assets exceed $10 million. A transferee generally meets the second prong of this
test if it is a  domestic,  taxable  corporation  and agrees in  writing  not to
transfer  the  interest  to any person  other  than  another  domestic,  taxable
corporation that also satisfies the requirements of the asset test. A transferor
cannot rely on the asset test if the  transferor  knows,  or has reason to know,
that the  transferee  will not comply  with its written  agreement  to limit the
restrictions on subsequent transfers of the residual interest.

<PAGE>

    Rev. Proc. 2001-12 provides that the asset test fails to be satisfied in the
case of a transfer or assignment of a noneconomic residual interest to a foreign
branch of an otherwise  eligible  transferee.  If such a transfer or  assignment
were permitted,  a corporate taxpayer might seek to claim that the provisions of
an  applicable  income tax treaty  would  resource  excess  inclusion  income as
foreign  source  income,  and that,  as a  consequence,  any U.S. tax  liability
attributable  to the excess  inclusion  income  could be offset by  foreign  tax
credits.  Such a claim would impede the  assessment or collection of U.S. tax on
excess inclusion income,  contrary to the congressional purpose of assuring that
such income will be taxable in all events. See, e.g., sections 860E(a)(1),  (b),
(e) and 860G(b) of the Code.

    The Treasury and the IRS have  learned that certain  taxpayers  transferring
noneconomic residual interests to foreign branches have attempted to rely on the
formula  test to obtain  safe  harbor  treatment  in an  effort  to  impede  the
assessment or collection of U.S. tax on excess  inclusion  income.  Accordingly,
the  final  regulations  provide  that if a  noneconomic  residual  interest  is
transferred  to a  foreign  permanent  establishment  or  fixed  base  of a U.S.
taxpayer,  the transfer is not eligible for safe harbor  treatment  under either
the asset  test or the  formula  test.  The  final  regulations  also  require a
transferee  to  represent  that it will not cause  income  from the  noneconomic
residual  interest to be attributable to a foreign  permanent  establishment  or
fixed base.

    Section 1.860E-1(c)(8)  provides computational rules that a taxpayer may use
to  qualify  for  safe  harbor   status   under  the   formula   test.   Section
1.860E-1(c)(8)(i)  provides that the transferee is presumed to pay tax at a rate
equal to the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).  Some  commentators
were  concerned that this presumed rate of taxation was too high because it does
not take into  consideration  taxpayers  subject to the alternative  minimum tax
rate. In light of the comments received,  this provision has been amended in the
final regulations to allow certain transferees that compute their taxable income
using the alternative  minimum tax rate to use the alternative  minimum tax rate
applicable to corporations.

    Additionally,  Sec.  1.860E-1(c)(8)(iii) provides that the present values in
the  formula  test  are to be  computed  using  a  discount  rate  equal  to the
applicable  Federal  short-term  rate prescribed by section  1274(d).  This is a
change  from  the  proposed   regulation  and  Rev.  Proc.   2001-12.  In  those
publications  the  provision  stated that "present  values are computed  using a
discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate prescribed in section 1274(d)
compounded  semiannually"  and that "[a] lower  discount rate may be used if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly borrows, in the course of its trade
or  business,  substantial  funds at such  lower  rate from an  unrelated  third
party." The IRS and the Treasury  Department  have learned  that,  based on this
provision,  certain taxpayers have been attempting to use unrealistically low or
zero interest rates to satisfy the formula test,  frustrating  the intent of the
test.  Furthermore,  the  Treasury  Department  and the IRS believe  that a rule
allowing  for a rate  other than a rate based on an  objective  index  would add
unnecessary complexity to the safe harbor. As a result, the rule in the proposed

<PAGE>

regulations  that  permits a transferee  to use a lower  discount  rate,  if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly  borrows  substantial funds at such
lower rate, is not included in the final regulations; and the Federal short-term
rate  has  been  substituted  for  the  applicable  Federal  rate.  To  simplify
taxpayers' computations, the final regulations allow use of any of the published
short-term  rates,  provided  that  the  present  values  are  computed  with  a
corresponding  period  of  compounding.  With the  exception  of the  provisions
relating to transfers to foreign  branches,  these  changes  generally  have the
proposed  applicability  date of February 4, 2000,  but  taxpayers may choose to
apply the interest  rate formula set forth in the proposed  regulation  and Rev.
Proc. 2001-12 for transfers occurring before August 19, 2002.

    It is anticipated that when final regulations are adopted with
respect to

[[Page 47453]]

FASITs,  Sec.  1.860H-6(g)  of the  proposed  regulations  will  be  adopted  in
substantially  its  present  form,  with the result  that the final  regulations
contained  in this  document  will  also  govern  transfers  of FASIT  ownership
interests with substantially the same applicability date as is contained in this
document.

Effect on Other Documents

    Rev. Proc. 2001-12 (2001-3 I.R.B. 335) is obsolete for transfers of
noneconomic residual interests in REMICs occurring on or after August
19, 2002.

Special Analyses

    It is hereby  certified that these  regulations  will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is
based  on the  fact  that it is  unlikely  that a  substantial  number  of small
entities will hold REMIC residual interests. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis  under  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter  6) is not
required.  It  has  been  determined  that  this  Treasury  decision  is  not  a
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.  Therefore, a
regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that sections
553(b) and 553(d) of the  Administrative  Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter 5) do
not apply to these regulations.

other  personnel  from the IRS and  Treasury  Department  participated  in their
development.

               Section 12.01.  Subordinate  Certificate  Loss Coverage;  Limited
Guaranty.  (a) Subject to subsection (c) below,  prior to the later of the third
Business Day prior to each Distribution Date or the related  Determination Date,
the Master  Servicer  shall  determine  whether it or any  Sub-Servicer  will be
entitled to any  reimbursement  pursuant to Section 4.02(a) on such Distribution

Advances or Sub-Servicer  Advances that were made with respect to  delinquencies
which were  subsequently  determined to be Excess Special Hazard Losses,  Excess
Fraud Losses,  Excess Bankruptcy Losses or Extraordinary Losses) and, if so, the
Master Servicer shall demand payment from Residential Funding of an amount equal
to the amount of any Advances or Sub-Servicer  Advances  reimbursed  pursuant to
Section 4.02(a),  to the extent such Advances or Sub-Servicer  Advances have not
been included in the amount of the Realized Loss in the related  Mortgage  Loan,
and  shall  distribute  the same to the Class B  Certificateholders  in the same
manner as if such amount were to be distributed pursuant to Section 4.02(a).

               (b) Subject to  subsection  (c) below,  prior to the later of the

shall demand  payment from  Residential  Funding of the amount of such  Realized
Loss and shall distribute the same to the Class B Certificateholders in the same
manner as if such amount  were to be  distributed  pursuant to Section  4.02(a);
provided, however, that the amount of such demand in respect of any Distribution
Date shall in no event be greater than the sum of (i) the  additional  amount of
Accrued  Certificate  Interest  that  would  have  been  paid  for  the  Class B
Certificateholders  on such  Distribution  Date had such Realized Loss or Losses
not occurred plus (ii) the amount of the reduction in the Certificate  Principal

Bankruptcy Losses and Extraordinary Losses allocated to the Class B Certificates
will not be covered by the Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation.

Available")  shall  be  equal  to the  lesser  of (X)  minus  the sum of (i) all
previous  payments made under  subsections (a) and (b) hereof and (ii) all draws
under the Limited  Guaranty made in lieu of such payments as described  below in
subsection (d) and (Y) the then outstanding  Certificate  Principal  Balances of
the Class B Certificates, or such lower amount as may be established pursuant to
Section 12.02.  Residential  Funding's  obligations as described in this Section
are referred to herein as the "Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation."

               (d) The Trustee will promptly  notify General  Motors  Acceptance
Corporation of any failure of Residential Funding to make any payments hereunder
and  shall  demand  payment  pursuant  to the  limited  guaranty  (the  "Limited
Guaranty"),  executed by General Motors Acceptance  Corporation,  of Residential
Funding's  obligation  to make payments  pursuant to this Section,  in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the Amount Available and (ii) such required payments,
by  delivering to General  Motors  Acceptance  Corporation a written  demand for
payment by wire  transfer,  not later than the second  Business Day prior to the
Distribution Date for such month, with a copy to the Master Servicer.

               (e) All payments  made by  Residential  Funding  pursuant to this
Section or amounts paid under the Limited  Guaranty shall be deposited  directly
in the Certificate  Account,  for distribution on the Distribution Date for such
month to the Class B Certificateholders.

               (f) The Company shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to
substitute  for  either  or  both of the  Limited  Guaranty  or the  Subordinate
Certificate  Loss  Obligation  another  instrument  in the  form of a  corporate
guaranty,  an irrevocable  letter of credit, a surety bond,  insurance policy or
similar  instrument  or a reserve fund;  provided  that (i) the Company  obtains
(subject to the provisions of Section 10.01(f) as if the Company was substituted
for the Master Servicer solely for the purposes of such provision) an Opinion of
Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent counsel) to the effect that
obtaining such  substitute  corporate  guaranty,  irrevocable  letter of credit,
surety bond,  insurance  policy or similar  instrument  or reserve fund will not
cause  either (a) any  federal  tax to be imposed on the Trust  Fund,  including
without limitation,  any federal tax imposed on "prohibited  transactions" under
Section  860(F)(a)(1) of the Code or on  "contributions  after the startup date"
under Section  860(G)(d)(1) of the Code or (b) the Trust Fund to fail to qualify
as a REMIC at any time that any  Certificate  is  outstanding,  and (ii) no such
substitution  shall  be made  unless  (A) the  substitute  Limited  Guaranty  or
Subordinate  Certificate  Loss Obligation is for an initial amount not less than
the then  current  Amount  Available  and  contains  provisions  that are in all
material  respects  equivalent to the original  Limited  Guaranty or Subordinate
Certificate   Loss   Obligation   (including   that  no  portion  of  the  fees,
reimbursements  or other  obligations under any such instrument will be borne by
the Trust  Fund),  (B) the long  term debt  obligations  of any  obligor  of any
substitute  Limited Guaranty or Subordinate  Certificate Loss Obligation (if not
supported by the Limited Guaranty) shall be rated at least the lesser of (a) the
rating  of  the  long  term  debt  obligations  of  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation  as of the date of  issuance  of the  Limited  Guaranty  and (b) the
rating  of  the  long  term  debt  obligations  of  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation at the date of such substitution and (C) the Company obtains written
confirmation from each nationally recognized credit rating agency that rated the
Class B Certificates at the request of the Company that such substitution  shall
not lower the  rating on the Class B  Certificates  below the  lesser of (a) the
then-current  rating  assigned to the Class B Certificates by such rating agency
and (b) the original  rating assigned to the Class B Certificates by such rating

agency. Any replacement of the Limited Guaranty or Subordinate  Certificate Loss
Obligation pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by a written Opinion of
Counsel to the substitute guarantor or obligor, addressed to the Master Servicer
and the Trustee, that such substitute instrument  constitutes a legal, valid and
binding  obligation  of the  substitute  guarantor  or obligor,  enforceable  in
accordance  with its terms,  and  concerning  such  other  matters as the Master
Servicer and the Trustee  shall  reasonably  request.  Neither the Company,  the
Master  Servicer nor the Trustee shall be obligated to substitute for or replace
the Limited  Guaranty  or  Subordinate  Certificate  Loss  Obligation  under any
circumstance.

               Section  12.02.  Amendments  Relating  to the  Limited  Guaranty.
Notwithstanding  Sections 11.01 or 12.01: (i) the provisions of this Article XII
may be amended,  superseded or deleted, (ii) the Limited Guaranty or Subordinate
Certificate Loss Obligation may be amended,  reduced or canceled,  and (iii) any
other  provision of this Agreement which is related or incidental to the matters
described  in this  Article  XII may be amended in any  manner;  in each case by
written  instrument  executed or  consented  to by the  Company and  Residential
Funding but without the consent of any Certificateholder and without the consent
of the Master  Servicer or the Trustee being required  unless any such amendment
would impose any  additional  obligation on, or otherwise  adversely  affect the
interests of, the Master Servicer or the Trustee,  as applicable;  provided that
the Company shall also obtain a letter from each  nationally  recognized  credit
rating agency that rated the Class B Certificates  at the request of the Company
to the effect that such amendment,  reduction, deletion or cancellation will not
lower  the  rating  on the  Class B  Certificates  below  the  lesser of (a) the
then-current  rating  assigned to the Class B Certificates by such rating agency
and (b) the original  rating assigned to the Class B Certificates by such rating
agency, unless (A) the Holder of 100% of the Class B Certificates is Residential
Funding  or  an  Affiliate  of  Residential  Funding,  or  (B)  such  amendment,
reduction,  deletion or cancellation is made in accordance with Section 11.01(e)
and,  provided  further that the Company  obtains  (subject to the provisions of
Section  10.01(f)  as if the  Company was  substituted  for the Master  Servicer
solely for the purposes of such provision),  in the case of a material amendment
or  supercession  (but not a reduction,  cancellation or deletion of the Limited
Guaranty or the Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation),  an Opinion of Counsel
(which  need not be an opinion of  Independent  counsel)  to the effect that any
such amendment or  supercession  will not cause either (a) any federal tax to be
imposed on the Trust Fund, including without limitation, any federal tax imposed
on  "prohibited  transactions"  under  Section  860F(a)(1)  of  the  Code  or on
"contributions  after the startup date" under Section  860G(d)(1) of the Code or
(b) the  Trust  Fund to  fail  to  qualify  as a  REMIC  at any  time  that  any
Certificate is outstanding.  A copy of any such instrument  shall be provided to
the Trustee and the Master  Servicer  together  with an Opinion of Counsel  that
such amendment complies with this Section 12.02.
