          THIS POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of
November 26, 2002 by and among ALLIANCE LAUNDRY SYSTEMS LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("ALS" and, in its capacity as Originator and Servicer
hereunder, the "Originator" and the "Servicer," respectively), ALLIANCE LAUNDRY
EQUIPMENT RECEIVABLES 2002 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("ALER"
and, in its capacity as the Transferor hereunder, the "Transferor"), and
ALLIANCE LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT RECEIVABLES TRUST 2002-A, a Delaware statutory trust
(the "Issuer").

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, ALS will from time to
time sell or convey certain Loans and all of its Receivables to the Transferor;

          WHEREAS, the Transferor desires to further contribute such Loans and
Receivables to the Issuer in respect of its beneficial interest in the Issuer,
and the Servicer desires to perform the servicing obligations set forth herein
for, and in consideration of, the fees and other benefits set forth in this
Agreement;

          WHEREAS, the Transferor and the Issuer wish to set forth the terms
pursuant to which such Loans and Receivables are to be sold by the Transferor to
the Issuer, and the Servicer and the Issuer wish to set forth the terms pursuant
to which such Loans and Receivables will be serviced by the Servicer;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the other good and
valuable consideration and the mutual terms and covenants contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                               CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

          SECTION 1.01 Definitions. Certain capitalized terms used in the above
recitals and in this Agreement are defined in and shall have the respective
meanings assigned them in Part I of Appendix A to this Agreement. All references
herein to "the Agreement" or "this Agreement" are to this Pooling and Servicing
Agreement as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the
exhibits hereto and the capitalized terms used herein which are defined in such
Appendix A, and all references herein to Articles, Sections and subsections are
to Articles, Sections or subsections of this Agreement unless otherwise
specified. The rules of construction set forth in Part II of such Appendix A

                                   ARTICLE II

                                PURCHASE AND SALE

          SECTION 2.01 Purchase and Sale. The Originator has previously sold,
transferred and conveyed to the Transferor, the Transferor hereby conveys,
transfers or assigns to the Issuer, and the Issuer hereby accepts from the
Transferor, at the times set forth in Section 2.2, all of Transferor's right,
title and interest in, to and under:

<PAGE>

          (a) all Specified Assets that existed and were transferred to the
Transferor on the Closing Date under the Purchase Agreement;

          (b) all Specified Assets that existed and were acquired by the
Transferor on each Purchase Date during the period from and including the
closing of business on the Closing Date to the Purchase Termination Date;

          (c) the Purchase Agreement and the other Basic Documents (other than
the Trust Agreement, and the documents and certificates executed in connection
with the foregoing) to the extent such rights relate to the Specified Assets,
including the right of the Transferor to cause ALS to perform its obligations
thereunder (including the obligation of ALS under Sections 2.12(c) and (d) of
the Purchase Agreement); and

          (d) any and all income and Proceeds of the property described in
clauses (a) through (c) above.

          As used herein, "Second Tier Purchased Assets" means the items listed
above in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) collectively.

          SECTION 2.02 Timing of Conveyances.

          (a) Initial Closing Date Conveyances. On the Closing Date, the
Transferor will, pursuant to an assignment in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A-1 (the "Initial PSA Assignment"), convey, sell, transfer, assign, and
set over to the Issuer all of the Specified Assets acquired by the Transferor on
the Closing Date pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

          (b) Regular Conveyances. On each Purchase Date under the Purchase
Agreement, the Transferor will immediately, upon the acquisition by the
Transferor of such Specified Assets, transfer, pursuant to an assignment in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "Additional PSA Assignment"), each and
every Specified Asset acquired by the Transferor on such Purchase Date pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

          SECTION 2.03 Character of Transfers. Each transfer of Second Tier
Purchased Assets as set forth in Section 2.02 will be treated as a capital
contribution by the Transferor to the Issuer.

          SECTION 2.04 No Recourse. Except as specifically provided in Section
2.12 of this Agreement, the sale and purchase of Second Tier Purchased Assets
under this Agreement shall be without recourse to the Transferor; it being
understood that the Transferor shall be liable to the Issuer for all
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities made by the Transferor
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of which obligations are limited so
as not to constitute recourse to the Transferor for the credit risk of the
Obligors under any Second Tier Purchased Assets.

          SECTION 2.05 No Assumption of Obligations Relating to Second Tier
Purchased Assets. Neither the Issuer nor the Servicer shall have any obligation
or liability to any Obligor or other customer or client of the Transferor
(including any obligation to perform any of the obligations of the Transferor
under any Second Tier Purchased Asset including any contract

                                        2

<PAGE>

or purchase orders or other agreements related to any Second Tier Purchased
Asset). No such obligation or liability is intended to be assumed by the Issuer
or the Servicer hereunder, and any such assumption is expressly disclaimed.

          SECTION 2.06 Absolute Conveyances. Each of the Transferor and the
Issuer intends each transfer of the Second Tier Purchased Assets hereunder to be
capital contributions by the Transferor to the Issuer, that in each case are
absolute and irrevocable and that provide the Issuer with the full benefits of
ownership of the Second Tier Purchased Assets. Neither the Issuer nor the
Transferor intends the transactions contemplated hereunder to be, or for any
purpose to be characterized as, loans from the Issuer to the Transferor.

          The Transferor, the Servicer and the Issuer intend to treat such
transfer and assignment as a capital contribution for accounting purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arrangements with respect to such assets
are deemed for any purpose to constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale or
capital contribution of the Second Tier Purchased Assets, it is the intention of
the parties hereto that this Agreement shall still constitute a security
agreement under applicable law, and Transferor hereby grants to the Issuer a
first priority perfected security interest in all of Transferor's right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the
Second Tier Purchased Assets, and all money, accounts, general intangibles,
payment intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, supporting
obligations, goods, investment property, deposit accounts, securities
entitlements, certificates of deposit, letters of credit, letter-of-credit
rights, and advices of credit consisting of, arising from or related to such
assets, and all proceeds thereof, to secure its obligations hereunder, including
its obligation to remit to the Issuer, or its successors and assigns, all
Collections of such assets and other proceeds of such assets and all other
Second Tier Purchased Assets. The Transferor and the Issuer agree that the
foregoing transfers of Purchased Receivables and Loans included in the Second
Tier Purchased Assets constitute sales of "accounts," "promissory notes" and
"chattel paper" as described in the UCC, and that this Agreement shall create a
security interest in favor of the Issuer as the purchaser of such assets.

          Each of the Transferor and the Issuer shall, to the extent consistent
with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if
this Agreement is deemed to create a security interest in the Second Tier
Purchased Assets, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected
security interest of first priority Lien in favor of the Indenture Trustee (as
assignee of the Issuer) under applicable law (including the filing of any
financing statements describing the subject of such security interest as all
assets of the Transferor) and will be maintained as such throughout the term of
this Agreement. Such grant of a security interest in the Second Tier Purchased
Assets shall be deemed to include all rights, powers and options (but none of
the obligations, if any) of the Transferor under any agreement or instrument
included in the assets referred to in the Second Tier Purchased Assets,
including the immediate and continuing right to claim for, collect, receive and
give receipt for principal and interest payments in respect of Purchased
Equipment Loans and all other monies payable under such Purchased Equipment
Loans, the immediate and continuing right to collect the Purchased Receivables
to give and receive notices and other communications, to make waivers or other
agreements, to exercise all rights and options, to bring Proceedings in the name
of the Transferor or otherwise and generally to do and receive anything that the
Transferor is or may be entitled to do or receive

                                        3

<PAGE>

under or with respect to the Second Tier Purchased Assets. For purposes of such
grant, this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under the UCC.

          SECTION 2.07 Effect of Transfer. Upon each Advance under the Indenture
and the Note Purchase Agreement, title to the Second Tier Purchased Assets shall
vest in the Issuer, whether or not the conditions precedent to the obligation of
the Issuer to acquire such Second Tier Purchased Assets were in fact satisfied.

          SECTION 2.08 Servicing of Second Tier Purchased Assets. Consistent
with the Issuer's ownership of the Second Tier Purchased Assets, the Issuer
shall have the sole right to service, administer and collect the Second Tier
Purchased Assets and to assign such right to others.

          SECTION 2.09 Custody of Collateral Documents. Simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Servicer, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Custodian shall enter into the Custodial Agreement,
whereby the Custodian shall act as the agent of the Indenture Trustee as
custodian of the following documents and instruments (collectively, the
"Collateral Documents") for each Loan to be acquired by the Issuer pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement:

          (a) the fully executed endorsed original of the Equipment Note and any
original loan agreement for any such Loan (which shall not bear any transfer or
encumbrance legend or, if it shall bear such a legend, shall be accompanied by
an unconditional release from the party or parties named in such legend);

          (b) the original, fully executed Guaranty executed in respect of such
Loan (unless the Loan Schedule certifies that such document does not exist with
respect to the applicable Loan);

          (c) the original, fully executed security agreement executed for such
Loan;

          (d) the original file-stamped UCC financing statement with recording
information indicated thereon for such Loan filed by the Originator against the
Obligor with respect to the related Equipment or a copy thereof and related
certificates (as provided in the second paragraph below);

          (e) the Delivery and Acceptance Receipt for the Equipment relating to
such Loan (unless the Loan Schedule certifies that such document does not exist
with respect to the applicable Loan) or a copy thereof and related certification
(as provided in the second paragraph below); and

          (f) the assignment of lease, landlord waiver, mortgagee waiver or
deed, in each case, with respect to the real property on which the related
Equipment is located (unless the Loan Schedule certifies that such document does
not exist with respect to the applicable Loan and is not required to be
delivered to the Custodian pursuant to this Agreement).

          The Transferor shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, deliver to the
Custodian (i) on or prior to the Closing Date, all of the Collateral Documents
(but shall retain copies thereof)

                                        4

<PAGE>

relating to at least 98% of the Aggregate Initial Loan Balance of the Initial
Loans, and (ii) the Collateral Documents relating to the remaining Initial Loans
within three (3) Business Days of the Closing Date. On or prior to the Closing
Date (with respect to the 98%) and two Business Days after receipt by the
Custodian (with respect to the remaining 2%) such Collateral Documents shall
have been certified as complete and without Exception (as defined in the
Custodial Agreement) by the Custodian (a copy of such certification will be
provided to the Insurer and the Indenture Trustee). With respect to any Loan
transferred to the Issuer after the Closing Date, the Transferor shall, or shall
cause the Servicer to, deliver all of the Collateral Documents (but shall retain
copies thereof) relating to such Loans to the Custodian and such Collateral
Documents shall have been certified as complete and without Exception (as
defined in the Custodial Agreement) by the Custodian (a copy of such
certification will be provided to the Insurer and the Indenture Trustee) no
later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day prior to, and as a condition to the
funding of the Equipment Loan under the Indenture, on the applicable Equipment
Loan Borrowing Date. The Custodian shall, in accordance with the Custodial
Agreement, review and certify as complete pursuant to a Custodian Receipt
Certification all Collateral Documents required to be delivered to the Custodian
with respect to each Loan. Except as otherwise provided herein with respect to
the transfer of servicing duties hereunder, the Servicer: (i) shall maintain in
its possession the Loan Files and Receivables Files (other than the Collateral
Documents) in a manner consistent with the Loan Servicing Standards, (ii) will
not dispose of any documents constituting the Loan Files or Receivables Files,
(iii) will not permit any Person other than the Indenture Trustee to maintain
any adverse claim upon any Loan File or Receivables File, and (iv) will not
permit any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer (or any
sub-servicer or other agent permitted hereunder) or the Custodian to maintain
possession of any Loan File or Receivable File so long as the related Loan or
Receivable shall remain part of the Trust Estate.

          With respect to any Collateral Documents described in clauses (d) or
(f) above which have been delivered, or are being delivered, to recording
offices for recording and have not been returned to the Transferor or Servicer
in time to permit their delivery hereunder at the time required, then, in lieu
of delivering such original documents, the Transferor or Servicer shall deliver
to the Custodian a true copy thereof with a certification (a copy of which
certification shall be delivered to the Control Party) executed by an authorized
representative of the Transferor or Servicer certifying that such copy is a
true, correct and complete copy of the original, which has been transmitted for
recordation. The Transferor or Servicer shall deliver such original documents to
the Custodian promptly when they are received.

          Upon termination of the Servicer as Servicer, the terminated Servicer
shall promptly deliver to the Indenture Trustee any Loan Files and any
Receivables Files, or portion thereof, as applicable, and any copies of the
Collateral Documents that may be in the possession of such Servicer and that may
have been delivered to such Servicer pursuant to this Section 2.09. From time to
time, solely to the extent the same is required to implement the foreclosure,
purchase, payoff, substitution or servicing of the Loans or Receivables by the
Servicer or any related collateral, the Servicer may request release by the
Custodian of, and the Custodian shall deliver to the Servicer, any portion of
the Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms of the Custodial
Agreement. A copy of any such request shall be sent concurrently to the Control
Party. In the event that an Event of Default, Default, Rapid Amortization Event
or Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Control
Party shall be required in

                                        5

<PAGE>

order for the Servicer to make any such request. The Servicer shall promptly
return to the Custodian each and every document previously requested from the
Collateral Documents when the Servicer's need therefor no longer exists, unless
the Loan or Receivable has been liquidated, paid off or collected, is a Warranty
Loan, an Administrative Loan or is a Loan with respect to which a Substitute
Loan has been substituted in its place, in which case, the Servicer shall
provide a certification to this effect to the Custodian, which may be included
in the request for release, a copy of which shall be sent concurrently to the
Control Party.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Servicer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Control Party, be
entitled to request any Collateral Documents held by the Custodian if the sum of
the unpaid Loan Balances of all Loans for which the Servicer is then in
possession of the related Collateral Documents (other than for Loans then held
by the Servicer which have been repurchased, paid off, substituted or liquidated
in accordance with the Loan Servicing Standards) (including the Collateral
Documents to be requested) exceeds 5% of the Aggregate Loan Balances of all
Loans then owned by the Trust. The Servicer may hold, and hereby acknowledges
that it shall hold, any Collateral Documents and all other property included in
the Trust Estate property that it may from time to time receive hereunder as
custodian for the Indenture Trustee solely at the will of the Custodian and the
Indenture Trustee for the sole purpose of facilitating the servicing of the
Loans and such retention and possession shall be in a custodial capacity only.
To the extent the Servicer, as agent of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer,
holds any Trust Estate property, the Servicer shall do so in accordance with the
Loan Servicing Standards as such standard applies to servicers acting as
custodial agent. The Servicer shall promptly report to the Custodian and the
Indenture Trustee the loss by it of all or part of any Collateral Documents
previously provided to it by the Custodian and shall promptly take appropriate
action to remedy any such loss. In such custodial capacity, the Servicer shall
have and perform the following powers and duties:

          (i) hold the Loan Files and Collateral Documents that it may from time
     to time receive hereunder from the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
     Indenture Trustee, maintain accurate records pertaining to each Loan to
     enable it to comply with the terms and conditions of the Indenture and this
     Agreement, and maintain a current inventory thereof;

          (ii) implement policies and procedures consistent with the Servicing
     Standards (and the Credit and Collection Policies generally) and
     requirements of the Custodial Agreement so that the integrity and physical
     possession of such Loan Files and Collateral Documents will be maintained;
     and

          (iii) take all other actions, in accordance with the Servicing
     Standards (and the Credit and Collection Policies generally), in connection
     with maintaining custody of such Loan Files and Collateral Documents on
     behalf of the Indenture Trustee.

Acting as custodian of the Loan Files pursuant to this Section, the Servicer
agrees that it does not and will not have or assert any beneficial ownership
interest in the Loans, the Loan Files or the Collateral Documents.

                                        6

<PAGE>

          The Servicer agrees to maintain the Collateral Documents in its
possession that it may from time to time receive from the Custodian at its
office located in Ripon, Wisconsin or at such other offices of the Servicer as
shall from time to time be identified by prior written notice to the Indenture
Trustee and the Control Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may
temporarily move individual Loan Files or Receivables Files (or any portion
thereof) or any Collateral Documents without notice as necessary to conduct the
collection and other servicing activities originally set forth in the request
for release in accordance with the Servicing Standards; provided, that the
Servicer shall not move any such Loan Files, Receivables Files or such
Collateral Documents for more than 30 days without obtaining the written consent
of the Indenture Trustee and the Control Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          SECTION 2.10 Acceptance and Acknowledgment by Issuer. (a) The Issuer
hereby accepts the Second Tier Purchased Assets and declares that the Issuer
shall hold such assets in trust for the benefit of Beneficiaries in accordance
with the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and this Agreement. The Issuer hereby
accepts the appointment of ALS as Servicer.

          (b) Transfer of Conveyed Assets. Each of the Transferor, ALS, as the
Originator, and the Servicer, understands that the Issuer intends to pledge the
Trust Estate to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Beneficiaries
pursuant to the Indenture. Each of the Transferor, ALS, as the Originator, and
the Servicer agrees that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Indenture Trustee may exercise the rights of the Issuer hereunder and shall be
entitled to all of the benefits to which the Issuer is entitled hereunder to the
extent provided for in the Indenture.

          SECTION 2.11 Representations and Warranties as to the Loans and
Receivables. Pursuant to Section 2.01(c), the Transferor assigned to the Issuer
all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchase Agreement,
including the representations and warranties of ALS made to the Transferor
pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Purchase Agreement. Each of the Originator and
the Transferor hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the Issuer that it
has taken no action, and will take no action, which would cause such
representations, warranties and covenants to be false in any material respect as
of the Closing Date, Purchase Date or Substitution Date, as applicable. Each of
the Originator and the Transferor further acknowledges that the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Control Party rely on, and for their benefit, the
Transferor hereby reaffirms, the representations, warranties and covenants of
the Transferor under this Agreement and the Originator hereby reaffirms the
representations, warranties and covenants of ALS under the Purchase Agreement,
in accepting the Loans and Receivables in trust and executing and delivering the
Securities. The foregoing representations and warranties are made as of the
Closing Date, Purchase Date or Substitution Date but shall survive the sale,
transfer and assignment of the Loans, the Receivables and the other Second Tier
Purchased Assets to the Issuer and the pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to the Indenture.

          SECTION 2.12 Payments in Respect of Receivables and Repurchases of
Loans. Upon discovery by the Transferor, the Control Party, the Servicer, the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made with respect to

                                        7

<PAGE>

any Conveyed Assets that were identified as Eligible Receivables and/or Eligible
Equipment Loans on the relevant Funding Date Data Pool Report in:

          (x) Section 3.01 of the Purchase Agreement (irrespective of any
          limitation set forth in the Purchase Agreement regarding knowledge of
          the Originator); or

          (y) Sections 2.11 or clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 7.01(b) of
          this Agreement; or

          (z) Section 7.01 (a), Section 7.01(b) (other than clauses (i), (ii)
          and (iii) of Section 7.01(b)) or 7.01(c) of this Agreement which
          breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the
          Beneficiaries in, or collectability of, the affected Loan or
          Receivable, as the case may be;

the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice thereof to
the others.

          Unless such breach shall have been waived in writing by the Control
Party or cured in all material respects (whether by remedying the affected Loan
or Receivable or by the Transferor's acquiring and conveying to the Issuer
additional Eligible Receivables or Eligible Equipment Loans, as the case may
be), then the Transferor (in the event of a breach of the representations and
warranties made by the Transferor and not by the Originator) or the Originator
(in the event of a breach of representation and warranty of the Originator and
not the Transferor), shall:

          (i) in the case of a non-conforming Receivable, on the Conversion Date
     (and on each Business Day after the Conversion Date, with respect to events
     or conditions that occur or exist (or are discovered after the Conversion
     Date)) pay the Receivable Repurchase Amount, if any, as described and
     defined in Section 2.12(c) of the Purchase Agreement; and

          (ii) in the case of a non-conforming Loan, unless the Transferor shall
     have provided a Substitute Loan as provided in Section 2.13, repurchase
     such Loan from the Issuer for a price equal to the Warranty Payment by not
     later than the Distribution Date following the second Accounting Date after
     the receipt of notice of such breach.

The Owner Trustee shall have no affirmative duty to conduct any investigation as
to the occurrence of any event requiring the repurchase of any non-conforming
Loan or the payment in respect of any non-conforming Receivable pursuant to this
Section 2.12.

          It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Warranty
Purchaser to repurchase any Loan or make such payment in respect of a Receivable
as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, if such payment or
repurchase obligations are fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the
Transferor, the Servicer or ALS for such breach available to any Interested
Party. The Servicer acknowledges its obligations to repurchase Administrative
Loans from the Issuer pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof and ALS, in its capacity
as the seller under the Purchase Agreement, acknowledges its obligations to
repurchase Warranty Loans pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Purchase Agreement.

          SECTION 2.13 Substitution of Loans.

          (a) Provided no Rapid Amortization Event or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Transferor may, at its option, transfer to the
Issuer on or prior to the eighth day of a month, pursuant to an assignment,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-3 (each, a "Substitution
Assignment") one or more Eligible Equipment Loans (each, a "Substitute Loan")
for any Loan that became subject to a Warranty Event (each such replaced Loan, a
"Predecessor Loan"), together with all right, title and interest of the
Transferor in, to and under:

          (i) all documents and instruments evidencing or governing the
     Substitute Loans and all Loan Files relating thereto, identified in the
     schedule to the Substitution Assignment and all monies paid or payable
     thereon (including Liquidation Proceeds) on or after or due and payable,
     but in each case not paid, as of the Substitution Cutoff Date;

          (ii) the Equipment, including, without limitation, all security
     interests therein, granted by Obligors pursuant to such Substitute Loans
     and any other collateral securing such Substitute Loans;

          (iii) any Insurance Policies, and proceeds thereof, and rights and
     benefits thereunder, with respect to such Equipment and any other
     collateral securing such Substitute Loans;

          (iv) with respect to such Substitute Loans, any Guaranties, and
     proceeds thereof, and all rights and benefits thereunder;

          (v) all funds on deposit from time to time in the Loan Lockbox or in
     the Loan Lockbox Account with respect to such Substitute Loans and all
     proceeds thereof;

          (vi) the Purchase Agreement, and the other Basic Documents (other than
     the Trust Agreement, the Trust Certificate, the Certificates and the
     documents and certificates executed in connection with the foregoing)
     relating to such Loan, including the right of the Transferor to cause ALS
     to perform its obligations thereunder (including the obligation to
     repurchase such Loans under certain circumstances); and

          (vii) any Proceeds of the property described in clauses (i) through
     (vi) above.

          The sum of the Loan Balances, measured as of the Substitution Cutoff
Date, of the Substitute Loans to be transferred to the Issuer on any
Substitution Date shall not be less than the sum of the Loan Balances, or more
than 110%, of the sum of the Loan Balance of the Predecessor Loans, in each case
measured as of the Substitution Cutoff Date. Any such Substitute Loan shall also
bear interest at the same or higher rate of interest as the Predecessor Loan and
shall also have a final maturity date that is not later than six months prior to
the Final Scheduled Distribution Date.

          (b) Each Substitute Loan shall be an Eligible Equipment Loan as of the
close of business on the last day of the month preceding the Substitution Date
(the "Substitution Cutoff Date"), and no Substitute Loan shall have previously
been a Substitute Loan. Loans may

                                        9

<PAGE>

not be substituted for Warranty Loans if and to the extent (i) from the Closing
Date, the sum of the Loan Balances (measured as of the related Substitution
Cutoff Date) of all Substitute Loans (including the Eligible Equipment Loans to
be substituted on such date) exceeds an amount equal to 5% of the sum of the
Loan Balances of all Loans transferred by the Transferor to the Trust on or
after the Closing Date, or (ii) after giving effect to the addition of the
Substitute Loans to be added on such date, the Equipment Loan Borrowing Base
would be less than the Aggregate Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance.

          (c) Upon the replacement of a Loan and collateral as described above,
the interest of the Trustees and the Noteholders in such Predecessor Loan and
related collateral shall be terminated and such Predecessor Loan and collateral
shall be released to the Transferor.

          (d) Any substitution of a Loan pursuant to this Agreement shall be
effected by (i) delivery to the Custodian on behalf of the Indenture Trustee of
the Collateral Documents for each such Substitute Loan on or prior to the
related Substitution Date in accordance with Section 2.03, (ii) filing of any
UCC financing statements necessary to perfect the interest of the Indenture
Trustee in the Substitute Loans, (iii) delivery to the Indenture Trustee of a
list of Substitute Loans reflecting such substitution, and (iv) execution of and
delivery of the related Assignments.

                                   ARTICLE III

          GENERAL ADMINISTRATION; ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF LOANS

          SECTION 3.01 Duties of the Servicer regarding Loans. ALS is hereby
appointed as the initial Servicer. The Servicer is hereby appointed and
authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Loans and in such capacity shall
manage, service, administer and make Collections on the Loans with reasonable
care, using no less than that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer
exercises with respect to comparable stand-alone commercial laundry equipment
loans that it services for itself or others and consistent with the Loan Credit
and Collection Policy (collectively, the "Loan Servicing Standards"). ALS hereby
accepts such appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of
Servicer with respect to the Loans set forth herein. The Servicer's duties shall
include, but not be limited to, collection and posting of all payments,
responding to inquiries of Obligors on the Loans, investigating delinquencies,
sending payment statements to Obligors, upon the request of an Obligor reporting
tax information to such Obligors (which currently consists of IRS Form 1098),
monitoring the collateral in accordance with the Loan Servicing Standards,
accounting for Collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Loans with respect to distributions, maintaining the first priority
perfected security interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Trust Estate (other
than Exempt Collateral) for the benefit of the Beneficiaries and filing any
financing and continuation statements required to be filed pursuant to the UCC,
including, but not limited to, filings against ALS, Transferor and Alliance
Laundry Receivables Warehouse LLC, respectively, to perfect the transfers
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, this Agreement and any document pursuant to
which ALS acquired such assets from Alliance Laundry Receivables Warehouse LLC,
continuation statements shall be filed on or before the 60th day prior to the
expiration date of such financing statement; and promptly delivering evidence of
all such filings to the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer which evidence shall
be satisfactory in form

                                       10

<PAGE>

and substance to the Insurer with evidence of the filing of continuation
statements being delivered on or before the 30th day before the expiration of
such financing statements, and performing the other duties specified herein.
Subject to the provisions of Section 3.02, the Servicer shall follow the Loan
Servicing Standards and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do
any and all things in connection with such managing, servicing, administration
and collection that it may deem necessary or desirable.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is
hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the Loans, pursuant to this
Section 3.01 to execute and deliver, on behalf of all Interested Parties, or any
of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial
or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect
to the Loans and the related collateral but solely to the extent such release or
discharge is expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of the Basic Documents.
The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence in the name of the Owner of such
Loan or, to the extent necessary, in its own name, a legal proceeding to enforce
a Defaulted Equipment Loan as contemplated by Section 3.04, to enforce all
obligations of ALS and ALER, in its capacity as the Transferor or otherwise,
under each of the Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or
to commence or participate in a legal proceeding (including a bankruptcy
proceeding) relating to or involving a Loan or a Defaulted Equipment Loan. If
the Servicer commences or participates in such a legal proceeding in its own
name (which any successor Servicer shall not be permitted to do, it being
understood that in no event will any successor Servicer take any action
hereunder in its own name, including, without limitation, setting up accounts or
directing Obligors to make payments to it or in its name), the Owner of such
Loan shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such Loan to the
Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in any such
proceeding as a party or claimant, the Servicer is hereby authorized and
empowered by the Owner of a Loan to execute and deliver in the Servicer's name
any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits, all instruments
of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge or
other documents or instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner
of Loans, upon the written request of the initial Servicer, shall furnish the
Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents and take any other
steps which the Servicer may deem necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement. Except to the extent required by the preceding two sentences, the
authority and rights granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the retention by
the Owner of a Loan of equivalent authority and rights. If in any proceeding it
is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Loan on the grounds that it is not a
real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Loan, the applicable
Trustee shall, at the Servicer's specific written direction and expense, take
such steps as shall be reasonably required to enforce the Loan, including
bringing suit in the name of such Person.

          SECTION 3.02 Collection of Loan Payments. The Servicer shall make
reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Loans as and when the same shall become due, and shall follow
the Loan Servicing Standards. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Servicer shall release the
Equipment or other collateral securing a Loan from the lien of the Indenture
unless the outstanding Loan Balance, if any, of such Loan has been deposited
into the Equipment Collection Account, except (x) upon substitution of
Substitute Loans, (y) substitution

                                       11

<PAGE>

of equivalent Equipment or other collateral (such substitution shall not reduce
the Obligor's payment obligations under such Loan) or (z) the foreclosure and
sale of collateral or final settlement or compromise of a Defaulted Equipment
Loan in which case the proceeds of such foreclosure, sale, or final settlement
or compromise shall be deposited into the Collection Account as required under
the Basic Documents. Subject to the limitations in subsection 3.07(c), the
Servicer is hereby authorized to (i) grant extensions, rebates or adjustments on
a Loan without the prior consent of the Owner or the Control Party, and (ii)
consent to the assignment or assumption, including the release of the existing
Obligor in connection therewith, without the prior consent of the Owner or the
Control Party, provided that (x) after giving effect to such extension, rebate
or adjustment, the Equipment Loan Borrowing Base would not be less than the then
Aggregate Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance, (y) with respect to any such
assignment or assumption (other than the assignment or assumption of a Defaulted
Equipment Loan) after giving effect to such assignment or assumption, the new
Obligor and Eligible Loan would satisfy all of the criteria set forth in the
definition of Eligible Equipment Loan applicable to Obligors and (z) such Loan,
after any such extension, rebate or adjustment, meets the definition of an
Eligible Equipment Loan; provided, further, that subject to preceding clauses
(x), (y) and (z) and Section 3.07(c), any successor Servicer (other than an
affiliate of ALS) shall be authorized to grant extensions, rebates or
adjustments without the consent of the Control Party only to the extent it
determines that such action is reasonably likely to prevent a payment event of
default by the Obligor. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive
any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other fees that may be
collected in the ordinary course of servicing such Loan; provided, however, that
once the Servicer waives such fees, then such fee cannot be collected from the
Designated Accounts, the Loan Lockbox Account or any other source. To the extent
provided for in any Loan, the Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect
all payments with respect to amounts due for maintenance, taxes or assessments
on the Equipment or the Loans and shall remit such amounts to the appropriate
maintenance provider or Governmental Authority on or prior to the date such
payments are due.

          SECTION 3.03 Prepayments. The Servicer may accept the prepayment in
part or in full of a Loan; provided, that in the event of Full Prepayment, the
Servicer may consent to such Full Prepayment only if the amount thereof
deposited into the Collection Account in connection with such prepayment is not
less than the then Loan Balance of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, such
Loan and all other amounts due and payable in connection therewith other than
fees and charges that would otherwise be payable to the Servicer pursuant to
Section 8.2(c)(1) or Section 8.2(f)(1) of the Indenture, and provided further,
that in the event of a Prepayment in part, the outstanding Loan Balance of such
Loan is not reduced by more than the amount of such Prepayment allocable to the
payment of principal pursuant to Section 3.11.

          SECTION 3.04 Realization Upon Defaulted Equipment Loans. The Servicer
shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with the Loan Servicing Standards, to
repossess, remarket or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of each item
of Equipment and other collateral that it has reasonably determined should be
repossessed or otherwise converted following a default under the Loan secured by
each such item of Equipment and other collateral. The Servicer is authorized to
follow such practices, policies and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
advisable and as shall be in accordance with the Loan Servicing Standards to
realize upon or obtain benefits of any proceeds from any Insurance Policies and
proceeds from any Guaranties, in each case with respect to the Loans, selling
the related Equipment and other

                                       12

<PAGE>

collateral at public or private sale or sales and other actions by the Servicer
in order to realize upon such a Loan. The foregoing is subject to the provision
that, in any case in which the Equipment shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or towards the
repossession of such Equipment unless it shall determine in its discretion
consistent with the Loan Servicing Standards that such repair and/or
repossession shall likely increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related
Loan by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. The Servicer shall
be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to each Defaulted
Equipment Loan out of amounts that would otherwise comprise Liquidation Proceeds
with respect to the related Loan. The Servicer shall enforce any of the
foregoing rights and remedies described in this Section 3.04 with respect to any
Defaulted Equipment Loans that are cross collateralized by other loan
obligations, in the manner and priority specified in Section 5.1(k) of the
Purchase Agreement. To the extent that an escrow account has been established
by, or on behalf of an Obligor to cover defaults on contracts between such
Obligor and the Originator, amounts in such escrow account shall be applied
against defaults under each such contract in the order that such defaults occur
with respect to any such contract unless otherwise required by law, regulation
or judicial order. The Servicer shall not accelerate any Scheduled Payment
unless permitted to do so by the terms of the Loan or under applicable law.

          SECTION 3.05 Maintenance of Insurance Policies. The Servicer shall,
except as specified in clause (q) of the definition of "Eligible Equipment
Loan", require that each Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance
covering each item of Equipment as of the execution of the related Loan. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with the Loan Servicing Standards, monitor such
physical damage insurance with respect to each item of Equipment that secures
each Loan. The Servicer shall remit to the Collection Account within two
Business Days of receipt all Insurance Proceeds received directly by the
Servicer with respect to any Loan or Equipment subject thereto. Additionally,
the Servicer shall maintain a general liability policy in the amount of at least
$1,000,000 per occurrence and at least $2,000,000 in the aggregate, and an
excess liability insurance policy in umbrella form in the aggregate amount of at
least $5,000,000. All premiums due and payable for the term of the period in
respect of such policies have been paid and shall continue to be paid promptly
as such premiums become due. The Indenture Trustee, the Insurer, the Issuer, the
Transferor and the Noteholders shall at all times while the Notes are
outstanding be named as an additional insured or a primary insured on such
casualty and liability policies maintained by the Servicer.

          SECTION 3.06 Maintenance of Security Interests in Collateral. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with the Loan Servicing Standards and at its own
expense, take such steps as are necessary to maintain in favor of the Indenture
Trustee perfection of the first priority security interest in the Trust Estate
(other than Exempt Collateral) including, without limitation, filings required
because of revisions to the UCC. The Owner of each Loan hereby authorizes the
Servicer to re-perfect such first priority security interest as necessary for
any reason. The Servicer shall file such continuation statements and any other
documents reasonably requested by the Indenture Trustee or which may be required
by law to fully preserve and protect the first priority perfected security
interest of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Beneficiaries in and to the
Trust Estate other than Exempt Collateral. The Servicer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce the obligations of the Obligors under the
applicable loan documents to remove any Lien on the Trust Estate of which the
Servicer has actual knowledge or reason to

                                       13

<PAGE>

have knowledge pursuant to the performance of its obligations as Servicer
hereunder other than the Lien created pursuant to the Indenture.

          SECTION 3.07 Covenants of the Servicer. The Servicer hereby makes the
following covenants on which the Issuer, the Control Party, the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders are relying in connection with the Issuer acquiring
the Loans hereunder and issuing the Securities under the Basic Documents. The
Servicer covenants that from and after the Closing Date:

          (a) Liens in Force. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
the Servicer shall not release in whole or in part any Lien on any collateral
securing any Loan or any Equipment or other collateral from the security
interest securing such related Loan and shall use reasonable efforts not to
permit any Liens to attach to the Trust Estate except those created under the
Indenture.

          (b) No Impairment. The Servicer shall not impair the rights of the
Issuer, the Insurer or any Interested Party in and to any Loan and shall take no
action with respect to a Loan which at the time the Servicer reasonably believes
would be contrary to the maximization of the ultimate repayment on such Loan.

          (c) No Modifications. The Servicer shall not (i) amend or otherwise
modify or grant rebates or adjustments on any Loan such that (A) the Loan
Balance is decreased, (B) after such amendment, modification, rebate or
adjustment, the Equipment Loan Borrowing Base would be less than the Aggregate
Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance, (C) the Loan no longer meets the
definition of Eligible Equipment Loan or (ii) grant any extension with respect
to, or amend, any Scheduled Payment to extend or delay any payments of principal
on any Loan which modification or amendment would extend the due date for the
final Scheduled Payment on such Loan beyond six (6) months prior to the
Scheduled Final Maturity Date. Except as accounted for under clause (o) of the
definition of "Excess Loan Concentration Amount", the Servicer shall not amend
or otherwise modify any Loan more than once after its applicable Cutoff Date.

          (d) Contract Management System. The Servicer will, at its own cost and
expense, (A) retain the Contract Management System, or an alternative system of
equal capability, used by the Servicer as a master record of the Loans and
Receivables and (B) mark the Contract Management System to the effect that the
Loans and Receivables listed thereon have been conveyed to the Issuer pursuant
to this Agreement and pledged by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture to the
Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Beneficiaries.

          The Servicer will maintain accounts and records as to each Loan and
Receivable serviced by the Servicer that are accurate and sufficiently detailed
to permit (i) the reader thereof to know as of the most recent Determination
Date the status of such Loan or Receivable, including payments and recoveries
made and payments owing (and the nature of each), and (ii) reconciliation
between payments or recoveries on (or with respect to) each Loan and Receivable
and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Collection Account in respect
of such Loan or Receivable.

                                       14

<PAGE>

          (e) Compliance with Law. The Servicer will comply, in all material
respects, with all acts, rules, regulations, orders, decrees and directions of
any Governmental Authority applicable to the Loans, the Receivables and the
Equipment or any part thereof; provided, however, that the Servicer may contest
any act, regulation, order, decree or direction in any reasonable manner that
shall not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Noteholders or the
Insurer in the Trust Estate; and provided, further, that such contests shall be
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall not subject the Insurer or
the Indenture Trustee to any civil or criminal liability or risk of loss of any
collateral.

          (f) Obligations with Respect to Loans and Receivables. The Loans and
Receivables shall impose no material obligation on the Originator or any
successor or assignee. Without limiting the foregoing, as more specifically set
forth in this Agreement, in performing its servicing duties hereunder, the
Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standards, collect all payments
required to be made by the Obligors under the Loans and Receivables and enforce
all material rights of the Issuer under the Loans and Receivables. The Servicer
shall not assign, sell, pledge, or exchange, or in any way encumber or otherwise
dispose of the Equipment or other collateral securing the Loans, except as
expressly permitted under this Agreement and the Indenture.

          (g) No Ownership Interest. The Servicer does not have any ownership
interest in the Trust Estate and, except for the purposes of commencing a
collection proceeding against an Obligor as provided in Section 3.01 hereof,
will not assert any ownership interest in the Trust Estate.

          (h) Collection Policies and Procedures. The Servicer shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Control Party, amend, modify or
otherwise change its Credit and Collection Policies in any manner unless such
amendment, modification or change (i) applies generally to all contracts, loans
or receivables serviced by the Servicer (and not just to Loans or Receivables in
the Trust Estate) and (ii) would not materially and adversely affect the Trust
Estate or the ability of the Servicer to collect the Loans or Receivables or the
minimum required credit quality of the Loans or Receivables consistent with the
underwriting criteria of ALS in the ordinary course of business. The Servicer
shall provide at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Control Party (with a copy to the initial Noteholders) of any proposed material
change to the Credit and Collection Policy.

          (i) Financial Condition Covenants. For so long as any payments of
principal or interest remain outstanding on the Notes or any other amounts are
owed to any Beneficiary, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee under the Basic
Documents, the Servicer shall, so long as ALS, any Affiliate thereof or any
successor thereto pursuant to Section 8.02 is the Servicer, maintain the
following financial ratios (the "Financial Condition Covenants") as specified in
this Section 3.07. The Servicer shall not permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
as at the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the
Servicer ending with any fiscal year or quarter, as applicable, set forth below
to exceed the ratio set forth below opposite such fiscal year or quarter, as
applicable, under the column entitled "Consolidated Leverage Ratio":

and each Fiscal Quarter thereafter       2.25 to 1.00

          SECTION 3.08 Servicer's Purchase of Loans or Payments in Respect of
Receivables Upon Breach of Covenant. (a) Upon discovery by any of the Control
Party, the Issuer, the Transferor, the Servicer or any party under the Transfer
and Servicing Agreements of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
Section 3.06 or Section 3.07(a), (b) or (c), the party discovering such breach
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other Persons set forth above.
Unless such breach shall have been waived by the Control Party or cured in all
material respects, the Servicer shall purchase from the Owner thereof any Loan
affected by such breach by depositing the Administrative Purchase Payment in the
Loan Collection Account by not later than the Determination Date immediately
following the second Accounting Date after receipt of notice of such breach. It
is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any
Loan with respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall,
if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the Servicer
for such breach available to the Transferor or any Interested Party so long as
the cumulative sum of the then Principal Balance of all Loans shall not exceed
4% of the sum of the Loan Balances of all Loans sold to the Trust on or after
the Closing Date. Should the Servicer's cumulative repurchases exceed the 4%
threshold described in the foregoing sentence, then the Transferor, the Control
Party or any Interested Party shall be entitled to exercise any rights to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee shall have no affirmative duty to conduct any investigation as
to the occurrence of any event requiring the repurchase of any Loan pursuant to
this Section 3.08.

          (b)  If on any Business Day, either of the following conditions shall
apply:

                    (A) the Servicer shall have breached its covenants set forth
               in Section 4.03(a) (no impairment) with respect to any Receivable
               that was an Eligible Receivable on the Purchase Date on which it
               was transferred by the Originator to the Transferor;

                    (B) the Servicer shall have breached its covenants set forth
               in Section 4.03(b) (limited modifications) with respect to any
               Receivable

                                       17

<PAGE>

               that was an Eligible Receivable on the Purchase Date on which it
               was transferred by the Originator to the Transferor.

then, in either such instance, the Issuer shall be entitled to a credit (such
credit, a "Servicer Modification Credit") in an amount equal to (i) in the case
of clause (A) above, the Unpaid Balance on such Business Day of such
non-conforming Receivable, and (ii) in the case of clause (B) above, the full
amount of such reduction, setoff or cancellation in the Unpaid Balance of such
Receivable (the applicable amount set forth in clause (i) or (ii), the "Servicer
Modification Credit Amount"). On each Purchase Date with respect to Receivables
and for so long as the Servicer is the sole owner of the Tranferor, the Servicer
Modification Credit Amount, if any, shall be reduced by the amount of the
capital contributions made pursuant to Section 2.12(a)(ii) of the Purchase
Agreement and not previously applied to the Servicer Modification Credit
Amounts. The Servicer may, at its option, at any time prior to the Conversion
Date elect to remedy the events described in clause (A) or (B) above by
remitting to the Issuer cash in an amount equal to the unpaid Servicer
Modification Credit Amount.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall remit to the Issuer:
(x) on the Conversion Date cash in an amount equal to the sum of all then unpaid
Servicer Modification Credit Amounts calculated as of the Conversion Date and
(y) on each Business Day after the Conversion Date, cash in an amount equal to
all unpaid Servicer Modification Credit Amounts that result from events or
conditions that occur or exist (or are discovered) subsequent to the Conversion
Date.

          SECTION 3.09 Servicing Fees; Payment of Certain Expenses by Servicer.
The Servicer is entitled to receive the Servicing Fee out of Collections (to the
extent not waived by the Servicer) in respect of the Trust Estate as provided in
Section 8.2 of the Indenture. Subject to any limitations on the Servicer's
liability hereunder or as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Servicer
shall be required to pay from its own funds all expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement (including fees and
disbursements of the Issuer, any trustees and independent accountants, taxes
imposed on the Servicer, expenses incurred in connection with distributions and
reports to the Beneficiaries and the Registered Owners the fees of the Indenture
Trustee, the Back-up Servicer, the Custodian and the Lockbox Bank, and all other
fees and expenses not expressly stated under this Agreement to be for the
account of the Beneficiaries and the Registered Owners, but excluding federal,
state and local income and franchise taxes, if any, of the Issuer, the
Beneficiaries and the Registered Owners).

          SECTION 3.10 Servicer's Certificate. Not later than 11:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on each Determination Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the initial Noteholders, the Control Party and
the Rating Agencies a Servicer's Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit D hereto with respect to the immediately preceding Monthly Period
executed by the President or any of the Vice President/Controller, the Vice
President/Chief Financial Officer or the Treasurer of the initial Servicer or by
an appropriate officer of any successor Servicer (or, if such Servicer's
Certificate is delivered electronically, such Servicer's Certificate shall be
deemed for all purposes to have been certified by the Chief Financial Officer or
similar officer), containing all information necessary to each such party for
making the calculations, withdrawals, deposits, transfers and distributions
required by Section 5.06 of this Agreement and Section 8.2 of the Indenture, all
information required to

                                       18

<PAGE>

be provided to Registered Owners, the Insurer and Noteholders under Section
5.08(a) and the net amount of Servicer Modification Credits. Loans to be
purchased by the Servicer under Section 3.08 hereof or to be repurchased by the
Transferor or Originator under Section 2.12 hereunder or by ALS under the
Purchase Agreement as of the last day of any Monthly Period shall be identified
by Loan number (as set forth in the Schedule of Loans). With respect to any
Loans for which the Transferor, the Originator or ALS becomes the Owner, the
Servicer shall deliver to the Transferor, the Originator or ALS such accountings
relating to such Loans and the actions of the Servicer with respect thereto as
the Transferor, the Originator or ALS may reasonably request and at the expense
of the requesting party.

          SECTION 3.11 Application of Collections. For the purposes of this
Agreement, as of each Accounting Date, all payments by, or on behalf of, an
Obligor received during a Monthly Period with respect to a Loan shall be applied
by the Servicer (i) first, to any unpaid Scheduled Payment for any prior Monthly
Period with respect to such Loan, (ii) second, to the Scheduled Payment for such
Monthly Period with respect to such Loan, (iii) third, to the payment of any
late fees, rewrite charges, and other related fees with respect to such Loan and
(iv) fourth, the remainder shall constitute, with respect to such Loan, a
Prepayment of principal of the Loan.

          SECTION 3.12 Power of Attorney. The Servicer (other than a successor
Servicer) and the Originator each irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Indenture Trustee, with full power of substitution, as their true and lawful
attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and
stead of the Servicer or the Originator, as applicable, and in the name of the
Servicer or the Originator, as applicable, or in its own name, for purposes of
taking any and all appropriate action and executing any and all documents and
instruments which may be necessary to accomplish either of the following:

          (a) so long as an Event of Default, Rapid Amortization Event or
Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing, at any time, for the purpose of
carrying out the terms of this Agreement in the name of the Servicer or its own
name, or otherwise, to take possession of and indorse and collect any checks,
drafts, notes, acceptances or other instrument, general intangible or contract
or with respect to any other collateral and to file any claim or to take any
other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed
appropriate by the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer for the purpose of
collecting any and all such monies due under any account, instrument, general
intangible or contract with respect to the Trust Estate; and

          (b) whether or not an Event of Default, Rapid Amortization Event or
Servicer Default has occurred or is continuing, execute and deliver any and all
agreements, instruments, documents and papers (including, without limitation,
UCC Financing Statements) as the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer may reasonably
request to perfect the Indenture Trustee's security interest in the Trust Estate
(other than Exempt Collateral).

          SECTION 3.13 Back-up Servicer. The Servicer shall retain a back-up
servicer (the "Back-up Servicer") designated by the Control Party, which is
reasonably acceptable to the Servicer to be the Back-up Servicer for the
Equipment Loans and Receivables, who will agree to perform the services set
forth in Exhibit C pursuant to terms and conditions acceptable to the Control
Party. The initial Back-up Servicer shall be BNY Asset Solutions LLC

                                       19

<PAGE>

and the Control Party hereby agrees that the terms and conditions of the Back-up
Servicing Agreement entered into on the date hereof with BNY Asset Solutions LLC
is acceptable. The Servicer shall on or prior to each Distribution Date send
such Back-up Servicer the information required to be provided pursuant to the
Back-up Servicing Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Back-up Servicer shall
be paid by the Servicer from the Servicing Fee. To the extent the obligations of
the Back-up Servicer as Servicer under this Agreement shall be expressly
modified pursuant to the provisions of its Back-Up Servicing Agreement, such
provisions shall modify the obligations of the Back-up Servicer as Servicer
under this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.14 Schedule of Loans. Servicer shall maintain the Schedule
of Loans, showing all Loans owned by the Issuer and whether those Loans are
Eligible Equipment Loans.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES

          SECTION 4.01 Designation of the Servicer. The servicing, administering
and collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by the Person designated as
the Servicer hereunder from time to time in accordance with this section. ALS is
designated (and agrees to act) as the initial Servicer.

          SECTION 4.02 Duties of the Servicer and Transferor.

          (a) Duties of the Servicer in General. The Servicer shall service the
Receivables and, subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall
have full power and authority, acting alone or through any sub-servicer
permitted hereunder, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing
that it may deem necessary or appropriate. The Indenture Trustee shall execute
and deliver to the Servicer any instruments or documents that are prepared by
the Servicer and stated in an Officer's Certificate to be, and shall furnish the
Servicer with any documents in its possession, necessary or appropriate to
enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing duties. The Servicer shall
manage, service, administer and make Collections on the Receivables with
reasonable care, using no less than that degree of skill and attention that the
Servicer would exercise and apply if it owned such Receivables and consistent
with the Receivables Credit and Collection Policy (collectively the "Receivables
Servicing Standards").

          The Servicer shall take all such actions as the Servicer deems
necessary or appropriate to collect each Receivable, all in accordance with
applicable law and the Receivables Credit and Collection Policy.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the
preceding paragraph and Article VIII, the Servicer or its designee is hereby
authorized and empowered, unless such power and authority is revoked by the
Indenture Trustee on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, (i) to
instruct Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the Designated
Accounts as set forth in this Agreement, (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf
of the Issuer for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, any and all instruments of

                                       20

<PAGE>

satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and
all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables, (iii) to make
any filings, reports, notices, applications and registrations with, and to seek
any consents or authorizations from, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Ontario Securities Commission and any state securities authority on behalf of
the Issuer as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with any federal or
state securities laws or reporting requirements or other laws or regulations,
and (iv) to the extent permitted under, and in compliance with, the Receivables
Credit and Collection Policy and all Applicable Law, to commence or settle
collection proceedings with respect to the Receivables and otherwise to enforce
the rights and interests of the Trust and the Registered Owners and the
Beneficiaries in, to and under the Receivables. If in any proceeding it is held
that the Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the grounds that it is not a
real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Receivable, the
applicable Trustee shall, at the Servicer's specific written direction and
expense, take such steps as shall be reasonably required to enforce the
Receivable, including bringing suit in the name of such Person.

          (b) Identification and Transfer of Collections. The Servicer shall
direct the Lockbox Bank to transfer Collections of Receivables that consist of
cash or cash equivalents to be deposited into the Collection Account pursuant to
the terms and provisions of the Basic Documents.

          (c) [Reserved].

          (d) Documents and Records. At any time when ALS is not Servicer, ALER,
to the extent that it is entitled to do so under the Purchase Agreement, shall,
upon the request of the then-acting Servicer, cause the applicable Transferor to
deliver to Servicer, and Servicer shall hold in trust for ALER and Indenture
Trustee in accordance with their respective interests, all records that evidence
or relate to the Receivables originated by such Transferor and the contracts
related to the Receivables, or that are otherwise necessary or desirable to
collect the Receivables of the applicable Transferor, and Servicer shall make
the same available to the Indenture Trustee at one or more places selected by
Trustee or its designee.

          (e) Identification of Eligible Receivables. The initial Servicer will
include in each Servicer Certificate, and Borrowing Base Certificate information
that shows whether, and to what extent, the Receivables described in such
Servicer Certificate, and Borrowing Base Certificate, as the case may be, are
Eligible Receivables.

          (f) Authorization to Act as Issuer's Agent. Without limiting the
generality of subsection (a), with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer hereby
appoints the Servicer as its agent for the following purposes: (i) specifying
deposit accounts to which payments to the Issuer are to be made, (ii) making
transfers among, and deposits to and withdrawals from, all deposit accounts of
the Issuer for the purposes described in the Basic Documents, and (iii)
arranging payment by the Issuer of all fees, expenses and other amounts payable
by the Issuer pursuant to the Basic Documents. The Issuer irrevocably agrees
that (i) it shall be bound by all actions taken by the Servicer pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and (ii) Indenture Trustee and the banks holding all deposit
accounts of the Issuer are entitled to accept submissions, determinations,
selections, specifications, transfers, deposits and withdrawal requests, and
payments from the Servicer on behalf of the Issuer.

moved to a bank or trust company, the short-term unsecured debt obligations of
which shall have the Required Deposit Rating and which is otherwise acceptable
to the Control Party, or (B) to be moved to the corporate trust department of
the Indenture Trustee.

          (b) Each of the Lockbox Accounts shall at all times be subject to the
respective Lockbox Agreement, and each of the Loan Collection Account,
Receivables Collection Account and the Reserve Account shall at all times be
subject to a control agreement (the "Control Agreement") substantially in the
form of Exhibit E hereto.

          SECTION 6.08 Collections. Notwithstanding the Servicer's notice to
each Obligor pursuant to Section 6.02(b), the Servicer shall remit or shall
cause to be remitted to the Lockbox Accounts, the Loan Collection Account or the
Receivables Collection Account, as applicable, within two (2) Business Days
after receipt all payments by, or on behalf of, the Obligors on the Loans or the
Receivables, including all Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds and proceeds
from any Guaranties, that were received directly by the Servicer, the Issuer or
any of their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that up to Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($300,000) of such payments and proceeds deposited to a lockbox
account associated with another financing facility in a calendar month may be
remitted to the appropriate Collection Account on a later date which is no later
than the last day of the calendar month in which they were received. Until such
amounts are so remitted, the Servicer shall (or shall cause such recipient to)
segregate such payments and hold such payments in trust for Indenture Trustee.
Based upon the amounts set forth in the Servicer's Certificate or the daily
report of the Indenture Trustee delivered pursuant to Section 7.3 of the
Indenture, as the case may be, the Servicer shall direct the Indenture Trustee
to distribute the Available Amounts in the appropriate Collection Accounts (and
the Reserve Account, if applicable) according to the priority of payments set
forth in Section 8.2 of the Indenture.

          SECTION 6.09 Investment Earnings.

          Investment Earnings on the Designated Accounts and any available
Investment Earnings on the Lockbox Accounts shall be deposited in the
corresponding Collection Accounts and shall be deemed to be Available Amounts.

          SECTION 6.10 Servicer Advances. As of each Accounting Date, if the
payments during the related Monthly Period by or on behalf of the Obligor on a
Loan (other than an Administrative Loan, a Warranty Loan or a Defaulted
Equipment Loan) after application under subsection 3.11 shall be less than the
Scheduled Payment then the Servicer may, if in its sole discretion it deems the
shortfall recoverable, but in either event shall not be obligated to, advance
from its own funds any such shortfall (such amounts, a "Servicer Advance"). In
addition, the Servicer shall be required to advance the amount of any fees paid
to the Lockbox Banks by setoff against amounts in the Lockbox Accounts pursuant
to the Lockbox Agreements. The Servicer shall receive Servicer Advance
Reimbursement Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Indenture.

          SECTION 6.11 Additional Deposits. Servicer Advances pursuant to
Section 6.10 and the proceeds of Administrative Purchase Payments and the
Warranty Payments with respect to Administrative Loans and Warranty Loans,
respectively, shall be deposited into the

                                       31

<PAGE>

Collection Accounts. All such deposits with respect to a Monthly Period shall be
made in immediately available funds one Business Day prior to the Distribution
Date related to such Monthly Period.

          SECTION 6.12 Ambac Policy Proceeds. All proceeds with respect to the
Ambac Policy shall be deposited in the Loan Collection Account or Receivables
Collection Account, as the case may be, for distribution to Noteholders as set

Trustee, the Insurer and the Noteholders. The following representations and
warranties are made jointly and severally by each of the Transferor, the
Originator, the Servicer and the Issuer (for purposes of this Section 7.01,

Purchased Assets, to such assets acquired on such date) but shall survive the
sale, transfer and assignment of the Loans to the Issuer and the pledge thereof
to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

          (a) Representations and Warranties as to each Party.

          (i) Organization and Good Standing. Such Party has been duly organized
     and is validly existing as a limited liability company (with respect to the
     Issuer, a Delaware statutory trust) in good standing under the laws of the
     State of Delaware, with power and authority to own its properties and to

     Agreement;

          (ii) Due Qualification. Such Party is duly qualified to do business as
     a foreign limited liability company (with respect to the Issuer, a foreign

     Agreement) requires or shall require such qualification;

          (iii) Power and Authority. Such Party (A) has the power and authority
     to execute and deliver the Basic Documents to which it is a party (as used
     in this Section

     Basic Documents have been duly authorized by such Party by all necessary
     limited liability company (with respect to the Issuer, a statutory trust)
     action;

          (iv) Binding Obligations. The applicable Basic Documents, when duly
     executed and delivered, shall constitute a legal, valid and binding
     obligation of such Party enforceable against such Party in accordance with
     its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
     enforcement of creditors' rights in general and by general principles of
     equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law;

          (v) No Violation. The consummation by such Party of the transactions
     contemplated by the applicable Basic Documents and the fulfillment of the
     terms of such agreements by such Party shall not conflict with, result in
     any breach of any of the terms and provisions of or constitute (with or
     without notice or lapse of time) a default under, the limited liability
     company agreement (with respect to the Issuer, trust agreement) of such
     Party, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Party

     asserting the invalidity of the applicable Basic Documents, any Securities
     issued pursuant thereto and, in the case of the Transferor, the Custodial
     Agreement or the Administration Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the
     issuance of such Securities or the consummation of any of the transactions
     contemplated by the applicable Basic Documents, or (iii) seeking any
     determination or ruling that might materially and adversely affect the
     performance by such Party of its obligations under, or the validity or
     enforceability of, such Securities, under the applicable Basic Documents;
     and

                                       33

<PAGE>

          (vii) Consents and Approvals. No consent or authorization of, filing
     with, notice to or other act by or in respect of any Governmental Authority
     or any other Person is required in connection with the transactions
     contemplated hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance,
     validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Basic
     Documents except as to such consents which have already been obtained prior
     to the Closing Date and filings necessary to perfect the security interests
     of the Indenture Trustee in the Trust Estate.

          (b) Representations and Warranties of the Transferor and Issuer Only.

          (i) Good Title. No Loan or Receivable has been sold, transferred,
     assigned or pledged by the Transferor to any Person other than the Issuer;
     immediately prior to the conveyance of the Loans or Receivables pursuant to
     this Agreement the Transferor had good and marketable (provided that the
     Transferor makes no representation as to the existence of a willing buyer
     of such Loans or Receivables) title thereto, free of any Lien; and, upon
     execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Transferor, the Issuer
     shall have all of the right, title and interest of the Transferor in, to
     and under the Purchased Property transferred thereby free of any Lien;

          (ii) All Filings Made. All filings (including UCC filings) necessary
     in any jurisdiction to give the Issuer a first priority perfected security
     or ownership interest in the Trust Estate (other than Exempt Collateral)
     shall have been made; and

          (iii) Valid Transfer. This Agreement constitutes a valid transfer and
     assignment of the Purchased Property transferred thereby, enforceable
     against creditors of the Transferor.

          (iv) Financial Condition. Each of the Transferor and Issuer is solvent
     and able to pay its debts when due, and is not the subject of any case or
     proceeding, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of debts, winding-up, liquidation,
     dissolution, composition, receivership, trusteeship, custodianship, or any
     other proceeding regarding relief of debtors or enforcement of creditors'
     rights. Neither the Transferor nor the Issuer shall take any action in
     furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence
     in, any of the foregoing cases or proceedings. Neither the Transferor nor
     the Issuer is a defendant in any case, proceeding or other action seeking
     issuance of a writ or warrant of attachment, execution, distraint or
     similar process against all or any part of its assets.

          (v) Place of Business. The principal places of business and chief
     executive office of the Transferor and Issuer and the offices where
     Transferor keeps all of its Loan Files (other than any Collateral Documents
     held by the Custodian) and Receivables Files is located at Shepard Street,
     Ripon, WI 54971-0990.

          (vi) Absence of Event. No event has occurred which materially and
     adversely affects the Transferor's operations or its ability to perform its
     obligations under the Basic Documents to which it is a party.

                                       34

<PAGE>

          (vii) UCC Information. The information set forth on Schedule 7.01
     hereto is true, correct and complete in all material respects.

          (viii) Security Interest Representations.

               (1) In the event that the transfer of the Second Tier Purchased
     Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is held not to constitute a
     "true sale" or "true contribution", this Agreement creates a valid and
     continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the
     Second Tier Purchased Assets in favor of the Issuer, which security
     interest is prior to all other Liens, and is enforceable as such as against
     creditors of and purchasers from the Transferor;

               (2) The Receivables constitute "accounts" within the meaning of
     the applicable UCC. The Equipment Loans constitute "tangible chattel paper"
     within the meaning of the applicable UCC. The Equipment Notes constitute
     "instruments" within the meaning of the applicable UCC. The rights of the
     Transferor under the Purchase Agreement are "general intangibles" under the
     applicable UCC.

               (3) Immediately prior to the conveyance of the Second Tier
     Purchased Assets set forth in this Agreement, the Transferor was the sole
     owner of such Second Tier Purchased Assets and owned and had good and
     marketable title to the Second Tier Purchased Assets, free and clear of any
     Lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person (whether senior, junior or pari
     passu) other than Permitted Adverse Claims; provided, however, that the
     Transferor makes no representation regarding the availability of a willing
     buyer for the Second Tier Purchased Assets;

               (4) The Transferor has caused the filing of all appropriate
     financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
     jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
     interest in the Second Tier Purchased Assets granted to the Issuer and
     assigned to the Indenture Trustee. All financing statements filed against
     the Transferor in favor of the Issuer in connection herewith describing the
     Second Tier Purchased Assets contain a statement to the following effect:
     "A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in this
     financing statement except in favor of the Indenture Trustee will violate
     the rights of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee";

               (5) Other than the security interest granted to the Issuer
     pursuant to this Agreement and assigned to the Indenture Trustee, the
     Transferor has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in
     or otherwise conveyed any of the Second Tier Purchased Assets except as
     permitted hereby. The Transferor has not authorized the filing of, and is
     not aware of, any financing statements or documents of similar import
     against the Transferor that include a description of collateral covering
     the Second Tier Purchased Assets other than any financing statement or
     document of similar import (i) relating to the security interest granted to
     the Issuer and assigned to the Indenture Trustee or (ii) that has been
     terminated. The Transferor is not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings
     against the Transferor;

               (6) The Transferor has received a written acknowledgement from
     the

                                       35

<PAGE>

     Custodian that the Custodian is holding the only original executed
     counterpart of each Equipment Note and the related security agreement on
     behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Indenture Trustee and is subject to
     the Custodian's customary security and safekeeping procedures;

               (7) None of the Equipment Notes or Equipment Loans have any marks
     or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise
     conveyed to any Person other than the Issuer's assignee, the Indenture
     Trustee except as provided in Section 2.09(a); and

               (8) The Transferor has received all necessary consents and
     approvals required by the terms of the Second Tier Purchased Assets to the
     pledge to the Issuer of its interest and rights in such Second Tier
     Purchased Assets hereunder, or the Indenture.

The representations and warranties set forth above shall survive until the
Indenture is terminated in accordance with its terms. Any breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 7.01(b)(viii) above may be
waived upon satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition.

          (ix) Non-Consolidation of Issuer and Transferor. (I) Such Party has
     consistent with the Basic Agreements, been operated in such a manner that
     it shall not be substantively consolidated with the trust estate of any
     other person in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the such Party
     or such other person. Without limiting the foregoing the Issuer has (1)
     conducted its business in its own name, (2) maintained its books, records
     and cash management accounts separate from those of any other person, (3)
     maintained its bank accounts separate from those of any other person, (4)
     maintained separate financial statements of the Transferor, showing its
     assets and liabilities separate and apart from those of any other person,
     (5) paid its own liabilities and expenses only out of its own funds, (6)
     allocated fairly and reasonably any overhead expenses that are shared with
     an Affiliate, (7) held itself out as a separate entity, (8) maintained
     adequate capital in light of its contemplated business operations and (9)
     observed all other appropriate limited liability or trust and other
     organizational formalities including, inter alia, remaining in good
     standing and qualified as a foreign limited liability or trust in each
     jurisdiction and obtaining all necessary licenses and approvals as required
     under Applicable Law.

          (II) Such Party has not (1) held itself out as being liable for the
     debts of any other person, (2) acted other than in its own name and through
     its trustee or its duly authorized officers or agents, (3) engaged in any
     joint activity or transaction of any kind with or for the benefit of any
     Affiliate including any loan to or from or guarantee of the indebtedness of
     any Affiliate, except payment of lawful distributions to its beneficial
     owners or members, (4) commingled its funds or other assets with those of
     any other person, (5) created, incurred, assumed, guaranteed or in any
     manner became liable in respect of any indebtedness (except pursuant to
     this Indenture) other than indemnities, trade payables and expense accruals
     incurred in the ordinary course of its business, (6) entered into a
     transaction with an Affiliate unless such transaction was commercially
     reasonable and on the same terms as would be available in an arm's length
     transaction

                                       36

<PAGE>

     with a person or entity that is not an Affiliate, or (7) taken any other
     action that would be inconsistent with maintaining the separate legal
     identity of such Party.

          (c) Representations and Warranties of the Originator Only.

          (i) Purchase Agreement Representations and Warranties. The
     representations and warranties of the Originator in Section 3.1 of the
     Purchase Agreement are true and correct as of the date when made.

          (ii) Absence of Event. No event has occurred which materially and
     adversely affects the Originator's operations or its ability to perform its
     obligations as Originator under the Basic Documents.

          (iii) Non-Consolidation of ALS. (a) ALS has, consistent with the Basic
     Agreements, been operated in such a manner that it shall not be
     substantively consolidated with the trust estate of either or both of the
     Transferor or the Issuer in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of
     either or both of the Transferor or the Issuer. Without limiting the
     foregoing ALS has (1) maintained its books, records and cash management
     accounts separate from those of either or both of the Transferor or the
     Issuer, (2) maintained its bank accounts separate from those of either or
     both of the Transferor or the Issuer, (3) maintained separate financial
     statements, showing its assets and liabilities separate and apart from
     those of either or both of the Transferor or the Issuer or maintained
     consolidated financial statements that contain a footnote indicating that
     the assets of the Transferor and the Issuer are not available to creditors
     of ALS, (4) paid its own liabilities and expenses of either or both of the
     Transferor or the Issuer, (5) allocated fairly and reasonably any overhead
     expenses that are shared with either or both of the Transferor or the
     Issuer and (6) held itself out as a separate entity from either or both of
     the Transferor or the Issuer.

          (b) ALS has not (1) held itself out as being liable for the debts of
     either or both of the Transferor or the Issuer, (2) acted or conducted its
     business in the name of either or both of the Transferor or the Issuer, (3)
     engaged in any joint activity or transaction of any kind with or for the
     benefit of either or both of the Transferor or the Issuer including any
     loan to or from or guarantee of the indebtedness of any Affiliate, (4)
     commingled its funds or other assets with those of either or both of the
     Transferor or the Issuer, (5) created, incurred, assumed, guaranteed or in
     any manner became liable in respect of any indebtedness of either or both
     of the Transferor or the Issuer, (6) entered into a transaction with either
     or both of the Transferor or the Issuer unless such transaction is
     commercially reasonable and on the same terms as would be available in an
     arm's length transaction with a person or entity that is not an Affiliate,
     (7) conducted its business in the name of either or both of the Transferor
     or the Issuer, or (8) taken any other action that would be inconsistent
     with maintaining the separate legal identity of the either or both of the
     Transferor or the Issuer.

          (c) Representations and Warranties of the Servicer Only. No Servicer
     Default has occurred and no condition exists which, upon the issuance of
     the Notes, would constitute a Servicer Default.

                                       37

          SECTION 7.02 Liability of Transferor. The Transferor shall be liable

Transferor shall be a party, (iii) succeeding to the business of the Transferor,
or (iv) more than 50% of the voting interests of which is owned directly or
indirectly by ALS, which entity in any of the foregoing cases executes an
agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the Transferor under this
Agreement, shall be the successor to the Transferor under this Agreement without
the execution or filing of any document or any further act on the part of any of
the parties to this Agreement; provided that the Transferor shall provide 10
days' prior notice of any merger, consolidation or succession pursuant to this
Section 7.03 to the Rating Agencies and obtain the prior written consent of the
Control Party.

          (b) Until the Outstanding Obligations have been paid in full, the
Transferor shall at all times have two "Independent Managers". The Transferor
hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement it shall not amend the
definition of "Independent Manager" or Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 4.1, 4.2,
4.4, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 9.1 or 9.7 or Schedule 1 of its limited

herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, Securities so owned by or pledged
to the Transferor or such controlling or commonly controlled Person shall have
an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of this Agreement,
without preference, priority or distinction as among all of such Securities.

          (a) The Servicer shall be liable in accordance with this Agreement

following:

          (i) The Servicer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
     Trustee, each Issuer, the Beneficiaries, the Registered Owners and any
     director, officer, employee or agent thereof (and, if ALS or any of its
     Affiliates is no longer the Servicer, then the indemnities in this
     provision shall run) in addition to the foregoing, to the benefit of the
     Agents, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Noteholders and any director,
     officer, employee or agent thereof) from and against any and all costs,
     expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities arising out of or
     resulting from claims by third parties (other than parties to the Basic
     Documents) arising from the servicing of Loans or Receivables or the use,

     the Equipment repossessed) or operation by the Servicer or any Affiliate
     thereof of any item of Equipment or other collateral therefor;

          (ii) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
     Trustee, each Beneficiary, the Registered Owners, the Insurer, the Issuer

     its Affiliates is no longer the Servicer, then indemnities in this
     provision shall run, in addition to the foregoing, to the benefit of the
     Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Noteholders and any director,
     officer, employee or agent thereof) from and against any taxes that may at
     any time be asserted against any such Person with respect to the
     transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including any sales, gross
     receipts, general corporation, tangible personal property, privilege or
     license taxes (but not including any taxes asserted with respect to, and as
     of the date of, the sale of the Loans and the Receivables to the Issuer or
     the issuance and original sale of the Securities, or asserted with respect
     to ownership of the Loans or Receivables, or federal or other income taxes
     arising out of distributions on the Securities, or any fees or other
     compensation payable to any such Person) and costs and expenses in
     defending against the same;

          (iii) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
     Trustee, the Issuer, the Beneficiaries, the Registered Owners and any
     director, officer, employee or agent thereof (and, if ALS or any of its
     Affiliates is no longer the Servicer, then the indemnities in this
     provision shall run, in addition to the foregoing, to the benefit of the
     Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Noteholders and any director,
     officer, employee or agent thereof) from and against any and all costs,
     expenses, losses, claims, damages, and liabilities to the extent that such
     cost, expense, loss, claim, damage, or

                                       39

<PAGE>

     liability arose out of, or was imposed upon such Trustee, the Issuer, the
     Beneficiaries or the Registered Owners through the negligence, willful
     misfeasance or bad faith of the Servicer or any breach or failure by the
     Servicer in the performance of its duties under this Agreement and any
     other Basic Documents or by reason of negligent disregard of its
     obligations and duties or if any of the representations and warranties by
     the Servicer shall be inaccurate as of the date made under any of the Basic
     Documents; and

          (iv) The Servicer (other than the Indenture Trustee in its capacity as
     successor Servicer pursuant to Section 9.02 hereof) shall indemnify, defend
     and hold harmless each Trustee and their respective agents, officers,
     directors and servants, from and against all costs, expenses, losses,
     claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or incurred in connection
     with (x) in the case of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee's
     performance of its duties under the Basic Documents, (y) in the case of the
     Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee's performance of its duties under the
     Basic Documents or (z) the acceptance, administration or performance by, or
     action or inaction of, the applicable Trustee of the trusts and duties
     contained in this Agreement, the Basic Documents, the Indenture (in the
     case of the Indenture Trustee), including the administration of the Trust
     Estate, and the Trust Agreement (in the case of the Owner Trustee),
     including the administration of the Owner Trust Estate, except in each case
     to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability:
     (A) is due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of the
     Person seeking to be indemnified, (B) to the extent otherwise payable to
     the Indenture Trustee, arises from the Indenture Trustee's breach of any of
     its representations or warranties in Section 6.13 of the Indenture or (C)
     to the extent otherwise payable to the Owner Trustee, arises from the Owner
     Trustee's breach of any of its representations or warranties set forth in
     Section 6.6 of the Trust Agreement.

          (b) Indemnification under this Section 8.01 shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement. If the Servicer has made any indemnity payments
pursuant to this Section 8.01 and the recipient thereafter collects any of such
amounts from others, the recipient shall promptly repay such amounts collected
to the Servicer, without interest.

          (c) The Servicer shall pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 8.01
hereof directly to the indemnified Person and such amounts will not be deposited
in the Collection Accounts.

          (d) Indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.01 will include,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of
litigation reasonably incurred.

          (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing indemnification obligations, nothing
in this Section 8.01 shall be intended by the parties to constitute a guaranty
by the Servicer of repayment of the Loans.

          SECTION 8.02 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the
Obligations of, the Servicer. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, without the

                                       40

<PAGE>

consent of the Control Party or any other person, (a) the Servicer may
consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets and (b) any
entity (i) into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, (ii) resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a
party, (iii) succeeding to the business of the Servicer, or (iv) more than 50%
of the voting interests of which is owned directly or indirectly by ALS and
which is otherwise servicing the Transferor's loans, which corporation or other
entity in any of the foregoing cases executes an agreement of assumption
reasonably satisfactory to the Insurer and Indenture Trustee to perform every
obligation of the Servicer under this Agreement shall be the successor to the
Servicer under this Agreement without the further execution or filing of any
paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties to this Agreement;
provided, however, that immediately after giving effect thereto, there shall be
no Servicer Default. In the event that the requirements in the proviso of the
preceding sentence are not satisfied, such transaction shall require the Control
Party's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Pursuant to this
Section 8.02, the Servicer shall provide the Control Party and the Rating
Agencies at least thirty days' prior written notice of any merger, consolidation
or succession and a copy of the agreement of assumption in respect of such
merger, consolidation or succession, the pro forma financial calculations
supporting the successor entity's compliance with the financial covenants
specified in Section 3.07(i), if applicable, and such other additional
information as the Control Party shall reasonably request. It is understood that
nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be construed to limit or otherwise impair the
ability of the Transferor or any Interested Party to enforce such remedies as
are available to them under the Basic Documents.

          SECTION 8.03 Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.

          (a) Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or
employees or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Issuer
or the Noteholders, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to the
Basic Documents or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this
provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such Person against any
liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence (negligence, in the case of the initial Servicer) in
the performance of duties or by reason of reckless (negligent, in the case of
the initial Servicer) disregard of obligations and duties under the Basic
Documents. The Servicer and any director, officer or employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on the advice of counsel or on any document of
any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting
any matters arising under this Agreement.

          (b) [Reserved.]

          (c) Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be
under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is
not incidental to its duties to service the Loans or Receivables in accordance
with this Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement and the interests of the
Beneficiaries and the Registered Owners under this Agreement and the
Beneficiaries under the Indenture and the interests of the Registered Owners
under the Trust Agreement. In such event, the reasonable

                                       41

<PAGE>

legal expenses and costs for such action and any liability resulting therefrom
that is not incidental to its duties to service the Loans or Receivables in
accordance with this Agreement shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the
Issuer and the Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor.

          (d) The Indenture Trustee shall distribute out of the Collection
Accounts on a Distribution Date any amounts permitted for reimbursement pursuant
to subsection 8.03(c) which have not been previously reimbursed in accordance
with Section 8.2 of the Indenture; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee
shall not distribute such amounts if the amount on deposit in the Reserve
Account (after giving effect to all deposits and withdrawals pursuant to Section
8.2 of the Indenture) is greater than zero but less than the Reserve Account
Required Amount for such Distribution Date.

          SECTION 8.04 Delegation of Duties. So long as ALS acts as Servicer,
the Servicer may, at any time without notice or consent, delegate any duties
under this Agreement to any other entity more than 50% of the voting stock of
which is owned, directly or indirectly, by ALS. The Servicer may at any time
perform specific duties as Servicer through sub-contractors who are in the
business of servicing stand alone commercial laundry equipment loans; provided,
however, that (i) Servicer shall not delegate to any such sub-contractor any
material portion of such servicing duties without the Control Party's consent,
and (ii) no such delegation shall relieve the Servicer of its responsibility
with respect to such duties.

          SECTION 8.05 Servicer Not to Resign. Subject to the provisions of
Section 9.02, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
imposed on it by this Agreement as Servicer without the consent of the Control
Party, except upon determination that the performance of its duties under this
Agreement is no longer permissible under applicable law. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel to such effect delivered to each Trustee and the Control Party and the
Rating Agencies (with a copy to the initial Noteholders). No such resignation
shall become effective until the Indenture Trustee or a successor Servicer
acceptable to the Control Party shall have assumed the responsibilities and
obligations of the Servicer in accordance with Section 9.02.

                                   ARTICLE IX

          SECTION 9.02 Consequences of a Servicer Default.

          (a) If a Servicer Default shall occur and be continuing (and has not
been waived in writing by the Control Party), the Control Party by notice then
given in writing to the Servicer and the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture
Trustee if given by the Noteholders) may, in addition to other rights and
remedies available in a court of law or equity to damages, injunctive relief and
specific performance, elect to waive such Servicer Default or direct the
Indenture Trustee to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer
as Servicer under this Agreement (provided that a termination shall occur
without notice upon a Servicer Default under Section 9.01(c) or (d)). On or
after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Securities, the Loans or Receivables or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested
in the Indenture Trustee and any successor Servicer pursuant to and under
Section 9.03. The Indenture Trustee and any successor Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of the Loans and related

                                       44

<PAGE>

documents, or otherwise. The predecessor Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
Indenture Trustee and any successor Servicer in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement, including the
transfer to either Trustee for administration by it of all cash amounts that
shall at the time be held by the Servicer for deposit, or that shall have been
deposited by the Servicer in the Lockbox Accounts, the Collection Accounts, the
Reserve Account or thereafter received with respect to the Loans and the
Receivables that shall at that time be held by the Servicer, and will provide
the Indenture Trustee and any successor Servicer reasonable access to the
servicing systems and records with respect to the Loans and the Receivables. In
addition to any other amounts that are then payable to the predecessor Servicer
under this Agreement, the predecessor Servicer shall be entitled to receive from
the successor Servicer the portions of any Servicer Advance Reimbursement Amount
which relates to any Servicer Advance made by the terminated Servicer. To assist
the successor Servicer in enforcing all rights under the Loans and the
Receivables, the predecessor Servicer, at its own expense, shall transfer its
electronic records relating to such Loans and Receivables to the successor
Servicer in such electronic form as is then-maintained by the predecessor
Servicer in the ordinary course of its business and shall transfer the related
Loan Files and all other records, correspondence and documents relating to the
Loans and Receivables that it may possess to the successor Servicer in the
manner and at such times as the successor Servicer shall reasonably request.

          (b) Following the occurrence of a Servicer Default, but without
limiting the rights of the Indenture Trustee or the Control Party under any
other provisions of the Basic Documents, the Control Party may direct the
Indenture Trustee to conduct a review of the Servicer's cash application
procedures with respect to Collections on the Loans and Receivables, including,
without limitation, transfers from the Lockbox Accounts to the Collection
Accounts, and the Indenture Trustee hereby agrees to conduct such review, or
cause a third party to conduct such review, at the expense of the Servicer, on
such basis as the Control Party shall reasonably determine.

          SECTION 9.03 Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. On
and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 9.02 unless and until the Control Party has designated a successor
Servicer, which has accepted such appointment, the Back-up Servicer shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this
Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for in this Agreement, and
shall be subject to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions
of this Agreement; provided, however, that the predecessor Servicer shall remain
liable for, and the successor Servicer shall have no liability for, any
indemnification obligations of the Servicer arising as a result of acts,
omissions or occurrences during the period in which the predecessor Servicer was
the Servicer; and provided, further, that ALS shall remain liable for the
indemnification obligations of the Servicer under subsections 8.01(ii) and (iv)
of this Agreement without regard to whether it is still Servicer hereunder.
Servicer shall be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party with respect
to claims against a replacement Servicer. As compensation therefor, the
Indenture Trustee or a successor Servicer designated by the Control Party shall
be entitled to reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in the transfer and
conversion of the electronic records relating to the Loans and the Receivables
received from the predecessor Servicer, together with such compensation (whether
payable out of the Collection Accounts or otherwise) as the Servicer would have
been entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of termination

                                       45

<PAGE>

had been given including, but not limited to, the Servicing Fee. In the event
the Indenture Trustee becomes the successor Servicer, it hereby reserves the
right to terminate any then-existing sub-servicing agreements as may be entered
into pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof. Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture
Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally
unable so to act, appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint, a successor (i) having a net worth of not less than $10,000,000, (ii)
acceptable to the Control Party and (iii) whose regular business includes the
servicing of equipment loans, as the successor to the Servicer under this
Agreement in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties
or liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement. In connection with such
appointment and assumption, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor out of payments on Loans and Receivables as
it and such successor shall agree, subject to the consent of the Control Party;
provided, that if a successor Servicer is appointed and assumes the duties of
successor Servicer hereunder, the Servicing Fee Rate used to calculate the
Servicing Fee payable to the successor Servicer shall be a rate agreed upon by
such successor Servicer and the person or group appointing it hereunder but not
in excess of 1.0% unless the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied. The
Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent with
this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession. No
removal or resignation of the Servicer shall (other than under Section 9.02(a)
with respect to a Servicer Default under Section 9.01(c) or (d)) become
effective until the Indenture Trustee, the Back-up Servicer under Section 3.13
or another successor Servicer acceptable to the Control Party shall have assumed
the Servicer's responsibilities and obligations in accordance with this Section
9.03.

          SECTION 9.04 Notification to the Beneficiaries and the
Certificateholders. Upon any termination of, or appointment of a successor to,
the Servicer pursuant to this Article IX, the Indenture Trustee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Noteholders, the Insurer and the Rating
Agencies, and the Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Certificateholders.

          SECTION 9.05 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Control Party may, on behalf
of all Beneficiaries and Registered Owners, waive any default by the Servicer in
the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences, including a
default in making any required deposits to or payments from any of the accounts
in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such
default shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Default arising therefrom shall
be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

          SECTION 9.06 Effects of Termination or Resignation of Servicer.

          (a) Upon the appointment of the successor Servicer, the predecessor
Servicer shall immediately remit any Scheduled Payments, Liquidation Proceeds or
other payments that it may receive pursuant to any Loan or Receivable or
otherwise to the successor Servicer for the benefit of the Issuer after such
date of appointment.

          (b) After the termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section 9.02 or
resignation pursuant to Section 8.05 (except as otherwise provided in Section
8.05 or 9.03), the predecessor Servicer shall have no further rights or
obligations with respect to the management

                                       46

<PAGE>

or servicing of the Trust Estate or the enforcement, custody or collection of
the Loans or Receivables, and the successor Servicer shall have all of such
obligations, except that the predecessor Servicer will transmit or cause to be
transmitted directly to the relevant Designated Account, promptly upon receipt
and in the same form in which received, any amounts held by the predecessor
Servicer (properly endorsed where required for the successor Servicer to collect
them) received as payments upon or otherwise in connection with the Loans or
Receivables. The predecessor Servicer's indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 8.01 hereof will survive the termination or resignation of the
predecessor Servicer but will not extend to any acts or omissions of a successor
Servicer.

                                    ARTICLE X

                             TERMINATION; REDEMPTION

          SECTION 10.01 Optional Purchase of Equipment Loans and Receivables. If
at any time after the Conversion Date, the Aggregate Loan Balance of the Loans
held by the Trust is 10% or less of the Aggregate Loan Balance on such
Conversion Date, the Servicer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to
purchase for cash the Equipment Loans and related assets and Receivables at a
price equal to the aggregate Administrative Purchase Payments for all Loans
(including Defaulted Equipment Loans) plus the appraised value of the
Receivables and such other related assets held by the Trust (less the
Liquidation Expenses to be incurred in connection with the recovery thereof
(excluding the Receivables and related assets)), such value to be determined by
an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the Servicer, each Trustee and the Control
Party (the "Optional Purchase Price"); provided, however, that the Servicer may
not exercise its option if the Optional Purchase Price would be less than the
sum of (i) the Redemption Price, (ii) all administrative expenses, operating
costs and amounts to third parties due as of such Distribution Date, and (iii)
all Reimbursement Amounts due to the Insurer, if any. In the event the Servicer
elects to exercise its option, the Issuer shall redeem the Equipment Notes and
the Receivables Notes in accordance with this Section 10.01 effective as of such
date of purchase. The Issuer shall be required to notify the Indenture Trustee
and the Control Party in writing by no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to a notice required to be sent by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
11.1(a) of the Indenture, and return the cancelled Ambac Policy to the Insurer
once all of the preceding amounts have been paid in full. To exercise such
option, the Servicer shall deposit in the Loan Collection Account an amount
equal to the Optional Purchase Price.

          SECTION 10.02 Termination of the Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by

          (a) This Agreement may be amended by the Transferor, the Servicer and
the Issuer with the consent of the Indenture Trustee and the Control Party, but

the interests of the Noteholders.

          (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), this Agreement may also be amended
from time to time by the Transferor, the Servicer and the Issuer with the
consent of the Control Party for the purpose of adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement,
or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders, and any provisions
hereof may be waived with the consent of the Control Party except that no
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would be prohibited under the
proviso of Section 9.2 of the Indenture if such amendment were to be made to the
Indenture unless the consent that would have been required as described therein,
if such amendment were to be made to the Indenture, shall have been obtained.

          (c) Prior to the execution of any such amendment or consent, the
Indenture Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to the Rating Agencies, the initial Noteholders and the

          (e) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Noteholders
pursuant to subsection 11.01(b) to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance thereof but it shall be necessary to obtain the consent of the
Control Party. The manner of obtaining such consents of the Noteholders (and any
other consents of the Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of
evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by the Noteholders shall
be subject to such reasonable requirements as either Trustee may prescribe.

          (f) The Owner Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into
any such amendment which affects the Owner Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Agreement or otherwise. The Indenture Trustee may, but
shall not be obligated to, execute and deliver any such amendment which affects
the Indenture Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or
otherwise.

          (g) Each of ALS and the Transferor agrees that such Person shall not
amend or agree to any amendment of the Purchase Agreement unless such amendment

11.01 were contained in the Purchase Agreement with the consent of the Control
Party.

          (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the signatures of the Transferor
and the Issuer shall not be required for the effectiveness of any amendment
which modifies the representations, warranties, covenants or responsibilities of
the Servicer at any time when the Servicer is not the Originator or a successor
Servicer is designated pursuant to Section 9.02.

          SECTION 11.02 Protection of Title to Owner Trust Estate.

          (a) The Transferor or the Servicer or both shall execute and file such
financing statements and cause to be executed and filed such continuation and
other statements, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by
law fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of the Beneficiaries,
the Certificateholders and the Trustees under this Agreement in the Loans and
Receivables. The Transferor or the Servicer or both shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to each Trustee and the Insurer file-stamped copies of, or filing
receipts for, any document filed as provided above, as soon as available
following such filing.

          (b) Neither the Transferor nor the Servicer shall change its
jurisdiction of organization, name, identity or corporate structure in any
manner that would, could or might make any financing statement or continuation
statement filed in accordance with paragraph (a) above incorrect or seriously
misleading within the meaning of Section 9-507 of the UCC, unless it shall have
given each Trustee and the Insurer at least 60 days prior written notice thereof
and shall have taken all such actions as may be reasonably requested by the
Trustees or the Insurer or necessary to maintain the perfection and priority of
such Liens of the Trustees.

          (c) Each of the Transferor and the Servicer shall give each Trustee
and the Insurer at least 60 days prior written notice of any relocation of its
principal executive office if, as a result of such relocation, the applicable
provisions of the UCC would require the filing of any amendment of any
previously filed financing or continuation statement or of any new financing
statement. The Servicer shall at all times maintain each office from which it
services Loans and Receivables and its principal executive office within the
United States of America.

          (d) The Servicer shall maintain accounts and records as to each Loan
accurately and in sufficient detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to know at
any time the status of such Loan, including payments and recoveries made and
payments owing (and the nature of each) and extensions of any scheduled payments
made not less than 45 days prior thereto, and (ii) reconciliation between
payments or recoveries on (or with respect to) each Loan and

                                       49

Receivable and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Lockbox Accounts
and the Collection Accounts.

          (e) The Servicer shall maintain its computer systems so that, from and
after the time of sale under this Agreement of the Loans and Receivables to the
Issuer, the Servicer's master computer records (including any back-up archives)
that refer to any Loan or Receivable indicate clearly that the Loan or
Receivable is owned by the Issuer. Indication of the Issuer's ownership of a
Loan or Receivable shall be deleted from or modified on the Servicer's computer
systems when, and only when, the Loan or Receivable has been paid in full,
liquidated or repurchased by the Transferor or purchased by the Servicer.

          (f) If at any time the Transferor or the Servicer proposes to sell,
grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in stand-alone
commercial laundry equipment loans to any prospective purchaser, lender or other
transferee, the Servicer shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or
other transferee computer tapes, records or print-outs (including any restored
from back-up archives) that, if they refer in any manner whatsoever to any Loan,
indicate clearly that such Loan has been sold and is owned by the Issuer unless
such Loan has been paid in full, liquidated or repurchased by the Transferor or
purchased by the Servicer.

          (g) If at any time the Transferor or the Servicer proposes to sell,
grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in trade
receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, the
Servicer shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee
computer tapes, records or print-outs (including any restored from back-up
archives) that, if they refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable,
indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the Issuer
unless such Receivable has been paid in full, liquidated or repurchased by the
Transferor or purchased by the Servicer.

          (h) The Servicer shall permit each Trustee and the Insurer and their
respective agents (at such Person's cost and expense except to the extent such
costs and expenses shall be required to be paid by ALS or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Basic Documents) at any time during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice to inspect, audit and make copies of and
abstracts from the Servicer's records regarding any Loans and Receivables then
or previously included in the Owner Trust Estate.

          (i) The Servicer shall furnish to each Trustee and the Insurer at any
time upon request a list of all Loans and Receivables then held as part of the
Trust including any then-existing amendments, substitutions or replacements
thereto, together with a reconciliation of such list to the Schedule of Loans
and Schedule of Receivables and to each of the Servicer's Certificates furnished
before such request indicating removal of Loans or Receivables from the Trust.
Upon request, the Servicer shall furnish a copy of any such list to the
Transferor. Each Trustee and the Transferor shall hold any such list and the
Schedule of Loans and Schedule of Receivables for examination by interested
parties during normal business hours at their respective offices located at the
