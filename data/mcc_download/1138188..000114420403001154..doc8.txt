<PAGE>

principal  corporate  office or at such other place as Ugomedia may from time to
time  designate  by  written  notice  to  the  Exchangeable  Shareholders,   the
certificates  representing  the  Exchangeable  Shares  which  such  Exchangeable
Shareholder   desires  Ugomedia  to  purchase,   duly  endorsed  in  blank,  and
accompanied by such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect
a transfer of Exchangeable  Shares under applicable law and the by-laws of Sciax
and such additional documents and instruments as Ugomedia may reasonably require
together  with (a) a duly  completed  form of notice of exercise of the Exchange
Right  stating:  (i) that the  Exchangeable  Shareholder  thereby  exercises the
Exchange  Right so as to require  Ugomedia  to purchase  from such  Exchangeable
Shareholder the number of Exchangeable Shares specified therein;  (ii) that such
Exchangeable Shareholder has good title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares
to be acquired by Ugomedia free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances;
(iii) the names in which the  certificates  representing  Ugomedia  Common Stock
issuable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right are to be issued;
and (iv) the names and  addresses  of the persons to whom such new  certificates

certificates  delivered to Ugomedia  are to be  purchased by Ugomedia  under the
Exchange  Right,  then a new  certificate  for the balance of such  Exchangeable
Shares shall be issued to such Exchangeable  Shareholder at the expense of Sciax
and Ugomedia.

2.6  DELIVERY OF UGOMEDIA  COMMON  STOCK;  EFFECT OF  EXERCISE.  Promptly  after
receipt of the  certificates  representing  the  Exchangeable  Shares  which the
Exchangeable  Shareholder desires Ugomedia to purchase under the Exchange Right,
together with such  documents and  instruments  of transfer and a duly completed
form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right and appropriate certificates or
other  assurances in respect of any applicable taxes related to the transaction,
duly  endorsed  for transfer to Ugomedia,  subject to  Withholding  Obligations,
Ugomedia  shall  deliver  or  cause  to be  delivered  to  the  holder  of  such
Exchangeable  Shares (or to such other persons,  if any, properly  designated by
such  Exchangeable  Shareholder),  the  certificates  for the number of Ugomedia
Common Stock  issuable in  connection  with the exercise of the Exchange  Right,
which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and  non-assessable and shall be
free and clear of any lien,  claim or encumbrance,  and cheques for the balance,
if any, of the total  purchase  price  therefor  (less any  amounts  withheld on
account of tax required to be deducted and  withheld  therefrom  and for greater
certainty subject to any Withholding  Obligations);  provided,  however, that no
such  delivery  shall be made  unless  and  until the  Exchangeable  Shareholder
requesting  the same shall have paid (or  provided  evidence of payment  thereof
satisfactory to Sciax and Ugomedia) the taxes,  if any,  payable as contemplated
by  Section  2.8.  Immediately  upon the  giving of  notice by the  Exchangeable
Shareholder  to Ugomedia of the exercise of the Exchange  Right,  as provided in
this Section,  the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale  contemplated
by the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have  occurred,  and the holder of such
Exchangeable  Shares shall be deemed to have  transferred to Ugomedia all of its
right,  title and interest in and to such  Exchangeable  Shares and the Exchange
Right and the Automatic  Exchange Rights attaching thereto and shall cease to be
a holder of such  Exchangeable  Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the  rights of a holder in respect  thereof,  other than the right to receive
his  proportionate  part  of the  total  purchase  price  therefor,  unless  the
requisite  number of  Ugomedia  Common  Stock  (together  with a cheque  for the
balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefor (less any amounts withheld
on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom and for greater

                                       5
<PAGE>

certainty subject to any Withholding  Obligations)) is not allotted,  issued and
delivered  by  Ugomedia  to such  Exchangeable  Shareholder  (or to  such  other
persons, if any, properly designated by such Exchangeable  Shareholder),  within
five  (5)  Business  Days of the  date of the  giving  of  such  notice  by such
Exchangeable  Shareholder,   in  which  case  the  rights  of  the  Exchangeable
Shareholder  shall remain  unaffected  until such  Ugomedia  Common Stock are so
allotted,  issued and  delivered by Ugomedia and any such cheque is so delivered
and paid. Concurrently with such Exchangeable Shareholder ceasing to be a holder
of Exchangeable  Shares,  such Exchangeable  Shareholder shall be considered and
deemed for all purposes to be the holder of Ugomedia  Common Stock  delivered to
it pursuant to the Exchange Right.

2.7 EXERCISE OF EXCHANGE RIGHT  SUBSEQUENT TO  RETRACTION.  In the event that an
Exchangeable  Shareholder has exercised its right under the  Exchangeable  Share
Provisions  to require  Sciax to retract any or all of the  Exchangeable  Shares
held by such Exchangeable  Shareholder (the "RETRACTED  SHARES") and is notified
by Sciax pursuant to the  Exchangeable  Share  Provisions that Sciax will not be
permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to purchase all
such  Retracted  Shares,  and  provided  that Sub shall not have  exercised  the
Retraction  Call  Right  with  respect  to the  Retracted  Shares  and  that the
Exchangeable Shareholder has not revoked the retraction request delivered by the
Exchangeable Shareholder to Sciax pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions,
the retraction  request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute  notice
from the  Exchangeable  Shareholder  to Ugomedia to exercise the Exchange  Right
with respect to those Retracted Shares which Sciax is unable to purchase.

2.8  STAMP OR OTHER  TRANSFER  TAXES.  Upon any sale of  Exchangeable  Shares to
Ugomedia  pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic  Exchange Rights,  the
share  certificate  or  certificates  representing  Ugomedia  Common Stock to be
delivered in connection  with the payment of the total  purchase  price therefor
shall be issued in the name of the Exchangeable  Shareholder of the Exchangeable
Shares so sold or in such names as such  Exchangeable  Shareholder may otherwise
direct  in  writing  without  charge  to  the  Exchangeable  Shareholder  of the
Exchangeable Shares so sold;  provided,  however,  that any delivery of Ugomedia
Common Stock shall be subject to Withholding  Obligations and such  Exchangeable
Shareholder:  (a) shall pay (and neither Ugomedia nor Sciax shall be required to
pay) any documentary,  stamp,  transfer,  withholding or other taxes that may be
payable in respect of any  transfer,  issuance  or  delivery of such shares to a
person other than such Exchangeable Shareholder;  or (b) shall have established,
to the  satisfaction  of Ugomedia and Sciax,  that such taxes, if any, have been
paid. The Shareholder  agrees that Ugomedia,  Sub and Sciax shall be entitled to
rights of withholding in respect of applicable  taxes triggered upon the payment
of a dividend or consideration  otherwise  payable to any holder of Exchangeable
Shares, as more particularly set forth in the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

2.9 NOTICE OF INSOLVENCY EVENT. Immediately upon the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event or any event  which  with the  giving of notice or the  passage of time or
both would be an Insolvency  Event,  Sciax,  Sub and Ugomedia shall give written
notice  thereof to each  Exchangeable  Shareholder,  at the expense of Ugomedia,
which notice shall  contain a brief  statement of the right of the  Exchangeable
Shareholders with respect to the Exchange Right.

          exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Ugomedia or Sub, each holder
          shall be  obligated  to sell all the  Exchangeable  Shares held by the
          holder to Ugomedia or Sub on the  Liquidation  Event Effective Date on
          payment  by  Ugomedia  or Sub  to the  holder  of the  Exchange  Share
          Consideration  representing  the  Liquidation  Call Purchase Price for
          each such share,  subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for
          greater certainty any Withholding Obligations.

     (b)  To exercise the Liquidation  Call Right,  Ugomedia or Sub, as the case
          may be, must notify the holders of Exchangeable  Shares,  and Sciax of
          its  intention  to  exercise  such  right at least 60 days  before the
          Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary  liquidation,  dissolution
          or  winding-up  of Sciax and at least five  Business  Days  before the
          Liquidation   Date  in  the  case  of  an   involuntary   liquidation,
          dissolution  or winding-up of Sciax.  If Ugomedia or Sub exercises the
          Liquidation Call Right, on the Liquidation  Date,  Ugomedia or Sub, as
          the case may be, will  purchase  and the holders  will sell all of the
          Exchangeable  Shares  then  outstanding  for  the  Exchangeable  Share
          Consideration  representing the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price,
          subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for greater certainty
          any Withholding Obligations.

     (c)  Provided that Ugomedia or Sub exercise the  Liquidation  Call Right in
          the manner  described  above, the right of each holder of Exchangeable
          Shares will be limited to receiving such holder's  proportionate share
          of  the  Exchangeable  Share  Consideration   representing  the  total
          Liquidation  Call  Purchase  Price  payable by Ugomedia or Sub without
          interest  (subject  to  applicable  withholding  taxes and for greater
          certainty any Withholding Obligations) upon presentation and surrender
          by the holder of certificates  representing  the  Exchangeable  Shares
          held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the  Liquidation
          Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the
          Ugomedia  Common Stock  delivered to it. Upon surrender to Ugomedia or
          Sub of a certificate or  certificates  representing  the  Exchangeable
          Shares,  together with such other  documents and instruments as may be
          required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and
          the by-laws of Sciax and such additional  documents and instruments as
          Ugomedia or Sub may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered
          certificate or  certificates  shall be entitled to receive in exchange
          therefor,  and  Ugomedia  or Sub shall  transfer to such  holder,  the
          Exchangeable  Share  Consideration  to which the  holder is  entitled,
          subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for greater certainty
          any Withholding Obligations.  If Ugomedia or Sub does not exercise the
          Liquidation   Call  Right  in  the  manner  described  above,  on  the
          Liquidation  Date  the  holders  of the  Exchangeable  Shares  will be
          entitled  to receive  in  exchange  therefor  the  Exchangeable  Share
          Consideration representing the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by
          Sciax in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
          Sciax  pursuant  to Article 5 of the  Exchangeable  Share  Provisions,
          subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for greater certainty
          any Withholding Obligations.

2.12 UGOMEDIA REDEMPTION CALL RIGHT.

     (a)  Ugomedia and Sub shall have the overriding right (the "REDEMPTION CALL
          RIGHT"),  notwithstanding  the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable
          Shares  by Sciax  pursuant  to  Article  7 of the  Exchangeable  Share
          Provisions,  to  purchase  from all,  but not less  than  all,  of the
          holders of Exchangeable Shares on the Automatic Redemption Date (other
          than Ugomedia or any  Affiliate  thereof) all but not less than all of
          the  Exchangeable  Shares  held by each  such  holder  on  payment  by
          Ugomedia  or  Sub to  the  holder  of  the  Exchangeable  Share  Price

                                       9
<PAGE>

          applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Automatic  Redemption
          Date (the "REDEMPTION CALL PURCHASE PRICE"), which as provided in this
          section 2.12, shall be fully paid and satisfied by the transfer of the
          Exchangeable  Share  Consideration  representing  the Redemption  Call
          Purchase Price to the holders of Exchangeable  Shares,  subject to any
          applicable withholding taxes and for greater certainty any Withholding
          Obligations. In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right
          by Ugomedia or Sub,  each holder  shall be  obligated  to sell all the
          Exchangeable  Shares  held by the  holder  to  Ugomedia  or Sub on the
          Automatic  Redemption Date on payment by Ugomedia or Sub to the holder
          of the Exchangeable  Share  Consideration  representing the Redemption
          Call  Purchase  Price for each such share,  subject to any  applicable
          withholding   taxes  and  for  greater   certainty   any   Withholding
          Obligations.

     (b)  To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Ugomedia or Sub must notify the
          Shareholder and Sciax of its intention to exercise such right at least
          60 days  before the  Automatic  Redemption  Date.  If  Ugomedia or Sub
          exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Automatic Redemption Date,
          Ugomedia or Sub will purchase and the Shareholder will sell all of the
          Exchangeable  Shares  then  outstanding  for  the  Exchangeable  Share
          Consideration  representing  the total Redemption Call Purchase Price,
          subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for greater certainty
          any Withholding Obligations.

     (c)  Provided  that Ugomedia or Sub exercise the  Redemption  Call Right in
          the manner described below, on and after the Automatic Redemption Date
          the rights of each  holder of  Exchangeable  Shares will be limited to
          receiving such holder's  proportionate share of the Exchangeable Share
          Consideration  representing  the total  Redemption Call Purchase Price
          payable by Ugomedia or Sub (subject to  applicable  withholding  taxes
          and  for  greater   certainty  any   Withholding   Obligations)   upon
          presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates  representing
          the  Exchangeable  Shares held by such holder and the holder  shall on
          and after the Automatic  Redemption  Date be considered and deemed for
          all purposes to be the holder of the Exchangeable Share  Consideration
          delivered  to such  holder.  Upon  surrender  to  Ugomedia or Sub of a
          certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together
          with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect
          a transfer  of  Exchangeable  Shares  under the Act and the by-laws of
          Sciax and Ugomedia and such  additional  documents and  instruments as
          Ugomedia or Sub may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered
          certificate or  certificates  shall be entitled to receive in exchange
          therefor,  the Exchangeable Share Consideration to which the holder is
          entitled,  subject to any applicable withholding taxes and for greater
          certainty  any  Withholding  Obligations.  If Ugomedia or Sub does not
          exercise the Redemption Call Right in the manner  described  above, on
          the Automatic  Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable  Shares
          will be  entitled  to receive in exchange  therefor  the  Exchangeable
          Share  Consideration   representing  the  Redemption  Price  otherwise
          payable by Sciax in connection with the redemption of the Exchangeable
          Shares  pursuant to Article 7 of the  Exchangeable  Share  Provisions,

                                       10

          subject to any applicable  withholding taxes and for greater certainty
          any Withholding Obligations.

2.13 REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES.  Upon the exchange,  purchase or redemption
of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to any of the provisions of Article 2 hereof
or  pursuant  to  the  Exchangeable   Share  Provisions,   the  holders  of  the
Exchangeable  Shares shall offer for  redemption by Ugomedia 0.25 of a Preferred
Share for every  Exchangeable  Share to be  exchanged,  purchased or redeemed in
accordance thereof,  and Ugomedia hereby agrees to redeem such Preferred Shares,
without any additional  consideration  for such redemption paid to the holder of
the Preferred Shares. The holders of the Exchangeable  Shares shall surrender to
Ugomedia or Sub a certificate or certificates  representing the Preferred Shares
to be redeemed,  together with such other  documents and  instruments  as may be
required  to  effect a  redemption  of  Preferred  Shares  under the Act and the
by-laws of Ugomedia and such additional documents and instruments as Ugomedia or
Sub may reasonably require.

2.14 WARRANTY OF UGOMEDIA.  Ugomedia hereby  represents,  warrants and covenants
that it has reserved for  issuance  and will at all times keep  available,  free
from  pre-emptive and other rights,  out of its authorized and unissued  capital
stock  such  number  of  shares  of  Ugomedia  Common  Stock  as are now and may
hereafter  be  required  to  enable  and  permit  Sciax to meet its  obligations
hereunder,  under the Support Agreement, under the Exchangeable Share Provisions
and under any other security or commitment pursuant to which Ugomedia may now or
hereafter be required to issue shares of Ugomedia Common Stock.

                               UGOMEDIA SUCCESSORS

3.1  UGOMEDIA  REORGANIZATIONS.  Ugomedia  shall not enter into any  transaction
(whether  by  way  of  reconstruction,  reorganization,  consolidation,  merger,
transfer,  sale,  lease or otherwise)  whereby all or  substantially  all of its
undertaking,  property  and assets would become the property of any other person
or, in the case of a merger, of the continuing  corporation  resulting therefrom
unless  (i)  such  other  person  or  continuing  corporation,   (the  "UGOMEDIA
SUCCESSOR"), by operation of law becomes, without an additional act on its part,
bound by the  terms  and  provisions  of this  Agreement  or,  if not so  bound,
executes,   prior  to  or  contemporaneously   with  the  consummation  of  such
transaction an agreement supplemental hereto and such other instruments, if any,
as are  necessary  or  advisable  to evidence  the  assumption  by the  Ugomedia
Successor of all  obligations  of Ugomedia  under this  Agreement  and (ii) such
transactions  shall be upon such terms as  substantially  to preserve and not to
impair in any material respect any of the rights, duties, powers and authorities
of the Exchangeable Shareholders hereunder.

3.2 VESTING OF POWERS IN SUCCESSOR.  Whenever the conditions of Section 3.1 have
been duly observed and performed,  the Ugomedia  Successor,  Sub and Sciax shall
execute the necessary supplemental  agreement, if any is required by Section 3.1

Ugomedia  Successor  shall  possess and from time to time may exercise  each and
every right and power of Ugomedia  under this  Agreement in the name of Ugomedia

                                       11
<PAGE>

or  otherwise  and any act or  proceeding  by any  provision  of this  Agreement
required to be done or  performed  by the board of  directors of Ugomedia or any
officers of Ugomedia may be done and performed with like force and effect by the
directors or officers of such Ugomedia Successor.

3.3 WHOLLY-OWNED  SUBSIDIARIES.  Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing
the  amalgamation or merger of any  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Ugomedia with or
into Ugomedia or the winding up,  liquidation or dissolution of any wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Ugomedia  provided  that all the assets of such  subsidiary  are
transferred  to  Ugomedia or another  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Ugomedia  and
provided  that  such  event  is not in any  way  prejudicial  to the  rights  or
interests  of the  holders of  Exchangeable  Shares and  provided  that any such
transactions are expressly permitted by this Article 3.

                                   ARTICLE 4

4.1 TERM.  This Agreement  shall come into force and be effective as of the date

permitted  event as a result of which either the shares of Ugomedia Common Stock
or the Exchangeable Shares or both are in any way changed,  this Agreement shall
forthwith  be amended and modified as necessary in order that it will apply with

          of each of  Sciax,  Sub and  Ugomedia,  it may be  expedient  to make,
          provided that each such Board of Directors  shall be of the good faith
          opinion that such amendments or modifications  will not be prejudicial
          to the rights or interests of the holders of the Exchangeable  Shares;

          Sciax,  Sub and  Ugomedia,  are  required for the purpose of curing or
          correcting  any  ambiguity  or defect  or  inconsistent  provision  or
          clerical  omission or mistake or  manifest  error,  provided  that the
          Boards of Directors of each of Sciax, Sub and Ugomedia shall be of the
          good  faith  opinion  that such  changes  or  corrections  will not be
