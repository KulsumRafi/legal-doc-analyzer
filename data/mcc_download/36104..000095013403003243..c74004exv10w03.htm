1998 EXECUTIVE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN<BR>
(ADOPTED ORIGINALLY IN DECEMBER 1996<BR>
AND AS AMENDED THROUGH DECEMBER 1998)</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name and Purpose. This Plan was adopted originally by Star Banc Corporation
in December 1996, adopted and amended through December 1998 by its successor,
Firstar Corporation, and assumed by U.S. Bancorp (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) as of
February&nbsp;27, 2001 and shall be known hereafter as the U.S. Bancorp 1998
Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). The purpose of the Plan is to
advance the interests of the Corporation by providing material incentive for
the continued services of directors, advisory directors and key employees and
by attracting able individuals to serve as directors and advisory directors of
the Corporation and by attracting able personnel to employment with the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries. The term &#147;Subsidiary&#148; as used herein means a
subsidiary corporation of the Corporation as the term is defined in Section
424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1986 and 1991 Stock Incentive Plans. The 1986 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1986
Plan) and the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1991 Plan) adopted by the
Corporation&#146;s successor, Star Banc Corporation, are hereby amended and restated
in their entirety so that their terms and conditions match exactly as the terms
and conditions of this Plan, with the exception that the number of shares
authorized under each such Plan and the termination date of each such Plan,
shall remain unchanged. Grants of remaining authorized shares under the 1986
Plan and the 1991 Plan, and administration of awards made under those Plans,
shall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth therein. In the event
of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the 1986 and 1991 Plans, and
those set forth herein, this document shall govern.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation
Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The
Committee shall consist of at least two members of the Board of Directors, each
of whom is a &#147;Non-Employee Director&#148; as defined in Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), as such Rule may be amended from time to time or any
successor rule thereto. To the extent that it is desired that compensation
resulting from the grant of a particular Option be excluded from the deduction
limitation of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the &#147;Code&#148;), all directors comprising the Committee granting such Option also
shall be &#147;outside directors&#148; within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;162(m). The
Committee may establish, subject to the provisions of the Plan, such rules and
regulations as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan,
and make such determinations and take such action in connection therewith, or
in relation to the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable, consistent with the
Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility. Directors of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and
advisory directors of the Regional Advisory Boards established by the
Corporation (collectively, &#147;Directors&#148;), and regular employees of the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries who are key employees, including officers,
whether or not Directors (collectively, &#147;Eligible Employees&#148;) shall be eligible
to participate in the Plan.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The shares to be issued and delivered by the Corporation under the
Plan are the Corporation&#146;s common shares, $0.01 par value, which may be either
authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

issued under the Plan (excluding those previously authorized under the 1986 and
1991 Plans) shall not exceed forty-five million (45,00,000) shares; subject,
however, to the adjustment provided in Paragraph&nbsp;14 in the event of stock
splits, stock dividends, exchanges of shares or the like occurring after the
effective date of this Plan. No option may be granted under this Plan, no
Restricted Shares may be allocated under this Plan and no Performance Awards
payable in common stock can be paid under this Plan which could cause such
maximum limit to be exceeded.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The maximum number of shares with respect to which options may be

respect to such shares shall again be available for issuance in connection with
other options granted under this Plan. Common shares repurchased by the
Corporation as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;12, in respect of which no benefits of
ownership have been received, shall again be available for issuance in
connection with other allocations of Restricted Shares under this Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant of Options. The Committee may from time to time, in its discretion
and subject to the provisions of the Plan, grant options to any or all
Directors and Eligible Employees. With respect to Eligible Employees who are
not subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;16 of the 1934 Act or Section&nbsp;162(m)
of the Code, options may be so granted by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation as the designee of the Committee. Directors and Employees to whom
options have been granted are herein referred to as &#147;Optionees&#148;. Each option
shall be embodied in an &#147;Option Agreement&#148; signed by the Optionee and the
Corporation providing that the option shall be subject to the provisions of
this Plan and containing such other provisions as the Committee may prescribe
not inconsistent with the Plan. Option grants shall specify whether the grant
is made in the Optionee&#146;s capacity as a Director or as an Eligible Employee.

granted under this Plan. An &#147;Incentive Option&#148; shall mean an option granted
under this Plan which is designated to be an incentive stock option under the
provisions of Code Section&nbsp;422; and any provisions elsewhere in this Plan or in
any such Incentive Option which would prevent such options from being an
incentive stock option may be deleted and/or voided retroactively to the date
of the granting of such option, by action of the Committee. A &#147;Non-Qualified
Option&#148; shall mean an option granted under this Plan which is not an incentive
stock option under the provisions of Code

Options.

a Non-Qualified Option granted to a Director shall not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of the Corporation&#146;s common shares, as determined by the
Committee in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Code for
incentive stock options.

exercised prior to the expiration of one year after the date of granting the
Incentive Option, and no option, whether an Incentive Option or a Non-Qualified
Option, may be exercised after the expiration of ten years from the date the
option is granted.

as otherwise provided in Paragraph&nbsp;15, or by the Committee, either by Committee
action or by provision in any option or other agreement to which an Optionee is
party, if an Optionee&#146;s employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
terminates for any reason regardless of whether by action of the Optionee or
the Corporation or Subsidiary, all options granted under this Plan to such
Optionee which are not exercisable on the date of such termination of
employment shall terminate immediately. Any remaining options shall terminate
if not exercised before the expiration of the following periods, or at such
earlier time as may be applicable under Paragraph&nbsp;7(c) above:

termination is for gross misconduct or offense, in which case the options shall

termination of status as a Director, each Optionee shall have one (1)&nbsp;year
following the date of termination or such later time as the Committee deems
appropriate to exercise options granted and fully vested under this Plan.
Except as provided in Paragraphs 15 and 16 of this Plan, no unvested option

thereunder shall be exercisable during the Optionee&#146;s lifetime only by the
Optionee and shall be non-assignable and non-transferable by the Optionee,
except that a Non-Qualified Option may be transferred pursuant to a &#147;domestic
relations order&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;414(p)(1)(B) of the Code. In the event
of the Optionee&#146;s death, such options and rights thereunder are transferable by
his will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In the event the death of
an Optionee occurs, the representative or representatives of the Optionee&#146;s
estate, or the person or persons who acquired (by bequest or inheritance) the
rights to exercise his stock options granted under this Plan, may exercise any
of the unexercised options in whole or in part prior to the expiration of the
applicable exercise period, as specified in Paragraph&nbsp;7(d) above.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;More than One Option Granted to an Optionee: More than one option,
and more than one form of option, may be granted to an Optionee under this
Plan; provided, however, that the aggregate fair market value (determined as of
the time the option is granted) of the shares for which Incentive Options are
exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under
the Plan and all such plans of the Corporation and any parent or subsidiary
corporation) shall not exceed $100,000 or any other limit established by the
Code. A single option grant may include both an Incentive Option and a
Non-Qualified Option.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Exercise of Options. An Optionee may exercise a stock option by
delivering an option exercise form to the Committee, and arranging for the
satisfaction of the exercise price and any tax withholding obligation (as
provided in Paragraph&nbsp;20). The exercise price and tax withholding obligation
may be satisfied (i)&nbsp;by check; (ii)&nbsp;by delivery of common shares of the
Corporation previously owned by the Optionee, valued at fair market value when
the option is exercised, subject to the limits described below, or (iii)
through a broker cashless exercise procedure. Common shares of the Corporation
may be delivered to satisfy the exercise price only if the shares have been
held by the Optionee for at least six months before delivery, and have not been
used for another option exercise during this period. Shares held by an
Optionee which formerly were Restricted Shares may not be used for this purpose
until six months have elapsed after the restrictions under Paragraph&nbsp;10 have
terminated with respect to such shares. Use of previously owned shares may be
effected by actual delivery of the stock certificates to the Corporation, or by
completing an affidavit available from the Committee affirming that the
Optionee owns the necessary shares and that any applicable holding period has
been satisfied. Upon receipt of the exercise price, the Corporation shall
deliver a certificate representing the common shares acquired upon exercise to
the Optionee or, in the case of a Non-Qualified Option, to such other recipient
as directed by the Optionee. An Optionee wishing to use the cashless exercise
procedure is required to elect to have a broker sell a sufficient number of
common shares of the Corporation to satisfy the

<P><FONT size="2">option exercise price. The Optionee may elect to have the broker sell
additional shares to satisfy the tax withholding amount, or sell up to the full
number of shares subject to the option exercise. Following the broker&#146;s
delivery to the Corporation of the proceeds necessary to satisfy the exercise
price and the tax withholding obligation, the Corporation will deliver to the
broker the number of shares previously sold by the broker at the Optionee&#146;s
direction, and will deliver any remaining amount of cash or shares to the
Optionee or, in the case of a Non-Qualified Option, to such other recipient as
directed by the Optionee.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Committee may from time to time, in its discretion and subject to
the provisions of the Plan, allocate common shares to any or all Directors and
Eligible Employees. Common shares allocated under this Paragraph&nbsp;9 of the Plan
are referred to herein as &#147;Restricted Shares.&#148; Directors and Employees to whom
Restricted Shares have been allocated are herein referred to as &#147;Participants.&#148;
Each Participant to whom an allocation of Restricted Shares has been made shall
have the right to purchase such Restricted Shares as herein provided. Each
allocation shall specify whether the Participant has received such allocation
in the Participant&#146;s capacity as a Director or as an Eligible Employee.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Committee shall advise each Participant to whom an allocation of
Restricted Shares has been made in writing of the terms of the offer, including
the number of shares which such person shall be entitled to purchase, the
purchase price per share, and any other terms, conditions and restrictions
relating thereto. The Participant shall have ten (10)&nbsp;days from the date of
the offer to accept such offer. The Committee may, in the exercise of its
discretion, extend the term of any offer. Subject to the express provisions of
the Plan, the Committee shall have the power to make such offer subject to any
terms and conditions it may establish and the offers made to different persons,
or to the same person at different times, may be subject to terms, conditions
and restrictions which differ from each other. Each allocation shall be
embodied in a &#147;Restricted Share Agreement&#148; signed by the Participant and the
Corporation providing that the Restricted Shares shall be subject to the
provisions of this Plan and containing such other provisions the Committee may
prescribe not inconsistent with the Plan.

lawful consideration established by the Committee in its discretion. If a
Participant elects to purchase Restricted Shares, he shall pay the purchase
price in full, at the principal office of the Corporation, prior to expiration
of the offer. Upon payment of the purchase price, certificates representing
the shares shall be issued to the Participant, which certificates shall bear an
appropriate legend reflecting that such shares are subject to the restrictions
contained in this Plan.

Shares allocated to a Participant under this Plan, the Participant agrees and
consents to the restrictions described in this Plan for a period determined by
the Committee at the time of such allocation, said period referred to herein as
the &#147;Restricted Period.&#148; For the duration of the Restricted Period (unless the
restrictions earlier lapse or are removed by the Committee), Restricted Shares
issued under this Plan shall be held in escrow by Firstar Bank, N.A., and
shall not be transferred,

shall automatically terminate as to that number of the Restricted Shares owned
by the Director which is equal to the total number of such Restricted Shares
multiplied by fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months
which have elapsed from the date of allocation and the denominator of which is
the number of total months during the Restricted Period. The Director (or his
or her estate, heirs, or legatees) shall be required to resell the remaining
Restricted Shares to the Corporation at a price per share equal to the original
purchase price paid by the Director for such shares, unless the Committee
shall, in its discretion, waive the restrictions under Paragraph&nbsp;10 as to any
part or all of such remaining Restricted Shares.

attaining normal retirement age under the provisions of any retirement plan of
the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the restrictions under Paragraph&nbsp;10 of this
Plan shall automatically terminate as to that number of the Restricted Shares
owned by such Participant which is equal to the total number of such Restricted
Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full

Corporation, and thereafter the shares shall be deemed to have been transferred
to the Corporation and the Participant, despite his failure to deliver the
share certificates, shall have no further rights as a stockholder of the
Corporation. In such event, the Treasurer of the Corporation shall continue to

discretion and subject to the provisions of the Plan, provide an incentive
opportunity (&#147;Performance Awards&#148;) to any or all Directors and Eligible
Employees based on achievement by the Corporation for any calendar year or
other period chosen by the Committee. Each Performance Award shall be embodied
in a &#147;Performance Award Agreement&#148; signed by the Participant and the
Corporation providing that the Performance Award shall be subject to the
provisions of this Plan and containing such other provisions as the Committee
may prescribe not inconsistent with the Plan. The Committee will determine, in
its sole discretion, the performance targets and whether Performance Awards
should be payable in the form of the Corporation&#146;s common shares or cash. If
the Eligible Employee requests, prior to the date on which payment of the
Performance Award is to be made, that such payment not be made until
termination of employment by such Eligible Employee, then the Committee shall
consider and act upon such request promptly. If no request is made by such
Eligible Employee, the payment shall be made in the time period chosen by the
Committee.

proportionate adjustments shall be made by the Committee in (a)&nbsp;the number of
shares available for option and issuance under this Plan, (b)&nbsp;the number of
shares subject to options granted under this Plan, and (c)&nbsp;the option price of
