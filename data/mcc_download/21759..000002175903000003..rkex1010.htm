<P>&#9;All moneys remaining in the Construction Fund after the Completion Date and after payment or provision for payment of all other items provided for in the preceding subsections (1) to (9), inclusive, of this Section, shall at the direction of the Borrower be used in accordance with Section 3.4 hereof.</P>
<P>&#9;Each of the payments referred to in this Section shall be made upon receipt by the Trustee of a written order complying with the form set forth in Section 5.7 of the Indenture signed by an Authorized Borrower Representative. If the Borrower is relying on Section 3.3(9) for payment, it will so notify the Trustee at the time it provides the Trustee with the order pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Indenture.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 3.4.&#9;Establishment of Completion Date; Obligation of the Borrower to Complete.</P>
<P>&#9;As soon as practicable after the completion of construction of the Project, the Borrower shall furnish to the Trustee a certificate signed by an Authorized Borrower Representative stating (i) that construction of the Project has been completed substantially in accordance with the plans, specifications and work orders therefor, (ii) the Completion Date, (iii) the Cost of the Project, (iv) the portion of the Cost of the Project which has then been paid and (v) the portion of the Cost of the Project which has not yet then been paid. Such certificate may state that is given without prejudice to any rights against third parties which exist at the date of such certificate or which may subsequently come into being. Moneys (including investment proceeds) remaining in the Construction Fund on the date of such certificate may be used, at the direction of an Authorized Borrower Representative, to the extent indicated, for one or more of the following purposes:</P>
<P>(1)&#9;for the payment, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, of any Cost of the Project not then paid as specified in the above-mentioned certificate; or</P>
<P>(2)&#9;for transfer to the Bond Fund, but only if, and to the extent that, the Trustee has been furnished with an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such transfer is permitted by the Act and does not adversely affect the exemption from federal income taxes of interest on any of the Bonds.</P>
<P>&#9;Any moneys (including investment proceeds) remaining in the Construction Fund on the date of the aforesaid certificate and not set aside for the payment of the Cost of the Project as specified in (1) above or transferred to the Bond Fund pursuant to (2) above shall on such date be placed by the Trustee in the Escrow Account and used to pay all or part of the redemption price of Bonds at the redemption date or dates selected by the Borrower; provided that, until so used such moneys may also be used, at the direction of the Borrower, for one or more of the following purposes:</P>
<P>(a)&#9;to pay all or part of the price of purchasing Bonds on tender, in the open market or at private sale, on or before such date or dates, for the purpose of cancellation;</P>
<P>(b)&#9;for the payment of the cost of any additional project, provided that prior to such use this Agreement is amended in accordance with Section 3.1 hereof to include such additional facilities within the definition of Project as used herein;</P>
<P>(c)&#9;for any other purpose;</P>
<P>provided that, no moneys on deposit in such Escrow Account may be used for any of the purposes specified in (a), (b) or (c) in this paragraph unless and until the Borrower, at the Borrower's expense, causes Bond Counsel to deliver to the Trustee an opinion of Bond Counsel upon which the Trustee may rely to the effect that such use is permitted by the Act and does not adversely affect the exemption from federal income taxes of interest on any of the Bonds; and provided further that, until used for one or more of the foregoing purposes, moneys on deposit in the Escrow Account may be invested in investments authorized by the first paragraph of Section 3.5 of this Agreement, but may not be invested to produce a yield on such moneys (computed from the Completion Date and taking into account any investment of such moneys during the period from the Completion Date until such moneys were deposited in such Escrow Account) greater than the yield on the Bonds, all as such terms are used in and determined in accordance with relevant provisions of the Code and regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder.</P>
<P>In the event moneys remaining in the Construction Fund at the Completion Date are used for the purpose specified in (b) above, the provisions of this Agreement relating to and in effect during the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Project shall apply to such additional facilities.</P>
<P>In the event the moneys in the Construction Fund available for payment of the Cost of the Project should not be sufficient to pay the costs thereof in full, the Borrower agrees to pay directly, or to deposit in the Construction Fund moneys sufficient to pay, the costs of completing the Project as may be in excess of the moneys available therefor in the Construction Fund. The Issuer does not make any warranty, either express or implied, that the moneys which will be paid into the Construction Fund and which, under the provisions of this Agreement, will be available for payment of the Cost of the Project, will be sufficient to pay all the costs which will be incurred in that connection. The Borrower agrees that if after exhaustion of the moneys in the Construction Fund the Borrower should pay, or deposit moneys in the Construction Fund for the payment of, any portion of the Cost of the Project pursuant to the provisions of this Section, it shall not be entitled to any reimbursement therefor from the Issuer or from the Trustee or from the owners of any of the Bonds, nor shall it be entitled to any diminution of the amounts payable under Section 4.2 hereof.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 3.5.&#9;Investment of Moneys in Construction Fund and Bond Fund.</P>
<P>Any moneys held as a part of the Construction Fund or the Bond Fund shall at the written request (or the oral request confirmed in writing) of an Authorized Borrower Representative be invested or reinvested by the Trustee in the following: (i) any bonds or other obligations which as to principal and interest constitute direct obligations of or are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America, (ii) obligations of the Federal National Mortgage Association, (iii) obligations of the Federal Intermediate Credit Corporation, (iv) obligations of Federal Banks for Cooperatives, (v) certificates of deposit issued by, bankers acceptances or debt obligations of or repurchase agreement of, and interest bearing accounts in, commercial banks, including the Trustee or any of its affiliates and banks domiciled outside of the United States of America, which have a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000, (vi) commercial paper of domestic corporations (as defined in Section 5.1 hereof), (vii) obligations of Federal Land Banks, (viii) obligations of Federal Home Loan Banks, (ix) obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association, (x) debt obligations of domestic corporations (as defined in Section 5.1 hereof), (xi) obligations issued by or on behalf of any state of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or funds consisting solely of such obligations, (xii) shares of such open-end, SEC-registered money market mutual fund used by the Trustee for the investment of funds held by it and which fund invests its assets primarily in any of the securities described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vii), (viii), (ix) or (xi) above, including, without limitation, any fund for which the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee serves as an investment advisor, administrator, shareholder servicing agent, and/or custodian or subcustodian, notwithstanding that (a) the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee charges fees and expenses from such fund for services rendered, (b) the Trustee charges and collects fees and expenses for services rendered pursuant to the Indenture, and (c) services performed for such fund and pursuant to the Indenture may converge at any time, or (xiii) any other investments permitted by law; provided, that any such investment pursuant to (vi), (x), (xi) or (xiii) above shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. If the Borrower fails to direct the Trustee to make such investments, the Trustee shall invest moneys held as a part of the Construction Fund or the Bond Fund in the Trustee's tax-exempt money market fund (for which the Trustee shall be entitled to charge the Borrower its customary fee charged to other investors in such fund). For purposes of this Section, a rating category shall mean a generic rating category without regard to any refinement or gradation of such rating category by numerical modifier or otherwise. The Trustee may make any and all such investments through its own trust investment department.</P>
<P>The investments so purchased shall be held by the Trustee and shall be deemed at all times a part of the Construction Fund or the Bond Fund, as the case may be, and the interest accruing thereon and any profit realized therefrom shall be credited to such fund and any net losses resulting from such investment shall be charged to such fund.</P>
<P>The Borrower covenants that any funds (including investment proceeds), except funds constituting a minor portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, on deposit in the Construction Fund more than three years after the date of the delivery of the Bonds will not be invested to produce a yield greater than the yield on the Bonds, all as such terms are used in and determined in accordance with the regulations promulgated or proposed under relevant provisions of the Code.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 3.6.&#9;Arbitrage Certifications.</P>
<P>The Borrower reasonably expects, based on its knowledge, information and belief, and hereby certifies and represents to the Issuer, and the Issuer hereby certifies that it reasonably expects, that the proceeds of the Bonds will not be used in a manner that would cause the Bonds to be classified as "arbitrage bonds" under Section 148 of the Code and regulations prescribed under that Section. The Issuer and the Borrower jointly and severally certify and covenant with all purchasers and owners of the Bonds from time to time outstanding that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding moneys on deposit in any fund or account in connection with the Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds or from any other sources, will not be used in a manner which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of the Code, and any lawful regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder; provided that the Issuer will be deemed to have failed to comply with such certification and covenant only if it knows or should have known that a particular use might result in a violation thereof; provided further that the Issuer shall conclusively be deemed to have complied with such certification and covenant to the extent that it has relied upon an opinion of Bond Counsel.</P>

<P>&#9;Section 4.2.&#9;Repayment of Loan; Other Amounts Payable.</P>
<P>(a)&#9;On or before the Business Day prior to each date provided in or pursuant to the Indenture for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and/or interest on the Bonds, until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have been fully paid or provision for the payment thereof shall have been made in accordance with the Indenture, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee in federal or other immediately available funds at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee for deposit in the Bond Fund, as a repayment installment of the loan made to the Borrower out of Bond proceeds pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, a sum equal to the amount payable on such date as principal (whether at maturity, or upon redemption or acceleration), premium, if any, and interest upon the Bonds as provided in the Indenture; provided, however, that the obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment shall be reduced by the amount of moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund on any such date and available to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds on such date (excluding moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund for the payment of past due principal of or premium, if any, or interest on Bonds in cases where Bonds have not been presented for payment or interest checks have not been cashed); provided further, that in any event the payments under this Section 4.2(a) shall at all times be sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, and if on any date on which the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on Bonds is due, the Trustee shall not have sufficient moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund and available therefor to make each such payment in full, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Trustee in immediately available funds an amount equal to such deficiency. Each payment made pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) shall be made during normal banking hours. In the event the Borrower should fail to make any of the payments required in this Section 4.2(a), the item or installment so in default shall continue as an obligation of the Borrower until the amount in default shall have been fully paid, and the Borrower agrees to pay the same with interest thereon to the extent permitted by law at the rate of interest borne by the Bonds from the due date thereof until paid.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;The Borrower agrees to pay the Trustee (1) the initial acceptance fee of the Trustee and reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the Trustee in entering into and executing the Indenture and (2) until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have been fully paid or provision for the payment thereof shall have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, (i) an amount equal to the reasonable annual fee of the Trustee for the ordinary services of the Trustee, as trustee, rendered and its reasonable ordinary expenses incurred under the Indenture, as and when the same become due, (ii) the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of the Trustee as Registrar and as Paying Agent, as and when the same become due, (iii) the reasonable fees, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of the Trustee for the necessary extraordinary services rendered by it and extraordinary expenses incurred by it under the Indenture, as and when the same become due, and (iv) the cost of typing or printing any Bonds required to be furnished by the Issuer. The Borrower further agrees to indemnify the Trustee and its officers, employees and agents for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part, arising out of or in connection with the issuance or sale of the Bonds or the acceptance or administration of the trusts under the Indenture, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers and duties under the Indenture. In the event the Borrower should fail to make any of the payments required in this Section 4.2(b), the item or installment so in default shall continue as an obligation of the Borrower until the amount in default shall have been fully paid, and the Borrower agrees to pay the same with interest thereon to the extent permitted by law at the prime rate of the Trustee (or if the Trustee does not have a prime rate, the lowest prime rate of any of its affiliates) at the time of such failure from the due date thereof until paid.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;The Borrower also agrees to pay upon written request, reasonable expenses of the Issuer incurred in carrying out its duties and obligations under this Agreement. In the event the Borrower should fail to make any of the payments required in this Section 4.2(c), the item or installment so in default shall continue as an obligation of the Borrower until the amount in default shall have been fully paid, and the Borrower agrees to pay the same with interest thereon to the extent permitted by law at the rate of interest borne by the Bonds from the due date thereof until paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the Bonds, the Indenture or any other instrument or document executed by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection herewith, the Issuer shall not be obligated to take any action or execute any instrument pursuant to any provision hereof until it shall have been requested in writing to do so by the Borrower or the Trustee.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 4.3&#9;Security Interest Granted.</P>
<P>&#9;To secure the prompt payment of the Loan and the performance by the Borrower of its other obligations hereunder, the Borrower, to the full extent permitted by law, hereby pledges to the Issuer and hereby grants to the Issuer a purchase money Security Interest in and agrees and acknowledges that the Issuer shall have and shall continue to have a Security Interest in the Project provided, that at any time when the Borrower is not in default in the performance of any term, condition or covenant hereof, if the Borrower in its discretion determines that any items of Project machinery or equipment have become inadequate, obsolete, worn out, unsuitable, undesirable or unnecessary, the Borrower may remove and dispose of such items of machinery or equipment from the Project and sell, trade in, exchange or otherwise dispose of them (as a whole or in party) without any responsibility or accountability to the Issuer or the Trustee therefore, and free of the security interest granted herein, if the Borrower: </P>
<P>(a)&#9;Substitutes and installs other machinery or equipment having equal or greater value and utility (but not necessarily having the same function) in the operation of the project for its intended purpose (provided such removal and substitution shall not impair operating unity), all of which substituted machinery or equipment shall be free of all liens and encumbrances and shall become a part of the Project and shall be subject to the Security Interest granted to the issuer herein; or </P>
<P>(b)&#9;Pays over to the Trustee for deposit by the Trustee to the Redemption Account, (i) in the case of the trade-in of such machinery or equipment for other machinery or equipment not deemed a part of the Project, the amount of the credit received by it in such trade-in and (ii) in the case of any disposition other than as provided in clause (b)(i) an amount equal to the original cost thereof less depreciation at rates calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices consistently followed by the Borrower; or </P>
<P>(c)&#9;In the event that the Borrower has acquired and installed, prior to such removal and disposal of an item of machinery or equipment from the Project other than under preceding subsection (a) of this Section, an additional item or items of machinery or equipment with its own funds, free of all liens and encumbrances, which have become part of the Project, and are subject to the Security Interest or Mortgage granted herein, the Borrower may take credit to the extent of the amount so spent against the requirement that it either substitute and install other machinery or equipment having equal or greater utility or that it make payment to the Trustee for deposit into the Redemption Account. </P>
<P>Prior to the removal, disposal or other disposition of any portion of the Project, the Borrower's Authorized Representative shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate that such removal, disposal or disposition will not affect the utility or value of the Project for the purposes set forth herein. The certificate shall specify which portions of the Project are to be removed or disposed of, and identify any additions or substitutions which have been or will be made part of the Project pursuant to the provisions of this section. The Borrower will also execute, record and deliver to the Trustee any documents deemed necessary by the Trustee to perfect and to maintain the lien on, pledge of, mortgage upon or Security Interest in such additions and substitutions. </P>
<P>The removal from the Project of any portion of the machinery or equipment and the substitution, payment or credit therefor pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall not entitle the Borrower to any delay, abatement or diminution of the installments payable under Section 4.2 hereby. </P>
<P>The Borrower shall file with the Trustee annually on or before October 16 in each year during the term of this Agreement, beginning October 16, 2003, an opinion of counsel (who may also be counsel for the Borrower) stating that all action has been taken with respect to the filing, recording, refilling and re-recording of financing statements or continuation statements or other notices as is necessary to perfect and to maintain the lien on, pledge of, mortgage of and security interest in the Project or any additions or substitutions which may be allowed as provided herein, and to preserve the priority of the lien on the Project represented by the Indenture, the Security Interest and the Mortgage. </P>
<P>&#9;Section 4.4.&#9;No Defense or Set-Off; Unconditional Obligation.</P>
<P>The obligations of the Borrower to make the payments required in Section 4.2 hereof and to perform and observe the other agreements on its part contained herein shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation irrespective of any defense or any rights of set-off, recoupment or counterclaim it might otherwise have against the Issuer or the Trustee, and the Borrower shall pay absolutely net during the term of this Agreement the payments to be made on account of the loan as prescribed in Section 4.2 and all other payments required hereunder free of any deductions and without abatement, diminution or set-off; and until such time as the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have been fully paid, or provision for the payment thereof shall have been made in accordance with the Indenture, the Borrower: (i) will not suspend or discontinue any payments provided for in Section 4.2 hereof; (ii) will perform and observe all of its other agreements contained in this Agreement; and (iii) except as provided in Article VII hereof, will not terminate this Agreement for any cause, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, destruction of or damage to the Project, commercial frustration of purpose, any change in the tax laws of the United States of America or of the State of Florida or any political subdivision of either of these, or any failure of the Issuer or Trustee to perform and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or connected with this Agreement or the Indenture, except to the extent permitted by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall be entitled to recover from the Trustee all costs and damages resulting from the failure of the Trustee to perform or observe any agreement, duty or obligation arising out of or connected with this Agreement, the Tax Agreement or the Indenture and shall be entitled to institute such action against the Issuer or the Trustee as the Borrower shall deem appropriate to compel performance of any agreement, duty or obligation under this Agreement, the Tax Agreement or the Indenture; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to carry out any agreement, duty or obligation unless it is reimbursed for its costs and expenses by the Borrower. To the extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives any defense of usury which may or might be applicable to its payments hereunder, including interest on overdue amounts.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 4.5.&#9;Assignment of Issuer's Rights.</P>
<P>As security for the payment of the Bonds, the Issuer will assign to the Trustee, without recourse, the Issuer's rights under this Agreement, except for the Reserved Rights, and the Issuer hereby directs the Borrower to make said payments (other than payments in respect of the Reserved Rights) directly to the Trustee. The Borrower herewith assents to such assignment and will make such payments (other than payments in respect of the Reserved Rights) directly to the Trustee without defense or set-off by reason of any dispute between the Borrower and the Issuer or the Trustee.</P>

<P>&#9;Section 6.1.&#9;Events of Default.</P>
<P>The occurrence and continuation of any one of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:</P>
<P>(a)&#9;failure by the Borrower to pay any amount required to be paid under Section 4.2(a) hereof with respect to principal of or premium on any Bond at the time specified therein; or</P>
<P>(b)&#9;failure by the Borrower to pay any amount required to be paid under Section 4.2(a) hereof with respect to interest on any Bond at the time specified therein and the continuation thereof for a period of 30 days; or</P>
<P>(c)&#9;failure by the Borrower to observe and perform any covenant, condition or agreement on its part to be observed or performed in this Agreement, other than as referred to in (a) or (b) above, for a period of 30 days after receipt by the Borrower of written notice, specifying such failure and requesting that it be remedied, given to the Borrower by the Issuer or the Trustee, unless the Issuer and the Trustee shall agree in writing to an extension of such time prior to its expiration; provided, however, if the failure stated in the notice cannot be corrected within the applicable period, the Issuer and the Trustee will not unreasonably withhold their consent to an extension of such time if corrective action is instituted within the applicable period and diligently pursued until the default is corrected; provided further, if any such failure obligates the Borrower to prepay installments pursuant to Section 7.1(b) hereof, and such prepayment is in fact made by the Borrower and Bonds are redeemed with such prepayment moneys as provided in the Indenture, then such failure by the Borrower shall not constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement; or</P>
<P>(d)&#9;the dissolution or liquidation of the Borrower or the filing by the Borrower of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or failure by the Borrower promptly to lift any execution, garnishment or attachment of such consequence as will impair its ability to carry on its obligations hereunder, or the commission by the Borrower of any act of bankruptcy, or adjudication of the Borrower as a bankrupt, or if a petition or answer proposing the adjudication of the Borrower as a bankrupt or its reorganization, arrangement or debt readjustment under any present or future federal bankruptcy act or any similar federal or state law shall be filed in any court and such petition or answer shall not be discharged or denied within ninety days after the filing thereof, or if the Borrower shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the Borrower shall be appointed in any proceeding brought against the Borrower and shall not be discharged within ninety days after such appointment or if the Borrower shall consent to or acquiesce in such appointment, or assignment by the Borrower for the benefit of its creditors, or the entry by the Borrower into an agreement of composition with its creditors, or a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding shall be otherwise initiated by or against the Borrower under any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization or analogous law as now or hereafter in effect and if initiated against the Borrower shall remain undismissed (subject to no further appeal) for a period of ninety days; provided, the term "dissolution or liquidation of the Borrower", as used in this subsection, shall not be construed to include the cessation of the corporate existence of the Borrower resulting either from a merger or consolidation of the Borrower into or with another corporation or a dissolution or liquidation of the Borrower following a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety, under the conditions permitting such actions contained in Section 5.1 hereof; or</P>
<P>(e)&#9;the occurrence of an "event of default" under the Indenture.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 6.2.&#9;Remedies on Default.</P>
<P>&#9;Whenever the unpaid principal amount of the Bonds and interest accrued thereon has been declared to be immediately due and payable under the Indenture, then upon any such declaration the amounts payable under Section 4.2(a) hereof shall automatically become and shall be immediately due and payable in the amount set forth in Section 9.2 of the Indenture; provided, however, that any such automatic acceleration of unpaid loan repayment installments payable under Section 4.2(a) of this Agreement shall be deemed automatically rescinded upon any rescission by the Trustee of the corresponding declaration of acceleration of the Bonds under Section 9.11 of the Indenture.</P>
<P>&#9;Whenever any Event of Default shall have happened and is continuing, the Issuer, (with the consent of the Trustee or without the consent of the Trustee to the extent that such Event of Default relates solely to the Reserved Rights) or the Trustee may take whatever action at law or in equity may appear necessary or desirable to collect the payments and other amounts then due or to enforce performance and observance of any obligation, agreement or covenant of the Borrower under this Agreement.</P>
<P>&#9;In case the Issuer, with the consent of the Trustee, or the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce its rights under this Agreement and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Issuer and/or the Trustee, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Borrower and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Borrower and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.</P>
<P>&#9;The Borrower covenants that, in case an Event of Default shall occur with respect to the payment of any repayment installment payable under Section 4.2(a) hereof, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Borrower will pay to the Trustee the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable under said Section 4.2(a), with interest (to the extent permitted by law) on such amount at the rate borne by the Bonds from the due date thereof until paid.</P>
<P>&#9;In case the Borrower shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Borrower and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Borrower, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.</P>
<P>&#9;If an Event of Default shall happen and be subsisting, in case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Borrower under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have been appointed for the property of the Borrower or in the case of any other similar judicial proceedings relative to the Borrower, or to the creditors or property of the Borrower, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount owing and unpaid pursuant to this Agreement, irrespective of whether the principal of the Bonds or any amount hereunder shall then be due and payable as therein or herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise, and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.2 or of Section 9.2 of the Indenture, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Borrower, its creditors, or its property, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of its charges and expenses; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized to make such payments to the Trustee, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for compensation and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses incurred by it up to the date of such distribution.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 6.3.&#9;Agreement to Pay Attorneys' Fees and Expenses.</P>
<P>In the event the Borrower should default under any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Issuer should employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of the payments due under this Agreement or the enforcement of performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the Borrower herein contained, the Borrower agrees that it will on demand therefor pay to the Issuer the reasonable fees and expenses of such attorneys and such other reasonable expenses so incurred by the Issuer. In the event the Borrower should default under any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Trustee should employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of the payments due under this Agreement or the enforcement of performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the Borrower herein contained, the Borrower agrees that it will on demand therefor pay to the Trustee the reasonable fees and expenses of such attorneys and such other reasonable expenses so incurred by the Trustee.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 6.4.&#9;No Remedy Exclusive.</P>
<P>No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Issuer is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute, except that the remedy of acceleration shall be exercised only in the manner set forth in Section 6.2 hereof. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or event of default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. Such rights and remedies as are given the Issuer hereunder shall also extend to the Trustee, and the Trustee and the owners of the Bonds shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of all covenants and agreements herein contained. In order to entitle the Issuer, with the consent of the Trustee, or the Trustee to exercise any remedy reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as may be herein expressly required.</P>
<P>&#9;Section 6.5.&#9;No Additional Waiver Implied by One Waiver.</P>
<P>In the event any agreement contained in this Agreement should be breached by the Borrower and thereafter waived by the Issuer or the Trustee, such waiver shall be limited to the particular breach so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other breach hereunder.</P>
