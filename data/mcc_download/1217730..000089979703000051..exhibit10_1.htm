<u>Purposes of Plan</u>.&nbsp; </b>The purposes of this Greater Buffalo Savings Bank
2000 Stock Option Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;) are to provide for stock options (&quot;Options&quot;)
as incentives for key employees, titled assistants, officers and/or directors of
Greater Buffalo Savings Bank (the &quot;Company&quot;) and its Subsidiary Corporations, as
hereinafter defined and in certain instances to compensate founding directors
for their efforts in founding the Company or directors for attending meetings of
the Company's Board of Directors or committees of the Company's Board of
Directors, through acquisition or increased ownership of the Company's common
stock, par value $5.00 per share (&quot;Common Stock&quot;), and where appropriate to
encourage such individuals to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the
Company's business. It is intended that Options granted to employees under the
Plan will constitute &quot;incentive stock options&quot; within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;). It is also
intended that Options granted to non-employee officers and directors pursuant to
this Plan shall be non-qualified options for purposes of the Code. The Plan
shall be subject to the provisions of the New York Banking Law, including
Section 140-a thereof, the regulations of the New York Banking Board, including
Part 26 thereof, and all other applicable laws and regulations.</p>

Corporation without cause, as defined below, or the resignation, removal, or
failure of an Optionee who is a director of the Company to be re-elected to the
Board of Directors of the Company , all unexpired Options held by such Optionee
shall be deemed 100% vested as of the date of such death, Retirement or
Disability or termination of employment or expiration of service as a director
of the Company. For purposes of this Section 6(b) the term &quot;cause&quot; shall mean
any of the following: (i) the Optionee's conviction of any felony offense

provided, however, an Option may not be exercised for fewer than one hundred
(100) shares of Common Stock, or the number of shares of Common Stock remaining
as to which such Option is then exercisable whichever is smaller. The Option
shall be exercised by delivering to the Company written notice of such exercise
setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased and the name
in which such shares shall be registered, together with a certified check, bank
draft or money order, in the full amount of the purchase price therefor, in each
case payable to the order of the Company in United States dollars; provided,
however, that such purchase price may in the alternative, to the extent
permitted by law, be paid by assigning and delivering to the Company shares of
Common Stock having in the aggregate on the date of exercise a Fair Market Value
equal to such purchase price; and provided further that at the election of the
Option Committee, to the extent permitted by law, such purchase price may
consist of other property, tangible or intangible, or labor or services actually
received by or performed for the Company or for its benefit, or a combination
thereof. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board
of Directors as to the value of the consideration received upon the exercise of
an Option shall be conclusive.</p>

exercise of an Option may be restricted from further transfer for any period
which may be required under applicable securities laws, in which case the stock

Company or a Subsidiary Corporation to terminate his employment at any time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Nontransferability of Options</u>. During the lifetime
of an Optionee, Options held by such Optionee shall be exercisable only by such
Optionee or, in the event of an Optionee's disability, by his guardian or legal
representative. No Option shall be assignable or transferable by an Optionee
other than by will or applicable laws of descent and distribution.</p>

split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights
offering, or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of Common
Stock of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock available for
Options, the number of such shares covered by outstanding Options, and/or the
Option Price per share shall be proportionately adjusted by the Board of
Directors, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, if required, to
reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares
of Common Stock; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from
such adjustment shall be eliminated by rounding down to the nearest whole number
of shares. The Board of Director's determinations of adjustments shall be final,
binding and conclusive, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, if
required.</p>

securities, property, cash or any combination thereof that such Optionee would
receive upon such dissolution, liquidation, or corporate consolidation or merger

alternative, that each Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a
date to be fixed by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that not less
than thirty (30) days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each
Optionee, who shall have the right, during the period of thirty (30) days
preceding such termination, to exercise each Option as to all or any part of the

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Registration, Listing and Qualification of Shares of
Stock. </u>Each Option shall be subject to the requirement that if at any time
the Board of Directors or the Option Committee shall determine that the
registration, listing or qualification of the shares of Common Stock subject
thereto, upon any securities exchange or under any federal or state law, or the
consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or
desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option
or the purchase of shares of Common Stock thereunder, no such Option may be
exercised unless and until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or
approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not
acceptable to the Option Committee or Board of Directors. The Company may
require that any person exercising an Option shall make such representations and
agreements and furnish such information as the Company deems appropriate to
assure compliance with the foregoing or any other applicable legal requirement.</p>

rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the Option until
the date of the issuance of a stock certificate to him for such shares. No
adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in
cash, securities or other property) or distributions or other rights for which
the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued, except as
provided in Section 6(f) hereof.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Option Agreements</u>. Each Option granted pursuant to

Common Stock to which the Option relates, the Option Price, and that the terms
and conditions of this Plan shall be incorporated therein by reference. Each
Option Agreement shall contain such other provisions, including, without
limitation, the imposition of restrictions upon the exercise of an Option, as
the Option Committee shall deem advisable.</p>
