<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>provided</U>, however,

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;

4 hereof, in connection with a Change in Control, the Optionee shall have the
immediate and nonforfeitable right to exercise the Option with respect to all

the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation shall adopt and
maintain the Plan. In the event the Option becomes exercisable pursuant to this
Section&#160;5, the Company shall notify the Optionee of his right to exercise
the Option. Upon a Change in Control described in Section 1.6(b)(iii) of the

Shares resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated. Adjustments under
this Section&#160;6 shall be made by the Committee, whose determination as to
the adjustments to be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding and
conclusive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Exercise&#160;of&#160;Option</U>. &nbsp;The Option may be exercised by delivering
to the Chairman, Vice Chairman, President or Chief Financial Officer of the
Company at the then principal office address of the recipient officer, a
completed Notice of Exercise of Option (obtainable from the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company) setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which
the Option is being exercised. Such Notice shall be accompanied by payment in
full for the Shares, unless other arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for
prompt payment of such amount are made. Payment of the Option Exercise Price may
be made in any manner permitted by the Plan, subject to the consent of the
Committee as applicable. With the consent of the Committee, the Optionee may
effect a cashless exercise of the Option as described in the Plan. With the
consent of the Committee in its sole discretion, payment for Shares acquired
upon exercise of the Option may be made by delivery to the Company of an
assignment of a sufficient amount of the proceeds from the sale of Shares
acquired upon exercise of the Option to pay for all or some of the Shares
acquired upon exercise of the Option and an authorization to the broker or
selling agent to pay that amount to the Company, which sale shall be made at the
Optionee&#146;s direction on the Option Exercise Date; <U>provided</U>, that the
Committee may require the Optionee to furnish an opinion of counsel acceptable
to the Committee to the effect that such delivery would not result in the
Optionee incurring any liability under Section 16 of the Act and does not
require any Consent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Issuance&#160;of&#160;Share&#160;Certificates</U>.&nbsp; Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 8, upon receipt by the Company prior to expiration of
the Option of a duly completed Notice of Exercise of Option accompanied by
payment for the Shares being purchased pursuant to such Notice (and, with
respect to any Option exercised pursuant to Section 9 hereof by someone other
than the Optionee, accompanied in addition by proof satisfactory to the
Committee of the right of such person to exercise the Option), the Company shall
deliver to the Optionee, within thirty (30) days of such receipt, a certificate
for the number of Shares so purchased. The Optionee shall not have any of the
rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares which are subject to the
Option unless and until a certificate representing such Shares is issued to the
Optionee. The Company shall not be required to issue any certificates for Shares
upon the exercise of the Option prior to (i)&#160;obtaining any Consents which
the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
advisable, or (ii) the determination by the Committee, in its sole discretion,
that no Consents need be obtained. </FONT></P>

action pursuant to this Agreement. The Option shall not be transferable other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Option may be
exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee;
<U>provided</U>, that a guardian or other legal representative who has been duly
appointed for such Optionee may exercise the Option on behalf of the Optionee.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, with the consent of the Committee in its
sole discretion, the Optionee may transfer the rights under the Option in
respect of some or all of the Shares which are subject to the Option to a Family
Member or a trust for the exclusive benefit of the Optionee and/or Family
Members, or a partnership or other entity affiliated with the Optionee that may
be approved by the Committee. All terms and conditions of any Option, including
provisions relating to the termination of the Optionee&#146;s employment with
the Company and its Affiliates, shall continue to apply following a transfer
made in accordance with this Section 10 and the Transferee shall have no greater
right to exercise the Option than the Optionee would have in the absence of the
transfer. The Option may be exercised by the Transferee only in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Transferee&#146;s exercise of the Option
shall be subject to the Transferee and/or the Optionee satisfying all of the
conditions relating to the exercise of the Option including, without limitation,
provisions concerning payment of the Option Exercise Price and tax withholding. </FONT></P>

Optionee may direct that Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of the
Option be used to satisfy any withholding obligation; <U>provided</U>, that for
