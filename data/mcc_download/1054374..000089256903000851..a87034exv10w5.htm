1998 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN- STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT</B><BR>
<B><I>POST APRIL 1, 2003 ENTRY DATE INTO NOVEMBER 2002 OFFERING PERIOD</I></B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">I hereby elect to participate in the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
&#147;ESPP&#148;) and hereby subscribe to purchase shares of Common Stock of Broadcom
Corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the ESPP. I hereby authorize payroll deductions from each of my
paychecks following my entry into the offering period in the 1% multiple of my
eligible cash earnings (not to exceed a maximum of 15%) specified in my
attached Enrollment/Change Form.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Each offering period will be of a duration of 24&nbsp;months or less and will be
divided into a series of consecutive purchase intervals. Those purchase
intervals will be of six months duration and begin on the first business day of
May and November each year during the offering period. My participation will
automatically remain in effect, in accordance with my most current payroll
deduction authorization, from one purchase interval to the next within the
offering period in which I join the ESPP and from one purchase interval to the
next within each subsequent offering period during the remaining term of the
ESPP, unless I withdraw from the ESPP or change the rate of my payroll
deduction or unless my employment status changes. I may reduce the rate of my
payroll deductions on one occasion per 6-month purchase interval, to become
effective with the filing of the change form, and I may increase my rate of
payroll deductions to become effective at the beginning of any subsequent
6-month purchase interval (May 1 or November 1). For offering periods
beginning on or after May&nbsp;1, 2003, I may change my rate of payroll deductions
at any time, to become effective on the first pay day of the month following
the month in which I file my change request with the plan administrator, and
there will be no limit on the number of changes I may make per purchase
interval or per offering period.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">My payroll deductions will be accumulated for the purchase of shares of the
Corporation&#146;s Common Stock on the last business day of each purchase interval
within each offering period in which I participate. The purchase price per
share will be equal to 85% of the lower of (i)&nbsp;the fair market value per share
of Common Stock on my entry date into that offering period or (ii)&nbsp;the fair
market value per share on the purchase date. I will also be subject to ESPP
restrictions (i)&nbsp;limiting the maximum number of shares which I may purchase per
purchase interval and the maximum number of shares purchasable in the aggregate
by all participants on any one purchase date and (ii)&nbsp;prohibiting me from
purchasing more than $25,000 worth of Common Stock for each calendar year my
purchase right remains outstanding.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">I may withdraw from the ESPP at any time prior to the last business day of a
purchase interval and elect either to have the Corporation refund all my
payroll deductions for that interval or to have such payroll deductions applied
to the purchase of Common Stock at the end of such interval. However, I may
not rejoin the ESPP until a new quarterly entry date (first business day in
February, May, August and November). Upon the termination of my employment for
any reason (including death or disability) or my loss of eligible employee
status, my participation in the ESPP will immediately cease and all my payroll
deductions for the purchase interval in which my employment terminates or my
loss of eligibility occurs will automatically be refunded. If I take an unpaid
leave of absence, my payroll deductions will immediately cease and any payroll
deductions for the purchase interval in which my leave begins will, at my
election, either be refunded or applied to the purchase of shares of Common
Stock at the end of that purchase interval. If I return to active service
within 90&nbsp;days after the start of my leave, then my payroll deductions will at
that time automatically resume at the rate in effect for me when my leave
began.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Corporation will issue a stock certificate for the shares purchased on my
behalf after the end of each purchase interval and the certificate will be
deposited directly in the Corporation-designated brokerage account established
on my behalf. I will notify the Corporation of any disposition of shares
purchased under the ESPP and I will satisfy all applicable income and
employment tax withholding requirements at the time of such disposition.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Corporation has the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to amend or
terminate the ESPP at any time, with such amendment or termination to become
effective immediately following the exercise of outstanding purchase rights at
the end of any current purchase interval. Should the Corporation elect to
terminate the ESPP, I will have no further rights to purchase shares of Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement. I have received a copy of the Q&#038;A Summary
identifying the major features of the ESPP. I have read this Agreement and the
Q&#038;A Summary and hereby agree to be bound by the terms of both this Agreement
and the ESPP. The effectiveness of this Agreement is dependent upon my
eligibility to participate in the ESPP.
