Grantee will deposit with the Corporation cash in an amount determined by the Corporation to be necessary to satisfy required taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation will be under no obligation to credit units
or to pay cash to Grantee in settlement of any units if Grantee fails timely to deposit such amount with the Corporation. The Corporation in its sole discretion may also withhold any required taxes from dividend equivalents payable on the units.
