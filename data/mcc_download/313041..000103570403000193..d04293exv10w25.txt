Service, EpicEdge will pay Consultant the fees set forth in Exhibit A ("Services

performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. Consultant is
solely responsible for, and must maintain adequate records of, expenses incurred
in the course of performing services under this Agreement. No part of
Consultant's compensation will be subject to withholding by EpicEdge for the
payment of any social security, federal, state or any other employee payroll
taxes. EpicEdge will regularly report amounts paid to Consultant by filing Form
1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.

      4.    Intellectual Property Rights/Confidential Information.

            4.1   Disclosure, Ownership and Assignment of Inventions. Consultant
agrees that all inventions or copyrightable works, or any portion thereof,

property of EpicEdge and EpicEdge shall be the sole owner of all rights in
connection therewith. Consultant hereby assigns to EpicEdge any rights
Consultant may have or acquire in all inventions and/or copyrightable works in
connection with Consultant's performance of the Services. Consultant further
