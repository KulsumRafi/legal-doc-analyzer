                                                      Contract No. N01 -ES-25497

        (2)     The Government is not obligated to pay any additional amount

                ceiling rates. In the event that the final indirect cost rates
                are less than these negotiated ceiling rates, the final
                negotiated ceiling rates shall be reduced to conform to the
                lower rates.

                Any costs over and above this cost ceiling shall not be
                reimbursed under this contract or any other Government contract,

b.      ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

        The Contractor is required to have an accounting system that segregates
        costs and is acceptable for cost reimbursement type contracts. An
        accounting system review will be performed as part of the negotiation of
        indirect cost rates. The contractor must agree to implement changes
        should their system be determined to be inadequate.

c.      SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS

        information/data that the Contractor will be provided during the
        performance of the contract is of a sensitive nature and can not be
        disclosed in any manner.

        Disclosure of the information/data, in whole or in part, by the
        Contractor can only be made after the Contractor receives prior written

SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

ARTICLE H.1. REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS FOR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
PROJECTS

The primary purpose of the Public Health Service (PHS) is to support and advance
independent research within the scientific community. This support is provided
in the form of contracts and grants totaling approximately 7 billion dollars
annually. PHS has established effective, time tested and well recognized
procedures for stimulating and supporting this independent research by selecting
from multitudes of applications those research projects most worthy of support
within the constraints of its appropriations. The reimbursement through the
indirect cost mechanism of independent research and development costs not
incidental to product improvement would circumvent this competitive process.

                                       10

<PAGE>

                                                      Contract No. N01 -ES-25497

To ensure that all research and development projects receive similar and equal
consideration, all organizations may compete for direct funding of independent
research and development projects they consider worthy of support by submitting
those projects to the appropriate Public Health Service grant office for review.
Since these projects may be submitted for direct funding, the Contractor agrees
that no costs for any independent research and development project, including
all applicable indirect costs, will be claimed under this contract.

ARTICLE H.2. HUMAN SUBJECTS

It is hereby understood and agreed that research involving human subjects shall
not be conducted under this contract, and that no material developed, modified,
or delivered by or to the Government under this contract, or any subsequent
modification of such material, will be used by the Contractor or made available
by the Contractor for use by anyone other than the Government, for experimental
or therapeutic use involving humans without the prior written approval of the
Contracting Officer.

ARTICLE H.3. CONTINUED BAN ON FUNDING OF HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH Pursuant to
Public Law(s) cited in paragraph b. , below, NIH is prohibited from using
appropriated funds to support human embryo research. Contract funds may not be
used for (1) the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes; or
(2) research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or
knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for
research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 46.208(a)(2) and Section 498(b) of the
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289g(b)). The term "human embryo or
embryos" includes any organism, not protected as a human subject under 45 CFR 46
as of the date of the enactment of this Act, that is derived by fertilization,
parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human gametes or
human diploid cells.
        Additionally, in accordance with a March 4, 1997 Presidential

ARTICLE H.6. SALARY RATE LIMITATION LEGISLATION PROVISIONS

a.      Pursuant to Public Law(s) cited in paragraph b., below, no NIH Fiscal
        Year funds may be used to pay the direct salary of an individual through
        this contract at a rate in excess of applicable amount shown for the
        fiscal year covered. Direct salary is exclusive of fringe benefits,
        overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as
        "indirect cost" or "facilities and administrative (F&A) costs"). Direct
        salary has the same meaning as the term "institutional base salary." An
        individual's direct salary (or institutional base salary) is the annual
        compensation that the contractor pays for an individual's appointment
        whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient
        care or other activities. Direct salary (or institutional base salary)
        excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside
        of duties to the contractor. The per year salary rate limit also applies
        to individuals proposed under subcontracts. It does not apply to fees
        paid to consultants.. If this is a multiple year contract, it may be
        subject to unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's
        salary rate exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future HHS
        appropriation acts.

                            GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS

                                 SEPTEMBER 2002

The major objective of this contract are to provide gene expression analyses for
acquiring high quality gene expression data from chemical treated or
environmentally-stressed biological systems.

A.      Gene Expression Analysis

        The Contractor shall provide gene expression analysis for obtaining high
        quality gene expression profiles derived from toxicant treated or
        environmentally-stressed biological samples. With the rapid advance of
        genomic information for multiple organisms, this platform must be highly
        flexible to change and grow through the course of the contract. The
        Contractor shall provide a validated, state-,of-the-art mRNA microarray
        expression methodology.

        The goal of this objective is to conduct initial pilot studies with the
        NIEHS Microarray Center (NMC) to validate the Contractor's methodology
        and to establish a baseline for merging data from the current NIEHS gene
        expression database with the prototype database generated in this
        contract. Over the term of this contract, it is expected that the number
        of investigators supported by the service of this contract will grow in
        order to increase the rate at which gene expression profile information
        may be accumulated. The details and phasing are provided below:

        (1)     Component 1 - Establishment of a gene expression platform that
                demonstrates utility and validity through data generation and
                exchange with the NCT.

                The NCT has been conducting gene expression experiments with
                rat, mouse or human cell lines through the NIEHS Microarray
                Center (NMC) using an in-house generated cDNA microarray
                platform for hybridizations. It is the desire of the NCT to
                build on the expertise already existing at the NMC to lay the
                groundwork for the development of a prototype toxicological
                microarray gene expression database. In order to facilitate
                this, the following objectives have been set:

                (a)     Provision of critical components of the Contractor's
                        gene expression platform to the NCT.

                        Designated members of the NCT (i.e., members of the NMC)
                        will serve to validate the work of the Contractor.
                        Therefore the Contractor shall provide the NMC the
                        critical components of its gene expression platform.
                        This will include microarray chips (details discussed in
                        the following paragraph), protocols and any, specialized
                        supplies or tools for labeling and hybridizing RNA to
                        these chips, array analysis tools, and training and
                        support in the use of these components as well as
                        support in production of

                        appropriate files/formats for integration into the
                        image. analysis software and databases being used by the
                        NMC. It is anticipated that this activity will occur
                        during months 1 to 6 after the contract award.

                        The Contractor shall provide high quality genomic
                        resources for the generation of sufficient number of
                        chips for replicate analysis of these samples. In the
                        case of a cDNA-based platform, all clones shall be fully
                        sequence verified (greater than 95%) and clones shall be
                        provided upon request for further validation. In the
                        case of an oligonucleotide-based platform, sequences of

                        hybridization of each gene shall be provided by the
                        Contractor, and information on the accuracy of the
                        sequences on the chip shall be assessed and provided.
                        High quality control measures/information should be
                        documented and provided. Regardless of the platform, it
                        is anticipated that the chips shall contain sequences to
                        provide gene expression information on a minimum of
                        20,000 genes/chip. This number may be increased,
                        decreased, or the genes represented may be modified as
                        the situation requires. The addition of other species
                        (i.e., yeast or Drosophila may be required in later
                        stages of the contract). In addition, appropriate and
                        flexible chip layouts must be allowed to adapt to the
                        scanning/image analysis capabilities of the NCT
                        consortium members. Provision of chip layouts and gene
                        annotation of data files should be made. Finally, chips
                        that represent the entire genome of an organism may be
                        required when possible. Each chip shall contain DNA
                        sequences that serve as positive and negative controls
                        as well as sequences that may be used for normalization
                        of one array to another. Adequate numbers of replicate
                        analyses to get reliable interpretation of significant
                        gene expression changes will be performed.

                (b)     Conduct of proof-of-principle experiments to validate
                the gene expression platform.

                        It is anticipated that the NMC for the NCT will conduct
                        up to four (4) large proof-of-principle experiments
                        focused on the examination of chemical or environmental
                        stress effects on model organisms. RNA samples will be
                        generated by the NMC or a contractor. It is expected
                        that a subset of the samples from these studies will be
                        split between the NMC and the Contractor for the purpose
                        of validation of the microarray methods and analysis at
                        each location.

                        In the first component of this project it is anticipated
                        that each experiment will consist of approximately 200
                        RNA samples to be analyzed in replicates (up to 4 chips
                        per sample) that may be derived from rat, mouse, or
                        human cell models. (Time frame month 7 - 12).

                (c)     Exchange of information between the Contractor and the
                NMC.

                        An area of focus is the comparison, validation and
                        quality assessment of the Contractor platform. Data
                        generated at both the NCT and the Contractor's site will
                        be shared. Data generated in Section (b) and in other

                        gene expression studies conducted by the NMC on their
                        current cDNA microarray platform as well as on the
                        Contractor's platform will be deposited for use by NCT
                        personnel into a prototype gene expression database
                        possibly developed by the Contractor (according to the
                        criteria below), through another contract or on site at
                        NIEHS. It is anticipated that this activity will occur
                        during months 7 to 60 after the contract award.

        (2)     COMPONENT 2 - DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS AND PRACTICES FOR
                INCORPORATION OF DATA FROM NIEHS EXTRAMURALLY SUPPORTED
                CONSORTIA.

                In order to develop consistency between the NMC and the
                extramural laboratories, up to four (4) validation baseline
                toxicology experiments involving rat, mouse, or human cell lines
                will be performed. These experiments may be conducted in rat,
                mouse or human models. It is anticipated that some of the
                extramural laboratories and the NMC will perform identical
                experiments. In general, these experiments will take the
                following format. (Time frame month 7-24).

                (a)     First multiple hybridization experiments on several RNA
                        extractions from various cell lines grown in normal
                        logarithmic stage will be compared among all platforms.

                (b)     These cell lines will be perturbed by several known
                        physiological or other type of stresses or known
                        toxicants to provide specific toxicant signatures.

                (c)     Several unknown compounds to provide comparisons to the
                        known library.

                (d)     These experiments will generate as many as 2400
                        biological samples in the first 24 months. Once
                        baselines have been set between the Contractor, the NMC
                        and extramural laboratories, and preliminary validation,
                        proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted, all
                        contract services will be provided under the direction
                        of the Project Officer for conducting gene expression
                        analysis on studies.

                        The Contractor, under direction of the Project Officer,
                        shall provide chips and/or perform RNA gene expression
                        analysis (labeling and hybridizations to their
                        chips-details for chips outlined in (1)(b)) for specific
                        experiments. These experiments may include, but not be
                        limited to: additional experiments with cell lines,
                        analysis of tissues following treatment of animals with
                        specific toxicants, environmental stresses, or the study
                        of developmental changes within an organism. It is
                        anticipated that the RNA will be extracted by the
                        specific performing members at their home sites and
                        simultaneous RNA analysis will be performed by the NMC
                        on site as well as by the Contractor at the Contractor's
                        site. (Time frame month 7-60).

                        The Contractor shall:

                        and the extramural laboratories using the Contractor
                        provided microarray chips. Some of the RNA will also be
                        analyzed on site with the NMC or the extramural
                        laboratory platforms.

                (f)     provide informatics support of chip layouts and gene
                        specifications

                In addition, besides the core studies listed above, there may up
                to four (4) optional studies per year encompassing up to a total
                of 2400 samples. The NMC will coordinate compiling purified RNA
                samples for processing by the contractor for the National
                Toxicology Program (NIP) or other collaborators. These samples
                will require processing from RNA through scanning/image
                processing steps. The optional studies will be activated as
                needed.

                        consultant by name or category as set forth in the
                        contract's Advance Understanding or in the COA letter,
                        as well as the effort (i.e., number of hours, days,
                        etc.) and rate being billed.

                        travel is travel outside of Canada, the United States

                        organization located outside Canada, the United States
                        and its territories and possessions, foreign travel
                        means travel outside that country. Foreign travel must

                        elements and dollar amounts separately. If the contract
                        contains restrictions on any cost element, that cost
                        element must be listed separately.

        (l)     Cost of Money (COM) - Cite the CQM factor and base in effect

When a line item varies by plus or minus 10 percent, i.e., the percentage
arrived at by dividing Column F by Column G, an explanation of the variance
should be submitted. In the case of an overrun (net negative variance), this
submission shall not be deemed as notice under the Limitation of Cost (Funds)
Clause of the contract.

Modifications: Any modification in the amount negotiated for an item since the
preceding report should be listed in the appropriate cost category.

Expenditures Not Negotiated: An expenditure for an item for which no amount was
negotiated (e.g., at the discretion of the contractor in performance of its
contract) should be listed in the appropriate cost category and all columns
filled in, except for 0. Column H will of course show a 100 percent variance and
will be explained along with those identified under H above.

HHSAR 352.223-70 SAFETY AND HEALTH (JANUARY 2001)

(a)     To help ensure the protection of the life and health of all persons, and
        to help prevent damage to property, the Contractor shall comply with all
        Federal, State and local laws and regulations applicable to the work
        being performed under this contract. These laws are implemented and/or
        enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and
        Health Administration and other agencies at the Federal, State and local
        levels (Federal, State and local regulatory/enforcement agencies).

(b)     Further, the Contractor shall take or cause to be taken additional
        safety measures as the Contracting Officer in conjunction with the
        project or other appropriate officer, determines to be reasonably
        necessary. If compliance with these additional safety measures results
        in an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for performance
        of any part of work under this contract, an equitable adjustment will be
        made in accordance with the applicable "Changes" Clause set forth in
        this contract.

(c)     The Contractor shall maintain an accurate record of, and promptly report
        to the Contracting Officer, all accidents or incidents resulting in the
        exposure of persons to toxic substances, hazardous materials or
        hazardous operations; the injury or death of any person; and/or damage
        to property incidental to work performed under the contract and all
        violations for which the Contractor has been cited by any Federal, State
        or local regulatory/enforcement agency. The report shall include a copy
        of the notice of violation and the findings of any inquiry or
        inspection, and an analysis addressing the impact these violations may
        have on the work remaining to be performed. The report shall also state
        the required action(s), if any, to be taken to correct any, violation(s)
        noted by the Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agency and
        the time frame allowed by the agency to accomplish the necessary
        corrective action.

(d)     If the Contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly with the Federal,
        State or local regulatory/enforcement agency's directive(s) regarding
        any violation(s) and prescribed corrective action(s), the Contracting
        Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until
        satisfactory corrective action (as approved by the Federal, State or
        local regulatory/enforcement agencies) has been taken and documented to
        the Contracting Officer. No part of the time lost due to any stop work
        order shall be subject to a claim for extension of time or costs or
        damages by the Contractor.

(e)     The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each
        subcontract involving toxic substances, hazardous materials, or
        operations. Compliance with the provisions of this clause by
        subcontractors will be the responsibility of the Contractor.
