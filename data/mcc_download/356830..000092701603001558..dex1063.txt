        2.      THE CLOSING.

                2.1     Closing Dates. Each closing of the purchase and sale of
the Shares to Purchaser hereunder (the "Closings") shall be held at the offices
of the Company, within thirty (30) days of the achievement of each of the
milestones referenced in Section 2.2 hereof, at 5:00 p.m., Massachusetts time,
or at such other date, time and place as the Company and Purchaser mutually
agree upon, orally or in writing (the "Closing Dates"). On each Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Purchaser the Shares registered in the name of
Purchaser.

                2.2     Schedule of Closings. Purchaser shall purchase at the
Fair Market Value per share (a) that number of shares equal to ***** upon
satisfaction of the *****; (b) that number of shares ***** upon satisfaction of
*****; and (c) that number of shares equal to *****. For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Fair Market Value" means 125% of the average closing stock price
over the period of time *****. The Company and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that at no time shall Purchaser's equity interest in the Company ***** of the
outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock. If, at the time of a Closing,
the requirement to purchase Shares at such Closing, in accordance with the
milestones set forth above would result in Purchaser owning an equity interest
***** of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock at such time,
Purchaser's obligation to purchase such Shares as such Closing shall be limited
to that amount of Common Stock that would result in the cumulative purchase of
an equity interest of ***** of the Company's Common Stock, and Purchaser shall
have no further obligation to purchase additional stock at a later date or of
any other form of payment to the Company with respect to that particular
milestone.

                2.3     Option of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the obligation of the Company to sell Shares to
Purchaser upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth above will be at the
option of the Company. If the Company elects not to sell Shares to Purchaser,
then it must deliver written notice to Purchaser of such election within ten
business days of the date the Company is notified of satisfaction of the
applicable milestone. If the Company so elects, Purchaser will be relieved of
its obligation to purchase such Shares and will be under no further obligation
to purchase such Shares at a future date or make any other form of payment to
the Company with respect to that particular milestone.

appropriate in connection with its purchase of the Shares.

The Securities shall not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
from Purchaser to a transferee other than (i) in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7 or (ii) in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act ("Rule 144") or otherwise in accordance with the
Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state of the United
States or any other applicable jurisdiction, provided that Purchaser provides
prior notice to the Company and, if reasonably requested by the Company,
delivers to the Company an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, that such disposition will not require registration under the
Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company hereby consents to
and agrees to register on the books of the Company and with any transfer agent
for the securities of the Company, any transfer of Shares by Purchaser to an
"affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule 144) of such Purchaser, provided
that the transferee certifies to the Company that it is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act and that it is acquiring
the Shares solely for investment purposes. As a condition of such transfer, any
such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of Section 7 of
this Agreement and, so long as Purchaser transfers ***** of the Shares held by
it at such time to the transferee, such transferee shall have the rights of
Purchaser under Section 7 of this Agreement; provided, however, with respect to
any subsequent transfer of Shares by any such subsequent transferee, such Shares
shall not be considered Registrable Securities (as defined below) under this
Agreement. Purchaser will be required to notify any subsequent transferee of any
then existing resale restrictions as set forth above and to comply with the
provisions of this Section 7.

                7.2     Restrictive Legends. Each certificate representing any

stock split or stock dividend) shall (unless otherwise permitted by the
provisions hereof) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially
in the following form (in addition to any legend required under applicable
federal or state securities laws):

        THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
        INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
        1933, AS AMENDED. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE
        ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM. THE SECURITIES
        REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER HEREOF ARE
        SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS, AND
        THE HOLDER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE (INCLUDING
        ANY FUTURE HOLDER) IS BOUND BY THE TERMS OF A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
        BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY (COPIES OF WHICH MAY BE
        OBTAINED FROM THE COMPANY).

        Such legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without legend: (i) if the Shares have been sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement, or (ii) if Rule 144(k) may be utilized by the seller of
such security, or (iii) if such legend is not required under applicable
requirements of the Securities Act.

                7.3     Registration Procedures and Expenses.

                        (a)     Shelf Registration.

                        (i)     Shelf Registration Statement. Upon the request
of the Holders of a majority of Registrable Securities (as defined below), the
Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC
promptly, but in no event later than ten business days, after receipt of such
request a Registration Statement (as defined below) for an offering to be made
on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act
registering the resale from time to time by the Holders (as defined below) of
all of the Registrable Securities acquired by the Holders at such Closing (each
a "Shelf Registration Statement"). *****. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Registration Statement" shall mean any registration statement under the
Securities Act of the Company that covers any of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, including the related Prospectus,
all amendments and supplements to such registration statement, including pre-
and post-effective amendments, all exhibits thereto and all material
incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such
registration statement; "Registrable Securities" shall mean the Shares and any
shares of common stock which may be issued or distributed with respect to, or in
exchange for, such Registrable Securities pursuant to a stock dividend, stock
split or other distribution, merger, consolidation, recapitalization or
reclassification or similar transaction; "Holders" shall mean any person owning
or having the right to acquire Registrable Securities or any assignee thereof in
accordance with Sections 7.1 or 9.4; and "Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus
included in any Registration Statement (including a prospectus that discloses
information previously omitted from a prospectus filed as part of an effective
registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A),

                                       12

as amended or supplemented by any prospectus supplement, with respect to the
terms of the offering of any portion of the Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement and all other amendments and supplements to such
prospectus, including post-effective amendments, and all material incorporated
by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such prospectus. The
Shelf Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is
unavailable, another appropriate form permitting registration of such
Registrable Securities for resale by such Holders in accordance with the methods
of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement (such methods of
distribution to include underwritten offerings and other methods designated in
writing by the Holders pursuant to Section 7.3(d)). The Company shall not permit
any securities other than the Registrable Securities to be included in the Shelf
Registration Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act by the date (the "Shelf Effectiveness Deadline Date") that, if
the Registration Statement is to be filed on Form S-3, is thirty (30) days after
receipt of the request for such filing, and, if the Registration Statement is to
be filed on Forms S-1, S-2, or any other appropriate form permitting
registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by such Holders, is
ninety (90) days after receipt of the request for such filing. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act (subject to Section 7.3(a)(v))
until the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the date such Shelf
Registration Statement is declared effective and (y) the sale of all of the
Registrable Securities included in the Shelf Registration Statement (such period
as may be extended in accordance with the proviso in Section 7.3(a)(ii), the
"Shelf Effectiveness Period"). Each Holder agrees that if such Holder wishes to
sell Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and
related Prospectus, it will do so only in accordance with this Section 7.3(a).

                        (ii)    Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the initial
Shelf Registration Statement or any Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement
ceases to be effective for any reason at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness
Period (other than because of the sale of all of the Registrable Securities),
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in any event
shall within twenty (20) days of such cessation of effectiveness (or, if the
cessation of effectiveness occurs during a Deferral Period, within five Business
Days of the end of such Deferral Period) amend the Shelf Registration Statement
in a manner reasonably expected by the Company to obtain withdrawal of the order
suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional "shelf" Registration
Statement pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act covering all of the
Registrable Securities (a "Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement") to permit
registration of the Registrable Securities. If a Subsequent Shelf Registration
Statement is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under
the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing or, if
filed during a Deferral Period, immediately after completion of the Deferral
Period, and to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective until the
end of the Shelf Effectiveness Period; provided, however, that, unless all
Registrable Securities included on the Shelf Registration Statement have been
sold, the Shelf Effectiveness Period shall be extended by the aggregate number
of days such Registration Statement was not effective as a result of Deferral
Periods or Transaction Delay Periods. As used herein, the term "Shelf
Registration Statement" means the Shelf Registration Statement and any
Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement.

                        (iii)   Amendments to Shelf Registration Statement. The
Company shall promptly supplement and amend the Shelf Registration Statement and
any related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf
Registration Statement, if required by the Securities Act or as requested by
Purchaser or by the Shelf Underwriter.

                        (iv)    Underwritten Syndicated Offerings.

                                (A)     If one or more Holders proposes to sell
Registrable Securities in an underwritten syndicated offering pursuant to the
Shelf Registration Statement, such Holder or Holders may request the Company in
writing to effect such underwritten syndicated offering by supplement or
amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, stating the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold. The Company and all Holders proposing to
distribute Registrable Securities through such underwritten syndicated offering
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriters for the offering.

                                (B)     Any underwritten syndicated offering
requested pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iv) shall be underwritten by an
underwriter selected by the Holders (the "Shelf Underwriter").

                                (C)     Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to effect an
offering pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iv) during any Transaction Delay Period
(as defined below) if, promptly, but in no event later than three business days,
following the Company's receipt of a request from a Holder to effect an offering
pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iv), the Company furnishes such Holder with a
certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company (a "Transaction Delay
Notice") to the effect that the Company prior to the Company's receipt of such
request, had commenced preparations for the filing of a registration statement
pertaining to a public offering of securities of the Company for the account of
the Company (a "Company Offering"). Any "Transaction Delay Period" shall be the
period commencing on the day the Company furnishes a Transaction Delay Notice
and continuing until the ***** following the effectiveness of the registration
statement relating to the applicable Company Offering, (B) promptly after the
abandonment of the applicable Company Offering, or (C) ***** after the date of
the Transaction Delay Notice. The Company may deliver no more than *****
Transaction Delay Notices in any twelve-month period, and the aggregate duration
of all Transaction Delay Periods shall not exceed ***** in any twelve-month
period. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
registration statement relating to any such Company Offering to become effective
as soon as possible.

                                (D)     *****

                                (E)     If in an underwritten syndicated
offering requested pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iv), the Shelf Underwriter
reasonably advises the Company in writing that, in its opinion, the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the
number that can be sold in such offering at a price reasonably related to the
then current market value of such securities, there shall be included in such
offering only the

                                       14

Registrable Securities that the Shelf Underwriter so advises may be sold at a
price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities.

                        (v)     Suspension of Shelf Registration Statement. Upon
(A) the issuance by the SEC of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation of proceedings with respect to
the Shelf Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the Securities
Act or (B) the occurrence of a Material Event (as defined below) or the
non-availability of financial statements required in the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company shall (i) in the case of clause (B) above, subject to the
next to last sentence of this Section 7.3(a)(v), as promptly as practicable
prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein
by reference or file any other required document that would be incorporated by
reference into the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus so that such
Shelf Registration Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the related
Prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, and, in the case of a
post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, subject to the
next to last sentence of this Section 7.3(a)(v), use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause it to be declared effective as soon as possible, and (ii) give
notice to the Holders named as selling security holders in the Prospectus that
the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement is suspended (a "Deferral
Notice"). Upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, each Holder agrees not to sell
any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until such
Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided
for in clause (i) above, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that
the Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such Prospectus. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed (x) in the case of clause
(A) above, as promptly as is practicable, but ***** after the Deferral Notice is
given to the Holders, or (y) in the case of clause (B) above, as soon as in the
good faith judgment of the Company the public disclosure of such Material Event
would not be prejudicial to or contrary to the interests of the Company, but
***** after the Deferral Notice is given to the Holders. The period during which
the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and any related Prospectus
is suspended pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(v) (the "Deferral Period") shall not
exceed ***** in any three (3) month period and ***** during the Shelf
Effectiveness Period. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Event"
shall mean any event or the existence of any fact as a result of which the
Company shall determine in its reasonable discretion that a Registration
Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or any Prospectus shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (including, in any such
case, as a result of the non-availability of financial statements).

                        (b)     Holders Incidental Registration. Subject to
Section 7.3(f), the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that it shall
file a registration statement under the Securities Act (other than (i) a
registration statement providing for an offering on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act or (ii) a registration
statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar forms) registering an
underwritten offering of Common Stock for cash consideration on any form that
also would permit the registration of the Registrable Securities and such filing
is to be on its behalf and/or on behalf of selling holders of the Company's
securities, the Company shall each such time promptly give each Holder written
notice of such determination setting forth the date on which the Company
proposes to file such registration statement, and advising each Holder of its
right to have Registrable Securities included in such registration. The Company
will select the managing underwriter and all other underwriters in any
underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 7.3(b). Upon the written request
of any Holder received by the Company no later than ten (10) days after the date
of the Company's notice, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause to be registered under the Securities Act all of the Registrable
Securities that each such Holder has so requested to be registered; provided
that if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register
any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement
filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any
reason not to proceed with the proposed registration of the securities to be
sold by it, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each Holder of Registrable Securities and, thereupon, shall be
relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection
with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration
expenses pursuant to Section 7.3(e) in connection therewith). If, in the written
opinion of the managing underwriter, the total amount of such securities to be
so registered, including such Registrable Securities, will exceed the maximum
amount of the Company's securities that can be marketed either (a) at a price
reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, or (b)
without otherwise materially and adversely affecting the entire offering, then
the Company shall include in such registration first (1st), all the securities
the Company proposes to sell for its own account or is required to register on
behalf of any third party exercising demand registration rights and without
having the adverse effect referred to above, and second (2nd), all Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration by the Holders pursuant
to this Section 7.3(b) and all shares of Common Stock requested to be included
by third parties exercising the rights similar to those granted in this Section
7.3(b) up to the number which the Company has been advised can be sold in such
offering without having either of the adverse effects referred to above. The
number of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by the Holders pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) shall be limited to
such extent and shall be allocated pro rata among all such requesting Holders
and third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in this Section
7.3(b) on the basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities each such
Holder has requested to be included in such registration and the number of
shares of Common Stock requested to be included in such registration by such
third parties.

                        (c)     Obligations of the Company. Whenever required
under Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as
expeditiously as possible:

                        (i)     prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such

and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the Shelf Effectiveness Period in the case of the Shelf
Registration Statement or for a period not in excess of sixty (60) days (or such
shorter period during which the distribution of securities thereunder continues)
in the case of all other Registration Statements contemplated by this Agreement,
cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any Prospectus supplement
required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to the
Securities Act and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by
the seller or sellers thereof, and furnish to the Holders of the Registrable
Securities copies of any such amendments and supplements prior to their being
used or filed with the SEC, which amendments and supplements will be subject to
the review of the Holders and their counsel;

under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the
United States as the Holders shall request for the distribution of the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to qualify to do business in or to file a general consent to service of
process in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of
this paragraph (v) be obligated to do so;

                        (f)     Underwriting Requirements. In connection with
any underwritten offering, the Company shall not be required under Section
7.3(b) to include Registrable Securities in such underwritten offering unless
the Holder of such Registrable Securities accepts the terms of the underwriting

the underwriters selected by the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                7.4     Indemnification. For the purpose of this Section 7.4:

                        (a)     the term "Selling Stockholder" shall include
Holders and any "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule 144) of any such
Holder, and their respective permitted transferees and assigns;

                        (b)     the term "untrue statement" shall, with respect
to any Registration Statement, include any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the related Registration Statement, or
any omission or alleged omission to state in the related Registration Statement
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, not misleading, and, with respect to any Prospectus, include
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the related Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state in the
related Prospectus a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                        (i)     The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Selling Stockholder (and each person, if any, who controls the
Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each
officer of the Selling Stockholder and each director of the Selling Stockholder)
from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Selling
Stockholder (or any such officer, director or controlling person) may become
subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise) insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out
of, or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or (ii) any failure by the
Company to fulfill any undertaking included in the related Registration
Statement, and the Company will reimburse the Selling Stockholder promptly as
incurred for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating,
defending or preparing to defend any such action, proceeding or claim, provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that such loss, claim, damage or liability (A) arises out of, or is based upon,
an untrue statement made in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by the Selling Stockholder specifically for use in preparation of the
Registration Statement or Prospectus (which has not been subsequently corrected
or supplemented), (B) results directly from the failure of the Selling
Stockholder to comply in all material respects with its covenants and agreements
contained in Section 7 hereof respecting sale of the Shares, or (C) arises out
of any statement or omission in any Prospectus that is corrected in any
subsequent Prospectus that was delivered to the Selling Stockholder prior to the
pertinent sale or sales by the Selling Stockholder.

                                       21

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST

                        (ii)    The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company (and each person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each officer of the
Company and each director of the Company) from and against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities to which the Company (or any such officer, director or
controlling person) may become subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise),
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue
statement if such untrue statement was made in conformity with written
information furnished by the Selling Stockholder specifically for use in
preparation of the Registration Statement or Prospectus, and the Selling
Stockholder will reimburse the Company promptly as incurred for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, defending or preparing to
defend any such action, proceeding or claim, provided, however, that the Selling
Stockholder need not indemnify any of the aforementioned indemnitees for such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any statement or omission in
any Prospectus that is corrected in any subsequent Prospectus if the subsequent
Prospectus was furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, claim,
damage or liability prior to the pertinent transaction or transactions. The
Selling Stockholder will reimburse the Company (or such officer, director or
controlling person), as the case may be, for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such
indemnifiable action, proceeding or claim; provided that the Selling
Stockholder's obligation to indemnify the Company shall be limited to the net
amount received by the Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Shares to which
the loss related.

                        (iii)   Promptly after receipt by any indemnified person
of a notice of a claim or the beginning of any action in respect of which
indemnity is to be sought against an indemnifying person pursuant to this
Section 7.4, such indemnified person shall notify the indemnifying person in
writing of such claim or of the commencement of such action, but the omission to
so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it
may have to any indemnified party under this Section 7.4 (except to the extent
that such omission materially and adversely affects the indemnifying party's
ability to defend such action) or from any liability otherwise than under this
Section 7.4. Subject to the provisions hereinafter stated, in case any such
action shall be brought against an indemnified person, the indemnifying person
shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it shall elect
by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving
the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, shall be entitled to assume
the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
person. After notice from the indemnifying person to such indemnified person of
its election to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying person shall not
be liable to such indemnified person for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified person in connection with the defense thereof,
provided, however, that if there exists or shall exist a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate, in the opinion of counsel to the indemnified
person, for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified person and such
indemnifying person or any "affiliate" or "associate" (as those terms are
defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) thereof, the
indemnified person shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of
such indemnifying person; provided, however, that no indemnifying person shall
be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel
(together with appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties. In no
event shall any indemnifying person be liable in respect of any amounts paid in
settlement of any action unless the indemnifying person shall have approved the
terms of such settlement; provided that

                                       22

<PAGE>

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST

such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No indemnifying person shall,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified person, effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
indemnified person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have
been sought hereunder by such indemnified person, unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of such indemnified person from all liability
on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

                        (iv)    If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7.4 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party under subsection (i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Selling
Stockholder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or other
matters which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, in the case of an untrue statement, whether the untrue statement
relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Selling
Stockholder on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement. The
Company and the Selling Stockholder agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (iv) were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if Selling Stockholder were treated as one entity for
such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (iv).
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
in this subsection (iv) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (iv), Selling Stockholder shall not be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net amount received
by Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Shares to which such loss relates
exceeds the amount of any damages which Selling Stockholder has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue statement. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Selling Stockholder's obligations
in this subsection to contribute are several in proportion to their sales of
Shares to which such loss relates and not joint.

                        (v)     The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge
that they are sophisticated business persons who were represented by counsel
during the negotiations regarding the provisions hereof including, without
limitation, the provisions of this Section 7.4, and are fully informed regarding
said provisions. They further acknowledge that the provisions of this Section
7.4 fairly allocate the risks in light of the ability of the parties to
investigate the Company and its business in order to assure that adequate
disclosure is made in the Registration Statement as required by the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. The parties are advised that federal or state public
policy as interpreted by the courts in certain jurisdictions may be contrary to
certain of the provisions of this Section 7.4, and the parties hereto hereby
expressly waive and

                                       23

<PAGE>

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST

relinquish any right or ability to assert such public policy as a defense to a
claim under this Section 7.4 and further agree not to attempt to assert any such
defense.

                7.5     Termination of Conditions and Obligations. The
conditions precedent imposed by this Section 7 upon the transferability of the
Shares shall cease and terminate as to any particular number of the Shares (i)
when such Shares shall have been effectively registered under the Securities Act
and sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the intended method of
disposition set forth in the Registration Statement covering such Shares, (ii)
when such Shares are sold pursuant to Rule 144 or (iii) at such time as an
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company shall have been
rendered to the effect that such conditions are not necessary in order to comply
with the Securities Act.

                7.6     Information Available. So long as a Registration
Statement is effective covering the resale of Shares owned by Purchaser, the
Company will furnish to Purchaser:

                        (a)     as soon as practicable after it is available,
one copy of (i) its Annual Report to Stockholders (which Annual Report shall
contain financial statements audited in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles by a national firm of certified public accountants), (ii)
its Annual Report on Form 10-K and amendments, if any, and (iii) its Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q and amendments, if any (the foregoing, in each case,
excluding exhibits);

                        (b)     upon the request of Purchaser, all exhibits
excluded by the parenthetical to subparagraph (a) of this Section 7.6 as filed
with the SEC and publicly available and all other information that is made
available to shareholders; and

                        (c)     promptly upon the request of Purchaser, an
adequate number of copies of the Prospectuses to supply to any other party
requiring such Prospectuses; and the Company, upon the request of Purchaser,
will meet with Purchaser or a representative thereof at the Company's
headquarters, or such other mutually agreed upon location, to discuss all
information relevant for disclosure in a Registration Statement covering the
Shares and will otherwise cooperate with any Purchaser conducting an
investigation for the purpose of reducing or eliminating such Purchaser's
exposure to liability under the Securities Act, including the reasonable
production of information at the Company's headquarters.

        8.      COMPANY REPORTS FILED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

                With a view to making available to Purchaser the benefits of
Rule 144 and other rules or regulations of the SEC that may permit the Purchaser
to sell the Shares without registration, for the first two years in which
Purchaser owns Shares issued in each Closing, the Company covenants and agrees
to (a) comply with all of the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
applicable to it and shall comply with all other public information reporting
requirements of the SEC that are conditions to the availability of Rule 144 for
the sale of the Shares and (b) furnish to Purchaser, upon request, a written
statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of
Rule 144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and such other information as
may be reasonably requested in order to avail the Purchaser of any rule or
regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such Shares without
registration.

        9.      MISCELLANEOUS.

                9.1     Waivers and Amendments. The terms of this Agreement may
be waived or amended only with the written consent of the Company and Purchaser.

laws. The Company and Purchaser each hereby irrevocably submit to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of Delaware, both state and
federal, for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
this Agreement.

                9.3     Survival. The covenants and agreements made under
Section 7 of this Agreement shall survive any Closing or any termination of the
Collaboration Agreement.

                9.4     Successors and Assigns. The provisions hereof shall
inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs,
executors and administrators of the parties hereto. In the event of any merger,
consolidation or acquisition involving the Company in which the Company is not
the surviving entity, the Company's obligations hereunder, including the
continued registration of the Shares pursuant to Section 7 hereof shall be
expressly or by operation of law assumed by the surviving entity.

                9.5     Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements constitute
the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard
to the subject hereof; provided, however, that nothing in the Transaction
Agreements shall be deemed to terminate or supersede the provisions of any
confidentiality and disclosure agreements executed by the parties hereto prior
to the date hereof, which agreements shall continue in full force and effect
until terminated in accordance with their respective terms.

                9.7     Severability of this Agreement. If any provision of this
Agreement shall be judicially determined to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                9.8     Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise
any right, power or remedy accruing to Company or to the Purchaser, upon any
breach or default of any party hereto under this Agreement, shall impair any
such right, power or remedy of Company or the Purchaser nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or of any similar breach of default thereafter occurring; nor shall any
waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any
waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of
Company or the Purchaser of any breach of default under this Agreement or any
waiver on the part of Company or the Purchaser of any provisions or conditions
of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this
Agreement, or by law or otherwise afforded to Company or the Purchaser shall be
cumulative and not alternative.

                9.9     Titles and Subtitles. The titles of the paragraphs and
subparagraphs of this Agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not,
by themselves, determine the construction of this Agreement.

number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one instrument.

rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of
the Purchaser and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under
this Agreement. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations
described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in any action for
specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate.

                9.12    Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to
enforce any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof is
validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to recover
