     remuneration, length of service or hours worked shall not infringe Rule 1.2
     unless,  where more than one of these three factors is used, paragraph 9(4)
     of Schedule 8 is not complied with.

2 PARTICIPATION CONTRACT

2.1  Holding Period: A Participation Contract (which shall include a Partnership
     Share Agreement which provides for the  Appropriation  of Matching  Shares)
     shall specify the Holding Period applicable to the Free Shares (or Matching

     subject to its provisions,  bind the Eligible Employee in contract with the
     Company:

       (a) to permit any Plan Shares which are subject to a Holding  Period  and
           Appropriated  to him or acquired on his behalf to remain in the hands
           of the Trustee throughout the Holding Period applicable to them; and

       (b) not to assign, charge or otherwise dispose of his beneficial interest

     extent (if any) to which those  Shares will be  forfeited  if other than in
     the event of Permitted Cessation:

       (a) the Participant ceases to be in Employment;

                                       18

       (b) the Participant withdraws the Shares from the Plan; or

       (c) in the case of Matching  Shares only, the  Participant  withdraws the
           Partnership  Shares in respect of which  those  Matching  Shares were
           Appropriated to him

     before the expiry of the period  (not  exceeding   three  years)  from  the
     Appropriation  Day of the relevant  Shares  specified in the  Participation
     Contract.  If any Shares are  forfeited,  a  Participant  shall cease to be
     beneficially entitled to those Shares.

3    INELIGIBILITY DUE TO PARTICIPATION IN OTHER SHARE PLANS

3.1  Free  Shares:   An   individual   shall  not  be  eligible  to  receive  an

     for the failure to meet a performance target.

4    INELIGIBILITY DUE TO MATERIAL INTEREST IN CLOSE COMPANY

     An individual shall not be eligible to participate  in the Plan at any time
     when he has (or has within the preceding 12 months had) a Material Interest

<PAGE>

6    ACQUISITION OF SHARES FOR THE PLAN

     Acquisition  of Shares:  The  Trustee,  upon the  direction of the Company,
     shall acquire Shares to be  Appropriated  as Free Shares or Matching Shares
     or to be  acquired  as  Partnership  Shares or  Dividend  Shares  either by
     acquiring  authorised  but  unissued  Shares or  treasury  Shares  from The
     Coca-Cola Company or by purchasing Shares on the market or otherwise.

7    RIGHTS ATTACHING TO PLAN SHARES

     Rights attaching to Plan Shares: Where the Trustee Appropriates or acquires
     Plan  Shares  a  proportion  of  which  rank  for  any  dividend  or  other
     distribution  or other rights  attaching to Shares by reference to a record
     date preceding the relevant  Appropriation  Day or  Acquisition  Date and a
     proportion  of  which do not,  then  the  Shares  to be  allocated  to each
     Qualifying  Employee  shall,  so  far  as  practicable,   be  in  the  same
     proportions of Shares with and without the rights.

8    RIGHTS ISSUES

8.1  Instructions to the Trustee:  Whenever any rights to be allotted any shares
     or  securities  (on  payment) or rights of any  description  are granted in
     respect of Plan Shares,  each Participant  shall be notified by the Trustee
     of the rights relating to his Plan Shares.  Each Participant may direct the
     Trustee and the Trustee may then, in accordance  with such  directions,  do
     one or more of the following:

       (a) subject to the provision by the  Participant of any necessary  funds,
           take up or sell  all or any of the  rights  or allow  them to  lapse;
           and/or

       (b) sell rights nil paid to the extent necessary to enable the Trustee to
           subscribe in full for the balance of any unsold rights.

     The Participant's directions may be of particular or general application
     and may relate to Plan Shares acquired before and after the date of the
     rights issue.

8.2  Period  for  giving  directions:  The  Trustee  shall  act  upon  any  such
     directions received by it not less than five Dealing Days before the expiry
     of the  period  allowed  for  the  exercise  of  any  such  rights.  If any
     Participant  has not by that time  given  directions  to the  Trustee  with
     regard to those rights and, if  appropriate,  provided any funds  necessary
     for the purpose,  the Trustee shall allow the rights to lapse.  Any Capital
     Receipt  received in consequence of the  non-exercise or sale of any rights
     shall be dealt with by the  Trustee in  accordance  with Clause 11.5 of the
     Deed.

                                       20

8.3  New Shares:  Any shares,  securities  or rights  taken up by the Trustee on
     behalf of any Participant  under Rule 8.1(b) shall,  subject to Rule 13 and
     provided  that the right to so take up shares,  securities  or other rights
     was  conferred  in  respect  of all the  ordinary  shares in The  Coca-Cola
     Company,  form part of the Participant's Plan Shares and shall be deemed to
     have been  Appropriated  to or acquired on behalf of the Participant in the
     same way and at the same time as the  Participant's  Plan Shares in respect
     of which they are allotted.

8.4  Trustee's indemnity:  Nothing in this Rule shall require the Trustee to act
     in any manner which would involve it in any liability unless indemnified to
     its satisfaction by the Participant against such liability.

9    CAPITALISATION ISSUES

     Where any Shares are  allotted by way of  capitalisation  to the Trustee in
     respect of any Participant's  Plan Shares,  those Shares shall form part of
     that  Participant's Plan Shares and be deemed to have been Appropriated to,
     or acquired on behalf of, the  Participant  in the same way and at the same
     time as the  Participant's  Plan  Shares  in  respect  of  which  they  are
     allotted.

10   COMPANY RECONSTRUCTION

10.1 Company  Reconstruction:  This Rule  applies if there occurs in relation to
     any of a Participant's Plan Shares (the "Original Shares") a transaction:

       (a) which results in a new holding (the "New Holding") being equated with
           the Original Shares for the purposes of capital gains tax; or

       (b) which  would have that result but for the fact that what would be the
           new holding consists of or includes a Qualifying Corporate Bond.

       Such a transaction is referred to in the Plan as a Company
       Reconstruction.

10.2 Excluded Shares: If, as part of a Company Reconstruction, any:

       (a) redeemable  shares or  securities  issued  as  mentioned  in  section
           209(2)(a) of the Taxes Act;

       (b) share capital issued in circumstances such that section 210(l) of the
           Taxes Act applies; or

       (c) share capital to which section 249 of the Taxes Act applies,

     is/are  issued  and a charge to income  tax arises in respect of the issue,
     those  shares  shall not form part of the New Holding  for the  purposes of
     this Rule.

                                       21
<PAGE>

10.3 New Shares:  In this Rule "New Shares" means,  subject to Rule 10.2, shares
     comprised in the New Holding  which were issued in respect of, or otherwise
     represent, the Original Shares.

10.4 Effect on Original Shares: For the purposes of the Plan:

       (a) a Company Reconstruction shall be treated as not involving a disposal
           of the Original Shares;

       (b) the date on which any New Shares  are to be  treated  as having  been
           Appropriated to or acquired on behalf of a Participant  shall be that
           on which his Original Shares were so Appropriated or acquired;

       (c) the  conditions  in Part VIII  (types  of share  that may be used) of
           Schedule  8 shall be  treated as  fulfilled  with  respect to any New
           Shares if they were (or were  treated as)  fulfilled  with respect to
           the Original Shares; and

       (d) the provisions of Part X (income tax) and Part XI (capital gains tax)
           of Schedule 8 shall apply in relation to the New Shares as they would
           have applied to the Original Shares.

10.5 References to Plan Shares:  Following a Company Reconstruction,  references
     to a  Participant's  Plan Shares shall be  construed,  subject to the above
     provisions,  as being or, as the case may be, as  including,  references to
     any New Shares.

11   EVENTS DURING HOLDING PERIOD

11.1 Takeover:  A Participant  may during the Holding  Period of any of his Plan
     Shares direct the Trustee to:

       (a) accept an offer for those Plan Shares (the "Original Shares") if such
           acceptance  will  result  in a new  holding  being  equated  with the
           Original Shares for the purposes of capital gains tax;

       (b) accept an offer of a Qualifying Corporate Bond (whether alone or with
           other  assets  or cash or both) for  those  Plan  Shares if the offer
           forms part of a general offer as mentioned in Rule 11.1(c) below;

       (c) accept an offer of cash, with or without other assets, for those Plan
           Shares if the offer  forms part of a general  offer  which is made to
           holders of shares of the same  class as his  shares in The  Coca-Cola
           Company and which is made in the first  instance on a condition  such
           that if it is satisfied the person making the offer will have control
           of The  Coca-Cola  Company,  within the meaning of section 416 of the
           Taxes Act; or

                                       22
<PAGE>

       (d) agree to a transaction  affecting  those Plan Shares or those of them
           which are of a particular  class, if the transaction would be entered
           into pursuant to a compromise, arrangement or scheme applicable to or
           affecting:

          (i) all the ordinary  share capital of The  Coca-Cola  Company or, as
              the case may be, all the shares of the class in question; or

         (ii) all the shares, or all the shares of the class in question, which
              are held by a class of shareholders identified otherwise than by
              reference to their employment or their participation in an
              Employee Share Ownership Plan.

11.2 Compulsory acquisition:  In the event of any Plan Shares being compulsorily
     acquired  under  sections  428 to  430F  of the  Companies  Act  1985,  the
     Participants  concerned  shall be entitled to receive  notification of this
     from the  Trustee as soon as  practicable  after the  acquisition,  and the
     provisions of Rules 13 and 14 shall apply with the necessary changes so far
     as relevant.

12   FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS

12.1 Proportionate  allocation:  Where the Trustee receives additional rights or
     securities  in respect of Plan  Shares  under a Company  Reconstruction,  a
     takeover or compulsory  acquisition  described in Rule 11, a capitalisation
     or rights issue or similar offer or invitation,  the Trustee shall allocate
     those  rights  or  securities  amongst  the  Participants  concerned  on  a
     proportionate  basis.  If that  allocation  gives rise to a  fraction  of a
     security or of a transferable unit of a security (in this Rule "unit"), the
     Trustee  shall  round  the  allocation  down to the  next  whole  unit  and
     aggregate  the  fractions  not  allocated.  The Trustee  shall use its best
     endeavours  to sell  any  rights  or  units  which  are not  allocated  and
     distribute the net proceeds of sale (after deducting from them any expenses
     of  sale  and any  taxation  which  may be  payable  in  respect  of  them)
     proportionately among the Participants whose allocations were rounded down,
     but so that any sum of less than 3 otherwise distributable to a particular
     Participant may be  retained  by the  Trustee and used for the  purposes of
     the Plan.

12.2 Allocation by reference to time of  Appropriation  or  acquisition:  In any
     circumstances in which the Trustee receives New Shares which form part of a
     Participant's Plan Shares, the Trustee shall allocate the New Shares to the
     Participant  by  reference  to  the  relative  times  of  Appropriation  or
     acquisition  of his Plan Shares to which they  relate.  If that  allocation
     gives  rise to a fraction  of a New  Share,  the  Trustee  shall  round the
     allocation  up or down to the next  whole  unit as it,  in its  discretion,
     thinks fit.

                                       23
<PAGE>

13   TRANSFER OF PLAN SHARES

     Subject  to  Clause  11.3  of the  Deed,  the  Trustee  shall,  as  soon as
     practicable  after it is  required  to do so under the Plan,  transfer  the
     legal title to any Plan Shares it holds on behalf of that  Participant into
     the name of the relevant Participant (or his nominee).

14   STAMP DUTY

     Any stamp duty or other expenses  involved in any transfer of Shares by the
     Trustee shall be payable:

       (a) in the case of a  transfer  into the  name of a  Participant,  by the
           Trustee (and reimbursed by the relevant Participating Company); and

       (b) in any other case, by the transferee.

15   NOTICES

15.1 Directions  to the  Trustee:  Any  direction  given to the Trustee by or on
     behalf of a Participant  or any person in whom the  beneficial  interest in
     his Plan Shares is for the time being  vested  under the Plan must be given
     in writing and, unless given electronically, signed by the relevant person.

15.2 Notices:  Any notice  which the  Trustee  gives to any  Eligible  Employee,
     Qualifying Employee or Participant shall be in writing (including by email)
     and  sufficiently  given if delivered to him  personally,  by email or sent
     first class  through the post  pre-paid,  in either case  addressed  to the
     Eligible  Employee,  Qualifying  Employee or Participant at the address (or
     email address) last known to the Trustee (including any address supplied by
     the  relevant  Participating  Company).  If the notice is sent by post,  it
     shall be deemed to have been duly  given on the day  following  the date of
     posting  and in the case of a notice  sent by email,  it shall be deemed to
     have been duly  given when sent  provided  the  Trustee  is not  thereafter
     notified that the email is undeliverable.

16   DISPUTES

     The  decision  of the  Company on any  dispute or  question  affecting  any
     Eligible Employee,  Qualifying Employee or Participant under the Plan shall
     be final and conclusive.

17   TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

     The rights and obligations of an individual  under the terms and conditions
     of his office or employment  shall not be affected by his  participation in
     the Plan or any right he may have to participate in the Plan. An individual
     who  participates  in the Plan waives all and any rights to compensation or
     damages in consequence of the  termination of his office or employment with
     any  company  for any  reason  whatsoever  - whether  lawful or  unlawful -
     insofar  as those  rights  arise,  or may arise,  from his  ceasing to have
     rights  under or to be entitled to the Shares under the Plan as a result of
     such  termination or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or
     entitlements.  If necessary,  the individual's terms of employment shall be
     varied accordingly.

                                   PART THREE

                                  FREE SHARES

1    INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE

     If the Company decides that an  Appropriation of Free Shares shall be made,
     it shall invite all Eligible  Employees who are not at that time a party to
     a Participation Contract, to participate by issuing to them a Participation
     Contract.  To consent to the  Appropriation  of Free  Shares,  an  Eligible
     Employee must return the Participation  Contract duly completed by the date
     specified in it. If the Company does not receive a  Participation  Contract
     from an Eligible  Employee by the specified  date,  that Eligible  Employee
     shall be deemed to have declined to  participate  in the Plan at that time.
     The Company  shall  specify  the  Holding  Period for the Free Shares to be
     Appropriated  on an  Appropriation  Date.  The Holding  Period for any Free
     Shares already Appropriated under the Plan cannot be changed.

2    MAXIMUM VALUE OF FREE SHARES APPROPRIATED

     The maximum aggregate Initial Market Value of the Free Shares  Appropriated
     to a  Qualifying  Employee  in an  Appropriation  Year shall not exceed the
     maximum amount permitted by paragraph 24 of Schedule 8 from time to time.

3    PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS

3.1  Appropriation may be subject to performance  measures:  An Appropriation of
     Free  Shares may be made  subject to  performance  measures  and targets as
     provided for under this Rule 3.

3.2  Requirements  as to  performance  measures:  If any  Appropriation  of Free
     Shares under the Plan is to be made subject to  performance  measures  they
     must be:

       (a) provided for all persons who are  Qualifying  Employees in respect of
           that Appropriation;

       (b) based on business results or other objective criteria;

       (c) fair and objective  measures of the  performance  of the  Performance
           Units to which they apply;

       (d) set for Performance  Units where no employee is a member of more than
           one Performance Unit; and

       (e) be either Restricted Performance Measures or Unrestricted Performance
           Measures.


                                       26
<PAGE>

3.3  Restricted Performance Measures: If the Company decides to Appropriate Free
     Shares by reference to  Restricted  Performance  Measures,  at least 20 per
     cent. of the Free Shares to be Appropriated  must be  Appropriated  without
     reference to  performance  measures and shall be  Appropriated  on the same
     terms as required by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules.  The remaining Free
     Shares shall be Appropriated  subject to performance  measures but so that,
     in respect  of such  Appropriation,  the  highest  Appropriation  made to a
     Qualifying  Employee by reference to performance  measures shall be no more
     than four times the highest  Appropriation to a Qualifying Employee without
     reference to performance measures.  The Free Shares awarded by reference to
     performance measures need not be Appropriated on the same terms as required
     by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules.

3.4  Unrestricted  Performance  Measures:  If the Company decides to Appropriate
     Free Shares by reference to Unrestricted  Performance  Measures some or all
     of the Free  Shares  shall be  Appropriated  by  reference  to  performance
     measures but so that:

       (a) Appropriations of Free Shares to Qualifying Employees who are members
           of the same  Performance  Unit  shall  be made on the  same  terms as
           required by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules; and

       (b) Free Shares  Appropriated  for each Performance Unit shall be treated
           as separate Appropriations.

3.5  Company's  obligation to notify:  If an  Appropriation of Free Shares under
     the Plan is to be made  subject to  performance  measures  and  targets the
     Company  must,  as soon as  reasonably  practicable,  notify each  Eligible
     Employee:

       (a) of the  performance  measures  and  targets  which  will  be  used to
           determine  the  number  or  value,  as  appropriate,  of Free  Shares
           Appropriated to him; and

       (b) in general terms of the  performance  measures  which will be used to
           determine the number or value, as  appropriate,  of Free Shares to be
           Appropriated  to  each  Qualifying  Employee  participating  in  that
           Appropriation.

3.6  Confidential  information:  In fulfilling its obligations under Rule 3.5(b)
     above,  the Company shall not be obliged to disclose any information  which
     it reasonably considers would prejudice commercial confidentiality.


                                       27
<PAGE>

4    BASIS OF APPROPRIATION

4.1  Free Shares - no performance  measures:  Free Shares to be  Appropriated to
     Qualifying  Employees without performance measures shall be Appropriated on
     a basis determined by the Company but so that such basis complies with Rule
     1 of Part Two of these Rules.

4.2  Free Shares - performance measures:  The Company shall determine in respect
     of any  Appropriation  of Free  Shares to be made  subject  to  performance
     measures  (a)  the  Performance  Units  for  that  Appropriation,  (b)  the
     performance  measures and targets, and (c) whether the performance measures
     are to be  Restricted  Performance  Measures  or  Unrestricted  Performance
     Measures.

                                   PART FOUR

                     PARTNERSHIP SHARES AND MATCHING SHARES

1    INVITATIONS

1.1  Invitations to Eligible Employees:  If the Company decides to give Eligible
     Employees the  opportunity  to acquire  Partnership  Shares,  each Eligible
     Employee will be sent a Partnership Share Agreement under which:

       (a) the Eligible  Employee  would  authorise  the relevant  Participating
           Company to deduct part of his Salary for the purchase of  Partnership
           Shares; and

       (b) the  Company  would  agree to arrange  for  Partnership  Shares to be
           acquired on behalf of the Eligible  Employee in  accordance  with the
           Plan.

     To take the opportunity to acquire Partnership Shares, an Eligible Employee
     must return the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  duly  completed by the date
     specified  in it.  If the  Company  does not  receive a  Partnership  Share
     Agreement from an Eligible  Employee by the specified  date,  that Eligible
     Employee shall be deemed to have declined to acquire  Partnership Shares at
     that time.

1.2  Maximum  deductions  from Salary:  The  Partnership  Share  Agreement  must
     stipulate the maximum amount of  Partnership  Share Money (or percentage of
     Salary)  that may be deducted  from an Eligible  Employee's  Salary and the
     intervals at which such  deductions are to be made, but so that the maximum
     amount does not exceed the amount  permitted from time to time by paragraph
     36 of  Schedule 8 and does not,  in any event,  exceed 10 per cent.  of the
     Eligible Employee's Salary.

1.3  Percentage of Salary:  For the purposes of Rule 1.2 above, "10 per cent. of
     the Eligible Employee's Salary" shall mean:

       (a) if  the   Partnership   Share  Agreement  does  not  provide  for  an
           Accumulation  Period,  10 per cent. of the Salary  payment from which
           the deduction is made; and

       (b) if the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  provides  for an  Accumulation
           Period,  10 per cent. of the Salary  payments  over the  Accumulation
           Period.

1.4  Minimum  deductions from Salary: The Partnership Share Agreement in respect
     of any  invitation  may also  stipulate  that the  minimum  monthly  amount
     (irrespective  of  the  interval  for  deductions)  to be  deducted  from a
     Qualifying  Employee's  Salary in pursuance of that  Agreement  must not be
     less than a specified amount which must not be greater than [British
     Pounds] 10.

                                       29

1.5  Prescribed notice: The Partnership Share Agreement must contain a notice in
     a prescribed  form in compliance with paragraph 38 of Schedule 8 (notice of
     possible effect of deductions on benefit entitlement).

2    PARTNERSHIP SHARE MONEY

     Any  Partnership  Share  Money  shall  be  paid to the  Trustee  as soon as
     practicable following its deduction from a Qualifying Employee's Salary and
     shall be held by the  Trustee  on his behalf  pending  its  application  in
     accordance  with Rule 3.1 or 4.3 of this Part Four, as  appropriate,  in an
     account (interest bearing or otherwise) with:

     (a) an institution authorised under the Banking Act 1987;

     (b) a building society; or

     (c) a relevant European institution.

     The Company  shall  determine and inform the Trustee of whether the account
     will be interest bearing.

     If the Partnership  Share Money held on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee is
     held in an interest  bearing  account,  the Trustee  shall  account for the
     interest to the Qualifying Employee.

3    NO ACCUMULATION PERIOD

3.1  Acquisition  of  Shares:  Any  Partnership  Share  Money  deducted  from  a
     Qualifying  Employee's  Salary under a Partnership  Share Agreement with no
     Accumulation Period will be applied by the Trustee in acquiring Partnership
     Shares on a date  (the  "Acquisition  Date")  set by the  Trustee  which is
     within 30 days after the deduction is made.  The number of Shares  acquired
     on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee shall be determined by reference to the
     Market Value of the Shares on the Acquisition Date.

3.2  Surplus  Partnership  Share  Money:  Any  surplus  Partnership  Share Money
     remaining after the  acquisition of Partnership  Shares by the Trustee may,
     with the agreement of the Qualifying Employee (which may be provided for in
     the Partnership Share Agreement),  be carried forward and added to the next
     deduction  of  Salary.  In any  other  case,  it must  be paid  over to the
     Qualifying  Employee  (subject  to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE and
     NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

                                       30

<PAGE>

4    ACCUMULATION PERIOD

4.1  Accumulation Period: If the Company decides to offer an Accumulation Period
     in respect of an invitation to acquire  Partnership Shares, the Partnership
     Share Agreement must specify:

       (a) the length of the Accumulation  Period (which cannot exceed 12 months
           or, if different, any period specified from time to time in paragraph
           41(1) of Schedule 8);

       (b) when the Accumulation  Period starts (which may not be later than the
           date on which  the first  deduction  of  Salary  is made  under  that
           Agreement); and

       (c) when the Accumulation Period ends and whether the Accumulation Period
           will  come to an end  before  then  on the  occurrence  of  specified
           event(s).

4.2  Transaction  resulting in a new holding: If, during an Accumulation Period,
     a transaction occurs in relation to any Shares (the "original  holding") to
     be acquired  under a  Partnership  Share  Agreement  which results in a new
     holding of shares  (the "new  holding")  being  equated  with the  original
     holding for the purposes of capital gains tax and the  Qualifying  Employee
     so consents,  the  Partnership  Share Agreement shall have effect after the
     time of that  transaction  as if it were an  agreement  for the purchase of
     shares comprised in the new holding.

4.3  Acquisition  of Shares:  Subject to Rule 4.5, the  Partnership  Share Money
     deducted in respect of a Participant during an Accumulation  Period must be
     applied by the Trustee in  acquiring  Partnership  Shares on behalf of that
     Participant on a date (the "Acquisition  Date") set by the Trustee which is
     within 30 days  after the end of that  Accumulation  Period.  The number of
     Shares  acquired on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee  will be determined by
     reference to the lower of:

       (a) the Market Value of the Shares at the  beginning of the  Accumulation
           Period; and

       (b) the Market Value of the Shares on their Acquisition Date.

4.4  Surplus  Partnership  Share  Money:  Any  surplus  Partnership  Share Money
     remaining after the  acquisition of Partnership  Shares by the Trustee may,
     with the agreement of the Qualifying Employee (which may be provided for in
     the  Partnership  Share   Agreement),   be  carried  forward  to  the  next
     Accumulation  Period.  In any  other  case,  it must  be  paid  over to the
     Qualifying  Employee  (subject  to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE and
     NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

4.5  Repayment of Partnership  Share Money: In any case where  Partnership Share
     Money  has been  deducted  in an  Accumulation  Period  and the  Qualifying
     Employee  ceases to be in Employment  with a  Participating  Company during
     that  Accumulation  Period the  Partnership  Share  Money  deducted in that
     Accumulation  Period must be paid over to the Qualifying  Employee (subject
     to

                                       31
<PAGE>

     deduction of income tax under PAYE and NICs as appropriate) as soon as
     practicable.  The  Partnership  Share  Agreement  may provide that when the
     Accumulation Period comes to an end on the occurrence of an event specified
     in the Agreement the Partnership  Share Money deducted in that Accumulation
     Period must be paid over to the Qualifying  Employee  (subject to deduction
     of income tax under PAYE and NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

5    STOPPING AND RESTARTING DEDUCTIONS

5.1  Stopping  deductions:  A Qualifying Employee may at any time after entering
     into a Partnership  Share  Agreement give notice in writing to the relevant
     Participating  Company  to stop  deductions  from  his  Salary  under  that
     Agreement.

5.2  Restarting  deductions:  A Qualifying  Employee who has stopped  deductions
     from  his  Salary  in  pursuance  of  a  Partnership  Share  Agreement  may
     subsequently give notice in writing to the relevant  Participating  Company
     to restart deductions from his Salary under that Agreement. However:

     (a) any deductions that have been missed may not be made up; and

     (b) where the  deductions  are made during an  Accumulation  Period,  the
         Partnership  Share  Agreement may prevent a Qualifying  Employee from
         restarting deductions more than once in that Accumulation Period.

5.3  Termination  of  Partnership  Share  Agreement:  A Qualifying  Employee may
     terminate his  Partnership  Share Agreement at any time by giving notice in
     writing to the relevant  Participating Company. Where a Qualifying Employee
     terminates his Partnership Share Agreement,  no further deductions shall be
     made from his Salary  and any  Partnership  Share  Money held on his behalf
     shall be paid over to him  (subject to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE
     and NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

5.4  Effect of notice  under  Rules  5.1,  5.2 and 5.3:  Unless a later  date is
     specified  in any notice  given under Rule 5.1 or 5.3 above,  the  relevant
     Participating  Company must give effect to such a notice  within 30 days of
     receiving it. Unless a later date is specified in a notice given under Rule
     5.2 above, the relevant Participating Company must restart deductions under
     the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  no later  than  the  date of the  first
     deduction due under the Partnership Share Agreement more than 30 days after
     receipt of the notice.

6    WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERSHIP SHARES

     A Participant may withdraw his Partnership Shares from the Plan at any
     time.


                                       32
<PAGE>

7    NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIP SHARES THAT CAN BE ACQUIRED

7.1  Limit specified at time of invitation:  The Company may specify at the time
     of making an  invitation  under Rule 1 the  maximum  number of  Partnership
     Shares that can be acquired on behalf of Eligible  Employees  in respect of
     that  invitation.   The  Partnership   Share  Agreement  shall  contain  an
     undertaking  by the  Company  to notify  each  Qualifying  Employee  of any
     restriction on the number of Shares to be acquired:

     (a) if there is no  Accumulation  Period,  before  the  deduction  of any
         Partnership Share Money under the Partnership Share Agreement; or

     (b) if there is an  Accumulation  Period,  before  the  beginning  of the
         Accumulation Period under that Partnership Share Agreement.

7.2  Scaling down: If the Company receives  applications for Partnership  Shares
     in excess of the maximum number of Partnership  Shares specified in respect
     of that invitation  under Rule 7.1, then the following steps shall be taken
     in sequence until the excess number is eliminated:

     (a) the  excess  of the  monthly  deduction  chosen  by  each  Qualifying
         Employee over the amount  stipulated  under Rule 1.4 shall be reduced
         pro rata;

     (b) all  monthly  deductions  shall be reduced  to the amount  stipulated
         under Rule 1.4; and

     (c) Partnership  Share Agreements shall be selected by lot, each based on
         a monthly deduction of the amount stipulated under Rule 1.4.

7.3  Modification/withdrawal  and  notification:   If  Rule  7.2  applies,  each
     Partnership  Share  Agreement  shall be  deemed to have  been  modified  or
     withdrawn in accordance with Rule 7.2 and each Qualifying Employee shall be
     notified accordingly.

8    MATCHING SHARES

8.1  Matching Shares - acquisition and forfeiture:  If the Company  decides,  in
     conjunction  with an invitation  to acquire  Partnership  Shares,  to offer
     Matching Shares,  each Eligible  Employee shall be sent a Partnership Share
     Agreement.  The Partnership  Share Agreement will state the extent (if any)
     to which the Matching  Shares  appropriated  to a Participant in respect of
     the associated  Partnership  Shares will be forfeited if, other than in the
     event of Permitted Cessation, the Participant:

     (a) ceases to be in Employment;

     (b) withdraws the Matching Shares from the Plan; or

                                       33

<PAGE>

     (c) withdraws the associated Partnership Shares from the Plan,

     in each case within such period after the relevant Shares were Appropriated
     to him (not to exceed  three years) as is stated in the  Partnership  Share
     Agreement.

8.2  Terms of Matching Shares: Matching Shares shall:

     (a) be  Shares  of the  same  class  and  carry  the same  rights  as the
         Partnership Shares to which they relate;

     (b) be Appropriated  on the same day as the  Partnership  Shares to which
         they relate are acquired on behalf of the Qualifying Employee; and

     (c) in respect of any  Appropriation,  be  Appropriated to all Qualifying
         Employees on exactly the same basis.

8.3  Ratio of Matching  Shares to  Partnership  Shares:  The  Partnership  Share
     Agreement under which Matching Shares are offered must specify the ratio of
     Matching  Shares to  Partnership  Shares for the time being  offered by the
     Company and the  circumstances and manner in which the ratio may be changed
     by the  Company.  The  ratio  must  not  exceed  2:1 (or such  other  ratio
     permitted by  paragraph  51(2) of Schedule 8 from time to time) and must be
     applied by reference to the number of Shares. The Qualifying  Employee must
     be  informed by the  Company if the ratio  offered by the  Company  changes
     before  Partnership  Shares are  acquired on his behalf  under the relevant
     Partnership Share Agreement.

                                   PART FIVE

                         REINVESTMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS



1    PERMITTED REINVESTMENT

1.1  Mandatory or voluntary reinvestment: At the time of operating Part Three or
     Part Four of these Rules,  the Company may decide  that,  subject to Rule 2
     below,  all cash dividends paid in respect of any Plan Shares  Appropriated
     or acquired on behalf of a Participant  as a consequence  of that operation
     must either:

     (a) be applied in acquiring Dividend Shares on behalf of the Participant;
         or

     (b) be  applied  in   acquiring   Dividend   Shares  on  behalf  only  of
         Participants who elect to reinvest those dividends.

     If the Company decides  to impose  or allow such a facility under the Plan,
     the provisions of this Part Five of these Rules shall apply.

1.2  Dividend Shares/Holding Period: Dividend Shares shall be shares of the same
     class and carry the same  rights as the  Shares to which the cash  dividend
     relates and may not be subject to forfeiture.

     During the Holding Period,  the Participant  shall be bound by the terms of
     his  Participation  Contract with the Company to permit any Dividend Shares
     acquired on his behalf to remain in the hands of the  Trustee and  (subject
     to Clause 8 of the Deed) not to assign,  charge or otherwise dispose of his
     beneficial interest in such Dividend Shares.

2    LIMIT ON DIVIDEND REINVESTED

2.1  Maximum amount reinvested:  The amount applied under the Plan and any other
     Employee  Share   Ownership  Plan  in  acquiring   Dividend  Shares  for  a
     Participant  shall  not  exceed  [British  Pounds]  1,500  in any  Year  of
     Assessment  (or such  other  amount as may be  permitted  from time to time
     under paragraph 54(1) of Schedule 8).

2.2  Surplus  cash  dividend:  If the amount of cash  dividend  received  by the
     Trustee  in  respect  of a  Participant's  Plan  Shares  exceeds  the limit
     specified in Rule 2.1 above for that Participant in any Year of Assessment,
     the excess of the cash  dividend  must be paid over to the  Participant  as
     soon as practicable.


                                       35
<PAGE>

3    ACQUISITION OF DIVIDEND SHARES

3.1  Time of  acquisition:  Subject to Rule 3.3,  the Trustee  must apply a cash
     dividend  paid in  respect  of Plan  Shares  that  is to be  reinvested  in
     acquiring  Dividend  Shares on a date (the  "Acquisition  Date") set by the
     Trustee  which is a date  within  30 days  after the date on which the cash
     dividend is received by it. The Trustee must,  in exercising  its powers in
     relation to the acquisition of Dividend Shares,  treat Participants  fairly
     and equally and may, for these purposes, use any unappropriated Shares that
     it holds.

3.2  Number of Dividend Shares acquired:  The number of Dividend Shares acquired
     on behalf of a  Participant  shall be  determined  in  accordance  with the
     Market Value of those Shares on their Acquisition Date.

3.3  Carry  forward of  uninvested  amounts:  Any cash  dividend  available  for
     reinvestment  that is not  reinvested  either  because  the  amount  of the
     dividend is insufficient to acquire a Dividend Share or because there is an
     amount remaining after acquiring one or more Dividend Shares on behalf of a
     Participant may be retained by the Trustee and carried forward and added to
     the amount of the next cash dividend to be reinvested for that Participant.
     However,  any such amount  retained by the Trustee must be paid over to the
     Participant as soon as practicable:

     (a) if or to the extent  that it is not  reinvested  within the period of
         three years beginning with the date on which the dividend was paid;

     (b) if  the  Participant   ceases  to  be  in  Employment  prior  to  its
         reinvestment; or

     (c) if a Plan Termination Notice is issued prior to its reinvestment.

     For the purposes of this Rule an amount of cash  dividend  carried  forward
     from an earlier  cash  dividend  shall be treated as  reinvested  before an
     amount derived from a later cash dividend.
