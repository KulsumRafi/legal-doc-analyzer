        As provided herein, the REMIC Administrator will elect to treat the
segregated pool of assets consisting of the REMIC I Regular Interests as a REMIC
for federal income tax purposes, and such segregated pool of assets will be
designated as REMIC II. The Class R-II Certificates will represent the sole
class of "residual interests" in REMIC II for purposes of the REMIC Provisions
under federal income tax law. The following table irrevocably sets forth the
designation, remittance rate (the "REMIC II Remittance Rate") and Initial
Certificate Principal Balance for each of the "regular interests" in REMIC II
(the "REMIC II Regular Interests"). The "latest possible maturity date"
(determined solely for purposes of satisfying Treasury regulation Section
1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii)) for each REMIC II Regular Interest shall be the first
Distribution Date that follows the stated maturity date for the Mortgage Loan
included in the Trust Fund as of the Closing Date with the longest remaining
term to stated maturity.

        foregoing percentages on any Distribution Date as provided in Section

        "Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount") would result in a
        distribution in respect of principal of any Class or Classes of
        Subordinate Certificates in an amount greater than the remaining
        Certificate Principal Balance thereof (any such class, a "Maturing
        Class"), then: (a) the Prepayment Distribution Percentage of each
        Maturing Class shall be reduced to a level that, when applied as
        described above, would exactly reduce the Certificate Principal Balance
        of such Class to zero; (b) the Prepayment Distribution Percentage of
        each other Class of Subordinate Certificates (any such Class, a
        "Non-Maturing Class") shall be recalculated in accordance with the
        provisions in paragraph (ii) above, as if the Certificate Principal
        Balance of each Maturing Class had been reduced to zero (such percentage
        as recalculated, the "Recalculated Percentage"); (c) the total amount of
        the reductions in the Prepayment Distribution Percentages of the
        Maturing Class or Classes pursuant to clause (a) of this sentence,
        expressed as an aggregate percentage, shall be allocated among the
        Non-Maturing Classes in proportion to their respective Recalculated
        Percentages (the portion of such aggregate reduction so allocated to any
        Non-Maturing Class, the "Adjustment Percentage"); and (d) for purposes
        of such Distribution Date, the Prepayment Distribution Percentage of
        each Non-Maturing Class shall be equal to the sum of (1) the Prepayment
        Distribution Percentage thereof, calculated in accordance with the
        provisions in paragraph (ii) above as if the Certificate Principal
        Balance of each Maturing Class had not been reduced to zero, plus (2)
        the related Adjustment Percentage.

        Prepayment Distribution Trigger: With respect to any Distribution Date
and any Class of Subordinate Certificates (other than the Class M-1
Certificates), a test that shall be satisfied if the fraction (expressed as a
percentage) equal to the sum of the Certificate Principal Balances of such Class
and each Class of Subordinate Certificates with a Lower Priority than such Class
immediately prior to such Distribution Date divided by the aggregate Stated
Principal Balance of all of the Mortgage Loans (or related REO Properties)
immediately prior to such Distribution Date is greater than or equal to the sum
of the related Initial Subordinate Class Percentages of such Classes of
Subordinate Certificates.

                                   ARTICLE II

                          CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS;
                        ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01.  Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

(a) _____ The Company, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, does
hereby assign to the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders without
recourse all the right, title and interest of the Company in and to the Mortgage
Loans, including all interest and principal received on or with respect to the
Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (other than payments of principal and
interest due on the Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-off Date).

(b) _____ In connection with such assignment, the Company does hereby deliver
to, and deposit with, the Trustee, or to and with one or more Custodians, as the
duly appointed agent or agents of the Trustee for such purpose, the original
Mortgage Note, with respect to each Mortgage Loan so assigned, endorsed without
recourse in blank, or in the name of the Trustee as trustee, and signed by an
authorized officer (which endorsement shall contain either an original signature
or a facsimile signature of an authorized officer of GMACM, and if in the form
of an allonge, the allonge shall be stapled to the Mortgage Note), with all
intervening endorsements showing a complete chain of title from the originator
to GMACM. If the Mortgage Loan was acquired by the endorser in a merger, the
endorsement must be by "____________, successor by merger to [name of
predecessor]". If the Mortgage Loan was acquired or originated by the endorser
while doing business under another name, the endorsement must be by
"____________ formerly known as [previous name]."

In lieu of delivering the Mortgage Note relating to any Mortgage Loan, the
Depositor may deliver or cause to be delivered a lost note affidavit from the
related Seller or GMACM stating that the original Mortgage Note was lost,
misplaced or destroyed, and, if available, a copy of each original Mortgage
Note; provided, however, that in the case of Mortgage Loans which have been
prepaid in full after the Cut-off Date and prior to the Closing Date, the
Depositor, in lieu of delivering the above documents, may deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Custodian, if any, or the Trustee, a certification to such
effect and shall deposit all amounts paid in respect of such Mortgage Loan in
the Payment Account on the Closing Date.

(c) _____ All other documents contained in the Mortgage File and any original
documents relating to the Mortgage Loans not contained in the Mortgage File or
delivered to the Custodian, if any, or the Trustee are and shall be held by the
Servicer in trust as agent for the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders.

                                       41
<PAGE>

        In the event that in connection with any Mortgage Loan: (a) the original
recorded Mortgage (or evidence of submission to the recording office), (b) all
interim recorded assignments, (c) the original recorded modification agreement,
if required, or (d) evidence of title insurance (together with all riders
thereto, if any) satisfying the requirements of clause (I)(ii), (iv), (vi) or
(vii) of the definition of Mortgage File, respectively, have not been delivered
to the Servicer concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof because such
document or documents have not been returned from the applicable public
recording office, or, in the case of each such interim assignment or
modification agreement, because the related Mortgage has not been returned by
the appropriate recording office, in the case of clause (I)(ii), (iv) or (vi) of
the definition of Mortgage File, or because the evidence of title insurance has
not been delivered to the related Seller by the title insurer in the case of
clause (I)(vii) of the definition of Mortgage File, the Servicer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, (A) in the case of clause (I)(ii), (iv) or
(vi) of the definition of Mortgage File, such original Mortgage, such interim
assignment, or such modification agreement, with evidence of recording indicated
thereon upon receipt thereof from the public recording office, or a copy
thereof, certified, if appropriate, by the relevant recording office, or (B) in
the case of clause (I)(vii) of the definition of Mortgage File, evidence of
title insurance.

(d) _____ If any of the documents held by the Servicer pursuant to clause (c)
above are missing or defective in any other respect and such missing document or
defect materially and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders
in the related Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall request that GMACM either (i)
cure such defect in all material respects, (ii) substitute for such Mortgage
Loan a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, which substitution shall be
accomplished in the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in Section
2.04, or (iii) purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase
Price within 90 days after the date on which GMACM was notified of such defect;
provided that if such defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a
"qualified mortgage" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, any such
cure, substitution or repurchase must occur within 90 days from the date such
breach was discovered. If GMACM fails to comply with such request by the
Servicer, the Servicer shall notify the Trustee of such missing document or
material defect and the Trustee shall cause GMACM to comply with clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence. It is understood and agreed that the
obligation of GMACM to cure a material defect in, or substitute for, or purchase
any Mortgage Loan as to which a material defect in or omission of a constituent
document exists, shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such material
defect or omission available to Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of
Certificateholders. The Purchase Price for the purchased Mortgage Loan shall be
deposited or caused to be deposited upon receipt by the Trustee in the Payment
Account, or upon receipt by the Servicer in the Custodial Account. Upon receipt
by the Trustee of written notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing
Officer, the Trustee shall (i) release or cause to be released to GMACM the
related Mortgage Note, (ii) cause the Servicer to release to GMACM any remaining
documents in the related Mortgage File which are held by the Servicer, and (iii)
execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse, as GMACM shall require as necessary to vest in GMACM ownership
of any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto and at such time the Trustee shall
have no further responsibility with respect to the related Mortgage Note.

                                       42
<PAGE>

(e) _____ The Servicer shall keep in its possession (a) from time to time
additional original documents evidencing an assumption or modification of a
Mortgage Loan and (b) any other documents required to be held by the Servicer.

        Except as may otherwise expressly be provided herein, none of the
Sellers, the Servicer or the Trustee shall assign, sell, dispose of or transfer
any interest in the Trust Fund or any portion thereof, or permit the Trust Fund
or any portion thereof to be subject to any lien, claim, mortgage, security
interest, pledge or other encumbrance of, any other Person.

        The Servicer shall cause to be filed the UCC assignment and UCC
financing statement referred to in clause (II)(vii) and (x), respectively, of
the definition of Mortgage File. If any UCC assignment or amendment or UCC
financing statement, as applicable, is lost or returned unfiled to the Servicer
because of any defect therein, the Servicer shall prepare a substitute UCC
assignment or amendment or UCC financing statement, as applicable, or cure such
defect, and cause such UCC assignment or amendment or UCC financing statement,
as applicable, to be filed in accordance with this paragraph. In connection with
its servicing of Cooperative Loans, the Servicer will use its reasonable best
efforts to file timely continuation statements with regard to each financing
statement and assignment relating to Cooperative Loans as to which the related
Cooperative Apartment is located outside of the State of New York.

        In connection with the assignment of any Mortgage Loan registered on the
MERS(R) System, the Servicer further agrees that it will cause, at the
Servicer's own expense, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the
MERS(R) System to indicate that such Mortgage Loans have been assigned to the
Trustee in accordance with this Agreement for the benefit of the
Certificateholders by including (or deleting, in the case of Mortgage Loans
which are repurchased in accordance with this Agreement) in such computer files
(a) the code "[IDENTIFY TRUSTEE SPECIFIC CODE]" in the field "[IDENTIFY THE
FIELD NAME FOR TRUSTEE]" which identifies the Trustee and (b) the code
"[IDENTIFY SERIES SPECIFIC CODE NUMBER]" in the field "Pool Field" which
identifies the series of the Certificates issued in connection with such
Mortgage Loans. The Servicer agrees that it will not alter the codes referenced
in this paragraph with respect to any Mortgage Loan during the term of this
Agreement unless and until such Mortgage Loan is repurchased in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and there is filed any financing statement or
amendment thereof necessary to comply with the New York Uniform Commercial Code
or the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction.

(f) _____ It is intended that the conveyance by the Company to the Trustee of
the Mortgage Loans as provided for in this Section 2.01 be construed as a sale
by the Company to the Trustee of the Mortgage Loans for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. Further, it is not intended that such conveyance be deemed
to be a grant of a security interest in the Mortgage Loans by the Company to the
Trustee to secure a debt or other obligation of the Company. However, if the
Mortgage Loans are held to be property of the Company or of the related Seller,
or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security
interest in the Mortgage Loans, then it is intended that, (a) this Agreement be
and hereby is a security agreement within the meaning of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) the conveyance
provided for in Section 2.01 shall be deemed to be, and hereby is, (1) a grant
by the Company to the Trustee of a security interest in all of the Company's


                                       43

right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to
the following: (A) the Mortgage Loans, including (i) with respect to each
Cooperative Loan, the related Mortgage Note, Security Agreement, Assignment of

documents in the related Mortgage File, (B) all amounts payable pursuant to the
Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms thereof, (C) all proceeds of the
conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments,
securities or other property, including without limitation all amounts from time
to time held or invested in the Payment Account or the Custodial Account,
whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property, (D) all
accounts, general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, money,
deposit accounts, goods, letters of credit, letter-of-credit rights, oil, gas,
and other minerals, and investment property consisting of, arising from or
relating to any of the foregoing, and (E) all proceeds of the foregoing, and (2)
an assignment by the Company to the Trustee of any security interest in any and
all of each Seller's right (including the power to convey title thereto), title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the property
described in the foregoing clauses (1)(A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) granted by such
Seller to the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; (c) the possession by
the Trustee, the Custodian or any other agent of the Trustee of any of the
foregoing property shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party, or
possession by a purchaser or a person holding for the benefit of such secured
party, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code and the Uniform Commercial Code of any
other applicable jurisdiction (including, without limitation, Sections 9-313 and
9-314 thereof); and (d) notifications to persons holding such property, and
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons holding such property,
shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations
from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents of, or persons holding for,
the Trustee (as applicable) for the purpose of perfecting such security interest
under applicable law.

        The Company and, at the Company's direction, GMACM and the Trustee
shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such reasonable
actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were determined to
create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans and the other property
described above, such security interest would be determined to be a perfected
security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such throughout the term of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Trustee not less
than 15 days prior to any filing date and, the Trustee shall forward for filing,
or shall cause to be forwarded for filing, at the expense of the Company, all
filings necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings
necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to
perfect the Trustee's security interest in the Mortgage Loans, as evidenced by
an Officer's Certificate of the Company, including without limitation (x)
continuation statements, and (y) such other statements as may be occasioned by
(1) any change of name of either Seller, the Company or the Trustee (such
preparation and filing shall be at the expense of the Trustee, if occasioned by
a change in the Trustee's name), (2) any change of type or jurisdiction of
organization of either Seller or the Company and (3) any transfer of any
interest of either Seller or the Company in any Mortgage Loan. The Company shall
file or cause to be filed the original filing necessary under the Uniform
Commercial Code to perfect the Trustee's security interest in the Mortgage
Loans.

Section 2.02.  Acceptance by Trustee.

        The Trustee acknowledges that the Custodian, acting on behalf of the
Trustee, has received (subject to any exceptions noted in the custodian
certification described below), the Mortgage Notes and the Trustee declares that
it holds or will hold the assets included in the definition of "Trust Fund," in
trust for the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future
Certificateholders.

        The Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, to cause
the Custodian to review each Mortgage Note and to execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, to GMACM, the Trustee and the Servicer a custodian
certification substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit N on or prior
to the Closing Date. Pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, in conducting such
review, the Custodian is required to ascertain whether the Mortgage Notes have
been executed and received, and whether the Mortgage Notes relate, determined on
the basis of the Mortgagor name, original principal balance and loan number, to
the Mortgage Loans. Neither the Custodian nor the Trustee shall be under any
duty or obligation to inspect, review or examine said documents, instruments,
certificates or other papers to determine that the same are genuine, enforceable
or appropriate for the represented purpose or that they have actually been
recorded, or are in recordable form or that they are other than what they
purport to be on their face.

        If, in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Notes and preparing the
certifications referred to above, the Custodian finds any Mortgage Note to be
missing or contains any defect which materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Certificateholders in the related Mortgage Loan, the Custodian
is required pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, to notify the Trustee, the
Company and the Sellers, and the Trustee shall request that GMACM cure any such
defect in all material respects within 90 days from the date on which GMACM was
notified of such defect, and if GMACM does not cure such defect in all material
respects during such period, the Trustee shall request on behalf of the
Certificateholders that GMACM either (i) substitute for such Mortgage Loan a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, which substitution shall be accomplished in
the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.04, or (ii)
purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price within 90
days after the date on which GMACM was notified of such defect; provided that if
such defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified
mortgage" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, any such cure,
substitution or repurchase must occur within 90 days from the date such breach
was discovered. It is understood and agreed that the obligation of GMACM to cure
a material defect in, or substitute for, or purchase any Mortgage Loan as to
which a material defect in, or omission of, a Mortgage Note exists shall
constitute the sole remedy respecting such material defect or omission available
to Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders. The
Purchase Price for the purchased Mortgage Loan shall be deposited or caused to
be deposited upon receipt by the Trustee in the Payment Account, or upon receipt
by the Servicer in the Custodial Account. Upon receipt by the Trustee of written
notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing Officer, the Trustee shall
(i) release or cause to be released to GMACM the related Mortgage Note, (ii)
cause the Servicer to release to GMACM any remaining documents in the related
Mortgage File which are held by the Servicer, and (iii) execute and deliver such
instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as GMACM


                                       45
<PAGE>

shall require as necessary to vest in GMACM ownership of any Mortgage Loan
released pursuant hereto and at such time the Trustee shall have no further
responsibility with respect to the related Mortgage Note.

     laws;

(iv) ____ The  Servicer is not in default with respect to any order or decree of

     that would  materially  and adversely  affect the  condition  (financial or
     other) or  operations  of the  Servicer  or its  properties  or might  have
     consequences  that  would  materially   adversely  affect  its  performance
     hereunder;

     threatened against the Servicer which would prohibit its entering into this
     Agreement or performing its obligations under this Agreement;

(viii) The Servicer is a member of MERS in good standing, and will comply in all
     material  respects with the rules and procedures of MERS in connection with
     the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are registered with MERS.

It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.03 shall survive delivery of the respective Mortgage Notes to the
Custodian, if any, or the Trustee.

Section 2.04.  Representations and Warranties of the Sellers and GMACM.

        The Company hereby assigns to the Trustee for the benefit of
Certificateholders all of its right, title and interest in respect of the
Purchase Agreement insofar as the Purchase Agreement relates to the
representations and warranties made by the Sellers and GMACM in respect of the
Mortgage Loans and any remedies provided thereunder for any breach of such
representations and warranties, such right, title and interest may be enforced
by the Servicer on behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders. Upon the
discovery by the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee or any Custodian of a breach
of any of the representations and warranties made by Witmer Funding LLC or GMACM
in the Purchase Agreement (which, for purposes hereof, will be deemed to include
any other cause giving rise to a repurchase obligation under the Purchase
Agreement) in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially and adversely
affects the interests of the Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties
(any Custodian being so obligated under a Custodial Agreement). The Servicer
shall promptly notify GMACM or Witmer Funding LLC, as applicable, of such breach
and request that such Person either (i) cure such breach in all material
respects within 90 days from the date such Person was notified of such breach or
(ii) purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and
in the manner set forth in Section 2.02; provided that in the case of a breach
under the Purchase Agreement, GMACM or Witmer Funding LLC, as applicable, shall
have the option to substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans for
such Mortgage Loan if such substitution occurs within two years following the
Closing Date; provided that if the breach would cause the Mortgage Loan to be
other than a "qualified mortgage" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code,
any such cure, repurchase or substitution must occur within 90 days from the
date the breach was discovered. In the event that GMACM or Witmer Funding LLC
elects to substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans for a Deleted
Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04, the Trustee shall cause such Person
to deliver to the Custodian with respect to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan or Loans, the original Mortgage Note endorsed as required by Section 2.01,
and the Trustee shall cause such Person to deliver to the Servicer with respect
to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, the Mortgage, an Assignment of the
Mortgage in recordable form if required pursuant to Section 2.01, and such other
documents and agreements as are required to be held by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 2.01. No substitution will be made in any calendar month after the
Determination Date for such month. Monthly Payments due with respect to
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution shall not be
part of the Trust Fund and will be retained by the Servicer and remitted by the
Servicer to such Person on the next succeeding Distribution Date. For the month
of substitution, distributions to the Certificateholders will include the


                                       47
<PAGE>

Monthly Payment due on a Deleted Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter
GMACM or Witmer Funding LLC, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain all
amounts received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall
amend or cause to be amended the Mortgage Loan Schedule, and, if the Deleted
Mortgage Loan was a Discount Mortgage Loan, the Schedule of Discount Fractions,
for the benefit of the Certificateholders to reflect the removal of such Deleted
Mortgage Loan and the substitution of the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans and the Servicer shall deliver the amended Mortgage Loan Schedule, and, if
the Deleted Mortgage Loan was a Discount Mortgage Loan, the amended Schedule of
Discount Fractions, to the Trustee. Upon such substitution, the Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the related Subservicing Agreement in all respects, and GMACM and
the related Seller shall be deemed to have made the representations and
warranties with respect to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan contained in
the Purchase Agreement as of the date of substitution.

        In connection with the substitution of one or more Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the Servicer will
determine the amount (if any) by which the aggregate principal balance of all
such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less
than the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans
(in each case after application of the principal portion of the Monthly Payments
due in the month of substitution that are to be distributed to the
Certificateholders in the month of substitution). The Servicer shall deposit the
amount of such shortfall received from GMACM or Witmer Funding LLC into the
Custodial Account on the day of substitution. The Servicer shall give notice in
writing to the Trustee of such event, which notice shall be accompanied by an
Officer's Certificate as to the calculation of such shortfall and (subject to
Section 10.01(f)) by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such substitution
will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund, including
without limitation, any federal tax imposed on "prohibited transactions" under
Section 860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions after the startup date"
under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code or (b) any portion of either of the REMICs
to fail to qualify as such at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.

        It is understood and agreed that the obligation of each Seller and GMACM
to cure such breach or purchase (or to substitute for) such Mortgage Loan as to
which a breach of its representations and warranties has occurred and is
continuing shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such breach available to
the Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders. In
connection with the purchase of or substitution for any such Mortgage Loan by
the related Seller, the Trustee shall assign to such Person all of the right,
title and interest in respect of the Purchase Agreement applicable to such
Mortgage Loan.

Section 2.05.  Execution and Authentication of Certificates.

        The Trustee acknowledges the assignment to it of the Mortgage Loans and
the delivery of the Mortgage Notes to the Custodian on its behalf, subject to
any exceptions noted, together with the assignment to it of all other assets
included in the Trust Fund and/or the applicable REMIC, receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged. Concurrently with such delivery and in exchange therefor,
the Trustee, pursuant to the written request of the Company executed by an
officer of the Company has executed and caused to be authenticated and delivered
to or upon the order of the Company the Certificates in authorized denominations
which evidence ownership of the entire Trust Fund.

        The trust is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing activities.

while any Certificate is outstanding without the consent of the
Certificateholders evidencing a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights of the
Certificates.

                                OF MORTGAGE LOANS

Section 3.01.  Servicer to Act as Servicer.

(a) _____ The Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the respective Mortgage Loans,
shall follow such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
advisable and as shall be normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing
activities, and shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through
Subservicers as provided in Section 3.02, to do any and all things which it may
deem necessary or desirable in connection with such servicing and
administration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer
in its own name or in the name of a Subservicer is hereby authorized and
empowered by the Trustee when the Servicer or the Subservicer, as the case may
be, believes it appropriate in its best judgment, to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee or any of them, any and all
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, or of consent to assumption or modification in connection with a
proposed conveyance, or of assignment of any Mortgage and Mortgage Note in
connection with the repurchase of a Mortgage Loan and all other comparable
instruments, or with respect to the modification or re-recording of a Mortgage
for the purpose of correcting the Mortgage, the subordination of the lien of the
Mortgage in favor of a public utility company or government agency or unit with
powers of eminent domain, the taking of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the
commencement, prosecution or completion of judicial or non-judicial foreclosure,


                                       49
<PAGE>

the conveyance of a Mortgaged Property to the related Insurer, the acquisition
of any property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or the
management, marketing and conveyance of any property acquired by foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect
to the Mortgaged Properties. The Servicer further is authorized and empowered by
the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee, in its own
name or in the name of the Subservicer, when the Servicer or the Subservicer, as
the case may be, believes it appropriate in its best judgment to register any
Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R) System, or cause the removal from the registration
of any Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R) System, to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Trustee and the Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments
of assignment and other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment
or re-recording of a Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the
Trustee and its successors and assigns. Any expenses incurred in connection with
the actions described in the preceding sentence shall be borne by the Servicer
in accordance with Section 3.16(c), with no right of reimbursement; provided,
that if, as a result of MERS discontinuing or becoming unable to continue
operations in connection with the MERS System, it becomes necessary to remove
any Mortgage Loan from registration on the MERS System and to arrange for the
assignment of the related Mortgages to the Trustee, then any related expenses
shall be reimbursable to the Servicer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to
Section 3.07(a), the Servicer shall not permit any modification with respect to
any Mortgage Loan that would both constitute a sale or exchange of such Mortgage
Loan within the meaning of Section 1001 of the Code and any proposed, temporary
or final regulations promulgated thereunder (other than in connection with a
proposed conveyance or assumption of such Mortgage Loan that is treated as a
Principal Prepayment in Full pursuant to Section 3.13(d) hereof) and cause
either REMIC formed under this Agreement to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the
Code. Upon request, the Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans. The Trustee shall not be liable for
any action taken by the Servicer or any Subservicer pursuant to such powers of
attorney. In connection with servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
Servicer and any Affiliate of the Servicer (i) may perform services such as
appraisals and brokerage services that are not customarily provided by servicers
of mortgage loans, and shall be entitled to reasonable compensation therefor in
accordance with Section 3.10 and (ii) may, at its own discretion and on behalf
of the Trustee, obtain credit information in the form of a "credit score" from a
credit repository.

(b) _____ All costs incurred by the Servicer or by Subservicers in effecting the
timely payment of taxes and assessments on the properties subject to the
Mortgage Loans shall not, for the purpose of calculating monthly distributions
to the Certificateholders, be added to the amount owing under the related
Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit,
and such costs shall be recoverable to the extent permitted by Section
3.10(a)(ii).

(c) _____ The Servicer may enter into one or more agreements in connection with
the offering of pass-through certificates evidencing interests in one or more of
the Certificates providing for the payment by the Servicer of amounts received
by the Servicer as servicing compensation hereunder and required to cover
certain Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans, which payment
obligation will thereafter be an obligation of the Servicer hereunder.

Section               3.02. Subservicing Agreements Between Servicer and
                      Subservicers; Enforcement of Subservicers' and Sellers'
                      Obligations.

        The Servicer may enter into Subservicing Agreements with Subservicers,
for the servicing and administration of all or some of the Mortgage Loans. Each
Subservicer of a Mortgage Loan shall be entitled to receive and retain, as
provided in the related Subservicing Agreement and in Section 3.07, the related
Subservicing Fee from payments of interest received on such Mortgage Loan after
payment of all amounts required to be remitted to the Servicer in respect of
such Mortgage Loan. Any Subservicing Fee shall be paid by the Servicer out of
the Servicing Fee for the related Mortgage Loans. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references in this Agreement to actions taken or to be taken by the
Servicer in servicing the Mortgage Loans include actions taken or to be taken by
a Subservicer on behalf of the Servicer.

Section 3.03.  Successor Subservicers.

        The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate any Subservicing Agreement
that may exist in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Subservicing
Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this Agreement; provided,
however, that in the event of termination of any Subservicing Agreement by the
Servicer or the Subservicer, the Servicer shall either act as servicer of the
related Mortgage Loan or enter into a Subservicing Agreement with a successor
Subservicer which will be bound by the terms of the related Subservicing
Agreement.

Section 3.04.  Liability of the Servicer.

        Notwithstanding any Subservicing Agreement, any of the provisions of
this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Servicer or a
Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or otherwise,
the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trustee and the
Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage Loans in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01 without diminution of such
obligation or liability by virtue of such Subservicing Agreements or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Subservicer or the Company
and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the
Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with a Subservicer or Seller for
indemnification of the Servicer and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

Section 3.05.  No Contractual Relationship Between Subservicer and Trustee or
                      Certificateholders.

        Any Subservicing Agreement that may be entered into and any other
transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Subservicer
in its capacity as such and not as an originator shall be deemed to be between
the Subservicer and the Servicer alone and the Trustee and the
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights, obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the Subservicer in
its capacity as such except as set forth in Section 3.06.

                                       51

Section 3.06.  Assumption or Termination of Subservicing Agreements by Trustee.

(a) _____ If the Servicer shall for any reason no longer be the servicer
(including by reason of an Event of Default), the Trustee, its designee or its
successor shall thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under each Subservicing Agreement that may have been entered into. The
Trustee, its designee or the successor servicer for the Trustee shall be deemed
to have assumed all of the Servicer's interest therein and to have replaced the
Servicer as a party to the Subservicing Agreement to the same extent as if the
Subservicing Agreement had been assigned to the assuming party except that the
Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations under the
Subservicing Agreement.
(b) _____ The Servicer shall, upon request of the Trustee but at the expense of
the Servicer, deliver to the assuming party all documents and records relating
to each Subservicing Agreement and the Mortgage Loans then being serviced and an
accounting of amounts collected and held by it and otherwise use its reasonable
best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of each Subservicing
Agreement to the assuming party.

Section 3.07. Collection of Certain Mortgage Loan Payments; Deposits to
Custodial Account.

(a) _____ The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect all payments
called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans, and shall, to
the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and the terms
and provisions of any related Primary Insurance Policy, follow such collection
procedures as it would employ in its good faith business judgment and which are
normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing activities. Consistent with
the foregoing, the Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late payment
charge or any prepayment charge or penalty interest in connection with the
prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the Due Date for payments due on a
Mortgage Note for a period not greater than 180 days; provided, however, that
the Servicer shall first determine that any such waiver or extension will not
impair the coverage of any related Primary Insurance Policy or materially
adversely affect the lien of the related Mortgage. In the event of any such
arrangement, the Servicer shall make timely advances on the related Mortgage
Loan during the scheduled period in accordance with the amortization schedule of
such Mortgage Loan without modification thereof by reason of such arrangements
unless otherwise agreed to by the Holders of the Classes of Certificates
affected thereby; provided, however, that no such extension shall be made if any
such advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance. Consistent with the terms of
this Agreement, the Servicer may also waive, modify or vary any term of any
Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of strict compliance with any such
term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Servicer's
determination such waiver, modification, postponement or indulgence is not
materially adverse to the interests of the Certificateholders (taking into
account any estimated Realized Loss that might result absent such action);
provided, however, that the Servicer may not modify materially or permit any
Subservicer to modify any Mortgage Loan, including without limitation any
modification that would change the Mortgage Rate, forgive the payment of any
principal or interest (unless in connection with the liquidation of the related
Mortgage Loan or except in connection with prepayments to the extent that such
reamortization is not inconsistent with the terms of the Mortgage Loan), or
extend the final maturity date of such Mortgage Loan, unless such Mortgage Loan
is in default or, in the judgment of the Servicer, such default is reasonably


                                       52
<PAGE>

foreseeable; and provided, further, that no such modification shall reduce the
interest rate on a Mortgage Loan below the sum of the Pool Strip Rate and the
Servicing Fee Rate. In connection with any Curtailment of a Mortgage Loan, the
Servicer, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Mortgage Note and
local law and practice, may permit the Mortgage Loan to be reamortized such that
the Monthly Payment is recalculated as an amount that will fully amortize the
remaining Stated Principal Balance thereof by the original Maturity Date based
on the original Mortgage Rate; provided, that such re-amortization shall not be
permitted if it would constitute a reissuance of the Mortgage Loan for federal
income tax purposes, except if such reissuance is described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.860G-2(b)(3). The Servicer shall not be required to
institute or join in litigation with respect to collection of any payment
(whether under a Mortgage, Mortgage Note or otherwise or against any public or
governmental authority with respect to a taking or condemnation) if it
reasonably believes that enforcing the provision of the Mortgage or other
instrument pursuant to which such payment is required is prohibited by
applicable law.

(b) _____ The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received
pursuant to each Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own funds and
general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial Accounts
held in trust, entitled "GMAC Mortgage Corporation Custodial Account in trust
for the benefit of the Holders of GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
Series 2003-J1." Each Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Account. The
Custodial Account shall be maintained as a segregated account, separate and
apart from trust funds created for mortgage pass-through certificates of other
series, and the other accounts of the Servicer.

        Within two Business Days of receipt, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, the Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited the
following payments and collections remitted by subservicers or received by it in
respect of the Mortgage Loans subsequent to the Cut-off Date (other than in
respect of principal and interest due on such Mortgage Loans on or before the
Cut-off Date) and the following amounts required to be deposited hereunder:

(i)            _____ All payments on account of principal, including Principal
               Prepayments made by Mortgagors on the Mortgage Loans and the
               principal component of any Subservicer Advance or of any REO
               Proceeds received in connection with an REO Property for which an
               REO Disposition has occurred;

(ii)           ____ All payments on account of interest at the Net Mortgage Rate
               on the Mortgage Loans, and the interest component of any
               Subservicer Advance or of any REO Proceeds received in connection
               with an REO Property for which an REO Disposition has occurred,
               minus the amount of any interest paid by a Mortgagor in
               connection with a Principal Prepayment in Full for the calendar
               month in which such Principal Prepayment is to be distributed
               pursuant to Section 4.02;

(iii)          Insurance Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds (net of any related
               expenses of the Subservicer);

                                       53
<PAGE>

(iv)           ____ All proceeds of any Mortgage Loans purchased pursuant to
               Section 2.02, 2.04 or 4.07 and all amounts required to be
               deposited in connection with the substitution of a Qualified
               Substitute Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.04;

(v)            _____ Any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section
               3.07(c); and

(vi)           ____ All amounts transferred from the Payment Account to the
               Custodial Account in accordance with Section 4.02(a).

The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Custodial Account shall be
exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments on the Mortgage Loans which are not part of the Trust
Fund (consisting of payments in respect of principal and interest on the
Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date) and payments or collections in
the nature of prepayment charges or late payment charges or assumption fees may
but need not be deposited by the Servicer in the Custodial Account. In the event
any amount not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account is so
deposited, the Servicer may at any time withdraw such amount from the Custodial
Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer
shall maintain records with respect to all deposits made pursuant to this
Section. All funds deposited in the Custodial Account shall be held in trust for
the Certificateholders until withdrawn in accordance with Section 3.10.

        With respect to Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds, REO Proceeds
and the proceeds of the purchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Sections 2.02,
2.04 and 4.07 received in any calendar month, the Servicer may elect to treat
such amounts as included in the Available Distribution Amount for the
Distribution Date in the month of receipt, but is not obligated to do so. If the
Servicer so elects, such amounts will be deemed to have been received (and any
related Realized Loss shall be deemed to have occurred) on the last day of the
month prior to the receipt thereof.

(c) _____ The Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
institution maintaining the Custodial Account to invest the funds in the
Custodial Account attributable to the Mortgage Loans in Permitted Investments
which shall mature not later than the Payment Account Deposit Date next
following the date of such investment (with the exception of the Amount Held for
Future Distribution) and which shall not be sold or disposed of prior to their
maturities. All income and gain realized from any such investment shall be for
the benefit of the Servicer as additional servicing compensation and shall be
subject to its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any losses
incurred in respect of any such investments attributable to the investment of
amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account by the Servicer out of its own funds immediately as realized without any
right of reimbursement.

Section 3.08.  Subservicing Accounts; Servicing Accounts.

(a) _____ In those cases where a Subservicer is servicing a Mortgage Loan
pursuant to a Subservicing Agreement, the Servicer shall cause the Subservicer,
pursuant to the Subservicing Agreement, to establish and maintain one or more
Subservicing Accounts which shall be an Eligible Account or, if such account is
not an Eligible Account, shall be acceptable to the Servicer and each Rating


                                       54
<PAGE>

Agency. The Subservicer will be required thereby to deposit into the
Subservicing Account on a daily basis all proceeds of Mortgage Loans received by
the Subservicer, less its Subservicing Fees and unreimbursed advances and
expenses, to the extent permitted by the Subservicing Agreement. If the
Subservicing Account is not an Eligible Account, the Servicer shall be deemed to
have received such monies upon receipt thereof by the Subservicer. The
Subservicer shall not be required to deposit in the Subservicing Account
payments or collections in the nature of prepayment charges or late charges or
assumption fees. On or before each Determination Date, the Servicer shall cause
the Subservicer, pursuant to the Subservicing Agreement, to remit to the
Servicer for deposit in the Custodial Account all funds held in the Subservicing
Account with respect to each Mortgage Loan serviced by such Subservicer that are
required to be remitted to the Servicer.

(b) _____ In addition to the Custodial Account and the Payment Account, the
Servicer shall for any Nonsubserviced Mortgage Loan, and shall cause the
Subservicers for Subserviced Mortgage Loans to, establish and maintain one or
more Servicing Accounts and deposit and retain therein all collections from the
Mortgagors (or advances from Subservicers) for the payment of taxes,
assessments, hazard insurance premiums, Primary Insurance Policy premiums, if
applicable, or comparable items for the account of the Mortgagors. Each
Servicing Account shall be hold in trust, entitled "GMAC Mortgage Corporation
Servicing Account in trust for the benefit of the of the Holders of GMACM
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2003-J1." Withdrawals of amounts
related to the Mortgage Loans from the Servicing Accounts may be made only to
effect timely payment of taxes, assessments, hazard insurance premiums, Primary
Insurance Policy premiums, if applicable, or comparable items, to reimburse the
Servicer or Subservicer out of related collections for any payments made
pursuant to Sections 3.11 (with respect to the Primary Insurance Policy) and
3.12(a) (with respect to hazard insurance), to refund to any Mortgagors any sums
as may be determined to be overages, to pay interest, if required, to Mortgagors
on balances in the Servicing Account or to clear and terminate the Servicing
Account at the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01. As
part of its servicing duties, the Servicer shall, and the Subservicers will,
pursuant to the Subservicing Agreements, be required to pay to the Mortgagors
interest on funds in this account to the extent required by law.

(c) _____ The Servicer shall advance the payments referred to in the preceding
subsection that are not timely paid by the Mortgagors or advanced by the
Subservicers on the date when the tax, premium or other cost for which such
payment is intended is due, but the Servicer shall be required so to advance
only to the extent that such advances, in the good faith judgment of the
Servicer, will be recoverable by the Servicer out of Insurance Proceeds,
Liquidation Proceeds or otherwise.

Section 3.09. Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding the
Mortgage Loans.

        If compliance with this Section 3.09 shall make any Class of
Certificates legal for investment by federally insured savings and loan
associations, the Servicer shall provide, or cause the Subservicers to provide,
to the Trustee, the Office of Thrift Supervision or the FDIC and the supervisory


                                       55
<PAGE>

agents and examiners thereof access to the documentation regarding the Mortgage
Loans required by applicable regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
such access being afforded without charge but only upon reasonable request and
during normal business hours at the offices designated by the Servicer. The
Servicer shall permit such representatives to photocopy any such documentation
and shall provide equipment for that purpose at a charge reasonably
approximating the cost of such photocopying to the Servicer.

Section 3.10.  Permitted Withdrawals from the Custodial Account.

(a)  _____  The  Servicer  may,  from  time  to time as  provided  herein,  make

     a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.02, 2.04 or 4.07) which represent (A)
     Late Collections of Monthly Payments for which any such advance was made in

     (B)  recoveries  of amounts in respect of which such  advances were made in
     the case of Servicing Advances;

(iii)to pay to itself or the related  Subservicer (if not previously retained by
     such  Subservicer)  out of each payment received by the Servicer on account
     of interest on a Mortgage Loan as  contemplated  by Sections 3.14 and 3.16,
     an  amount  equal  to that  remaining  portion  of any such  payment  as to
     interest (but not in excess of the Servicing Fee and the Subservicing  Fee,
     if not  previously  retained)  which,  when  deducted,  will  result in the
     remaining  amount of such interest  being interest at the Net Mortgage Rate
     (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan) on
     the amount specified in the  amortization  schedule of the related Mortgage
     Loan as the  principal  balance  thereof  at the  beginning  of the  period
     respecting which such interest was paid after giving effect to any previous

     Mortgagors as interest in respect of Curtailments;

(vi) ____ to pay the related Seller or GMACM, with respect to each Mortgage Loan
     or  property  acquired  in  respect  thereof  that  has been  purchased  or


                                       56
<PAGE>

     otherwise  transferred  pursuant to Section 2.02,  2.04,  4.07 or 9.01, all
     amounts  received  thereon  and  not  required  to be  distributed  to  the
     Certificateholders  as of the date on which the  related  Stated  Principal
     Balance or Purchase Price is determined;

(vii)to  reimburse  itself or the  related  Subservicer  for any  Nonrecoverable
     Advance or any Advance that was ultimately  determined to be Excess Special
     Hazard  Losses,   Excess  Fraud  Losses,   Excess   Bankruptcy   Losses  or
     Extraordinary Losses in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection
     (c) below, any Advance made in connection with a modification of a Mortgage
     Loan that is in default  or, in the  judgment of the  Servicer,  default is
     reasonably  foreseeable  pursuant  to  Section  3.07(a),  to the extent the
     amount of the Advance has been added to the Stated Principal Balance of the
     Mortgage  Loan,  or any Advance  reimbursable  to the Servicer  pursuant to
     Section 4.02(a);

(viii)         to reimburse itself or the Company for expenses incurred by and

               3.11, 3.13, 3.14(c), 6.03, 10.01 or otherwise;

(ix)           ____ to reimburse itself for Servicing Advances expended by it
               (a) pursuant to Section 3.14 in good faith in connection with the
               restoration of property damaged by an Uninsured Cause, and (b) in
               connection with the liquidation of a Mortgage Loan or disposition
               of an REO Property to the extent not otherwise reimbursed
               pursuant to clause (ii) or (viii) above; and

(x)            _____ to withdraw any amount deposited in the Custodial Account
               that was not required to be deposited therein pursuant to Section
               3.07.

(b)            _____ Since, in connection with withdrawals pursuant to clauses
               (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi), the Servicer's entitlement thereto is
               limited to collections or other recoveries on the related
               Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall keep and maintain separate
               accounting, on a Mortgage Loan by Mortgage Loan basis, for the
               purpose of justifying any withdrawal from the Custodial Account
               pursuant to such clauses.

(c)            _____ The Servicer shall be entitled to reimburse itself or the
               related Subservicer for any Advance made in respect of a Mortgage
               Loan that the Servicer determines to be a Nonrecoverable Advance
               or an Advance that was ultimately determined to be Excess Special
               Hazard Losses, Excess Fraud Losses, Excess Bankruptcy Losses or
               Extraordinary Losses by withdrawal from the Custodial Account of
               amounts on deposit therein attributable to the Mortgage Loans on
               any Payment Account Deposit Date succeeding the date of such
               determination. Such right of reimbursement in respect of a
               Nonrecoverable Advance on any such Payment Account Deposit Date
               shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the portion of such
               Advance previously paid to Certificateholders (and not
               theretofore reimbursed to the Servicer or the related
               Subservicer).

Section 3.11. Maintenance of the Primary Insurance Policies; Collections
Thereunder.

(a) _____ The Servicer shall not take, or permit any Subservicer to take, any
action which would result in non-coverage under any applicable Primary Insurance


                                       57
<PAGE>

Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Servicer or Subservicer,
would have been covered thereunder. To the extent coverage is available, the
Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and effect a Primary
Insurance Policy in the case of each Mortgage Loan having a Loan-to-Value Ratio
at origination in excess of 80%, until the principal balance of the related
Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged Property is reduced to 80% or less of the
appraised value based on the most recent appraisal of the Mortgaged Property
performed by a qualified appraiser, such appraisal to be included in the related
servicing file. The Servicer shall not cancel or refuse to renew any such
Primary Insurance Policy applicable to a Nonsubserviced Mortgage Loan, or
consent to any Subservicer canceling or refusing to renew any such Primary
Insurance Policy applicable to a Mortgage Loan subserviced by it, that is in
effect at the date of the initial issuance of the Certificates and is required
to be kept in force hereunder unless the replacement Primary Insurance Policy
for such canceled or non-renewed policy is maintained with an insurer whose
claims-paying ability is acceptable to each Rating Agency for mortgage
pass-through certificates having a rating equal to or better than the lower of
the then-current rating or the rating assigned to the Certificates as of the
Closing Date by such Rating Agency. In connection with any assumption or
substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into pursuant to Section
3.13, the Servicer shall promptly notify the insurer under the related Primary
Insurance Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability in
accordance with the terms of such policy and shall take all actions which may be
required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under
the Primary Insurance Policy. If such Primary Insurance Policy is terminated as
a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the Servicer shall
obtain a replacement Primary Insurance Policy as provided above.

(b) _____ In connection with its activities as administrator and servicer of the
Mortgage Loans, the Servicer agrees to present or to cause the related
Subservicer to present, on behalf of the Servicer, the Subservicer, if any, the
Trustee and Certificateholders, claims to the related Insurer under any Primary
Insurance Policies, in a timely manner in accordance with such policies, and, in
this regard, to take or cause to be taken such reasonable action as shall be
necessary to permit recovery under any Primary Insurance Policies respecting
defaulted Mortgage Loans. Pursuant to Section 3.07, any Insurance Proceeds
collected by or remitted to the Servicer under any Primary Insurance Policies
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to
Section 3.10.

Section 3.12. Maintenance of Fire Insurance and Omissions and Fidelity Coverage.

(a) _____ The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan
(other than a Cooperative Loan) fire insurance with extended coverage in an
amount which is equal to the lesser of (i) the greater of (A) the principal
balance owing on such Mortgage Loan and (B) the percentage such that the
proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the application of a
co-insurance clause; or (ii) 100 percent of the insurable value of the
improvements. If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal
Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as being a special flood
hazard area that has federally-mandated flood insurance requirements, the
Servicer will cause to be maintained a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
with a generally acceptable insurance carrier, in an amount representing
coverage not less than the least of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the
Mortgage Loan, (ii) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing
such Mortgage Loan or (iii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available


                                       58
<PAGE>

under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. The Servicer shall
also cause to be maintained on property acquired upon foreclosure, or deed in
lieu of foreclosure, of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Cooperative Loan), fire
insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in an amount as
provided above. Pursuant to Section 3.07, any amounts collected by the Servicer
under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or
repair of the related Mortgaged Property or property thus acquired or amounts
released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal
pursuant to Section 3.10. Any cost incurred by the Servicer in maintaining any
such insurance shall not, for the purpose of calculating monthly distributions
to the Certificateholders, be added to the amount owing under the Mortgage Loan,
notwithstanding that the terms of the Mortgage Loan so permit. Such costs shall
be recoverable by the Servicer out of related late payments by the Mortgagor or
out of Insurance Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds to the extent permitted by
Section 3.10. It is understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional
insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor or maintained on property acquired
in respect of a Mortgage Loan other than pursuant to such applicable laws and
regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall require such
additional insurance. All such policies shall be endorsed with standard
mortgagee clauses with loss payable to the Servicer and its successors and/or
assigns and shall provide for at least thirty days prior written notice of any
cancellation, reduction in the amount or material change in coverage to the
Servicer. The Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of
choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance
companies unless such companies currently reflect a General Policy Rating in
Best's Key Rating Guide currently acceptable to Fannie Mae and are licensed to
do business in the state wherein the property subject to the policy is located.

        If the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a blanket fire insurance
policy with extended coverage insuring against hazard losses on all of the
Mortgage Loans, it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 3.12(a), it being
understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which
case the Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained
on the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with the first sentence of
this Section 3.12(a) and there shall have been a loss which would have been
covered by such policy, deposit in the Payment Account the amount not otherwise
payable under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause. Any such
deposit by the Servicer shall be made on the Payment Account Deposit Date next
preceding the Distribution Date which occurs in the month following the month in
which payments under any such policy would have been deposited in the Custodial
Account. In connection with its activities as administrator and servicer of the
Mortgage Loans, the Servicer agrees to present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee
and the Certificateholders, claims under any such blanket policy.

(b) _____ The Servicer shall obtain and maintain at its own expense and keep in
full force and effect throughout the term of this Agreement a blanket fidelity
bond and an errors and omissions insurance policy covering the Servicer's
officers and employees and other persons acting on behalf of the Servicer in
connection with its activities under this Agreement. The amount of coverage,
taken together, shall be at least equal to the coverage that would be required


                                       59
<PAGE>

by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with respect to the Servicer if the Servicer were
servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In
the event that any such bond or policy ceases to be in effect, the Servicer
shall obtain a comparable replacement bond or policy from an issuer or insurer,
as the case may be, meeting the requirements set forth above.

Section               3.13. Enforcement of Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption and
                      Modification Agreements; Certain Assignments.

(a) _____ When any Mortgaged Property is conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer
or Subservicer, to the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, shall enforce
any due-on-sale clause contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage, to the extent
permitted under applicable law and governmental regulations, but only to the
extent that such enforcement will not adversely affect or jeopardize coverage
under any Required Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer
is not required to exercise such rights with respect to a Mortgage Loan if the
Person to whom the related Mortgaged Property has been conveyed or is proposed
to be conveyed satisfies the terms and conditions contained in the Mortgage Note
and Mortgage related thereto and the consent of the mortgagee under such
Mortgage Note or Mortgage is not otherwise so required under such Mortgage Note
or Mortgage as a condition to such transfer. In the event that the Servicer is
prohibited by law from enforcing any such due-on-sale clause, or if coverage
under any Required Insurance Policy would be adversely affected, or if
nonenforcement is otherwise permitted hereunder, the Servicer is authorized,
subject to Section 3.13(b), to take or enter into an assumption and modification
agreement from or with the person to whom such property has been or is about to
be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage
Note and, unless prohibited by applicable state law, the Mortgagor remains
liable thereon, provided that the Mortgage Loan shall continue to be covered (if
so covered before the Servicer enters such agreement) by the applicable Required
Insurance Policies. The Servicer, subject to Section 3.13(b), is also authorized
with the prior approval of the insurers under any Required Insurance Policies to
enter into a substitution of liability agreement with such Person, pursuant to
which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and such Person is
substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default
under this Section by reason of any transfer or assumption which the Servicer
reasonably believes it is restricted by law from preventing, for any reason
whatsoever.

(b) _____ Subject to the Servicer's duty to enforce any due-on-sale clause to
the extent set forth in Section 3.13(a), in any case in which a Mortgaged
Property is to be conveyed to a Person by a Mortgagor, and such Person is to
enter into an assumption or modification agreement or supplement to the Mortgage
Note or Mortgage which requires the signature of the Trustee, or if an
instrument of release signed by the Trustee is required releasing the Mortgagor
from liability on the Mortgage Loan, the Servicer is authorized, subject to the
requirements of the sentence next following, to execute and deliver, on behalf
of the Trustee, the assumption agreement with the Person to whom the Mortgaged
Property is to be conveyed and such modification agreement or supplement to the
Mortgage Note or Mortgage or other instruments as are reasonable or necessary to
carry out the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or otherwise to comply with
any applicable laws regarding assumptions or the transfer of the Mortgaged
Property to such Person; provided, however, that in connection with any such
assumption, no material term of the Mortgage Note may be changed. Upon receipt
of appropriate instructions from the Servicer in accordance with the foregoing,


                                       60
<PAGE>

the Trustee shall execute any necessary instruments for such assumption or
substitution of liability as directed in writing by the Servicer. Upon the
closing of the transactions contemplated by such documents, the Servicer shall
cause the originals or true and correct copies of the assumption agreement, the
release (if any), or the modification or supplement to the Mortgage Note or
Mortgage to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian and deposited with the
Mortgage File for such Mortgage Loan. Any fee collected by the Servicer or such
related Subservicer for entering into an assumption or substitution of liability
agreement will be retained by the Servicer or such Subservicer as additional
servicing compensation.

(c) _____ The Servicer or the related Subservicer, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to approve a request from a Mortgagor for a partial release of the
related Mortgaged Property, the granting of an easement thereon in favor of
another Person, any alteration or demolition of the related Mortgaged Property
(or, with respect to a Cooperative Loan, the related Cooperative Apartment)
without any right of reimbursement or other similar matters if it has
determined, exercising its good faith business judgment in the same manner as it
would if it were the owner of the related Mortgage Loan, that the security for,
and the timely and full collectability of, such Mortgage Loan would not be
adversely affected thereby and if it has also determined that any portion of the
applicable REMIC would not fail to continue to qualify as a REMIC under the Code
as a result thereof and (subject to Section 10.01(f)) that no tax on "prohibited
transactions" or "contributions" after the startup day would be imposed on such
REMIC as a result thereof. Any fee collected by the Servicer or the related
Subservicer for processing such a request will be retained by the Servicer or
such Subservicer as additional servicing compensation.

(d) _____ Subject to any other applicable terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Trustee and Servicer shall be entitled to approve an assignment
in lieu of satisfaction with respect to any Mortgage Loan, provided the obligee
with respect to such Mortgage Loan following such proposed assignment provides
the Trustee and Servicer with a "Lender Certification for Assignment of Mortgage
Loan" in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee and Servicer, providing the following: (i) that the
substance of the assignment is, and is intended to be, a refinancing of such
Mortgage; (ii) that the Mortgage Loan following the proposed assignment will
have a rate of interest at least 0.25 percent below or above the rate of
interest on such Mortgage Loan prior to such proposed assignment; and (iii) that
such assignment is at the request of the borrower under the related Mortgage
Loan. Upon approval of an assignment in lieu of satisfaction with respect to any
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall receive cash in an amount equal to the unpaid
principal balance of and accrued interest on such Mortgage Loan and the Servicer
shall treat such amount as a Principal Prepayment in Full with respect to such
Mortgage Loan for all purposes hereof.

Section 3.14.  Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

(a) _____ The Servicer shall foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert
(which may include an REO Acquisition) the ownership of properties securing such
of the Mortgage Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which no
satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments
pursuant to Section 3.07. In connection with such foreclosure or other
conversion, the Servicer shall, consistent with Section 3.11, follow such


                                       61
<PAGE>

practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable, as shall be
normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing activities, as shall meet the
requirements of the Insurer under any Required Insurance Policy, and as shall be
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. With respect to any REO
Property, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of the
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, or its nominee, on behalf of
the Certificateholders. The Trustee's name shall be placed on the title to such
REO Property solely as the Trustee hereunder and not in its individual capacity.
The Servicer shall ensure that the title to such REO Property references this
Agreement and the Trustee's capacity thereunder. The Servicer, however, shall
not be required to expend its own funds or incur other reimbursable charges in
connection with any foreclosure, or attempted foreclosure which is not
completed, or towards the restoration of any property unless it shall determine
(i) that such restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the proceeds of
liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Holders of Certificates of one or more
Classes after reimbursement to itself for such expenses or charges and (ii) that
such expenses or charges will be recoverable to it through Liquidation Proceeds,
Insurance Proceeds, or REO Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for
purposes of withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.10,
whether or not such expenses and charges are actually recoverable from related
Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or REO Proceeds). In the event of such
a determination by the Servicer pursuant to this Section 3.14(a), the Servicer
shall be entitled to reimbursement of such amounts pursuant to Section 3.10. If
the Servicer has knowledge that a Mortgaged Property which the Servicer is
contemplating acquiring in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is
located within a one (1) mile radius of any site listed in the Expenditure Plan
for the Hazardous Substance Clean Up Bond Act of 1984 or other site with
environmental or hazardous waste risks known to the Servicer, the Servicer will,
prior to acquiring the Mortgaged Property, consider such risks and only take
action in accordance with its established environmental review procedures.

        The Servicer shall, either itself or through an agent selected by the
Servicer, and in accordance with the Fannie Mae guidelines, manage, conserve,
protect and operate each REO Property in the same manner that it manages,
conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for its own account,
and in the same manner that similar property in the same locality as the REO
Property is managed. Each disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by
the Servicer at such price and upon such terms and conditions as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interest of the Certificateholders.

        Upon the occurrence of a Cash Liquidation or REO Disposition, following
the deposit in the Custodial Account of all Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation
Proceeds and other payments and recoveries referred to in the definition of
"Cash Liquidation" or "REO Disposition," as applicable, upon receipt by the
Trustee of written notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing Officer,
the Trustee or any Custodian, as the case may be, shall release to the Servicer
the related Mortgage File and the Trustee shall execute and deliver such
instruments of transfer or assignment prepared by the Servicer, in each case
without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the Servicer or its designee,
as the case may be, the related Mortgage Loan, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan
shall not be part of the Trust Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, in the Servicer's sole discretion with respect to
any defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property as to either of the following
provisions, (i) a Cash Liquidation or REO Disposition may be deemed to have
occurred if substantially all amounts expected by the Servicer to be received in
connection with the related defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property have been


                                       62
<PAGE>

received, and (ii) for purposes of determining the amount of any Liquidation
Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO Proceeds or any other unscheduled collections
or the amount of any Realized Loss, the Servicer may take into account minimal
amounts of additional receipts expected to be received or any estimated
additional liquidation expenses expected to be incurred in connection with the
related defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

(b) _____ If title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired by the Trust Fund as an
REO Property by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or
certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee or to its nominee on behalf
of Certificateholders. Notwithstanding any such acquisition of title and
cancellation of the related Mortgage Loan, such REO Property shall (except as
otherwise expressly provided herein) be considered to be an Outstanding Mortgage
Loan held in the Trust Fund until such time as the REO Property shall be sold.
Consistent with the foregoing for purposes of all calculations hereunder so long
as such REO Property shall be considered to be an Outstanding Mortgage Loan it
shall be assumed that, notwithstanding that the indebtedness evidenced by the
related Mortgage Note shall have been discharged, such Mortgage Note and the
related amortization schedule in effect at the time of any such acquisition of
title (after giving effect to any previous Curtailments and before any
adjustment thereto by reason of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding or any
moratorium or similar waiver or grace period) remain in effect. To the extent
the net income received during any calendar month is in excess of the amount
attributable to amortizing principal and accrued interest at the related
Mortgage Rate on the related Mortgage Loan for such calendar month, such excess
shall be considered to be a Curtailment of the related Mortgage Loan.

(c) _____ If the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property as aforesaid or otherwise
in connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan, the
Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund shall dispose of such REO Property within
three full years after the taxable year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund for
purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (or such shorter period as may be
necessary under applicable state (including any state in which such property is
located) law to maintain the status of any portion of the applicable REMIC as a
REMIC under applicable state law and avoid taxes resulting from such property
failing to be foreclosure property under applicable state law) or, at the
expense of the Trust Fund, request, more than 60 days before the day on which
such grace period would otherwise expire, an extension of such grace period
unless the Servicer (subject to Section 10.01(f)) obtains for the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Trustee and the Servicer, to the effect
that the holding by the Trust Fund of such REO Property subsequent to such
period will not result in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions"
as defined in Section 860F of the Code or cause the applicable REMIC to fail to
qualify as a REMIC (for federal (or any applicable State or local) income tax
purposes) at any time that any Certificates are outstanding, in which case the
Trust Fund may continue to hold such REO Property (subject to any conditions
contained in such Opinion of Counsel). The Servicer shall be entitled to be
reimbursed from the Custodial Account for any costs incurred in obtaining such
Opinion of Counsel, as provided in Section 3.10. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no REO Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be
rented (or allowed to continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf
of the Trust Fund in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would (i) cause
such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the
meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) subject the Trust Fund to the
imposition of any federal income taxes on the income earned from such REO
Property, including any taxes imposed by reason of Section 860G(c) of the Code,


                                       63
<PAGE>

unless the Servicer has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund
with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

(d) _____ The proceeds of any Cash Liquidation, REO Disposition or purchase or
repurchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, as well
as any recovery resulting from a collection of Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance
Proceeds or REO Proceeds, will be applied in the following order of priority:

(b) _____ From time to time as is appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure
of any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall deliver a Request for Release to the

invalidate any insurance coverage provided in respect of the Mortgage Loan under
any Required Insurance Policy. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the Trustee (if it

Note to the Servicer. The Servicer shall cause each Mortgage Note so released to
be returned to the Trustee, or the Custodian as agent for the Trustee when the
need therefor by the Servicer no longer exists, unless (i) the Mortgage Loan has

delivered directly or through a Subservicer to the Trustee and the Custodian a
certificate of a Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and address of the
Person to which such Mortgage Note was delivered and the purpose or purposes of
such delivery. In the event of the liquidation of any such Mortgage Loan, the
Custodian, if any, or the Trustee shall deliver the Request for Release with
respect thereto to the Servicer upon deposit of the related Liquidation Proceeds
in the Custodial Account.

(c) _____ The Servicer on the Trustee's behalf shall execute and deliver to the
Servicer, if necessary, any court pleadings, requests for trustee's sale or
other documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of a
Mortgaged Property or to any legal action brought to obtain judgment against any
Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment,
or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the Mortgage Note or
Mortgage or otherwise available at law or in equity. Together with such
documents or pleadings (if signed by the Trustee), the Servicer shall deliver to
the Trustee a certificate of a Servicing Officer requesting that such pleadings
or documents be executed by the Trustee and certifying as to the reason such
documents or pleadings are required and that the execution and delivery thereof
by the Trustee will not invalidate any insurance coverage under any Required
Insurance Policy or invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the Mortgage,
except for the termination of such a lien upon completion of the foreclosure or
trustee's sale.

(d) _____ Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Servicer
shall account fully to the Trustee for any funds received by the Servicer or
which otherwise are collected by the Servicer as Liquidation Proceeds or
Insurance Proceeds in respect of any related Mortgage Loan. All Mortgage Files
and funds collected or held by, or under the control of, the Servicer in respect
of any Mortgage Loans, whether from the collection of principal and interest
payments or from Liquidation Proceeds, including but not limited to, any funds
on deposit in the Custodial Account(s), shall be held by the Servicer for and on
behalf of the Trustee and shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of
the Trustee, subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement. The
Servicer also agrees that it shall not create, incur or subject any Mortgage
File or any funds that are deposited in the Custodial Account, Payment Account
or any related Servicing Account, or any funds that otherwise are or may become
due or payable to the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, to any
claim, lien, security interest, judgment, levy, writ of attachment or other
encumbrance, or assert by legal action or otherwise any claim or right of setoff
against any Mortgage File or any funds collected on, or in connection with, a
Mortgage Loan, except, however, that the Servicer shall be entitled to set off
against and deduct from any such funds any amounts that are properly due and
payable to the Servicer under this Agreement.

Distribution Date. In making such reduction, the Servicer will not withdraw from
the Custodial Account any such amount representing all or a portion of the
Servicing Fee to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 3.10(a)(iii).

the Trustee's own negligence or willful misconduct.

        On or before 90 days after the end of the Servicer's fiscal year,
commencing with its 2003 fiscal year, the Servicer at its expense shall cause a
firm of independent public accountants (who may also render other services to
the Servicer, the Depositor or any affiliate thereof) which is a member of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to furnish a statement to the
Trustee and the Depositor to the effect that such firm has examined certain
documents and records relating to the Servicer's servicing of mortgage loans of
the same type as the Mortgage Loans pursuant to servicing agreements
substantially similar to this Agreement, which agreements may include this
Agreement, and that, on the basis of such an examination, conducted
substantially in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers, such firm is of the opinion that the Servicer's servicing has
been conducted in compliance with the agreements examined pursuant to this
Section, except for (i) such exceptions as such firm shall believe to be
immaterial, and (ii) such other exceptions as shall be set forth in such
statement. Copies of such statement shall be provided by the Trustee to any
Certificateholder upon request at the Servicer's expense, provided such
statement is delivered to the Trustee.

Section 3.20.  Rights of the Company in Respect of the Servicer.

        The Servicer shall afford the Depositor and the Trustee reasonable

from the account that satisfies the requirements for a Subservicing Account (the
"Buydown Account") the predetermined amount that, when added to the amount due
on such date from the Mortgagor, equals the full Monthly Payment and deposit
that amount in the Custodial Account together with the related payment made by
the Mortgagor or advanced by the Subservicer.

entirety during the period (the "Buydown Period") when Buydown Funds are
required to be applied to such Buydown Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
withdraw from the Buydown Account and remit any Buydown Funds remaining in the
Buydown Account in accordance with the related buydown agreement. The amount of
Buydown Funds which may be remitted in accordance with the related buydown
agreement may reduce the amount required to be paid by the Mortgagor to fully
prepay the related Mortgage Loan. If the Mortgagor on a Buydown Mortgage Loan
defaults on such Mortgage Loan during the Buydown Period and the property
securing such Buydown Mortgage Loan is sold in the liquidation thereof (either
by the Servicer or the insurer under any related Primary Insurance Policy), the
Servicer shall withdraw from the Buydown Account the Buydown Funds for such
Buydown Mortgage Loan still held in the Buydown Account and deposit the same in
the Custodial Account or, pay to the insurer under any related Primary Insurance
Policy if the Mortgaged Property is transferred to such insurer and such insurer


                                       68

pays all of the loss incurred in respect of such default. Any amount so remitted
pursuant to the preceding sentence will be deemed to reduce the amount owed on
the Mortgage Loan.

described herein.

(e) _____ In addition to the foregoing distributions, with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that was previously the subject of a Cash Liquidation or an REO
Disposition that resulted in a Realized Loss, in the event that within two years
of the date on which such Realized Loss was determined to have occurred the
Servicer receives amounts, which the Servicer reasonably believes to represent
subsequent recoveries (net of any related liquidation expenses), or determines
that it holds surplus amounts previously reserved to cover estimated expenses,
specifically related to such Mortgage Loan (including, but not limited to,
recoveries in respect of the representations and warranties made by the related
Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement), the Servicer shall distribute such
amounts to the applicable Certificateholders of the Class or Classes to which
such Realized Loss was allocated, if applicable (with the amounts to be
distributed allocated among such Classes in the same proportions as such
Realized Loss was allocated), and within each such Class to the
Certificateholders of record as of the Record Date immediately preceding the
date of such distribution; provided that no such distribution to any Class of
Certificates of subsequent recoveries related to a Mortgage Loan shall exceed,
either individually or in the aggregate and together with any other amounts
distributed in reimbursement therefor, the amount of the related Realized Loss
that was allocated to such Class of Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Realized Loss or (ii) such Class of Certificates has been deposited into a
separate trust fund or other structuring vehicle and separate certificates or
other instruments representing interests therein have been issued in one or more
classes, and any of such separate certificates or other instruments were
protected against the related Realized Loss pursuant to any limited guaranty,
payment obligation, irrevocable letter of credit, surety bond, insurance policy
or similar instrument or a reserve fund, or a combination thereof. Any amount to
be so distributed with respect to the Certificates of any Class shall be
distributed by the Servicer to the Certificateholders of record as of the Record
Date immediately preceding the date of such distribution (i) with respect to the
Certificates of any Class (other than the Class IO Certificates), on a pro rata
basis based on the Percentage Interest represented by each Certificate of such
Class as of such Record Date and (ii) with respect to the Class IO Certificates,
to the Class IO Certificates in the same proportion as the related Realized Loss


                                       77

was allocated. Any amounts to be so distributed shall not be remitted to or
distributed from the Trust Fund, and shall constitute subsequent recoveries with
respect to Mortgage Loans that are no longer assets of the Trust Fund.

(f) _____ Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be
paid to the Depository, as Holder thereof, and the Depository shall be solely
responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution to the accounts of its
Depository Participants in accordance with its normal procedures. Each
Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such distribution to
the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect participating
brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm") for which it acts as agent. Each brokerage
firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners that it
represents. None of the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Company or the
Servicer shall have any responsibility for the allocation of such distributions
among Depository Participants, brokerage firms and Certificate Owners.

(g) _____ Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01, if the Servicer
anticipates that a final distribution with respect to any Class of Certificates
shall be made on the next Distribution Date, the Servicer shall, no later than
the Determination Date in the month of such final distribution, notify the
Trustee and the Trustee shall, no later than two (2) Business Days after receipt
of such notices or such Determination Date, mail on such date to each Holder of
such Class of Certificates a notice to the effect that: (i) the Trustee
anticipates that the final distribution with respect to such Class of
Certificates shall be made on such Distribution Date but only upon presentation
and surrender of such Certificates at the office of the Trustee or as otherwise
specified therein, and (ii) no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from
and after the end of the related Interest Accrual Period. In the event that
Certificateholders required to surrender their Certificates pursuant to Section
9.01(c) do not surrender their Certificates for final cancellation, the Trustee
shall cause funds distributable with respect to such Certificates to be
withdrawn from the Payment Account and credited to a separate escrow account for
the benefit of such Certificateholders as provided in Section 9.01(d).

Section 4.03.  Statements to Certificateholders.

(a) _____ Concurrently with each distribution charged to the Payment Account and
with respect to each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall make available to
Certificateholders and other parties to this Agreement via the Trustee's
internet website a statement as to each Class of Certificates and the Mortgage
Pool that includes the information set forth in Exhibit M attached hereto.

        The Trustee's internet website shall initially be located at
"www.abs.bankone.com." Assistance in using the website can be obtained by
calling the Trustee's customer service desk at (800) 524-9472. Parties that are
unable to use the website are entitled to have a paper copy mailed to them via
first class mail by calling the customer service desk and indicating such. The
Trustee shall have the right to change the way Distribution Date statements are
distributed in order to make such distribution more convenient and/or more
accessible to the above parties, provided that such procedures are no less
convenient for the Certificateholders and the Trustee shall provide timely and
adequate notification to all above parties regarding any such changes.

containing the information set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of subsection (a)
above aggregated for such calendar year or applicable portion thereof during
which such Person was a Certificateholder. Such obligation of the Trustee shall
be deemed to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable
information shall be provided by the Trustee pursuant to any requirements of the
Code.

(c) _____ Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar
year, the Trustee shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall forward, or
cause to be forwarded, to each Person who at any time during the calendar year
was the Holder of a Class R Certificate, a statement containing the applicable
distribution information provided pursuant to this Section 4.03 aggregated for
such calendar year or applicable portion thereof during which such Person was
the Holder of a Class R Certificate. Such obligation of the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable
information shall be provided by the Servicer pursuant to any requirements of
the Code.

(d) _____ Upon the written request of any Certificateholder, the Trustee, as
soon as reasonably practicable, shall provide the requesting Certificateholder
with such information as is necessary and appropriate, in the Trustee's sole
discretion, for purposes of satisfying applicable reporting requirements under
Rule 144A. The Company and the Servicer shall cooperate with the Trustee as is
reasonably necessary to respond to any such request.

Section               4.04. Distribution of Reports to the Trustee and the
                      Company; Advances by the Servicer.

(a) _____ Prior to the close of business on the Business Day next succeeding
each Determination Date, the Servicer shall furnish the Remittance Report to the
Trustee in a mutually agreed upon form of an electromagnetic tape or disk and
hard copy, or other automated transmission. The Remittance Report and any
information supplemental thereto shall include such information with respect to
the Mortgage Loans that is required by the Trustee for purposes of making the
calculations described in Section 4.02, as set forth in written specifications
or guidelines issued by the Servicer or the Trustee from time to time. The
Trustee shall be protected in relying upon the information set forth in the
Remittance Report without any independent check or verification.

(b) _____ On or before 2:00 P.M. New York time on each Payment Account Deposit
Date, the Servicer shall either (i) deposit in the Payment Account from its own
funds, or funds received therefor from the Subservicers, an amount equal to the
Advances to be made by the Servicer in respect of the related Distribution Date,
which shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate amount of Monthly
Payments (with each interest portion thereof adjusted to the Net Mortgage Rate),
less the amount of any related Servicing Modifications, Debt Service Reductions
or reductions in the amount of interest collectable from the Mortgagor pursuant
to the Relief Act, on the Outstanding Mortgage Loans as of the related Due Date,
which Monthly Payments were delinquent as of the close of business as of the
related Determination Date; provided that no Advance shall be made if it would
be a Nonrecoverable Advance, (ii) withdraw from amounts on deposit in the


                                       79
<PAGE>

Custodial Account and deposit in the Payment Account all or a portion of the
Amount Held for Future Distribution in discharge of any such Advance, or (iii)
make advances in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii) aggregating the
amount of such Advance. Any portion of the Amount Held for Future Distribution
so used shall be replaced by the Servicer by deposit in the Payment Account on
or before 11:00 A.M. New York time on any future Payment Account Deposit Date to
the extent that funds attributable to the Mortgage Loans that are available in
the Custodial Account for deposit in the Payment Account on such Payment Account
Deposit Date shall be less than payments to Certificateholders required to be
made on the following Distribution Date. The Servicer shall be entitled to use
any Advance made by a Subservicer as described in Section 3.07(b) that has been
deposited in the Custodial Account on or before such Distribution Date as part
of the Advance made by the Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.04. The amount of
any reimbursement pursuant to Section 4.02(a) in respect of outstanding Advances
on any Distribution Date shall be allocated to specific Monthly Payments due but
delinquent for previous Due Periods, which allocation shall be made, to the
extent practicable, to Monthly Payments which have been delinquent for the
longest period of time. Such allocations shall be conclusive for purposes of
reimbursement to the Servicer from recoveries on related Mortgage Loans pursuant
to Section 3.10.

        The determination by the Servicer that it has made a Nonrecoverable
Advance or that any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable
Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer
delivered to the Company and the Trustee.

        If the Servicer determines as of the Business Day preceding any Payment
Account Deposit Date that it will be unable to deposit in the Payment Account an
amount equal to the Advance required to be made for the immediately succeeding
Distribution Date, it shall give notice to the Trustee of its inability to
advance (such notice may be given by telecopy), not later than 3:00 P.M., New
York time, on such Business Day, specifying the portion of such amount that it
will be unable to deposit. Not later than 3:00 P.M., New York time, on the
Payment Account Deposit Date the Trustee shall, unless by 12:00 Noon, New York
time, on such day the Trustee shall have been notified in writing (by telecopy)
that the Servicer shall have directly or indirectly deposited in the Payment
Account such portion of the amount of the Advance as to which the Servicer shall
have given notice pursuant to the preceding sentence, pursuant to Section 7.01,
(a) terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01 and (b) assume the rights and
obligations of the Servicer hereunder, including the obligation to deposit in
the Payment Account an amount equal to the Advance for the immediately
succeeding Distribution Date.

        The Trustee shall deposit all funds it receives pursuant to this Section
4.04 into the Payment Account.

Section 4.05.  Allocation of Realized Losses.

        Prior to each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall determine the total
amount of Realized Losses, if any, that resulted from any Cash Liquidation,
Servicing Modification, Debt Service Reduction, Deficient Valuation or REO
Disposition that occurred during the calendar month preceding the month of
distribution or, in the case of a Servicing Modification that constitutes a
reduction of the interest rate on a Mortgage Loan, the amount of the reduction


                                       80
<PAGE>

in the interest portion of the Monthly Payment due during the related Due
Period. The amount of each Realized Loss shall be evidenced by an Officer's
Certificate. All Realized Losses, other than Excess Special Hazard Losses,
Extraordinary Losses, Excess Bankruptcy Losses or Excess Fraud Losses, shall be
allocated as follows: first, to the Class B-3 Certificates until the Certificate
Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; second, to the Class B-2
Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to
zero; third, to the Class B-1 Certificates until the Certificate Principal
Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; fourth, to the Class M-3 Certificates
until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; fifth,
to the Class M-2 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof
has been reduced to zero; sixth, to the Class M-1 Certificates until the
Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; and, thereafter,
if any such Realized Losses are on a Discount Mortgage Loan, to the Class PO
Certificates in an amount equal to the Discount Fraction of the principal
portion thereof, and the remainder of such Realized Losses on the Discount
Mortgage Loans and the entire amount of such Realized Losses on Non-Discount
Mortgage Loans shall be allocated among all the Senior Certificates (other than
the Class PO Certificates) on a pro rata basis, as described below. The
principal portion of any Excess Special Hazard Losses, Excess Bankruptcy Losses,
Excess Fraud Losses and Extraordinary Losses on the Discount Mortgage Loans
shall be allocated to the Class PO Certificates in an amount equal to the
Discount Fraction thereof and the remainder of such Realized Losses on the
Discount Mortgage Loans and the entire amount of such Realized Losses on
Non-Discount Mortgage Loans will be allocated among the Senior Certificates
(other than the Class PO Certificates) and Subordinate Certificates, on a pro
rata basis, as described below.

        As used herein, an allocation of a Realized Loss on a "pro rata basis"
among two or more specified Classes of Certificates means an allocation on a pro
rata basis, among the various Classes so specified, to each such Class of
Certificates on the basis of their then outstanding Certificate Principal
Balances prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such Distribution
Date in the case of the principal portion of a Realized Loss or based on the
Accrued Certificate Interest thereon payable on such Distribution Date (without
regard to any Compensating Interest for such Distribution Date) in the case of
an interest portion of a Realized Loss. Except as provided in the following
sentence, any allocation of the principal portion of Realized Losses (other than
Debt Service Reductions) to a Class of Certificates shall be made by reducing
the Certificate Principal Balance thereof by the amount so allocated, which
allocation shall be deemed to have occurred on such Distribution Date. Any
allocation of the principal portion of Realized Losses (other than Debt Service
Reductions) to the Subordinate Certificates then outstanding with the Lowest
Priority shall be made by operation of the definition of "Certificate Principal
Balance" and by operation of the provisions of Section 4.02(a). Allocations of
the interest portions of Realized Losses shall be made in proportion to the
amount of Accrued Certificate Interest and by operation of the definition of
"Accrued Certificate Interest" and by operation of the provisions of Section
4.02(a). Allocations of the principal portion of Debt Service Reductions shall
be made by operation of the provisions of Section 4.02(a). All Realized Losses
and all other losses allocated to a Class of Certificates hereunder will be
allocated among the Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage
Interests evidenced thereby.

Section 4.06.  Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonment of Mortgaged Property.

        The Servicer or the Subservicers shall file information returns with
respect to the receipt of mortgage interests received in a trade or business,
the reports of foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property and the
information returns relating to cancellation of indebtedness income with respect
to any Mortgaged Property required by Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P,
respectively, of the Code. Such reports shall be in form and substance
sufficient to meet the reporting requirements imposed by Sections 6050H, 6050J
and 6050P of the Code.

Section 4.07.  Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

        As to any Mortgage Loan which is delinquent in payment by 90 days or
more, the Servicer may, upon the written request of and with funds provided by
the Junior Certificateholder, purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trustee at
the Purchase Price therefor. If at any time the Servicer makes a payment to the
Payment Account covering the amount of the Purchase Price for such a Mortgage
Loan, and the Servicer provides to the Trustee a certification signed by a
Servicing Officer stating that the amount of such payment has been deposited in
the Payment Account, then the Trustee shall execute the assignment of such
Mortgage Loan at the request of the Servicer without recourse to the Junior
Certificateholder, which shall succeed to all the Trustee's right, title and
interest in and to such Mortgage Loan, and all security and documents relative
thereto. Such assignment shall be an assignment outright and not for security.
The Junior Certificateholder shall thereupon own such Mortgage, and all such
security and documents, free of any further obligation to the Trustee or the
Certificateholders with respect thereto.

                                THE CERTIFICATES

Section 5.01.  The Certificates.

(a) _____ The Senior, Class M, Class B and Class R Certificates shall be
substantially in the forms set forth in Exhibits A, B, C and D, respectively,
and shall, on original issue, be executed and delivered by the Trustee to the
Certificate Registrar for authentication and delivery to or upon the order of
the Company upon receipt by the Trustee or one or more Custodians of the
documents specified in Section 2.01. The Certificates shall be issuable in the
minimum denominations designated in the Preliminary Statement.

        The Certificates shall be executed by manual or facsimile signature on
behalf of an authorized signatory of the Trustee. Certificates bearing the
manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper
authorized signatories of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee, notwithstanding
that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to
the authentication and delivery of such Certificate or did not hold such offices
at the date of such Certificates. No Certificate shall be entitled to any
benefit under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears
on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form
provided for herein executed by the Certificate Registrar by manual signature,


                                       82
<PAGE>

and such certificate upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the
only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

(b) _____ Except as provided below, registration of Book-Entry Certificates may
not be transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository that agrees to
hold such Certificates for the respective Certificate Owners with Ownership
Interests therein. The Holders of the Book-Entry Certificates shall hold their
respective Ownership Interests in and to each of such Certificates through the
book-entry facilities of the Depository and, except as provided below, shall not
be entitled to Definitive Certificates in respect of such Ownership Interests.
All transfers by Certificate Owners of their respective Ownership Interests in
the Book-Entry Certificates shall be made in accordance with the procedures
established by the Depository Participant or brokerage firm representing such
Certificate Owner. Each Depository Participant shall transfer the Ownership
Interests only in the Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate Owners it
represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in accordance with
the Depository's normal procedures.

        The Trustee, the Servicer and the Company may for all purposes
(including the making of payments due on the respective Classes of Book-Entry
Certificates) deal with the Depository as the authorized representative of the
Certificate Owners with respect to the respective Classes of Book-Entry
Certificates for the purposes of exercising the rights of Certificateholders
hereunder. The rights of Certificate Owners with respect to the respective
Classes of Book-Entry Certificates shall be limited to those established by law
and agreements between such Certificate Owners and the Depository Participants
and brokerage firms representing such Certificate Owners. Multiple requests and
directions from, and votes of, the Depository as Holder of any Class of
Book-Entry Certificates with respect to any particular matter shall not be
deemed inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Certificate
Owners. The Trustee may establish a reasonable record date in connection with
solicitations of consents from or voting by Certificateholders and shall give
notice to the Depository of such record date.

        If (i)(A) the Company advises the Trustee in writing that the Depository
is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities as
Depository and (B) the Company is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii)
the Company at its option advises the Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Depository, the Trustee shall notify
all Certificate Owners, through the Depository, of the occurrence of any such
event and of the availability of Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners
requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the Book-Entry
Certificates by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from
the Depository for registration of transfer, the Trustee shall issue the
Definitive Certificates. Neither the Company, the Servicer nor the Trustee shall
be liable for any actions taken by the Depository or its nominee, including,
without limitation, any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.
Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates all references herein to
obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Company in connection with
the issuance of the Definitive Certificates pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall
be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Trustee, and the Trustee and
the Servicer shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Certificates as
Certificateholders hereunder.

                      accordance with the provisions of Section 8.12, a
                      Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable
                      regulations as it may prescribe, the Trustee shall provide
                      for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and
                      exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee
                      is initially appointed Certificate Registrar for the
                      purpose of registering Certificates and transfers and
                      exchanges of Certificates as herein provided.

(b)                   _____ Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
                      Certificate at any office or agency of the Trustee
                      maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 8.12 and,
                      in the case of any Class M, Class B or Class R
                      Certificate, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
                      below, the Trustee shall execute and the Certificate
                      Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of
                      the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
                      Certificates of a like Class and aggregate Percentage
                      Interest.

(c)                   _____ At the option of the Certificateholders,
                      Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of
                      authorized denominations of a like Class and aggregate
                      Percentage Interest, upon surrender of the Certificates to
                      be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any
                      Certificates are so surrendered for exchange the Trustee
                      shall execute and the Certificate Registrar shall
                      authenticate and deliver the Certificates of such Class
                      which the Certificateholder making the exchange is
                      entitled to receive. Every Certificate presented or
                      surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required
                      by the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar) be duly
                      endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
                      transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and the
                      Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof
                      or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

(d)                   _____ No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of a
                      Class B Certificate shall be made unless such transfer,
                      sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the
                      registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
                      as amended, and any applicable state securities laws or is
                      made in accordance with said Act and laws. In the event
                      that a transfer of a Class B Certificate is to be made
                      either (i)(A) the Trustee shall require a written Opinion
                      of Counsel acceptable to and in form and substance
                      satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company that such
                      transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption, describing
                      the applicable exemption and the basis therefor, from said
                      Act and laws or is being made pursuant to said Act and
                      laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of
                      the Trustee, the Company or the Servicer (except that, if
                      such transfer is made by the Company or the Servicer or
                      any Affiliate thereof, the Company or the Servicer shall
                      provide such Opinion of Counsel at their own expense);
                      provided that such Opinion of Counsel shall not be
                      required in connection with the initial transfer of any
                      such Certificate by the Company or any Affiliate thereof
                      to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and (B) the

                      acceptable to and in form and substance satisfactory to
                      the Company and the Trustee certifying to the Company and
                      the Trustee the facts surrounding such transfer, which
                      representation letters shall not be an expense of the
                      Trustee, the Company or the Servicer; provided, however,
                      that such representation letters shall not be required in
                      connection with any transfer of any such Certificate by

                      Affiliate of the Company, and the Trustee shall be
                      entitled to conclusively rely upon a representation
                      (which, upon the request of the Trustee, shall be a
                      written representation) from the Company, of the status of
                      such transferee as an Affiliate of the Company or (ii) the
                      prospective transferee of such a Certificate shall be
                      required to provide the Trustee, the Company and the
                      Servicer with an investment letter substantially in the

                      Trustee, the Company or the Servicer, and which investment
                      letter states that, among other things, such transferee
                      (A) is a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined under
                      Rule 144A, acting for its own account or the accounts of
                      other "qualified institutional buyers" as defined under
                      Rule 144A, and (B) is aware that the proposed transferor
                      intends to rely on the exemption from registration
                      requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
                      provided by Rule 144A. The Holder of any such Certificate
                      desiring to effect any such transfer, sale, pledge or
                      other disposition shall, and does hereby agree to,
                      indemnify the Trustee, the Company, the Servicer and the
                      Certificate Registrar against any liability that may
                      result if the transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition
                      is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such
                      federal and state laws.

(e)                   _____ (i) ____ In the case of any Class B or Class R
                      Certificate presented for registration in the name of any
                      Person, either (A) the Trustee shall require an Opinion of
                      Counsel acceptable to and in form and substance
                      satisfactory to the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer
                      to the effect that the purchase or holding of such Class B
                      or Class R Certificate is permissible under applicable
                      law, will not constitute or result in any non-exempt
                      prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the Employee
                      Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
                      ("ERISA"), or Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable
                      provisions of any subsequent enactments), and will not
                      subject the Trustee, the Company or the Servicer to any
                      obligation or liability (including obligations or
                      liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in
                      addition to those undertaken in this Agreement, which
                      Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee,
                      the Company or the Servicer or (B) the prospective
                      Transferee shall be required to provide the Trustee, the
                      Company and the Servicer with a certification to the
                      effect set forth in paragraph six of Exhibit H or

                      Certificate) or paragraph sixteen of Exhibit G-1 (with
                      respect to any Class R Certificate), which the Trustee may
                      rely upon without further inquiry or investigation, or
                      such other certifications as the Trustee may deem
                      desirable or necessary in order to establish that such

                      Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be
                      deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership
                      Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following
                      provisions and to have irrevocably authorized the Trustee
                      or its designee under clause (iii)(A) below to deliver
                      payments to a Person other than such Person and to
                      negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale under clause
                      (iii)(B) below and to execute all instruments of transfer
                      and to do all other things necessary in connection with
                      any such sale. The rights of each Person acquiring any
                      Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate are expressly
                      subject to the following provisions:

(A)  _____ Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership  Interest in a Class R

     (I) an affidavit and agreement (a "Transfer  Affidavit and  Agreement,"  in
     the form attached hereto as Exhibit G-1) from the proposed  Transferee,  in

     form  and  substance   satisfactory  to  the  Servicer,   representing  and
     warranting,  among other things, that it is a Permitted Transferee, that it
     is not acquiring its Ownership  Interest in the Class R Certificate that is
     the subject of the proposed Transfer as a nominee, trustee or agent for any
     Person who is not a  Permitted  Transferee,  that for so long as it retains
     its  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R  Certificate,  it shall  endeavor to
     remain a Permitted  Transferee,  and that it has reviewed the provisions of
     this  Section  5.02(f)  and  agrees  to  be  bound  by  them,  and  (II)  a
     certificate,  in the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit G-2, from the Holder
     wishing  to  transfer  the  Class  R  Certificate,  in form  and  substance
     satisfactory  to the Servicer,  representing  and  warranting,  among other
     things,  that  no  purpose  of  the  proposed  Transfer  is to  impede  the
     assessment or collection of tax.

(C)  _____ Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement by
     a proposed  Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible  Officer of
     the Trustee who is assigned to this Agreement has actual knowledge that the
     proposed  Transferee  is not a  Permitted  Transferee,  no  Transfer  of an
     Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate  to such  proposed  Transferee
     shall be effected.

(D)  _____ Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership  Interest in a Class R
     Certificate  shall agree (x) to require a Transfer  Affidavit and Agreement
     from any  other  Person  to whom  such  Person  attempts  to  transfer  its
     Ownership  Interest in a Class R  Certificate  and (y) not to transfer  its
     Ownership  Interest  unless it provides a certificate to the Trustee in the
     form attached hereto as Exhibit G-2.

(E)  Each  Person  holding  or  acquiring  an  Ownership  Interest  in a Class R
     Certificate,  by  purchasing  an  Ownership  Interest in such  Certificate,
     agrees  to give  the  Trustee  written  notice  that it is a  "pass-through
     interest  holder"  within the  meaning of  Temporary  Treasury  Regulations
     Section   1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A)   immediately  upon  acquiring  an  Ownership
     Interest  in a Class R  Certificate,  if it is, or is holding an  Ownership
     Interest in a Class R Certificate  on behalf of, a  "pass-through  interest
     holder."

(ii) ____ The Trustee  shall  register the  Transfer of any Class R  Certificate
     only if it shall have  received the Transfer  Affidavit  and  Agreement,  a
     certificate  of the Holder  requesting  such  transfer in the form attached
     hereto as Exhibit  G-2 and all of such other  documents  as shall have been
     reasonably  required by the Trustee as a  condition  to such  registration.
     Transfers of the Class R  Certificates  to  Non-United  States  Persons and
     Disqualified  Organizations (as defined in Section  860E(e)(5) of the Code)
     are prohibited.

(iii)(A) If any  Disqualified  Organization  shall  become a holder of a Class R
     Certificate,   then  the  last  preceding  Permitted  Transferee  shall  be
     restored,  to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and obligations as
     Holder thereof  retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of


                                       87

     such Class R  Certificate.  If a  Non-United  States  Person shall become a
     holder of a Class R  Certificate,  then the last  preceding  United  States
     Person shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and
     obligations as Holder thereof  retroactive to the date of  registration  of
     such  Transfer  of such Class R  Certificate.  If a  transfer  of a Class R
     Certificate  is   disregarded   pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Treasury
     Regulations  Section 1.860E-1 or Section 1.860G-3,  then the last preceding
     Permitted Transferee shall be restored,  to the extent permitted by law, to
     all rights and  obligations  as Holder  thereof  retroactive to the date of
     registration  of such  Transfer  of such Class R  Certificate.  The Trustee
     shall be under no liability to any Person for any  registration of Transfer
     of a Class R  Certificate  that is in fact not  permitted  by this  Section
     5.02(f) or for making any  payments due on such  Certificate  to the holder
     thereof or for taking any other  action with  respect to such holder  under
     the provisions of this Agreement.

(B)  If any purported  Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate
     in violation of the  restrictions in this Section 5.02(f) and to the extent
     that the retroactive  restoration of the rights of the Holder of such Class
     R  Certificate  as  described  in clause  (iii)(A)  above shall be invalid,
     illegal or unenforceable,  then the Servicer shall have the right,  without
     notice to the holder or any prior  holder of such Class R  Certificate,  to
     sell such Class R  Certificate  to a purchaser  selected by the Servicer on
     such terms as the  Servicer may choose.  Such  purported  Transferee  shall
     promptly  endorse and deliver the Class R Certificates  in accordance  with
     the instructions of the Servicer. Such purchaser may be the Servicer itself
     or any  Affiliate of the  Servicer.  The proceeds of such sale,  net of the
     commissions (which may include  commissions  payable to the Servicer or its
     Affiliates),  expenses  and taxes due,  if any,  shall be  remitted  by the
     Servicer to such purported Transferee. The terms and conditions of any sale
     under this clause  (iii)(B)  shall be determined in the sole  discretion of
     the Servicer,  and the Servicer shall not be liable to any Person having an
     Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of
     such discretion.

(iv) The Trustee shall make  available,  upon written  request from the Internal
     Revenue  Service  or  any  potentially  affected  Person,  all  information
     necessary  to compute any tax imposed (A) as a result of the Transfer of an
     Ownership  Interest  in a  Class  R  Certificate  to  any  Person  who is a
     Disqualified  Organization,  including the  information  regarding  "excess
     inclusions"  of such Class R  Certificates  required  to be provided to the
     Internal  Revenue  Service and  certain  Persons as  described  in Treasury
     Regulations Sections 1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E-2(a)(5), and (B) as a result
     of any regulated  investment company,  real estate investment trust, common
     trust fund, partnership, trust, estate or organization described in Section
     1381 of the Code that holds an Ownership  Interest in a Class R Certificate
     having  as  among  its  record  holders  at any time  any  Person  who is a
     Disqualified  Organization.  Reasonable  compensation  for  providing  such
     information  may be  required by the Trustee  before it will  provide  such


                                       88
<PAGE>

     information  to  any  such  potentially  affected  Person.  (v)  _____  The
     provisions  of this Section  5.02(f) set forth prior to this clause (v) may
     be modified,  added to or  eliminated,  provided that there shall have been
     delivered to the Trustee the following:

(A)  _____ written  notification  from each Rating Agency to the effect that the
     modification,  addition to or elimination of such provisions will not cause
     such Rating Agency to downgrade its  then-current  ratings,  if any, of any
     Class of the Senior, Class M or Class B Certificates below the lower of the
     then-current  rating or the rating assigned to such  Certificates as of the
     Closing Date by such Rating Agency; and

(B)  subject to Section  10.01(f),  an  Officer's  Certificate  of the  Servicer
     stating that the  Servicer has received an Opinion of Counsel,  in form and
     substance   satisfactory   to  the  Servicer,   to  the  effect  that  such
     modification,  addition to or absence of such provisions will not cause any
     portion of the applicable REMIC to cease to qualify as a REMIC and will not
     cause  (x)  any  portion  of  the  applicable  REMIC  to be  subject  to an
     entity-level  tax caused by the  Transfer of any Class R  Certificate  to a
     Person that is a Disqualified  Organization or (y) a  Certificateholder  or
     another Person to be subject to a REMIC-related  tax caused by the Transfer
     of a Class R Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.

(g)  _____ No service  charge  shall be made for any  transfer  or  exchange  of
     Certificates  of any Class,  but the Trustee  may require  payment of a sum
     sufficient to cover any tax or  governmental  charge that may be imposed in
     connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

(h)  _____ All  Certificates  surrendered  for transfer  and  exchange  shall be
     destroyed by the Certificate Registrar.

Section 5.03.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

        If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar, or the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar receive evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and
(ii) there is delivered to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless,
then, in the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar that
such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall
execute and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in
exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor, Class and Percentage Interest but
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the


                                       89
<PAGE>

Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute complete and
indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust Fund, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any
time.

Section 5.04.  Persons Deemed Owners.

        Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and any agent
of the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, or the Certificate Registrar may
treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the owner of
such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section
4.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, except as and to the extent provided
in the definition of "Certificateholder," and neither the Company, the Servicer,
the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any agent of the Company, the
Servicer, the Trustee, or the Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice
to the contrary except as provided in Section 5.02(f).

Section 5.05.  Appointment of Paying Agent.

        The Trustee may appoint a Paying Agent for the purpose of making
distributions to the Certificateholders pursuant to Section 4.02. In the event
of any such appointment, on or prior to each Distribution Date the Trustee shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to make
the payments to the Certificateholders in the amounts and in the manner provided
for in Section 4.02, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.

        The Trustee shall cause each Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee
that such Paying Agent shall hold all sums held by it for the payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders entitled
thereto until such sums shall be distributed to such Certificateholders. Any
sums so held by such Paying Agent shall be held only in Eligible Accounts to the
extent such sums are not distributed to the Certificateholders on the date of
receipt by such Paying Agent.

Section 5.06.  Optional Purchase of Certificates.

(a)  _____ On any Distribution Date on which the Pool Stated Principal  Balance,
     prior to giving  effect to  distributions  to be made on such  Distribution
     Date, is less than ten percent of the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the
     Mortgage  Loans,  the  Servicer  shall have the right,  at its  option,  to
     purchase the  Certificates  in whole,  but not in part, at a price equal to
     the outstanding Certificate Principal Balance of such Certificates plus the
     sum of  Accrued  Certificate  Interest  thereon  for the  related  Interest
     Accrual Period and any previously unpaid Accrued Certificate Interest.

(b)  _____ The  Servicer  shall give the  Trustee  not less than 60 days'  prior
     notice of the Distribution  Date on which the Servicer  anticipates that it
     shall purchase the Certificates pursuant to Section 5.06(a).  Notice of any
     such purchase,  specifying the Distribution Date upon which the Holders may
     surrender their  Certificates to the Trustee for payment in accordance with
     this  Section  5.06,  shall be given  promptly by the Servicer by letter to
     Certificateholders  (with  a copy to the  Certificate  Registrar  and  each
     Rating  Agency) mailed not earlier than the 15th day and not later than the
     25th day of the month next preceding the month of such final  distribution,
     specifying:

                                       90
<PAGE>

(i)  _____ the  Distribution  Date upon which  purchase of the  Certificates  is
     anticipated to be made upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates
     at the office or agency of the Trustee therein designated,

(ii) ____ the purchase price therefor, if known, and

(iii)that the Record Date otherwise  applicable to such Distribution Date is not
     applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the
     Certificates at the office or agency of the Trustee therein specified.

If the Servicer gives the notice specified above, the Servicer shall deposit in
the Payment Account before the Distribution Date on which the purchase pursuant
to Section 5.06(a) is to be made, in immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the purchase price for the Certificates computed as provided above.

(c) _____ Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates to be purchased
pursuant to Section 5.06(a) by the Holders thereof, the Trustee shall distribute
to such Holders an amount equal to the outstanding Certificate Principal Balance
thereof plus the sum of Accrued Certificate Interest thereon for the related
Interest Accrual Period and any previously unpaid Accrued Certificate Interest
with respect thereto.

(d) _____ If any Certificateholders do not surrender their Certificates on or
before the Distribution Date on which a purchase pursuant to this Section 5.06
is to be made, the Trustee shall on such date cause all funds in the Payment
Account deposited therein by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.06(b) to be
withdrawn therefrom and deposited in a separate escrow account for the benefit
of such Certificateholders, and the Servicer shall give a second written notice
to such Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for payment of the
purchase price therefor. If within six months after the second notice any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee shall
take appropriate steps as directed by the Servicer to contact the Holders of
such Certificates concerning surrender of their Certificates. The costs and
expenses of maintaining the escrow account and of contacting Certificateholders
shall be paid out of the assets which remain in the escrow account. If within
nine months after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation in accordance with this Section 5.06, the Trustee
shall pay to the Servicer all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof and
the Servicer shall thereafter hold such amounts until distributed to such
Holders. No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any
amount held in the escrow account or by the Servicer as a result of such
Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for payment in
accordance with this Section 5.06. Any Certificate that is not surrendered on
the Distribution Date on which a purchase pursuant to this Section 5.06 occurs
as provided above shall be deemed to have been purchased and the Holder as of
such date shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive the
purchase price therefor minus any costs and expenses associated with such escrow
account and notices allocated thereto. Any Certificates so purchased or deemed
to have been purchased on such Distribution Date shall remain outstanding
hereunder. The Servicer shall be for all purposes the Holder thereof as of such
date.

        The Company and the Servicer shall each be liable in accordance herewith
only to the extent of the obligations specifically and respectively imposed upon

and not limitation, the Company is not liable for the servicing and
administration of the Mortgage Loans, nor is it obligated by Section 7.01 or
Section 10.01 to assume any obligations of the Servicer or to appoint a designee
to assume such obligations, nor is it liable for any other obligation hereunder
that it may, but is not obligated to, assume unless it elects to assume such
obligation in accordance herewith.

consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which the Company or the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the business of the Company or the Servicer, shall be the successor of the
Company or the Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that the
successor or surviving Person to the Servicer shall be qualified to service
mortgage loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; and provided further that
each Rating Agency's ratings, if any, of the Senior Class M or Class B
Certificates in effect immediately prior to such merger or consolidation will
not be qualified, reduced or withdrawn as a result thereof (as evidenced by a
letter to such effect from each Rating Agency).

(c) _____ Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 6.02 and Section 6.04 to
the contrary, the Servicer may assign its rights and delegate its duties and
obligations under this Agreement; provided that the Person accepting such
assignment or delegation shall be a Person which is qualified to service
mortgage loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, is reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company, is willing to service the Mortgage
Loans and executes and delivers to the Company and the Trustee an agreement, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, which
contains an assumption by such Person of the due and punctual performance and
observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the
Servicer under this Agreement; provided further that each Rating Agency's rating


                                       92
<PAGE>

of the Classes of Certificates that have been rated in effect immediately prior
to such assignment and delegation will not be qualified, reduced or withdrawn as
a result of such assignment and delegation (as evidenced by a letter to such
effect from each Rating Agency). In the case of any such assignment and
delegation, the Servicer shall be released from its obligations under this
Agreement, except that the Servicer shall remain liable for all liabilities and
obligations incurred by it as Servicer hereunder prior to the satisfaction of
the conditions to such assignment and delegation set forth in the next preceding
sentence.

Section 6.03.  Limitation on Liability of the Company, the Servicer and Others.

        Neither the Company, the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company or the Servicer shall be under any liability
to the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Company, the Servicer or any such Person against any
breach of warranties or representations made herein or any liability which would
otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties hereunder. The Company, the Servicer and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or the Servicer may rely in good faith
on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any
Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Company, the Servicer and
any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or the Servicer shall be
indemnified by the Trust Fund and held harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement
or the Certificates, other than any loss, liability or expense related to any
specific Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans (except as any such loss, liability or
expense shall be otherwise reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement) and any
loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of
reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.

        Neither the Company nor the Servicer shall be under any obligation to
appear in, prosecute or defend any legal or administrative action, proceeding,
hearing or examination that is not incidental to its respective duties under
this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it in any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Company or the Servicer may in its
discretion undertake any such action, proceeding, hearing or examination that it
may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders
hereunder. In such event, the legal expenses and costs of such action,
proceeding, hearing or examination and any liability resulting therefrom shall
be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust Fund, and the Company and the
Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor out of amounts attributable
to the Mortgage Loans on deposit in the Custodial Account as provided by Section
3.10 and, on the Distribution Date(s) following such reimbursement, the
aggregate of such expenses and costs shall be allocated in reduction of the
Accrued Certificate Interest on each Class entitled thereto in the same manner
as if such expenses and costs constituted a Prepayment Interest Shortfall.

Section 6.04.  Company and Servicer Not to Resign.

        Subject to the provisions of Section 6.02, neither the Company nor the
Servicer shall resign from its respective obligations and duties hereby imposed
on it except upon determination that its duties hereunder are no longer
permissible under applicable law. Any such determination permitting the
resignation of the Company or the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel to such effect delivered to the Trustee. No such resignation by the
Servicer shall become effective until the Trustee or a successor servicer shall
have assumed the Servicer's responsibilities and obligations in accordance with
Section 7.02.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                     DEFAULT

Section 7.01.  Events of Default.

        Event of Default, wherever used herein, means any one of the following
events (whatever reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be
voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any
judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body):

(i)  the  Servicer  shall  fail to  deposit  or cause to be  deposited  into the
     Payment Account any amounts required to be so deposited therein at the time
     required  pursuant to Section 4.01 or otherwise,  and in either case,  such
     failure  shall  continue  unremedied  for a period of 5 days after the date
     upon which  written  notice of such failure,  requiring  such failure to be
     remedied,  shall  have been  given to the  Servicer  by the  Trustee or the
     Company or to the  Servicer,  the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
     Certificates of such Class evidencing  Percentage Interests aggregating not
     less than 25%; or

(ii) the Servicer  shall fail to observe or perform in any material  respect any
     other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Servicer  contained
     in the  Certificates  of any Class or in this  Agreement  and such  failure
     shall continue  unremedied for a period of 30 days (except that such number
     of days  shall be 15 in the case of a failure  to pay the  premium  for any
     Required  Insurance  Policy) after the date on which written notice of such
     failure,  requiring  the same to be remedied,  shall have been given to the
     Servicer by the Trustee or the Company, or to the Servicer, the Company and
     the Trustee by the Holders of Certificates of any Class evidencing,  in the
     case of any such Class, Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25%;
     or

(iii)a decree  or order of a court or  agency or  supervisory  authority  having
     jurisdiction  in the premises in an  involuntary  case under any present or
     future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing
     a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency,  readjustment of
     debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings,  or for


                                       94
<PAGE>

     the  winding-up  or  liquidation  of its  affairs,  shall have been entered
     against the Servicer and such decree or order shall have  remained in force
     undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

(iv) ____ the Servicer  shall consent to the  appointment  of a  conservator  or
     receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling
     of assets and liabilities,  or similar  proceedings of, or relating to, the
     Servicer or of, or relating to, all or substantially all of the property of
     the Servicer; or

(v)  _____ the  Servicer  shall admit in writing its  inability to pay its debts
     generally  as they become due,  file a petition  to take  advantage  of, or
     commence  a   voluntary   case  under,   any   applicable   insolvency   or
     reorganization   statute,  make  an  assignment  for  the  benefit  of  its
     creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations; or

(vi) ____ the Servicer shall notify the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.04(b) that
     it is unable to  deposit  in the  Payment  Account  an amount  equal to the
     Advance.

        If an Event of Default described in clauses (i)-(v) of this Section
shall occur, then, and in each and every such case, so long as such Event of
Default shall not have been remedied, the Company may, and at the direction of
Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 51% of the Voting Rights, the
Trustee shall, by notice in writing to the Servicer (and to the Company if given
by the Trustee or to the Trustee if given by the Company), terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the
Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, other than its rights as a
Certificateholder hereunder. If an Event of Default described in clause (vi)
hereof shall occur, the Trustee shall, by notice to the Servicer and the
Company, immediately terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer
under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof,
other than its rights as a Certificateholder hereunder as provided in Section
4.04(b). On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all
authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect
to the Certificates (other than as a Holder thereof) or the Mortgage Loans or
otherwise, shall subject to Section 7.02 pass to and be vested in the Trustee or
the Trustee's designee appointed pursuant to Section 7.02; and, without
limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and
all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of
the Mortgage Loans and related documents, or otherwise. The Servicer agrees to
cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation, the
transfer to the Trustee or its designee for administration by it of all cash
amounts which shall at the time be credited to the Custodial Account or the
Payment Account or thereafter be received with respect to the Mortgage Loans,
and the delivery to the Trustee of the Mortgage Files, and the recordation of
Assignments of Mortgages to the Trustee if MERS is not the mortgagee of a
Mortgage Loan or otherwise in accordance with Section 7.02(b). No such
termination shall release the Servicer for any liability that it would otherwise
have hereunder for any act or omission prior to the effective time of such
termination.

                                       95
<PAGE>

        Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of GMACM in its
capacity as Servicer hereunder, GMACM shall be entitled to receive, out of any
late collection of a Monthly Payment on a Mortgage Loan which was due prior to
the notice terminating GMACM's rights and obligations as Servicer hereunder and
received after such notice, that portion to which GMACM would have been entitled
pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(ii), (vi) and (vii) as well as its Servicing Fee in
respect thereof, and any other amounts payable to GMACM hereunder the
entitlement to which arose prior to the termination of its activities hereunder.

Section 7.02.  Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

(a) _____ Within 90 days of the time the Servicer resigns pursuant to Section
6.04 or receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.01, the Trustee
or a successor Servicer appointed by the Trustee hereunder shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer under this
Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be
subject thereafter to all the responsibilities, duties, liabilities and
limitations on liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer, including
the obligation to make Advances which have been or will be required to be made,
but excluding the representations of the Servicer contained in Section 2.03, by
the terms and provisions hereof; provided that any failure to perform such
duties or responsibilities caused by the predecessor Servicer's failure to
provide information required by Section 4.02 or 4.03 shall not be considered a
default by the Trustee as successor Servicer hereunder; and provided further
that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever with respect to any
liability (other than Advances deemed recoverable and not previously made)
incurred by the predecessor Servicer at or prior to the time of receipt by such
Servicer of the notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.01 or receipt by the
Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel referred to in Section 6.04. As compensation
therefor, the Trustee shall be entitled to the Servicing Fee and all funds
relating to the Mortgage Loans which the Servicer would have been entitled to
charge to the Custodial Account if the Servicer had continued to act hereunder,
except for amounts that the Servicer shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 7.01. If the Trustee has become the successor to the Servicer in
accordance with Section 6.04 or this Section 7.02, then notwithstanding the
above, if the Trustee shall be unwilling to so act, or shall be unable to so
act, the Trustee may appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint, any established housing and home finance institution, which is also a
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-approved mortgage servicing institution, having a net
worth of not less than $10,000,000 as the successor to the Servicer hereunder in
the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities
of the Servicer hereunder. Pending appointment of a successor to the Servicer
hereunder, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as herein above provided. In
connection with such appointment and assumption, the Trustee may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on Mortgage
Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such
compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Servicer hereunder. Each
of the Sellers, the Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such
succession.

        If the Trustee becomes the successor to the Servicer hereunder, the
Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Servicer for all costs
associated with the transfer of the servicing of the Mortgage Loans to the
Trustee, including any costs or expenses associated with the complete transfer
of all servicing data and the completion, correction or manipulation of such


                                       96
<PAGE>

servicing data as may be required by the Trustee to correct any errors or
insufficiencies in the servicing data or otherwise to enable the Trustee to
service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement. To the extent that
any such costs and expenses of the Trustee resulting from the termination of the
Servicer pursuant to this Section 7.02 are not reimbursed by the terminated
Servicer, the Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of such costs and
expenses from the Payment Account.

        Any successor, including the Trustee, to the Servicer shall maintain in
force during its term as Servicer hereunder insurance policies and fidelity
bonds as may be required to be maintained by the Servicer pursuant to Section
3.12.

        If the Trustee shall succeed to any duties of the Servicer with respect
to the Mortgage Loans as provided herein, it shall do so in a separate capacity
and not in its capacity as Trustee and, accordingly, the provisions of Article
VIII shall be inapplicable to the Trustee in its duties as successor Servicer in
the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (although such provisions shall continue to
apply to the Trustee in its capacity as trustee); the provisions of Article III,
however, shall apply to the Trustee in its capacity as successor Servicer.

(b) _____ In connection with the termination or resignation of the Servicer
hereunder, either (i) the successor Servicer, including the Trustee if the
Trustee is acting as successor Servicer, shall represent and warrant that it is
a member of MERS in good standing and shall agree to comply in all material
respects with the rules and procedures of MERS in connection with the servicing
of the Mortgage Loans that are registered with MERS, in which case the
predecessor Servicer shall cooperate with the successor Servicer in causing MERS
to revise its records to reflect the transfer of servicing to the successor
Servicer as necessary under MERS' rules and regulations, or (ii) the predecessor
Servicer shall cooperate with the successor Servicer in causing MERS to execute
and deliver an assignment of Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the
Mortgage from MERS to the Trustee and to execute and deliver such other notices,
documents and other instruments as may be necessary or desirable to effect a
transfer of such Mortgage Loan or servicing of such Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)
System to the successor Servicer. The predecessor Servicer shall file or cause
to be filed any such assignment in the appropriate recording office. The
predecessor Servicer shall bear any and all fees of MERS, costs of preparing any
assignments of Mortgage, and fees and costs of filing any assignments of
Mortgage that may be required under this subsection (b). The successor Servicer
shall cause such assignment to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian
promptly upon receipt of the original with evidence of recording thereon or a
copy certified by the public recording office in which such assignment was
recorded.

Section 7.03.  Notification to Certificateholders.

(a) _____ Upon any such termination or appointment of a successor to the
Servicer, the Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate
Register.

(b) _____ Within 60 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default, the
Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Certificates notice of each
such Event of Default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such Event of
Default shall have been cured or waived.

                                       97
<PAGE>

Section 7.04.  Waiver of Events of Default.

        The Holders representing at least 66% of the Voting Rights affected by a
default or Event of Default hereunder may waive such default or Event of
Default; provided, however, that (a) a default or Event of Default under clause
(i) of Section 7.01 may be waived only by all of the Holders of Certificates
affected by such default or Event of Default and (b) no waiver pursuant to this
Section 7.04 shall affect the Holders of Certificates in the manner set forth in
Section 11.01(b)(i) or (ii). Upon any such waiver of a default or Event of
Default by the Holders representing the requisite percentage of Voting Rights
affected by such default or Event of Default, such default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose
hereunder. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or
Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

Section 8.01.  Duties of Trustee.

(a) _____ The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after
the curing or waiver of all Events of Default which may have occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not
been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in
their exercise as a prudent investor would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of such investor's own affairs.

(b) _____ The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform to the requirements of this Agreement. The Trustee shall notify the
Certificateholders of any such documents which do not materially conform to the
requirements of this Agreement in the event that the Trustee, after so
requesting, does not receive satisfactorily corrected documents.

        The Trustee shall forward or cause to be forwarded in a timely fashion
the notices, reports and statements required to be forwarded by the Trustee
pursuant to Sections 4.03, 7.03 and 10.01. The Trustee shall furnish in a timely
fashion to the Servicer such information as the Servicer may reasonably request
from time to time for the Servicer to fulfill its duties as set forth in this
Agreement. The Trustee covenants and agrees that it shall perform its
obligations hereunder in a manner so as to maintain the status of any portion of
the applicable REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions and (subject to
Section 10.01(f)) to prevent the imposition of any federal, state or local
income, prohibited transaction, contribution or other tax on the Trust Fund to
the extent that maintaining such status and avoiding such taxes are reasonably
within the control of the Trustee and are reasonably within the scope of its
duties under this Agreement.

                                       98
<PAGE>

(c)  _____ No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be  construed to relieve the
     Trustee from  liability  for its own  negligent  action,  its own negligent
     failure to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, however, that:

(i)  Prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  and after the curing or
     waiver of all such Events of Default  which may have  occurred,  the duties
     and  obligations  of the Trustee shall be determined  solely by the express
     provisions  of this  Agreement,  the Trustee shall not be liable except for
     the  performance  of such duties and  obligations as are  specifically  set
     forth in this Agreement,  no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
     into this Agreement against the Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on
     the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
     of the statements and the  correctness of the opinions  expressed  therein,
     upon any  certificates or opinions  furnished to the Trustee by the Company
     or the Servicer and which on their face, do not contradict the requirements
     of this Agreement;

(ii)           ____ The Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error of
               judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or
               Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved
               that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
               facts;

(iii)          The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any
               action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
               in accordance with the direction of Certificateholders of any
               Class holding Certificates which evidence, as to such Class,
               Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25% as to the
               time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
               remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
               conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement;

(iv)           ____ The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any
               default (other than a default in payment to the Trustee)
               specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 or an Event of
               Default under clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 7.01 unless
               a Responsible Officer of the Trustee assigned to and working in
               the Corporate Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such
               failure or event or the Trustee receives written notice of such
               failure or event at its Corporate Trust Office from the Servicer,
               the Company or any Certificateholder; and

(v)  Except to the  extent  provided  in  Section  7.02,  no  provision  in this
     Agreement  shall  require  the  Trustee  to  expend  or risk its own  funds
     (including,  without  limitation,  the making of any  Advance) or otherwise
     incur any personal  financial  liability in the  performance  of any of its
     duties as Trustee  hereunder,  or in the  exercise  of any of its rights or
     powers,  if the Trustee shall have  reasonable  grounds for believing  that
     repayment of funds or adequate  indemnity against such risk or liability is
     not reasonably assured to it.

     (d) _____ The Trustee shall timely pay,  from its own funds,  the amount of
any and all  federal,  state and local  taxes  imposed  on the Trust Fund or its
assets  or  transactions   including,   without   limitation,   (A)  "prohibited


                                       99
<PAGE>

transaction"  penalty taxes as defined in Section 860F of the Code, if, when and
as the same shall be due and payable,  (B) any tax on  contributions  to a REMIC
after the Closing Date imposed by Section 860G(d) of the Code and (C) any tax on
"net  income from  foreclosure  property"  as defined in Section  860G(c) of the
Code,  but only if such  taxes  arise  out of a  breach  by the  Trustee  of its
obligations hereunder, which breach constitutes negligence or willful misconduct
of the Trustee.

Section 8.02.  Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

(a)            _____ Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

(i)  _____ The Trustee may rely and shall be protected  in acting or  refraining
     from acting upon any  resolution,  Officer's  Certificate,  certificate  of
     Servicing  Officer,  certificate  of  auditors  or any  other  certificate,
     statement,  instrument,  opinion, report, notice, request,  consent, order,
     appraisal, bond or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and
     to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

(ii) ____ The Trustee may consult  with  counsel and the written  advice of such
     counsel and any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization
     and  protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it
     hereunder  in good faith and in  accordance  with such advice or Opinion of
     Counsel;

(iii)The Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of the trusts or
     powers vested in it by this  Agreement or to  institute,  conduct or defend
     any  litigation  hereunder or in relation  hereto at the request,  order or
     direction of any of the  Certificateholders,  pursuant to the provisions of
     this Agreement,  unless such  Certificateholders  shall have offered to the
     Trustee  reasonable  security or indemnity against the costs,  expenses and
     liabilities  which may be incurred  therein or thereby;  nothing  contained
     herein  shall,  however,  relieve the Trustee of the  obligation,  upon the
     occurrence of an Event of Default (which has not been cured or waived),  to
     exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement,  and
     to use the same  degree  of care and skill in their  exercise  as a prudent
     investor  would exercise or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of
     such investor's own affairs;

(iv) ____ The  Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable for any  action  taken,
     suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized
     or within  the  discretion  or rights or powers  conferred  upon it by this
     Agreement;

(v)  Prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  hereunder  and after the
     curing or waiver of all  Events of  Default  which may have  occurred,  the
     Trustee  shall  not be bound to make any  investigation  into the  facts or
     matters  stated  in any  resolution,  certificate,  statement,  instrument,
     opinion,  report, notice, request,  consent, order, approval, bond or other
     paper or  document,  unless  requested  in  writing  so to do by Holders of
     Certificates  of  any  Class  evidencing,  as  to  such  Class,  Percentage
     Interests,  aggregating not less than 50%; provided,  however,  that if the
     payment within a reasonable  time to the Trustee of the costs,  expenses or


                                      100
<PAGE>

     liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation
     is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by
     the security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee may
     require  reasonable  indemnity  against  such  expense  or  liability  as a
     condition  to  so  proceeding.   The  reasonable   expense  of  every  such

               been furnished with an Opinion of Counsel, which shall not be a
               cost of the Trustee or the Trust Fund, to the effect that such
               contribution will not (i) cause any portion of the applicable
               REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any
               Certificates are outstanding or (ii) cause the Trust Fund to be
               subject to any federal tax as a result of such contribution
               (including the imposition of any federal tax on "prohibited

as the case may be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their

trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall
be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If
no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment
within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning
Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor trustee.

perform in any material respect any of its covenants, agreements or obligations
hereunder, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 5 days (in
respect of clause (i) above) or 30 days (in respect of clause (ii) above) after
the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring that the same be
remedied, shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company, then the Company
may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument
delivered as provided in the preceding sentence. In connection with the
appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Company shall, on or before the date on which any such appointment becomes

the ratings on any class of the Certificates below the lesser of the then
current or original ratings on such Certificates.

shall be delivered to the Company, one complete set to the Trustee so removed
and one complete set to the successor so appointed.

corporation or national banking association resulting from any merger,

purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located, the

and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the
Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Trustee, or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and

                                      104
<PAGE>

Fund, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Servicer and
the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Servicer shall not have
joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request
so to do, or in case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee
or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility

pursuant to this Section 8.10 all rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and
exercised or performed by the Trustee, and such separate trustee or co-trustee
jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which
any particular act or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or
as successor to the Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers,
duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any
portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

(c) _____ Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately,

Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or

Affiliates of the Company, the Servicer or the Sellers to hold all or a portion
of the Mortgage Notes as agent for the Trustee, by entering into a Custodial
Agreement; provided, however, that the Trustee may appoint a Custodian that is
an Affiliate of the Company, the Servicer or the Sellers if the Trustee receives
written confirmation from each Rating Agency that such appointment will not


                                      105
<PAGE>

reduce the rating assigned to any Class of Certificates by such Rating Agency
below the lower of the then-current rating or the rating assigned to such
Certificates as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency. Subject to Article
VIII, the Trustee agrees to comply with the terms of each Custodial Agreement
and to enforce the terms and provisions thereof against the Custodian for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. Each Custodian shall be a depository
institution subject to supervision by federal or state authority and shall be
qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which it holds any Mortgage
File. Each Custodian (other than the Custodian appointed as of the Closing Date)
shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $10,000,000. Each
Custodial Agreement may be amended only as provided in Section 11.01. The

     Mortgage Loans.

(a)            _____ Subject to Section 9.02, the respective obligations and
               responsibilities of the Company, the Servicer and the Trustee
               created hereby in respect of the Certificates (other than the
               obligation of the Trustee to make certain payments after the
               Final Distribution Date to Certificateholders and the obligation
               of the Company to send certain notices as hereinafter set forth)
               shall terminate upon the last action required to be taken by the
               Trustee on the Final Distribution Date pursuant to this Article
               IX following the earlier of:

(i)  _____ the later of the final payment or other  liquidation  (or any Advance
     with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in the Trust Fund
     or the  disposition  of all property  acquired upon  foreclosure or deed in
     lieu of foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, or

(ii) the  purchase  by the  Servicer  of all  Mortgage  Loans  and all  property
     acquired in respect of any Mortgage  Loan  remaining in the Trust Fund at a
     price equal to 100% of the unpaid  principal  balance of each Mortgage Loan
     or,  the fair  market  value of the  related  underlying  property  of such
     Mortgage  Loan with  respect to  Mortgage  Loans as to which title has been
     acquired  if such fair  market  value is less than  such  unpaid  principal
     balance (net of any unreimbursed Advances attributable to principal) on the


                                      106
<PAGE>

     day of repurchase  plus accrued  interest  thereon at the Net Mortgage Rate
     (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of any Modified  Mortgage  Loan)
     to, but not including,  the first day of the month in which such repurchase
     price is distributed,  provided,  however, that in no event shall the trust
     created hereby continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of
     the last  survivor  of the  descendants  of  Joseph  P.  Kennedy,  the late
     ambassador of the United  States to the Court of St.  James,  living on the
     date hereof and provided  further  that the purchase  price set forth above
     shall be increased as is necessary, as determined by the Servicer, to avoid
     disqualification of any portion of either REMIC as a REMIC.

        The right of the Servicer to purchase all the assets of the Trust Fund
pursuant to clause (ii) above is conditioned upon the Pool Stated Principal
Balance as of the Final Distribution Date, prior to giving effect to
distributions to be made on such Distribution Date, being less than ten percent
of the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans. If such right is
exercised by the Servicer, the Servicer shall be deemed to have been reimbursed
for the full amount of any unreimbursed Advances theretofore made by it with
respect to the Mortgage Loans. In addition, the Servicer, shall provide to the
Trustee and the Custodian a Request for Release substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F and the Trustee and any Custodian shall, promptly
following payment of the purchase price, release to the Servicer, as applicable,
the Mortgage Files pertaining to the Mortgage Loans being purchased.

(b)            _____ The Servicer shall give the Trustee not less than 60 days'
               prior notice of the Distribution Date on which the Servicer
               anticipates that the final distribution will be made to
               Certificateholders (whether as a result of the exercise by the
               Servicer of its right to purchase the assets of the Trust Fund or
               otherwise). Notice of any termination, specifying the anticipated
               Final Distribution Date (which shall be a date that would
               otherwise be a Distribution Date) upon which the
               Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates to the
               Trustee (if so required by the terms hereof) for payment of the
               final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by
               the Servicer (if it is exercising its right to purchase the
               assets of the Trust Fund), or by the Trustee (in any other case)
               by letter to the Certificateholders mailed not earlier than the
               15th day and not later than the 25th day of the month next
               preceding the month of such final distribution specifying:

(i)            _____ the anticipated Final Distribution Date upon which final
               payment of the Certificates is anticipated to be made upon
               presentation and surrender of Certificates at the office or
               agency of the Trustee therein designated,

(ii)           ____ the amount of any such final payment, if known, and

(iii)          that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution
               Date is not applicable, and in the case of the Senior
               Certificates and Class M Certificates, that payment shall be made
               only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the
               office or agency of the Trustee therein specified.

If the Servicer is obligated to give notice to Certificateholders as aforesaid,
it shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at the time such notice


                                      107
<PAGE>

is given to Certificateholders. In the event such notice is given by the
Servicer, the Servicer shall deposit in the Payment Account before the Final
Distribution Date in immediately available funds an amount equal to the purchase
price for the assets of the Trust Fund computed as above provided.

(c) _____ In the case of the Senior, Class M or Class B Certificates, upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates by the Certificateholders
thereof, the Trustee shall distribute to the Certificateholders (i) the amount
otherwise distributable on such Distribution Date, if not in connection with the
Servicer's election to repurchase, or (ii) if the Servicer elected to so
repurchase, an amount determined as follows: (A) with respect to each
Certificate the outstanding Certificate Principal Balance thereof, plus Accrued
Certificate Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period thereon and any
previously unpaid Accrued Certificate Interest, subject to the priority set
forth in Section 4.02(a), and (B) with respect to the Class R Certificates, any
excess of the amounts available for distribution (including the repurchase price
specified in clause (ii) of subsection (a) of this Section) over the total
amount distributed under the immediately preceding clause (A).

(d) _____ If any Certificateholders shall not surrender their Certificates for
final payment and cancellation on or before the Final Distribution Date (if so
required by the terms hereof), the Trustee shall on such date cause all funds in
the Payment Account not distributed in final distribution to Certificateholders
to be withdrawn therefrom and credited to the remaining Certificateholders by
depositing such funds in a separate escrow account for the benefit of such
Certificateholders, and the Servicer (if it exercised its right to purchase the
assets of the Trust Fund), or the Trustee (in any other case) shall give a
second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect
thereto. If within six months after the second notice any Certificate shall not
have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee shall take appropriate steps
as directed by the Servicer to contact the remaining Certificateholders
concerning surrender of their Certificates. The costs and expenses of
maintaining the escrow account and of contacting Certificateholders shall be
paid out of the assets which remain in the escrow account. If within nine months
after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Trustee shall pay to the Servicer all amounts distributable to
the holders thereof and the Servicer shall thereafter hold such amounts until
distributed to such holders. No interest shall accrue or be payable to any
Certificateholder on any amount held in the escrow account or by the Servicer as
a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for
final payment thereof in accordance with this Section 9.01.

(e) _____ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and the reduction of
its Certificate Principal Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, to zero,
each Class of Certificates shall be deemed to remain outstanding until the Final
Distribution Date and the Certificateholder(s) of each Class of Certificates on
the day the Certificate Principal Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, of
such Class is reduced to zero shall be deemed to be the Certificateholder(s) of
such Class until the Final Distribution Date.

Section 9.02.  Additional Termination Requirements.

(a)            _____ Each REMIC that comprises the Trust Fund shall be
               terminated in accordance with the following additional


                                      108
<PAGE>

               requirements, unless (subject to Section 10.01(f)) the Trustee
               and the Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel (which
               Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee) to the
               effect that the failure of either REMIC to comply with the
               requirements of this Section 9.02 will not (i) result in the
               imposition on the Trust Fund of taxes on "prohibited
               transactions," as described in Section 860F of the Code, or (ii)
               cause either REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that
               any Certificate is outstanding:

(i)            _____ The Servicer shall establish a 90-day liquidation period
               for such REMIC and specify the first day of such period in a
               statement attached to the Trust Fund's final Tax Return pursuant
               to Treasury regulations Section 1.860F-1. The Servicer also shall

(a) _____ The REMIC Administrator shall make an election to treat the Trust Fund

made on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return
(including Form 8811) or any appropriate state return for the taxable year
ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the Certificates are
issued. For the purposes of the REMIC elections in respect of the Trust Fund,
Certificates and interests to be designated as the "regular interests" and the
sole class of "residual interests" in each REMIC shall be set forth in Section

(c) _____ GMACM shall hold a Class R Certificate representing a 0.02% Percentage
Interest in each Class of the Class R Certificates and shall be designated as
"the tax matters person" with respect to each REMIC in the manner provided under
Treasury regulations section 1.860F-4(d) and Treasury regulations section
301.6231(a)(7)-1. The REMIC Administrator, as tax matters person, shall (i) act
on behalf of each REMIC in relation to any tax matter or controversy involving
the Trust Fund and (ii) represent the Trust Fund in any administrative or
judicial proceeding relating to an examination or audit by any governmental
taxing authority with respect thereto. The legal expenses, including without
limitation attorneys' or accountants' fees, and costs of any such proceeding and
any liability resulting therefrom shall be expenses of the Trust Fund and the
REMIC Administrator shall be entitled to reimbursement therefor out of amounts
attributable to the Mortgage Loans on deposit in the Custodial Account as
provided by Section 3.10 unless such legal expenses and costs are incurred by
reason of the REMIC Administrator's willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence.

(d) _____ The REMIC Administrator shall prepare or cause to be prepared all of
the Tax Returns that it determines are required with respect to each REMIC
created hereunder and deliver such Tax Returns in a timely manner to the Trustee
and the Trustee shall sign and file such Tax Returns in a timely manner. The
expenses of preparing such returns shall be borne by the REMIC Administrator
without any right of reimbursement therefor. The REMIC Administrator agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee with respect to any tax or liability
arising from the Trustee's signing of Tax Returns that contain errors or
omissions. The Trustee and Servicer shall promptly provide the REMIC
Administrator with such information as the REMIC Administrator may from time to
time request for the purpose of enabling the REMIC Administrator to prepare Tax
Returns.

(e) _____ The REMIC Administrator shall provide (i) to any Transferor of a Class
R Certificate such information as is necessary for the application of any tax
relating to the transfer of a Class R Certificate to any Person who is not a
Permitted Transferee, (ii) to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall forward to the
Certificateholders, such information or reports as are required by the Code or
the REMIC Provisions including reports relating to interest, original issue
discount and market discount or premium (using the Prepayment Assumption) and
(iii) to the Internal Revenue Service the name, title, address and telephone
number of the person who will serve as the representative of each REMIC.

(f) _____ The Servicer and the REMIC Administrator shall take such actions and
shall cause each REMIC created hereunder to take such actions as are reasonably
within the Servicer's or the REMIC Administrator's control and the scope of its
duties more specifically set forth herein as shall be necessary or desirable to
maintain the status of each REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions (and the
Trustee shall assist the Servicer and the REMIC Administrator, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Servicer and the REMIC Administrator to do so). The
Servicer and the REMIC Administrator shall not knowingly or intentionally take
any action, cause the Trust Fund to take any action or fail to take (or fail to
cause to be taken) any action reasonably within their respective control that,
under the REMIC Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i)
endanger the status of any portion of either REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in
the imposition of a tax upon either REMIC (including but not limited to the tax
on prohibited transactions as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the
tax on contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code)


                                      110
<PAGE>

(either such event, in the absence of an Opinion of Counsel or the
indemnification referred to in this sentence, an "Adverse REMIC Event") unless
the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as applicable, has received an Opinion
of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action or, if such
party fails to pay such expense, and the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as
applicable, determines that taking such action is in the best interest of the
Trust Fund and the Certificateholders, at the expense of the Trust Fund, but in
no event at the expense of the Servicer, the REMIC Administrator or the Trustee)
to the effect that the contemplated action will not, with respect to each REMIC
created hereunder, endanger such status or, unless the Servicer, the REMIC
Administrator or both, as applicable, determine in its or their sole discretion
to indemnify the Trust Fund against the imposition of such a tax, result in the
imposition of such a tax. Wherever in this Agreement a contemplated action may
not be taken because the timing of such action might result in the imposition of
a tax on the Trust Fund, or may only be taken pursuant to an Opinion of Counsel
that such action would not impose a tax on the Trust Fund, such action may
nonetheless be taken provided that the indemnity given in the preceding sentence
with respect to any taxes that might be imposed on the Trust Fund has been given
and that all other preconditions to the taking of such action have been
satisfied. The Trustee shall not take or fail to take any action (whether or not
authorized hereunder) as to which the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as
applicable, has advised it in writing that it has received an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur with respect to such
action. In addition, prior to taking any action with respect to either REMIC
created hereunder or any related assets thereof, or causing either REMIC to take
any action, which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement,
the Trustee shall consult with the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as
applicable, or its designee, in writing, with respect to whether such action
could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to either REMIC, and
the Trustee shall not take any such action or cause either REMIC to take any
such action as to which the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as applicable,
has advised it in writing that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur. The Servicer
or the REMIC Administrator, as applicable, may consult with counsel to make such
written advice, and the cost of same shall be borne by the party seeking to take
the action not expressly permitted by this Agreement, but in no event at the
expense of the Servicer or the REMIC Administrator. At all times as may be
required by the Code, the Servicer shall to the extent within its control and
the scope of its duties more specifically set forth herein, maintain
substantially all of the assets of each REMIC created hereunder as "qualified
mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code and "permitted
investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.

(g) _____ In the event that any tax is imposed on "prohibited transactions" of
either REMIC created hereunder as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code, on
"net income from foreclosure property" of either REMIC as defined in Section
860G(c) of the Code, on any contributions to either REMIC after the Startup Day
therefor pursuant to Section 860G(d) of the Code, or any other tax is imposed by
the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws, such tax shall
be charged (i) to the Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a
breach by the Servicer of any of its obligations under this Agreement or the
Servicer has in its sole discretion determined to indemnify the Trust Fund
against such tax, (ii) to the Trustee, if such tax arises out of or results from
a breach by the Trustee of any of its obligations under this Article X, or (iii)
otherwise against amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account as provided by
Section 3.10 and on the Distribution Date(s) following such reimbursement the


                                      111
<PAGE>

aggregate of such taxes shall be allocated in reduction of the Accrued
Certificate Interest on each Class entitled thereto in the same manner as if
such taxes constituted a Prepayment Interest Shortfall.

(h) _____ The Trustee and the Servicer shall, for federal income tax purposes,
maintain books and records with respect to each REMIC created hereunder on a
calendar year and on an accrual basis or as otherwise may be required by the
REMIC Provisions.

(i) _____ Following the Startup Day, neither the Servicer nor the Trustee shall
accept any contributions of assets to either REMIC created hereunder unless
(subject to Section 10.01(f)) the Servicer and the Trustee shall have received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to make such
contribution) to the effect that the inclusion of such assets in such REMIC will
not cause either REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any
Certificates are outstanding or subject either REMIC to any tax under the REMIC
Provisions or other applicable provisions of federal, state and local law or
ordinances.

(j) _____ Neither the Servicer nor the Trustee shall (subject to Section
10.01(f)) enter into any arrangement by which either REMIC created hereunder
will receive a fee or other compensation for services nor permit either REMIC to
receive any income from assets other than "qualified mortgages" as defined in
Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code or "permitted investments" as defined in Section
860G(a)(5) of the Code.

(k) _____ Solely for the purposes of Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii) of the Treasury
Regulations, the "latest possible maturity date" for each REMIC II Regular
Interest shall be its Maturity Date, and the "latest possible maturity date" for
each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be its latest possible maturity date as set
forth in the preliminary statement.

(l) _____ Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the REMIC Administrator shall
prepare and file with the Internal Revenue Service Form 8811, "Information
Return for Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and Issuers of
Collateralized Debt Obligations" for each REMIC created hereunder.

(m) _____ Neither the Trustee nor the Servicer shall sell, dispose of or
substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans (except in connection with (i) the
default, imminent default or foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, including but not
limited to, the acquisition or sale of a Mortgaged Property acquired by deed in
lieu of foreclosure, (ii) the bankruptcy of either REMIC created hereunder,
(iii) the termination of the applicable REMIC pursuant to Article IX of this
Agreement or (iv) a purchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant to Article II or III of
this Agreement) nor acquire any assets for either REMIC, nor sell or dispose of
any investments in the Custodial Account or the Payment Account for gain nor
accept any contributions to either REMIC after the Closing Date unless it has
received an Opinion of Counsel that such sale, disposition, substitution or
acquisition will not (a) affect adversely the status of either REMIC as a REMIC
or (b) unless the Servicer has determined in its sole discretion to indemnify
the Trust Fund against such tax, cause either REMIC to be subject to a tax on
"prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

(n) _____ The Trustee shall apply for an employer identification number from the
Internal Revenue Service on a Form SS-4 or any other acceptable method for all
tax entities.

respect to compliance with the REMIC Provisions, including without limitation,
any penalties arising from the Trustee's execution of Tax Returns prepared by
the REMIC Administrator that contain errors or omissions; provided, however,
that such liability shall not be imposed to the extent such breach is a result
of an error or omission in information provided to the REMIC Administrator by
the Servicer in which case Section 10.02(c) shall apply.

(c) _____ The Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trust Fund, the Company, the
REMIC Administrator and the Trustee for any taxes and costs (including, without
limitation, any reasonable attorneys' fees) imposed on or incurred by the Trust
Fund, the Company, the REMIC Administrator or the Trustee, as a result of a
breach of the Servicer's covenants set forth in this Article X or in Article III

limitation, any penalties arising from the Trustee's execution of Tax Returns
prepared by the Servicer that contain errors or omissions.

resecuritizing any of the Certificates issued hereunder, under the following
circumstances. With respect to any Class or Classes of Certificates issued
hereunder, or any portion of any such Class, as to which the Company or any of
its Affiliates (or any designee thereof) is the registered Holder (the
"Resecuritized Certificates"), the Company may deposit such Resecuritized
Certificates into a new REMIC, grantor trust, FASIT or custodial arrangement (a
"Restructuring Vehicle") to be held by the Trustee pursuant to a Supplemental
Article. The instrument adopting such Supplemental Article shall be executed by
the Company, the Servicer and the Trustee; provided, that neither the Servicer

connection with each Supplemental Article, the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (i) the Restructuring Vehicle
will qualify as a REMIC, grantor trust, FASIT or other entity not subject to
taxation for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the adoption of the
Supplemental Article will not endanger the status of either REMIC created
hereunder as a REMIC or (subject to Section 10.01(f)) result in the imposition
of a tax upon the Trust Fund or either REMIC created hereunder (including but
not limited to the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in Section
860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on contributions to a REMIC as set forth in
Section 860G(d) of the Code).

               evidencing a percentage  interest in the distributions  allocable
               to the  Class  IO  Certificates  with  respect  to a  Trust  Fund
               consisting  primarily  of a pool  of one-  to  four-family  fixed
               interest rate first mortgage loans formed and sold by RESIDENTIAL
               ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC.

               This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust
Fund, and does not represent an obligation of or interest in  Residential  Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee referred
to below or GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this
Certificate  nor the underlying  Mortgage Loans are guaranteed or insured by any

Products,  Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee or GMAC Mortgage

includes any successor entity under the Agreement  referred to below). The Trust
Fund  was  created  pursuant  to a  Pooling  and  Servicing  Agreement  dated as
specified above (the "Agreement") among the Company,  the Servicer and Bank One,
National  Association,  as trustee (the "Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the
pertinent provisions of which is set forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined

                                 SERIES 2003-J1

               evidencing a percentage  interest in the distributions  allocable
               to the  Class  PO  Certificates  with  respect  to a  Trust  Fund
               consisting  primarily  of a pool  of one-  to  four-family  fixed
               interest rate first mortgage loans formed and sold by RESIDENTIAL
               ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC.

               This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust
Fund, and does not represent an obligation of or interest in  Residential  Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee referred
to below or GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this
Certificate  nor the underlying  Mortgage Loans are guaranteed or insured by any
governmental   agency  or  instrumentality  or  by  Residential  Asset  Mortgage
Products,  Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee or GMAC Mortgage
Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  None of the  Company,  the  Servicer,
Witmer Funding LLC, GMAC Mortgage  Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates will
have any obligation with respect to any certificate or other obligation  secured
by or payable from payments on the Certificates.

               This certifies  that GMAC MORTGAGE  CORPORATION is the registered
owner of the  Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  (obtained by
dividing the Initial Certificate Principal Balance of all Class PO Certificates,
both as specified above) in certain distributions with respect to the Trust Fund
consisting  primarily  of an  interest  in a pool of one- to  four-family  fixed
interest rate first mortgage loans (the  "Mortgage  Loans"),  formed and sold by
Residential Asset Mortgage  Products,  Inc.  (hereinafter  called the "Company,"
which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement referred to below).
The Trust Fund was created  pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing  Agreement dated
as specified above (the  "Agreement")  among the Company,  the Servicer and Bank
One, National Association,  as trustee (the "Trustee"),  a summary of certain of
the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the extent not
defined herein,  the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in
the  Agreement.  This  Certificate  is issued under and is subject to the terms,
provisions  and conditions of the  Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of
this  Certificate by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount of principal
required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of  Class  PO  Certificates  on  such
Distribution Date.

               Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either  by the
Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the Trustee in immediately  available
funds (by wire  transfer or  otherwise)  for the account of the Person  entitled
thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Trustee or such Paying  Agent,


                                       3

or by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled  thereto,  as such name
and address shall appear on the Certificate Register.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or
agency  appointed  by the  Trustee  for that  purpose  in the  City of  Chicago,
Illinois.  The Initial Certificate  Principal Balance of this Certificate is set
forth above.  The  Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof will be reduced to the
extent of distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable
hereto.

               As  described  above,  in  connection  with any  transfer of this
Certificate the Transferee will be deemed to have made representations  relating
to the permissibility of such transfer under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
as described in Section  5.02(e) of the  Agreement.  In addition,  any purported
Certificate  Owner whose acquisition or holding of this Certificate (or interest
herein) was effected in violation of the  restrictions in Section 5.02(e) of the
Agreement  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Company,  the Trustee,  the
Servicer,  any  Subservicer,  and the Trust  Fund from and  against  any and all
liabilities,  claims,  costs or expenses incurred by such parties as a result of
such acquisition or holding.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates issued in several Classes designated as GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement.  In the event Servicer funds
are advanced with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is reimbursable to
the Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related recoveries
on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account and/or the Payment Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders
may be  made  by the  Servicer  from  time  to  time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement to the Servicer of advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by
it.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company,  the Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company, the Servicer
and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of  Certificates  evidencing  in
the  aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of each Class of
Certificates   affected  thereby.  Any  such  consent  by  the  Holder  of  this
Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all future
holders of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued upon the  transfer
hereof or in exchange  herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment
thereof in certain  circumstances  without  the consent of the Holders of any of


                                       4
<PAGE>

the Certificates and, in certain additional  circumstances,  without the consent
of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the  offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City of
Chicago, Illinois, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar  and any  agent of the  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Servicer,  the  Trustee  nor any such agent  shall be  affected by notice to the
contrary.

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Servicer from the
Trust Fund of all remaining  Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect
of such Mortgage Loans,  thereby effecting early retirement of the Certificates.
The Agreement permits,  but does not require,  the Servicer to (i) purchase at a
price  determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining  Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii) purchase in whole,
but not in part, all of the  Certificates  from the Holders  thereof;  provided,
that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated Principal  Balance
of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution Date upon which the proceeds of any
such  purchase  are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the  Cut-off  Date
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

                                 SERIES 2003-J1

               evidencing a percentage  interest in any distributions  allocable
               to the Class M-  Certificates  with  respect  to the  Trust  Fund
               consisting  primarily  of a pool  of one-  to  four-family  fixed
               interest rate first mortgage loans formed and sold by RESIDENTIAL
               ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC.

               This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust
Fund, and does not represent an obligation of or interest in  Residential  Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee referred
to below or GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this
Certificate  nor the underlying  Mortgage Loans are guaranteed or insured by any
governmental   agency  or  instrumentality  or  by  Residential  Asset  Mortgage

Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  None of the  Company,  the  Servicer,
Witmer Funding LLC, GMAC Mortgage  Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates will

by or payable from payments on the Certificates.

               This  certifies  that CEDE & CO. is the  registered  owner of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained by dividing the
Certificate  Principal Balance of this Certificate by the aggregate  Certificate
Principal Balance of all Class M- ______ Certificates,  both as specified above)
in certain  distributions with respect to a Trust Fund consisting primarily of a
pool of one- to  four-family  fixed  interest  rate  first  mortgage  loans (the
"Mortgage Loans"),  formed and sold by Residential Asset Mortgage Products, Inc.
(hereinafter  called the  "Company,"  which term includes any  successor  entity
under the Agreement referred to below). The Trust Fund was created pursuant to a
Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as specified above (the "Agreement") among
the Company,  the Servicer and Bank One, National  Association,  as trustee (the
"Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set
forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used
herein have the meanings  assigned in the Agreement.  This Certificate is issued
under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and conditions of the Agreement,
to which  Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the acceptance
hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount of interest and
principal,  if any  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of Class M- _____
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

               Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either  by the
Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the Trustee in immediately  available
funds (by wire  transfer or  otherwise)  for the account of the Person  entitled


                                       3
<PAGE>

thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Trustee or such Paying  Agent,
or by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled  thereto,  as such name
and address shall appear on the Certificate Register.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or
agency  appointed  by the  Trustee  for that  purpose  in the  City of  Chicago,
Illinois.  The Initial Certificate  Principal Balance of this Certificate is set
forth above.  The  Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof will be reduced to the
extent of the  distributions  allocable  to principal  and any  Realized  Losses
allocable hereto.

               As  described  above,  in  connection  with any  transfer of this
Certificate the Transferee will be deemed to have made representations  relating
to the permissibility of such transfer under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
as described in Section  5.02(e) of the  Agreement.  In addition,  any purported
Certificate  Owner whose acquisition or holding of this Certificate (or interest
herein) was effected in violation of the  restrictions in Section 5.02(e) of the
Agreement  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Company,  the Trustee,  the
Servicer,  any  Subservicer,  and the Trust  Fund from and  against  any and all
liabilities,  claims,  costs or expenses incurred by such parties as a result of
such acquisition or holding.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates issued in several Classes designated as GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement.  In the event Servicer funds
are advanced with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is reimbursable to
the Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related recoveries
on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account and/or the Payment Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders
may be  made  by the  Servicer  from  time  to  time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement to the Servicer of advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by
it.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company,  the Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company, the Servicer
and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of  Certificates  evidencing  in
the  aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of each Class of
Certificates   affected  thereby.  Any  such  consent  by  the  Holder  of  this
Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all future
holders of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued upon the  transfer
hereof or in exchange  herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment


                                       4
<PAGE>

thereof in certain  circumstances  without  the consent of the Holders of any of
the Certificates and, in certain additional  circumstances,  without the consent
of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the  offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City of
Chicago, Illinois, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar  and any  agent of the  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Servicer,  the  Trustee  nor any such agent  shall be  affected by notice to the
contrary.

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Servicer from the
Trust Fund of all remaining  Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect
of such Mortgage Loans,  thereby effecting early retirement of the Certificates.
The Agreement permits,  but does not require,  the Servicer to (i) purchase at a
price  determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining  Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii) purchase in whole,
but not in part, all of the  Certificates  from the Holders  thereof;  provided,
that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated Principal  Balance
of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution Date upon which the proceeds of any
such  purchase  are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the  Cut-off  Date
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

institutional  buyers"  as defined  under  Rule 144A,  and (B) is aware that the
proposed   transferor  intends  to  rely  on  the  exemption  from  registration
requirements  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  provided by Rule
144A. The Holder hereof desiring to effect such transfer shall,  and does hereby
agree to, indemnify the Trustee,  the Company,  the Servicer and the Certificate
Registrar  acting on behalf of the Trustee against any liability that may result
if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance  with such Federal
and state laws.  In  connection  with any such  transfer,  the Trustee will also
require either (i) an opinion of counsel acceptable to and in form and substance
satisfactory  to the Trustee,  the Company and the Servicer  with respect to the
permissibility  of such transfer under the Employee  Retirement  Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the "Code") and stating, among other things, that the transferee's  acquisition
of a  Class  B  Certificate  will  not  constitute  or  result  in a  non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or


                                       3

(ii) a representation letter, in the form as described by the Agreement,  either
stating that the transferee is not an employee  benefit or other plan subject to
the  prohibited  transaction  provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a
"Plan"), or any other person (including an investment manager, a named fiduciary
or a trustee  of any  Plan)  acting,  directly  or  indirectly,  on behalf of or
purchasing any  Certificate  with "plan assets" of any Plan, or stating that the
transferee  is an  insurance  company,  the  source of funds to be used by it to
purchase the Certificate (or interest therein) is an "insurance  company general
account" (within the meaning of Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption  ("PTCE")  95-60),  and  conditions set forth in Sections I and III of
PTCE 95-60 have been satisfied.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates issued in several Classes designated as GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement.  In the event Servicer funds
are advanced with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is reimbursable to
the Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related recoveries
on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account and/or the Payment Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders
may be  made  by the  Servicer  from  time  to  time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement to the Servicer of advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by
it.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company,  the Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company, the Servicer
and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of  Certificates  evidencing  in
the  aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of each Class of
Certificates   affected  thereby.  Any  such  consent  by  the  Holder  of  this
Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all future
holders of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued upon the  transfer
hereof or in exchange  herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment
thereof in certain  circumstances  without  the consent of the Holders of any of
the Certificates and, in certain additional  circumstances,  without the consent
of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the  offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City of
Chicago, Illinois, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new


                                       4
<PAGE>

Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

               The  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  and the  Certificate
Registrar  and any  agent of the  Company,  the  Servicer,  the  Trustee  or the
Certificate  Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Servicer,  the  Trustee  nor any such agent  shall be  affected by notice to the
contrary.

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Servicer from the
Trust Fund of all remaining  Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect
of such Mortgage Loans,  thereby effecting early retirement of the Certificates.
The Agreement permits,  but does not require,  the Servicer to (i) purchase at a
price  determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining  Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii) purchase in whole,
but not in part, all of the  Certificates  from the Holders  thereof;  provided,
that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated Principal  Balance
of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution Date upon which the proceeds of any
such  purchase  are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the  Cut-off  Date
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

               Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

                                 SERIES 2003-J1

               evidencing a percentage  interest in any distributions  allocable
               to the Class R-[ ]  Certificates  with  respect to the Trust Fund
               consisting  primarily  of a pool  of one-  to  four-family  fixed
               interest rate first mortgage loans formed and sold by RESIDENTIAL
               ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC.

               This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust
Fund, and does not represent an obligation of or interest in  Residential  Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc., the Servicer,  Witmer Funding LLC, the Trustee referred
to below or GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc. or any of their  affiliates.  Neither this

Witmer Funding LLC, GMAC Mortgage  Group,  Inc. or any of their  affiliates will

by or payable from payments on the Certificates.

               This  certifies  that  [  ___________________  ]  [GMAC  Mortgage
Corporation]  is the registered  owner of the Percentage  Interest  evidenced by
this Certificate (obtained by dividing the Initial Certificate Principal Balance
of this Certificate by the aggregate  Initial  Certificate  Principal Balance of
all Class R-[ ] Certificates,  both as specified above) in certain distributions
with  respect  to the  Trust  Fund  consisting  primarily  of a pool  of one- to
four-family  fixed interest rate first  mortgage  loans (the "Mortgage  Loans"),
formed and sold by Residential Asset Mortgage Products, Inc. (hereinafter called
the  "Company,"  which term  includes any  successor  entity under the Agreement
referred  to  below).  The Trust  Fund was  created  pursuant  to a Pooling  and
Servicing  Agreement  dated as  specified  above  (the  "Agreement")  among  the
Company,  the  Servicer  and Bank One,  National  Association,  as trustee  (the
"Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set
forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used
herein have the meanings  assigned in the Agreement.  This Certificate is issued
under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and conditions of the Agreement,
to which  Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the acceptance
hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

               Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a  distribution  will be
made on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,
the Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount of interest and
principal,  if  any  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of  Class  R-[ ]
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

               Each Holder of this  Certificate will be deemed to have agreed to
be bound by the  restrictions  set forth in the Agreement to the effect that (i)
each person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate must


                                       3
<PAGE>

be a United States Person and a Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) the transfer of any
Ownership  Interest in this Certificate will be conditioned upon the delivery to
the Trustee of,  among other  things,  an  affidavit  to the effect that it is a
United  States  Person  and  Permitted  Transferee,  (iii) any  transfer  of any
Ownership  Interest in this  Certificate will satisfy either the "asset test" as
set forth in Section  1.860E-1(C)(5) of the Treasury regulations or the "formula
test" as set forth in Section  1.860E-1(C)(7) of the Treasury regulations,  (iv)
any  attempted  or  purported   transfer  of  any  Ownership  Interest  in  this
Certificate in violation of such  restrictions  will be absolutely null and void
and will vest no rights in the purported transferee, and (v) if any person other
than a United  States Person and a Permitted  Transferee  acquires any Ownership
Interest in this Certificate in violation of such restrictions, then the Company
will have the right,  in its sole discretion and without notice to the Holder of
this  Certificate,  to sell this  Certificate  to a  purchaser  selected  by the
Company, which purchaser may be the Company, or any affiliate of the Company, on
such terms and conditions as the Company may choose.

               Notwithstanding   the  above,  the  final  distribution  on  this
Certificate  will be made after due notice of the pendency of such  distribution
and only upon  presentation  and surrender of this  Certificate at the office or
agency  appointed  by the  Trustee  for that  purpose  in the  City of  Chicago,
Illinois.  The Initial Certificate  Principal Balance of this Certificate is set
forth above.  The  Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof will be reduced to the
extent of distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable
hereto.  Notwithstanding  the  reduction of the  Certificate  Principal  Balance
hereof to zero, this Certificate will remain outstanding under the Agreement and
the  Holder  hereof  may  have  additional  obligations  with  respect  to  this
Certificate,   including  tax  liabilities,  and  may  be  entitled  to  certain
additional  distributions hereon, in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Agreement.

               No transfer of this Class R-[ ]  Certificate  will be made unless
the Trustee has received  either (i) an opinion of counsel  acceptable to and in
form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Trustee,  the Company and the Servicer
with  respect  to  the  permissibility  of  such  transfer  under  the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA"),  and Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and stating,  among other things, that
the transferee's acquisition of a Class R-[ ] Certificate will not constitute or
result in a  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction  under  Section 406 of ERISA or
Section  4975 of the  Code  or  (ii) a  representation  letter,  in the  form as
described  by the  Agreement,  stating  that the  transferee  is not an employee
benefit or other plan subject to the prohibited  transaction provisions of ERISA
or  Section  4975 of the Code (a  "Plan"),  or any other  person  (including  an
investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee of any Plan) acting, directly
or indirectly,  on behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with "plan assets" of
any Plan.

               This   Certificate  is  one  of  a  duly   authorized   issue  of
Certificates issued in several Classes designated as GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

               The  Certificates  are  limited  in right of  payment  to certain
collections  and  recoveries   respecting  the  Mortgage  Loans,   all  as  more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement.  In the event Servicer funds
are advanced with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is reimbursable to


                                       4
<PAGE>

the Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related recoveries
on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash that would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

               As  provided in the  Agreement,  withdrawals  from the  Custodial
Account and/or the Payment Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders
may be  made  by the  Servicer  from  time  to  time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement to the Servicer of advances made, or certain expenses incurred, by
it.

               The Agreement permits,  with certain exceptions therein provided,
the  amendment  of  the  Agreement  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company,  the Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Company, the Servicer
and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of  Certificates  evidencing  in
the  aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of each Class of
Certificates   affected  thereby.  Any  such  consent  by  the  Holder  of  this
Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all future
holders of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued upon the  transfer
hereof or in exchange  herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment
thereof in certain  circumstances  without  the consent of the Holders of any of
the Certificates and, in certain additional  circumstances,  without the consent
of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

               As provided in the Agreement  and subject to certain  limitations
therein  set forth,  the  transfer of this  Certificate  is  registrable  in the
Certificate  Register upon surrender of this  Certificate  for  registration  of
transfer  at the  offices or  agencies  appointed  by the Trustee in the City of
Chicago, Illinois, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other  written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in writing,  and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

               The  Certificates  are issuable only as  registered  Certificates
without coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement.  As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations

               No  service  charge  will be made  for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

registered  as the owner hereof for all purposes,  and neither the Company,  the
Servicer,  the  Trustee  nor any such agent  shall be  affected by notice to the
contrary.

               This Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

               The  obligations  created  by the  Agreement  in  respect  of the
Certificates and the Trust Fund created thereby shall terminate upon the payment
to  Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on behalf of the Trustee and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan subject thereto
or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure  of any Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the Servicer from the
Trust Fund of all remaining  Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect
of such Mortgage Loans,  thereby effecting early retirement of the Certificates.
The Agreement permits,  but does not require,  the Servicer to (i) purchase at a
price  determined as provided in the Agreement all remaining  Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan or (ii) purchase in whole,
but not in part, all of the  Certificates  from the Holders  thereof;  provided,
that any such option may only be exercised if the Pool Stated Principal  Balance
of the Mortgage Loans as of the Distribution Date upon which the proceeds of any
such  purchase  are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the  Cut-off  Date
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans.

               Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

                    FORM OF TRANSFER AFFIDAVIT AND AGREEMENT

STATE OF                         )
                                 )    ss.:
COUNTY OF                        )

               [NAME OF OFFICER], being first duly sworn, deposes and says:

1. ______ That he is [Title of Officer] of [Name of Owner] (record or beneficial
owner of the GMACM Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2003-J1, Class R-[
] (the  "Owner")),  a [savings  institution]  [corporation]  duly  organized and
existing under the laws of [the State of  ______________________________________
] [the United States], on behalf of which he makes this affidavit and agreement.

2.  ______  That  the  Owner  (i)  is  not  and  will  not  be  a  "disqualified
organization" as of [date of transfer] within the meaning of Sections 860E(e)(5)
of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code"),  (ii) will
endeavor  to remain  other than a  disqualified  organization  for so long as it
retains its  ownership  interest in the Class R-[ ]  Certificates,  and (iii) is
acquiring the Class R-[ ] Certificates for its own account or for the account of
another  Owner  from  which  it has  received  an  affidavit  and  agreement  in
substantially the same form as this affidavit and agreement.  (For this purpose,
a "disqualified  organization" means an electing large partnership under Section
775 of the Code, the United States, any state or political  subdivision thereof,
any  agency  or   instrumentality  of  any  of  the  foregoing  (other  than  an
instrumentality  all of the  activities of which are subject to tax and,  except
for the Federal  Home Loan  Mortgage  Corporation,  a majority of whose board of
directors  is not  selected  by any such  governmental  entity)  or any  foreign
government,  international organization or any agency or instrumentality of such
foreign government or organization, any rural electric or telephone cooperative,
or any organization (other than certain farmers' cooperatives) that is generally
exempt from federal income tax unless such organization is subject to the tax on
unrelated business taxable income).

3.  ______  That the  Owner is aware  (i) of the tax that  would be  imposed  on
transfers of Class R-[ ] Certificates to disqualified  organizations,  under the
Code, that applies to all transfers of Class R-[ ] Certificates  after March 31,
1988;  (ii)  that such tax  would be on the  transferor  (or,  with  respect  to
transfers to electing large partnerships, on each such partnership), or, if such
transfer  is  through  an agent  (which  person  includes  a broker,  nominee or
middleman) for a disqualified organization,  on the agent; (iii) that the person
(other than with respect to transfers to electing large partnerships)  otherwise
liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability for the tax if the  transferee
furnishes to such person an affidavit  that the transferee is not a disqualified
organization  and,  at the time of  transfer,  such  person does not have actual
knowledge  that  the  affidavit  is  false;  and  (iv)  that  the  Class  R-[  ]
Certificates  may be  "noneconomic  residual  interests"  within the  meaning of
Treasury regulations promulgated pursuant to the Code and that the transferor of
a  noneconomic  residual  interest  will  remain  liable  for any taxes due with
respect to the income on such residual interest,  unless no significant  purpose
of the transfer was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.

                                       1
<PAGE>

4.  ______  That the Owner  understands  that,  as the holder of a  "noneconomic
residual  interest"  the Owner may incur tax  liabilities  in excess of any cash
flows  generated  by the  interest  and  that the  Owner  intends  to pay  taxes
associated with holding the residual interest as they become due.

5. ______ That the owner will not cause income from the Class R-[ ]  Certificate
to be attributable to a foreign  permanent  establishment  or fixed base (within
the meaning of an  applicable  income tax  treaty) of the Owner or another  U.S.
taxpayer.

6. ______ That the Owner is aware of the tax imposed on a "pass-through  entity"
holding  Class  R-[ ]  Certificates  if  either  the  pass-through  entity is an
electing large  partnership  under Section 775 of the Code or at any time during
the taxable year of the pass-through  entity a disqualified  organization is the
record holder of an interest in such entity.  (For this purpose, a "pass through
entity" includes a regulated  investment company, a real estate investment trust
or common trust fund, a partnership, trust or estate, and certain cooperatives.)

7.  ______  The  Owner  is a  citizen  or  resident  of  the  United  States,  a
corporation,  partnership  or other entity created or organized in, or under the
laws of, the United States or any political  subdivision  thereof (except in the
case of a partnership,  to the extent provided in Treasury  regulations),  or an
estate that is described in Section  7701(a)(30)(D) of the Code, or a trust that
is described in Section 7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code.

8.  ______  That the  Owner is aware  that the  Trustee  will not  register  the
transfer  of  any  Class  R-[ ]  Certificates  unless  the  transferee,  or  the
transferee's  agent,  delivers to it an  affidavit  and  agreement,  among other
things,  in  substantially  the same form as this affidavit and  agreement.  The
Owner expressly agrees that it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows
or believes  that any of the  representations  contained in such  affidavit  and
agreement are false.

9. ______ That the Owner has reviewed the  restrictions set forth on the face of
the Class R-[ ]  Certificates  and the  provisions  of  Section  5.02(f)  of the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement  under which the Class R-[ ] Certificates  were
issued (in  particular,  clause  (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) of Section  5.02(f) which
authorize  the Trustee to deliver  payments to a person other than the Owner and
negotiate  a  mandatory  sale by the  Trustee in the event the Owner  holds such
Certificates in violation of Section 5.02(f)).  The Owner expressly agrees to be
bound by and to comply with such restrictions and provisions.

10. _____ That the Owner consents to any additional restrictions or arrangements
that shall be deemed necessary upon advice of counsel to constitute a reasonable
arrangement  to ensure  that the Class  R-[ ]  Certificates  will only be owned,
directly or indirectly, by an Owner that is not a disqualified organization.

11.     _____    The    Owner's     Taxpayer     Identification     Number    is
_____________________________ .

12.  _____  This  affidavit  and  agreement  relates  only  to the  Class  R-[ ]
Certificates  held by the Owner  and not to any other  holder of the Class R-[ ]
Certificates. The Owner understands that the liabilities described herein relate
only to the Class R-[ ] Certificates.

for such purposes exceed $10 million (disregarding,  for purposes of determining
gross or net assets,  the  obligation of any person  related to the Owner within
the  meaning of section  860L(g) of the Code or any other  asset if a  principal
purpose  of holding  or  acquiring  that asset is to permit the Owner to satisfy
this minimum gross asset or net asset requirement), (II) the Owner is a domestic

the Owner will not hereafter  engage in any such transfer or assignment  (or any
such  arrangement),  and (2) does not know or have  reason to know that upon any
transfers  of  the  Class  R-[]  Certificate,  the  Owner  will  not  honor  the
restrictions  on subsequent  transfers of any Class R-[]  Certificate or (B) the
Owner has determined  that the present value of the  anticipated tax liabilities

distributions  on the Class R-[]  Certificate,  and (3) the present value of the
anticipated tax savings  associated  with holding the Class R-[]  Certificate as
the REMIC generates losses (having made such  determination by (I) assuming that
the Owner  pays tax at a rate  equal to the  highest  rate of tax  specified  in
Section  11(b)(1) of the Code,  and (II)  utilizing a discount  rate for present
valuation  purposes equal to the applicable  Federal rate  prescribed by Section
1274(d) of the Code compounded  semi-annually (or a lower discount rate based on
the Owner having  demonstrated that it regularly  borrows,  in the course of its
trade or business,  substantial  funds at such lower rate from  unrelated  third
parties).

               IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Owner has caused this  instrument to be

3.  ______ The Seller has at the time of the  transfer  conducted  a  reasonable
investigation  of the financial  condition of the Purchaser as  contemplated  by

due in the future and either (A) has determined  all of the following  (1)(I) at

the transfer does not involve a transfer or assignment to a foreign  branch of a
domestic  corporation  (or  any  other  arrangement  by  which  any  Class  R-[]
Certificate  is at any time  subject  to net tax by a  foreign  country  or U.S.
possession) and the Purchaser will not hereafter  engage in any such transfer or
assignment  (or any such  arrangement)  and (2) does not know or have  reason to
know that the Purchaser will not honor the restrictions on subsequent  transfers
of any Class R-[]  Certificates  as  described  in  paragraph  15 of the Form of
Transfer  Affidavit and  Agreement,  or (B) the Seller has  determined  that the
present value of the anticipated tax liabilities  associated with the holding of
the Class R-[]  Certificate  does not exceed the sum of (1) the present value of
any  consideration  given to the Purchaser to acquire the  Certificate,  (2) the
present value of the expect future  distributions on the Class R-[] Certificate,
and (3) the present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding
the Class R-[]  Certificate  as the REMIC  generates  losses  (having  made such
determination  by (I)  assuming  the  Purchaser  pays tax at a rate equal to the
highest  rate of tax  specified  in  Section  11(b)(1)  of the  Code,  and  (II)

rate from unrelated third parties).  The Seller understands that the transfer of
a Class R-[ ]  Certificate  may not be respected  for United  States  income tax

taxes   associated   therewith)   unless  the  Seller  has  conducted   such  an
investigation.

4. ______ The Seller has no actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not
both a United States Person and a Permitted Transferee.

        any other  manner or (e) take any other  action,  that (as to any of (a)
        through (e) above) would  constitute a distribution  of any  Certificate

        in the case of a Mortgage  Loan which has been prepaid in full after the

        delivering the above documents, may deliver to the Custodian, if any, or
        the  Trustee,  a  certification  to such  effect and shall  deposit  all
        amounts paid in respect of such Mortgage Loan in the Payment  Account on
