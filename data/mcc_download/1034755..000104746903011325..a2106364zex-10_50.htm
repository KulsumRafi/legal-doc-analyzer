to all Holders (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Company Notice"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) and shall, subject to the limitations set forth below, use its reasonable best efforts to effect as soon as
practicable the registration under the Act of all Registrable Securities that the Holders request to be registered in a written request to be given within 30&nbsp;days of receipt of the Company
Notice. The Company Notice shall include reasonable details relating to the proposed registration and the due date for replies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is obligated to effect only one registration pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2. </FONT></P>

the foregoing, if the Company shall furnish to the Initiating Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2 within 30&nbsp;days
of receiving the Demand Registration a certificate signed by the President of the Company stating that in the good faith Judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, the Company shall have the
right to defer such filing for up to 2 periods of not more than 45&nbsp;days each after receipt of the Demand Registration; provided, however, that the Company may not use this right more than once
(for a total of up to 90&nbsp;days) in any 12-month period; and provided, further that the Company shall promptly notify the Initiating Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;2 of any decision by the Company to abandon or indefinitely delay such public offering. During any such delay the Initiating Holders may withdraw the Demand Registration and the
consequence of such withdrawal is that the Company's obligation under Section&nbsp;2(b) hereof is not satisfied. </FONT></P>

registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Company stock plan, or a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would be
required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities), the Company shall, at each such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration.
Upon the written request of each such Holder given within 20&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice by such Holder from the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of the following
sentence, use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be registered under the Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be registered. If the managing underwriter of
a proposed public offering shall advise the Company in writing that, in its opinion, the distribution of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration concurrently with the
securities being registered
by the Company or any Requesting Holder would materially and adversely affect the distribution of such securities by the Company or such Requesting Holders, then all selling security holders (but not
the Company or the Requesting Holders) shall reduce the amount of Registrable Securities of each intended to be distributed through such offering on a pro rata basis to the greatest aggregate amount
which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, would not materially and adversely affect the distribution of such securities. </FONT></P>

the event that the Company decides for any reason not to complete the registration of shares of Common Stock other than Registrable Securities, the Company shall have no obligation

party, representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party

of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;8 to the extent such failure is prejudicial to its ability to defend such
