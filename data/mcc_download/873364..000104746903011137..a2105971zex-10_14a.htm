<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, MDS Proteomics&nbsp;Inc., a company governed by the laws of Canada (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), hereby promises to pay to the
order of Cephalon,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation, or its successors or assigns ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Cephalon</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), the principal amount of Thirty Million United States
Dollars (US$30,000,000) on January&nbsp;7, 2010 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Maturity Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), together with interest as set forth below, unless this Note is converted or
otherwise becomes due on an earlier date in accordance with the terms hereof. Interest shall accrue during the term of this Note and be payable annually on the anniversary of the date of issuance (and
on the date of conversion, if converted) (an "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Interest Payment Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum (computed on the basis of a
365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed) ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Interest Rate</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Company acknowledges that the rate of interest applicable to the
Principal Amount (as herein defined) is computed on the basis of a year of 365&nbsp;days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. For purposes of the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Interest
Act</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (Canada), such rate, expressed as an annual rate, is calculated as (i)&nbsp;five percent, (ii)&nbsp;multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in
which the period for such interest is payable (or compounded) ends, and (iii)&nbsp;divided by 365. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
recording by Cephalon in its accounts of the Principal Amount, Deferred Interest (as defined), accrued interest and repayments shall, in the absence of manifest mathematical error,
be </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>prima facia</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> evidence of the same; provided that the failure of Cephalon to record the same shall not affect the obligations of the Company to pay
such amounts to Cephalon. Except as otherwise provided herein, the principal and interest of this Note shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by certified check payable to
Cephalon at the address of Cephalon as set forth herein or such other address as shall be designated in writing by Cephalon to the Company; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>, that notwithstanding the foregoing the Company, at its option and in its sole discretion, by written notice to Cephalon, no later than two
business days prior to the date such interest is due, may defer the payment of interest then due on any Interest Payment Date ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Deferred Interest</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") by
electing to deliver additional shares (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Interest Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the Company's Class&nbsp;A Common Shares, (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Common
Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), to Cephalon on the date of conversion of this Note (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Conversion Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in accordance with Section&nbsp;4 hereof,
which number of Interest Common Stock shares shall be calculated by dividing the aggregate value of any Deferred Interest as of the Conversion Date by the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion
Date. In the event the Note is not converted on or prior to the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Principal Amount and all other obligations hereunder become due and payable, any Deferred
Interest shall be due and payable to Cephalon on the Maturity Date or such </FONT></P>

the Company desires to prepay any amount due hereunder (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Prepayment Amount</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") prior to the Maturity Date, then the
Company shall provide Cephalon with written notice thereof (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Prepayment Notice</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). For a period of ten (10)&nbsp;days following receipt of the Prepayment Notice, Cephalon shall have the option of converting such
Prepayment Amount pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 hereof. If Cephalon does not elect to convert such Prepayment Amount within the timeframe provided, then the Company shall be permitted to pay the
Prepayment Amount, provided that the Company also pays to Cephalon at such time an amount equal to five percent (5%) of such Prepayment Amount. The Prepayment Amount, excluding such five percent
payment amount, shall be applied first to costs and expenses due hereunder, then to accrued but unpaid interest, and thereafter to the Principal Amount hereof. The original Principal Amount as reduced
from time to time for all Prepayment Amounts, if any, shall be referred to in this Note as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Principal Amount.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" </FONT></P>

any Change of Control Event (as defined below) occurs within six (6)&nbsp;months following payment of a Prepayment Amount, which, if Cephalon had converted the
Prepayment Amount and participated in the Change of Control Event as a shareholder, would have resulted in a larger payment to Cephalon in respect of the Common Stock received on the conversion of the
Prepayment Amount as compared to the Prepayment Amount, then the Company shall pay Cephalon on the date the Change of Control Event is consummated, an additional make-whole amount equal to
(i)&nbsp;the amount Cephalon would have been entitled to receive had Cephalon converted the Prepayment Amount in accordance with Section&nbsp;4 hereof as of the date such Change of Control Event
was consummated and had Cephalon been required to fully participate in the Change of Control Event, less (ii)&nbsp;the Prepayment Amount. The term "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Change of Control
Event</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" as used herein, shall mean (x)&nbsp;the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, (y)&nbsp;a sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, or (z)&nbsp;any consolidation, merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or share exchange of the Company in which the holders of the Company's voting capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or share exchange do not, in the aggregate, hold a majority of the voting capital stock of the surviving

at the office of the Company, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the sum of the Principal Amount being converted (plus
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon including, as applicable, all Deferred Interest), by the Conversion Price (as defined herein) then in effect. Such conversion, to the extent permitted by law,
shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the later of the date on which such Note shall have been surrendered or the Conversion Notice shall have been received. At the
effective time of conversion, Cephalon's rights as a holder of the Note to the extent converted shall cease and Cephalon shall be deemed to have become holder of the Converted Shares. The
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Conversion Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall initially be US$22.00 per share of Common Stock; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that such

distribution under Canadian Securities Laws (as herein defined) with aggregate proceeds (before deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions) of at least US$50,000,000 (a
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Qualified Public Offering</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") or (ii)&nbsp;the date of the consent of two-thirds of the holders of such Principal Amount to such
conversion. At the effective time of conversion, Cephalon's rights as a holder of the Note to the extent converted shall cease and Cephalon shall be deemed to have become holder of the Converted
Shares. "Canadian Securities Laws" shall mean all applicable Canadian securities laws, the respective regulations, rules, instruments and orders made thereunder, and all applicable policies and
