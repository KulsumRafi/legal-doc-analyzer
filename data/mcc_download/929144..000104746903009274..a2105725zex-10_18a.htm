<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>YOUNG BROADCASTING&nbsp;INC.<BR>  AMENDED AND RESTATED 1995 STOCK OPTION PLAN<BR>  (as amended as of May&nbsp;6, 2002)    <BR>  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of the Plan.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Young Broadcasting&nbsp;Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to promote the interests of Young Broadcasting&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and its stockholders by strengthening the Company's ability to attract and retain competent employees, to make service on the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board") more attractive to present and prospective non-employee directors of the Company and to provide a means to encourage stock ownership and proprietary interest in the Company by
officers, non-employee directors and valued employees and other individuals upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts the financial success and growth of the Company largely depend. The
Plan became effective on February&nbsp;6, 1995, by resolution of the Board, subject to ratification of the Plan by a majority vote of the stockholders of the Company at its 1995 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Subject to the Plan.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The total number of shares of the authorized but unissued or treasury shares of the Common Stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock")
for which options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted under the Plan shall be 4,550,000 subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;14 hereof, which shares may be of any
class of Common Stock; provided, however, that such number of shares may from time to time be reduced to the extent that a corresponding number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock are
purchased by the Company and set aside for issue upon the exercise of options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
If an option granted or assumed hereunder shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject thereto shall again be
available for subsequent option grants under the Plan; provided, however, that shares as to which an option has been surrendered in connection with the exercise of a related SAR will not again be
available for subsequent option or SAR grants under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Stock issuable upon exercise of an option or SAR granted under the Plan may be subject to such restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights or other restrictions as shall be
determined by the Board. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration of the Plan.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board. No member of the Board shall act upon any matter exclusively affecting an option or SAR granted or to be granted
to himself or herself under the Plan. A majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and any action may be taken by a majority of those present and voting at any meeting. The
decision of the Board as to all questions of interpretation and application of the Plan shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. The Board may, in its sole discretion, grant options to
purchase shares of Common Stock, grant SARs and issue shares upon exercise of such options and SARs, as provided in the Plan. The Board shall have authority, subject to the express provisions of the
Plan, to construe the respective option and SAR agreements and the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of the
respective option and SAR agreements, which may but need not be identical, and to make all other determinations in the judgment of the Board necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.
The Board may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any option or SAR agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry
the Plan into effect and shall be the sole and final judge of such </FONT></P>

expediency. No director shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith. The Board may, in its discretion, delegate its power, duties and responsibilities to a committee,
consisting of two or more members of the Board, all of whom are "Non-Employee Directors" (as hereinafter defined). If a committee is so appointed, all references to the Board herein shall
mean and relate to such committee, unless the context otherwise requires. For the purposes of the Plan, a director or member of such committee shall be deemed to be a "Non-Employee
Director" only if such person qualified as a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning of paragraph&nbsp;(b)(3)(i)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as such term is interpreted from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type of Options.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall be authorized by action of the Board (or a committee designated by the Board) and may be designated as either incentive
stock options meeting the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or non-qualified options which are not intended to meet the
requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, the designation to be in the sole discretion of the Board. Options designated as incentive stock options that fail to continue to meet the requirements
of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code shall be redesignated as non-qualified options automatically on the date of such failure to continue to meet the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the
Code without further action by the Board. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options designated as incentive stock options may be granted only to officers and key employees of the Company or of any subsidiary corporation (herein called
"subsidiary" or "subsidiaries"), as defined in Section&nbsp;424 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"). Directors who are not otherwise employees of the
Company or a subsidiary shall not be eligible to be granted incentive stock options pursuant to the Plan. SARs and options designated as non-qualified options may be granted to
(i)&nbsp;officers and key employees of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries, or (ii)&nbsp;agents and directors of and consultants to the Company, whether or not otherwise employees of the
Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
determining the eligibility of an individual to be granted an option or SAR, as well as in determining the number of shares to be optioned to any individual, the Board shall take into
account the recommendation of the Company's Chairman, the position and responsibilities of the individual being considered, the nature and value to the Company or its subsidiaries of his or her
service and accomplishments, his or her present and potential contribution to the success of the Company or its subsidiaries, and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on Incentive Stock Options.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incentive stock options (but not non-qualified options) granted under this Plan shall be subject to the following restrictions: </FONT></P>

options are granted, determined as of the date the incentive stock options are granted, exercisable for the first time by an individual during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. If an
incentive stock option is granted pursuant to which the aggregate fair market value of shares with respect to which it first becomes exercisable in any calendar year by an individual exceeds such
$100,000 limitation, the portion of such option which is in excess of the $100,000
limitation, and any such options issued subsequently in the same calendar year, shall be treated as a non-qualified option pursuant to Section&nbsp;422(d)(1) of the Code. In the event

on the date of grant the owner of stock (as determined under Section&nbsp;424(d) of the Code) possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or
any parent or subsidiary of the Company, then the following special provisions shall be applicable to the incentive stock options granted to such individual: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)
The option price per share subject to such incentive stock options shall be not less than 110%, of the fair market value of the stock determined at the time such option was granted.
In determining the fair market value under this clause&nbsp;(i), the provisions of Section&nbsp;8 hereof shall apply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)
The incentive stock option shall have a term expiring not more than five (5)&nbsp;years from the date of the granting thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option Agreement.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each option and SAR shall be evidenced by an agreement (the "Agreement") duly executed on behalf of the Company and by the grantee to whom such option or SAR is
granted, which Agreement shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. The Agreement may contain such other terms, provisions and conditions which are not inconsistent with
the Plan as may be determined by the Board, provided that options designated as incentive stock options shall meet all of the conditions for incentive stock options as defined in Section&nbsp;422 of
the Code. No option or SAR shall be granted within the meaning of the Plan and no purported grant of any option or SAR shall be effective until the Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of
the Company and the optionee. More than one option and SAR may be granted to an individual. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option Price.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The option price or prices of shares of Common Stock for options designated as nonqualified stock options shall be as determined by the Board. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;6(b) hereof, the option price or prices of shares of Common Stock for options designated as incentive stock options shall be at
least the fair market value of such Common Stock at the time the option is granted as determined by the Board in accordance with clause&nbsp;(c) below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
If the Common Stock is then listed on any national securities exchange, the fair market value shall be the mean between the high and low sales prices, if any, on the largest such
exchange on the date of the grant of the option or, if none, shall be determined by taking a weighted average of the means between the highest and lowest sales on the nearest date before and the
nearest date after the date of grant in accordance with Regulations Section&nbsp;25.2512-2. If the Common Stock is not then listed on any such exchange, the fair market value shall be
the mean between the closing "Bid" and the closing "Ask" prices, if any, as reported in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ") for the date of the grant
of the option, or, if none, shall be determined by taking a weighted average of the means between the highest and lowest sales on the nearest date before and the nearest date after the date of grant
in accordance with Regulations Section&nbsp;25.2512-2. If the Common Stock is not then either listed on any such exchange or quoted in NASDAQ, the fair market value shall be the mean

in an amount equal to the exercise price of such options, (ii)&nbsp;shares of Common Stock owned by the optionee having a fair market value equal in amount to the exercise price of such options, or,
(iii)&nbsp;any combination of (i)&nbsp;and (ii); provided, however, that payment of the exercise price by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by such optionee may be made only upon the
condition that such payment does not result in a charge to earnings for financial accounting purposes as determined by the Board, unless such condition is waived by the Board. The fair market value of
any shares of Common Stock which may be delivered upon exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
To the extent that the right to purchase shares under an option has accrued and is in effect, options may be exercised in full at one time or in part from time to time, by giving
written notice, signed by the person or persons exercising the option, to the Company, stating the number of shares with respect to which the option is being exercised, accompanied by payment in full
for such shares as provided in subparagraph (a)&nbsp;above. Upon such exercise, delivery of a certificate for paid-up non-assessable shares
shall be made at the principal office of the Company to the person or persons exercising the option at such time, during ordinary business hours, after three (3)&nbsp;days but not more than ninety
(90)&nbsp;days from the date of receipt of the notice by the Company, as shall be designated in such notice, or at such time, place and manner as may be agreed upon by the Company and the person or

extent that an option or SAR is not exercised when it becomes initially exercisable, it shall not expire but shall be carried forward and shall be exercisable, on a cumulative basis, until the
expiration of the exercise period. No partial exercise may be made for less than one hundred (100)&nbsp;full shares of Common Stock. The exercise of an option shall result in the cancellation of the
SAR to which it relates with respect to the same number of shares of Common Stock as to which the option was exercised. </FONT></P>

or of another corporation by reason of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, combination of shares, or dividends payable in capital
stock, appropriate adjustment shall be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code in the number and kind of shares as to which options and SARs may be granted under the Plan and as to
which outstanding options and SARs or portions thereof then unexercised shall be exercisable, to the end that the proportionate interest of the grantee shall be maintained as before the occurrence of
such event; such adjustment in outstanding options and SARs shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of such options and SARs and with a corresponding

addition, unless otherwise determined by the Board in its sole discretion, in the case of any (i)&nbsp;sale or conveyance to another entity of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the Company or (ii)&nbsp;Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of the Company, the purchaser(s) of the Company's assets or stock may, in his, her or its discretion,
deliver to the optionee the same kind of consideration that is delivered to the stockholders of the Company as a result of such sale, conveyance or Change in Control, or the Bond may cancel all
outstanding options and SARs in exchange for consideration in cash or in kind which consideration in both cases shall be equal in value to the value of those shares of stock or other securities the
optionee would have received had the option been exercised (to the extent then exercisable) and no disposition of the shares acquired upon such exercise been made prior to such sale, conveyance or
Change in Control, less the exercise price therefor. Upon receipt of such consideration, the options and SARs shall immediately terminate and be of no further force and effect. The value of the stock
or other securities the grantee would have received if the option had been exercised shall be determined in good faith by the Board, and in the case of shares of Common Stock, in accordance with the
provisions of Section&nbsp;8 hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board shall also have the power and right to accelerate the exercisability of any options or SARs, notwithstanding any limitations in this Plan or in the Agreement upon such a sale,
conveyance or Change in Control. Upon such acceleration, any options or portion thereof originally designated as incentive stock options that no longer qualify as incentive stock options under
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code as a result of such acceleration shall be redesignated as non-qualified stock options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the shares to be issued upon exercise of an option or SAR granted under the Plan have been effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act"), the Company shall be under no obligation to issue any shares covered by any option or SAR unless the person who exercises such option, in whole or in part, shall give a
written representation and undertaking to the Company which is satisfactory in form and scope to counsel for the Company and upon which, in the opinion of such counsel, the Company may reasonably
rely, that he or she is acquiring the shares issued pursuant to such exercise of the option or SAR for his or her own account as an investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
the distribution of any such shares, and that he or she will make no transfer of the same except in compliance with any rules and regulations in force at the time of such transfer under the 1933 Act,
or any other applicable law, and that if shares are issued without such registration, a legend to this effect may be endorsed upon the securities so issued. </FONT></P>

the event that the Company shall, nevertheless, deem it necessary or desirable to register under the 1933 Act or other applicable statutes any shares with respect to which an option

such information in writing for use in any registration statement, supplementary registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus or offering circular as is reasonably necessary for such
purpose and may require reasonable indemnity to the Company and its officers and directors from such holder against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising from such use of the information
so furnished and caused by any untrue statement of any material fact therein or caused by the omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
