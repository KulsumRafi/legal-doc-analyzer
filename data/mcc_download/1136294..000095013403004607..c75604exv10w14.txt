            subject to the Company's receipt of supporting documentation in
            accordance with the Company's customary reporting and documentation
            provisions.

            (d) Term.

                  (i) This Agreement is an employment contract for a term of two
            (2) years beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the
            second anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Initial Employment
            Term"). At the end of the Initial Employment Term, and at the end of
            each Additional Employment Term (as herein defined), unless the
            Company (with the approval of the Board) has provided the Executive
            with at least sixty (60) days advance written notice, so long as the
            Executive continues to be employed by the Company, this employment
            contract shall automatically renew for a term of one (1) year (each
            such additional term, an "Additional Employment Term"). The Initial
            Employment Term and each Additional Employment Term shall be
            referred to herein as an "Employment Term." Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, each Employment Term is subject to early termination (x)
            by reason of the Executive's death or Disability, (y) by resolution
            of the Board with or without Cause, or (z) upon the Executive's
            voluntary resignation with or without Good Reason. For all purposes
            under this Agreement, a delivery of a notice by the Company to the
            Executive pursuant to this Section 2(d)(i) to avoid an Additional
            Employment Term shall be treated as if an Employment Term has been
            terminated early by resolution of the Board without Cause.

                  (ii) The period of the Initial Employment Term together with
            each Additional Employment Term, if any, shall be referred to herein
            as the "Employment Period." Notwithstanding any termination of the
            Executive's employment by the Company (such termination, an
            "Employment Termination"), this Agreement shall remain a valid and
            enforceable contract between the parties, including without
            limitation Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof.

                  (i) If any Employment Term is terminated early by resolution
            of the Board with Cause or by reason of the Executive's voluntary
            resignation without Good Reason, then the Executive shall be
            entitled to receive only all previously earned and accrued but
            unpaid Base Salary and vacation time up to the date of the
            Employment Termination (and not any accrued but unpaid Bonus as of
            the date of the Employment Termination).

                  (ii) If any Employment Term is terminated early by reason of
            the Executive's death or Disability, then the Executive shall be
            entitled to receive only (x) all previously earned and accrued but
            unpaid Base Salary and vacation time up to the date of the
            Employment Termination, (y) if the date of the Employment
            Termination is 3 months after the commencement of a Bonus Year, then

            Year in which such termination occurs determined on a pro rated
            basis based on the number of days of the applicable Bonus Year prior
            to the date of the Employment Termination as compared to the number
            of days in such Bonus Year, which payment will be made when such
            Bonus for such Bonus Year would otherwise be payable and (z) any
            Bonus earned by the Executive during any Bonus Year which ended
            prior to the date of the Employment Termination and which has not
            been paid as of such date, which payment will be made when such
            Bonus for such Bonus Year would otherwise be payable.

                  (iii) If any Employment Term is terminated early by reason of
            the Executive's voluntary resignation with Good Reason or by
            resolution of the Board without Cause, then, subject to the last
            sentence of this section (iii), the Executive shall be entitled to
            receive only the following: (v) all previously earned and accrued
            but unpaid Base Salary and vacation time up to the date of the
            Employment Termination, (w) his Base Salary and the Benefits marked
            on Exhibit A with an "#" for the twelve-month period beginning on
            the date of the Employment Termination; provided, however, that such
            twelve-month period shall be extended until the date on which the
            Initial Employment Term would have ended if more than twelve months
            remained in the Initial Employment Term on the date of the
            Employment Termination; provided, further, that in lieu of providing
            such benefits, the Company may elect to pay to the Executive the
            cost of premiums for such benefits, (x) the Benefits referred to in
            Section 2(c)(ii)(C) hereof for the three-month period beginning on

            Termination, (y) if the date of the Employment Termination is 3
            months after the commencement of a Bonus Year, then a portion of the
            Bonus earned by the Executive during such Bonus Year in which such
            termination occurs determined on a pro rated basis based on the
            number of days of the applicable Bonus Year prior to the date of the
            Employment Termination as compared to the number of days in such
            Bonus Year, which payment will be made when such Bonus for such

            the Executive during any Bonus Year which ended prior to the date of
            the Employment Termination and which has not been paid as of such
            date, which payment will be made when such Bonus for such Bonus Year
            would otherwise be payable. Notwithstanding these payments or
            benefits, the period for which the Executive is entitled to health
            care continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Internal
            Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall begin to run on the date of

            limitation, civil rights claims), in such form as reasonably
            requested by the Company; provided, however, that the release will
            not affect any contractual rights the Executive may otherwise have
            under any stock option plans of Holdings or option agreements
            thereunder; and provided further that the release shall not apply to
            any rights to which the Executive is entitled in accordance with
            plan provisions under any employee benefit plan or fringe benefit
            plan or program of Holdings or the Company and its Affiliates.

                  (iv) Except as expressly provided in this Section 2(e), the
            Executive hereby agrees that upon and after the Employment
            Termination, no severance compensation of any kind, nature or amount
            (including by operation of law) shall be payable by Holdings, the
            Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the
            Executive and the Executive hereby irrevocably waives any claim for
            severance compensation of any kind, nature or amount (including by
            operation of law).

                  (v) Except as expressly provided in this Section 2(e), upon
            the Employment Termination, except as required by law, all of the
            Executive's rights to Benefits hereunder (if any) shall cease.

                  (vi) Subject to restrictive covenants contained in Section 5
            hereof, the Executive may obtain other engagements or employment
            after the date of an Employment Termination, and any compensation
            received or receivable by the Executive shall not reduce any amounts
            which the Company is required to pay to the Executive pursuant to
            this Agreement.


                                        8

      3. Work Product. The Executive agrees that all inventions, drawings,
improvements, developments, methods, processes, programs, designs and all
similar or related information which relates to Holdings' or any of its
Subsidiaries' actual or anticipated business or research and development or
existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed,
contributed to or made by the Executive (either solely or jointly with others)
while employed by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries ("Work Product") shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Holdings or any such Subsidiary. The
Executive will promptly disclose such Work Product to Holdings and perform all
actions requested by Holdings (whether during or after employment) to establish
and confirm such ownership (including, without limitation, assignments,
consents, powers of attorney and other instruments).

      4. Confidential Information.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges:

                  (i) That the Work Product, artificial intelligence systems,
            information, customer lists, goodwill, observations and data
            disclosed to, developed by or obtained by him while employed by
            Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the business or
            affairs of Holdings or any such Subsidiary (including without
            limitation Holdings' and its Subsidiaries' technology, methods of
            doing business and supplier and customer information) (collectively,
            "Confidential Information") are highly confidential and uniquely
            valuable to Holdings and its Subsidiaries;

                  (ii) That such Confidential Information is and shall
            continue to be the property of Holdings or any such Subsidiary;

                  (iii) That Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries has a
            proprietary interest in their respective Confidential Information,
            including without limitation the identity of their respective
            customers and suppliers, solicited customers, customer and supplier
            lists;

                  (iv) That the continued success of Holdings and its
            Subsidiaries depends in large part on keeping the Confidential
            Information from becoming known to competitors of Holdings and its
            Subsidiaries; and

                  (v) That Holdings and its Subsidiaries will be irreparably
            harmed by disclosure of any Confidential Information.

            (b) Therefore, the Executive agrees:

                  (i) That, during his employment and for all times thereafter,
            except as required by law or court order, he shall not directly or
            indirectly disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his own
            account any Confidential Information without the prior written
            consent of Holdings, unless and to the extent that the


                                        9
<PAGE>

            aforementioned matters become generally known to and available for
            use by the public other than as a result of the Executive's acts or
            omissions to act;

                  (ii) To use his best efforts and diligence to safeguard the
            Confidential Information and to protect it against disclosure,
            misuse, espionage, loss or theft;

                  (iii) That upon the Employment Termination or at any other
            time Holdings may request, for whatever reason, the Executive shall
            deliver (and in the event of the Executive's death or Disability,
            his representative shall deliver) to Holdings all computer equipment
            or backup files of or relating to Holdings and its Subsidiaries, all
            memoranda, correspondence, customer data, notes, plans, records,
            reports, manuals, photographs, computer tapes and software and other
            documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential
            Information, the Work Product or the business of Holdings or any of
            its Subsidiaries which he may then possess or have under his
            control. If Holdings requests, the Executive (or his representative)
            agrees to provide written confirmation that the Executive has
            returned all such materials to Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries;
            and

                  (iv) That upon the Employment Termination or at any other time
            Holdings may request, for whatever reason, the Executive shall
            assign all rights, title and interest in the Confidential
            Information, the Work Product, all computer equipment or backup
            files of or relating to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, all
            memoranda, correspondence, customer data, notes, plans, records,
            reports, manuals, photographs, computer tapes and software and other
            documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential
            Information, the Work Product or the business of Holdings or any of
            its Subsidiaries which the Executive may then possess, has under his
            control, or has ever developed, obtained, or contributed to during
            his tenure with Holdings.

      5. Noncompete, Nonsolicitation.

            (a) The Executive agrees that, during the time he is employed by
      Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries and during any applicable
      Post-Termination Period (as herein defined) (the "Noncompete Period"), he
      shall not directly or indirectly own, operate, manage, control,
      participate in, consult with, advise, provide services for, or in any
      manner engage in any business (including by himself or in association with
      any person, firm, corporate or other business organization or through any
      other entity) in competition with, or potential competition with, the
      businesses of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries as such businesses (the
      "Businesses") exist during the Executive's employment by the Company,
      within the United States or any other geographical area in which Holdings
      or any of its Subsidiaries engages or plans to engage in the Businesses
      (the "Geographical Area"). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive
      from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of
      a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no
      active participation in the business of such corporation. For purposes of
      this Section 5, "Post-Termination Period" means the twelve (12) month
      period beginning on the Termination Date.


                                       10
<PAGE>

            (b) During the Noncompete Period, the Executive shall not directly
      or indirectly through another entity (i) induce or attempt to induce any
      employee of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to leave the employ of
      Holdings or any such Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the
      relationship between Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries and any employee
      thereof, including without limitation, inducing or attempting to induce
      any union, employee or group of employees to interfere with the business
      or operations of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) hire any person
      who was an employee of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries at any time
      during the Executive's employment period, or (iii) induce or attempt to
      induce any customer, supplier, distributor, franchisee, licensee or other
      business relation of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to cease doing
      business with Holdings or any such Subsidiary, or in any way interfere
      with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, distributor,
      franchisee, licensee or business relation and Holdings or any of its
      Subsidiaries.

            (c) The Executive agrees that: (i) the covenants set forth in this
      Section 5 are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all
      other respects, (ii) Holdings and the Company would not have entered into
      this Agreement but for the covenants of the Executive contained herein,
      and (iii) the covenants contained herein have been made in order to induce
      Holdings and the Company to enter into this Agreement.

            (d) If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 5, a court shall
      hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are
      unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the
      maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall
      be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court
      shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
      maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.

            (e) The Executive recognizes and affirms that in the event of his
      breach of any provision of this Section 5, money damages would be
      inadequate and Holdings and the Company would have no adequate remedy at
      law. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that in the event of a breach or a
      threatened breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of this
      Section 5, Holdings and the Company, in addition and supplementary to
      other rights and remedies existing in its favor, may apply to any court of
      law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
      injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations
      of the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security).

      6. Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and delivered personally, mailed by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested and postage prepaid, sent via a nationally recognized
overnight courier, charges prepaid, or sent via facsimile. Such notices, demands
and other communications will be sent to the address indicated below:


                                       11

            To Holdings or the Company:

                  Global Power Equipment Group Inc.
                  6120 South Yale, Suite 1480
                  Tulsa, OK  74136
                  Attention:  Secretary
                  Facsimile No.:  (918) 274-2367

            To the Executive:

                  at the Executive's last address or facsimile
                  number on the records of the Company

or such other address or to the attention of such other Person as the recipient
party shall have specified by prior written notice to the sending party;
provided, that the failure to deliver copies of notices as indicated above shall
not affect the validity of any notice. Any such notice, demand or other
communication shall be deemed to have been received (i) when delivered, if
personally delivered, or sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or sent
via facsimile or (ii) on the third business day following the date on which the
piece of mail containing such notice, demand or other communication is posted if
sent by certified or registered mail.

      7. Miscellaneous.

            (a) Warranty by the Executive. The Executive represents and warrants
      to Holdings and the Company that he is not a party to any agreement
      containing a noncompetition provision or other restriction with respect to
      (i) the nature of any services or business which he is entitled to perform
      or conduct for Holdings or the Company under this Agreement, or (ii) the
      disclosure or use of any information which directly or indirectly relates
      to the nature of the business of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or
      the services to be rendered by the Executive under this Agreement.

            (b) Severability. If any provision or clause of this Agreement, or
      portion thereof shall be held by any court or other tribunal of competent
      jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in such
      jurisdiction, the remainder of such provision shall not be thereby
      affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid
      portion. It is the intention of the parties that, if any court construes
      any provision or clause of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, to be
      illegal, void or unenforceable because of the duration of such provision
      or the area matter covered thereby, such court shall reduce the duration,
      area, or matter of such provision, and, in its reduced form, such
      provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.

            (c) Complete Agreement. This Agreement shall embody the complete
      agreement and understanding among the Executive, Holdings and/or any of
      its Subsidiaries and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings,
      agreements or representations by or among such parties, written or oral,
      which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way, including,
      but not limited to, the Old Employment


                                       12

      Agreement. This Agreement does not supersede any agreements evidencing the
      grant of options to the Executive under Holdings' 2000 Option Plan,
      Holdings' 2001 Option Plan or any future option plan of Holdings.

            (d) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate
      counterparts, each of which is deemed to be an original and all of which
      taken together constitute one and the same agreement.

            (e) Successors and Assigns, Transfer.  This Agreement is intended to
      bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive,
      Holdings and the Company and their respective successors, heirs and
      assigns.

            (f) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
      in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without giving
      effect to any rules, principles or provisions of choice of law or conflict
      of laws.

            (g) Remedies. Holdings, the Company and the Executive will be
      entitled to enforce its or his respective rights under this Agreement
      specifically, to recover damages and costs (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees and expenses) caused by any breach of any provision of
      this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in its or his
      favor. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that Holdings and the
      Company will suffer irreparable harm and money damages may not be an
      adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the
      Executive and that any such party may in its sole discretion apply to any
      court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction (without posting any bond
      or deposit) for specific performance and/or other injunctive relief in
      order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this
      Agreement.

            (h) Amendment and Waiver. The provisions of this Agreement may be
      amended and waived only with the prior written consent of Holdings (with
      the approval of the Board) and the Executive.

            (i) Tax Matters. The Executive shall indemnify, defend and hold
      harmless Holdings and its Affiliates (and their respective officers,
      directors, shareholders and employees) for any liability associated with
      federal, state or local income tax withholding and employment tax
      withholding in respect of the Executive or his transferees (including all
      interest, penalties and additions to tax with respect thereto) resulting
      from, or arising with respect to, the issuance to the Executive of any
      units of interest in the Predecessor Company, whether before or after the
      merger of GEEG Acquisition, L.L.C. into the Predecessor Company, whether
      acquired by purchase from any Subsidiary of Holdings or otherwise, or the
      holding by the Executive or his transferees of any such units of interest
      in the Predecessor Company.
