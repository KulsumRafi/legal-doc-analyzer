administration of the Plan as it may deem advisable and not inconsistent with provisions of the Plan.&#160; Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all questions arising under the Plan or under any rule or regulation with respect to the Plan
adopted by the Committee, whether such questions involve an interpretation of the Plan or otherwise, shall be decided by the Committee, and its decisions shall be conclusive and binding in all cases.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"

requires, bear a legend consistent with the certifications and representations, which legend may restrict the transferability of the shares until they are first registered or until legal counsel gives the Company a written opinion that any proposed
sale or transfer by the holder does not require registration and would not jeopardize or destroy any exemptions from registration relied upon by the Company in issuing the shares.&#160; Although it is not legally required to do so, the Company
