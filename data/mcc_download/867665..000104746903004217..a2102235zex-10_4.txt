Commission, as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date and (subject to

Offer, such Holder will have no arrangement or understanding with any Person to
participate in the distribution of the Series B Notes in violation of the
provisions of the Securities Act, and that such Holder is not an affiliate of
the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act.

     (b)  The Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Series B
Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously, and shall
keep the Series B Exchange Offer open, for a period of not less than the minimum
period required under applicable federal and state securities laws to consummate
the Series B Exchange Offer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall such

Statement has become effective, subject to any extension that may be legally
required as a result of an event referred to in Section 4(c)(2).

     (c)  In connection with the Series B Exchange Offer, the Issuer shall
comply with all applicable provisions of Section 4 hereof, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect such exchange and shall comply with all of the
following provisions:

          (i)     If, following the date hereof and prior to consummation of the
Series B Exchange Offer, there has been published a change in Commission policy
with respect to exchange offers such as the Series B Exchange Offer, such that
in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Issuer there is a substantial
question as to whether the Series B Exchange Offer is permitted by applicable
federal law or Commission policy, the Issuer hereby agrees, upon the request of
any 10% Holder (as defined herein), to seek a no-action letter or other
favorable decision from the Commission allowing the Issuer to consummate a
Series B Exchange Offer for such New Notes. The Issuer hereby agrees to pursue
the issuance of such a decision to the Commission staff level but shall not be
required to take commercially unreasonable action to effect a change of
Commission policy. In connection with the foregoing, the Issuer hereby agrees,
however, but subject to the proviso set forth above, to take all such other
actions as are reasonably requested by the Commission or otherwise required in
connection with the issuance of such decision, including without limitation to
(A) participate in telephonic conferences with the Commission, (B) deliver to
the Commission staff an analysis prepared by counsel to the Issuer setting forth
the legal bases, if any, upon which such counsel has concluded that such a
Series B Exchange Offer should be permitted and (C) diligently pursue a
resolution (which need not be favorable) by the Commission staff of such
submission.

          (ii)    To the extent required by the Commission, prior to
effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Issuer shall
provide a supplemental letter to the Commission (A) stating that the Issuer is
registering the Series B Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the
Commission enunciated in EXXON CAPITAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION (available May 13,
1988), MORGAN STANLEY AND CO., INC. (available June 5, 1991) and, if applicable,
any no-

                                      - 5 -
<Page>

action letter obtained pursuant to clause (c)(i) immediately above, (B)
including a representation that the Issuer has not entered into any arrangement
or understanding with any Person to distribute the Series B Notes to be received
in the Series B Exchange Offer and that, to the best of the Issuer's information
and belief, each Holder participating in the Series B Exchange Offer is
acquiring the Series B Notes in its ordinary course of business and has no
arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution
of the Series B Notes received in the Series B Exchange Offer and (C) any other
undertaking or representation required by the Commission as set forth in any
no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (c)(i) immediately above.

     3.   SHELF REGISTRATION. References to "Registrable Securities" in this
Section 3 do not include Series B Notes or Additional Notes relating thereto:

     (a)  The Issuer shall as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date and
no later than 15 days after the Closing Date file a Shelf Registration Statement
relating to all Registrable Securities held by Holders with the Commission and
thereafter shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities by the
Holders to be declared effective by the Commission at the earliest possible
time, but in no event later than 105 days after the Closing Date, such offer and
sale of such Registrable Securities by the Holders being made from time to time
in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set
forth in such Registration Statement, including an Underwritten Offering. The
Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep each Shelf Registration
Statement discussed in this Section 3(a) continuously effective, supplemented
and amended as required by and subject to the provisions of Sections 2 and 3
hereof as applicable, and to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available
for sales of Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof entitled to the
benefit of this Section 3(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the
requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations
of the Commission as announced from time to time, for the period specified in
Section 3(b) below. The Issuer shall not permit any securities other than the
Registrable Securities (and any shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants)
to be included in any Shelf Registration Statement. In the event of an
Underwritten Offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for
such offering shall be selected by such Holders, and reasonably acceptable to
the Issuer. Such Holders shall provide the Issuer with notice of the identity of
the managing underwriter or underwriters it or they have selected at a
reasonable time prior to the commencement of any such underwritten offering.

     (b)  The Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep each Shelf
Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the Prospectus
forming part thereof to be usable by Holders until the earlier of (i) the date
that is two years from the Closing Date plus any Suspension Period or Black Out
Period (as respectively defined hereafter), (ii) the date that all of the
Registrable Securities covered thereby have been sold pursuant to such
Registration Statement, (iii) the date that Jefferies on behalf of the Holders
receives an opinion of counsel to the Issuer addressed to Jefferies and the
Holders, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Jefferies on behalf of
the Holders, that all of the Registrable Securities (other than those held by
Affiliates) covered thereby may be sold under the provisions of Rule 144 without
limitation as to volume or manner of sale (a copy of which opinion shall be
provided by the Issuer to any Holder

                                      - 6 -
<Page>

upon request by such Holder), or (iv) the date that all Registrable Securities
covered thereby have been otherwise transferred to persons who may trade such
shares without restriction or limitation under the Act, and the Issuer has
delivered a new certificate or other evidence of ownership for such securities
not bearing a restrictive legend, (in any such case, such period being called
the "REGISTRATION PERIOD"). If a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 3(a) ceases to be effective during the Registration Period, then, if the
effectiveness can be reinstated, the Issuer shall use all reasonable best
efforts to have such Registration Statement reinstated immediately, and if such
Registration Statement cannot be reinstated or is not reinstated immediately,
the Issuer shall use all reasonable best efforts to file promptly a substitute
registration statement and cause such substitute registration statement to
become effective as soon as practicable and continuously effective during the
balance of the Registration Period. Issuer may replace (or convert) any
Registration Statement on Form S-1 with a Registration Statement on Form S-3,
provided, that there is no interruption in the effectiveness of such Shelf
Registration Statement and such replacement is at Issuer's sole expense and the
Holders shall have no obligation as a result of such replacement or conversion.

     (c)  Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees by its acquisition of
such Registrable Securities that, upon actual receipt of any written notice from
the Issuer of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section
4(c)(2) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or Prospectus, as
the case may be (and will rescind any pending disposition, to the extent
practicable), until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(i) hereof, or until it is advised
in writing (the "ADVICE") by the Issuer that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or
supplements thereto. In the event that the Issuer shall give any such notice,
the Issuer shall use all reasonable best efforts to ensure the filing and/or
effectiveness of the Registration Statement and/or use of the Prospectus may be
resumed as promptly as practicable, and the period during which the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus are required to remain continuously effective shall
be extended by the number of days during such period from and including the date
of the giving of such notice to and including the date (the "SUSPENSION PERIOD")
when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement shall have received (x) the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(i) hereof or (y) the Advice; provided,
however, that such Suspension Period shall in no event exceed 45 consecutive
days and 90 days in any 12-month period.

     (d)  No Holder of Registrable Securities may include any Registrable
Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement or
enforce the provisions of Section 7 hereof unless and until such Holder
furnishes to the Issuer in writing, within 7 days after receipt of a written
request from the Issuer therefor, such information as the Issuer may reasonably
request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or
Prospectus or preliminary prospectus included therein as is legally required for
registration statements and prospectuses for similar securities. Each Holder of
Registrable Securities as to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being
effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Issuer all information required to be
disclosed in order to make information previously furnished to the Issuer by
such Holder not materially misleading.

event at least five Business Days prior to such filing so that such Holders have

any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or that any Registration

<Page>

Securities included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of
any proceeding for such purpose;

          (iii)   of the discovery or happening of any event that requires the
making of any changes in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus so that,
as of such date, the statements therein do not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (which advice shall be accompanied by an instruction to
suspend the use of such Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made);
and

          (iv)    of the Issuer's reasonable determination that a post-effective
amendment to any Registration Statement would be appropriate.

Any notice provided by the Issuer pursuant to this section 4(c) shall be kept
confidential by any recipient unless disclosure thereof is made in connection
with a court or administrative proceeding or action required by law or such
information becomes available to the public generally or through a third party
without a known obligation of confidentiality.

     (d)  The Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the

necessary in the opinion of counsel to the Issuer to enable the seller or
sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

Securities, upon receipt of such Holder's written request, and any Underwriter

Prospectus) included in such Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto and any document or exhibit incorporated or deemed
incorporated therein as such Holder may reasonably request in writing; and the
Issuer consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto and any document or exhibit incorporated or deemed incorporated therein

     (g)  Prior to any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Shelf
Registration Statement, the Issuer will register or qualify or cooperate with
the Holders of Registrable Securities included therein and their respective
counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from
such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and
sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any such
Holders or any Underwriter reasonably requests in writing, and do any and all
other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the offer and sale in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement and will keep such registration, qualification or exemption effective

required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not
then so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general
service of process or to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject.

     (h)  The Issuer will cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement
free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such
names as either the Holders or any Underwriter may request prior to sales of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

of any event contemplated by paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(2)(iv) above, the
Issuer will promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to any Shelf
Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus
or file any other required document so that the Prospectus, as supplemented or
amended, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be required to amend or supplement a Shelf
Registration Statement, any related Prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference in the event that, and for a period (a "BLACK OUT PERIOD")
not to exceed, for so long as this Agreement is in effect, 45 days consecutively
and 90 days in any 12-month period if either (A) any action by the Issuer
pursuant to this Section 4(i) would violate applicable law or (B) (x) an event
occurs and is continuing as a result of which a Registration Statement, any
related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference as then
amended or supplemented would, in the Issuer's good faith judgment, contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and (y) (1) the Issuer determines in good
faith that the disclosure of such event at such time would have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or prospects of the Issuer or (2) the
disclosure otherwise relates to a material business transaction which has not
yet been publicly disclosed in any relevant jurisdiction.

     (j)  The Issuer shall, if reasonably requested, promptly incorporate in a
Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration
Statement, such information as the Managing Underwriters or any of the 10%
Holders reasonably agrees should be included therein and shall make all required
filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment.

     (k)  The Issuer shall cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on
each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Issuer are
then listed, provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement and
shall enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements) and take
all other appropriate actions necessary or advisable in order to expedite or
facilitate the registration or the disposition of the Registrable Securities;
the Issuer shall also (i) make such representations, warranties to, and
covenants with the Underwriters and any 10% Holder upon request by such 10%
Holder, with respect to the businesses of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and documents incorporated by
reference therein, in each case, as are customarily made by issuers to
underwriters in underwritten offerings of securities similar to the Registrable
Securities to be sold in an underwritten offering, (ii) furnish to the
Underwriters and any 10% Holder upon request by such 10% Holder opinions of
counsel to the Issuer and updates thereof in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters and any such 10% Holders covering the
matters customarily covered in opinions delivered in underwritten offerings of
securities similar to the Registrable Securities, but in any event including (A)
an opinion that any Registration Statement filed by the Issuer is being filed on
the appropriate form for registration of the Registrable Securities and that
such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission and
there is no applicable stop order or other legal reason impairing the use of the
prospectus therein as a result of the action or failure to act by the Issuer or
as a result of any action by a governmental authority, and any Holder may trade
the Registrable Securities relating thereto freely (subject to any prospectus
delivery requirements) and (B) negative assurances regarding the substance of
Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act (which opinion and negative assurances shall be
reissued upon and dated the date of any amendment or supplement or incorporation
by reference to any Registration Statement or conclusion of any Black Out Period
or Suspension Period), (iii) obtain and furnish to the Underwriters and any 10%
Holder upon written request by such Holder "cold comfort" letters and updates
thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Managing
Underwriters and such 10% Holder, as the case may be, from the independent
public accountants of the Issuer (and, if necessary, any other independent
public accountants of any subsidiary of the Issuer or of any business acquired
by the Issuer for which financial statements and financial data are, or are
required to be, included in the Registration Statement), such letters to be in
customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold
comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings of securities similar
to the Registrable Securities to be sold (which shall be reissued upon and dated
the date of any amendment or supplement or incorporation by reference to any
Registration Statement or conclusion of any Black Out Period or Suspension
Period), and (iv) cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and
procedures no less favorable than those set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement
(or such other provisions and procedures acceptable to the Holders and the
Managing Underwriters, if any, with respect to all parties to be indemnified
pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement from Holders of Registrable Securities
to the Issuer). The above shall be done additionally at each closing under such
underwriting agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder.

     (l)  The Issuer shall (i) make reasonably available for inspection by a
representative or representatives of the Holders of Registrable Securities to be
registered thereunder, any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant
to a Shelf Registration Statement, and any

                                     - 11 -
<Page>

attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders or any such
Underwriter, during reasonable business hours all relevant financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries and (ii) cause the Issuer's officers, directors and employees to
supply all relevant information reasonably requested by any such representatives
or any such Underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any
such Shelf Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence
examinations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any information that is designated by the
Issuer, in good faith, as confidential at the time of delivery of such
information shall be kept confidential by any such representatives or any such
Underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent, unless such disclosure is made in
connection with a court or administrative proceeding or action or required by
law or is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission of material
fact in any Registration Statement, or such information becomes available to the
public generally or through a third party without a known obligation of
confidentiality.

     (m)  The Issuer shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of
the Commission and make generally available to the securityholders of Abraxas
earnings statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and
Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Act) no later
than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of
any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (A) commencing at the end
of any fiscal quarter in which Registrable Securities are sold to Underwriters
in a firm commitment or best efforts Underwritten Offering and (B) if not sold
to Underwriters in such an offering, then commencing on the first day of the
first fiscal quarter of Abraxas after the effective date of a Registration
Statement, which statements shall cover such 12-month periods.

     (n)  The Issuer shall cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities
covered by any Registration Statement and each Underwriter, if any,
participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their
respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the
NASD.

     (o)  In connection with each Registration Statement filed with the
Commission, the Issuer shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA
not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement and, in
connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such
changes to the Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so
qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may
be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to
be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a
timely manner.

     5.   REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Issuer will bear all expenses incident to
or incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration
Statement whether or not declared effective, and including, without limitation,
in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4
hereof, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees and

expenses of legal opinions) and all independent accountants (including the
expenses of "cold comfort" letters and annual audits), underwriters (excluding
discounts and commissions), and fees and expenses of other Persons retained by
the Issuer, in each case, whether all, some or none of the Registrable
Securities are sold but excluding fees and expenses of counsel to any of the
Holders, fees and expenses of any accountants, engineers, consultants or any
other advisers to the Holders, any underwriting discount or commission and any
broker-dealer sales commission that the Holders may incur in disposing of their
Registrable Securities. The Issuer will, in any event, bear its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of any of its
respective officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties).

     6.   INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) In connection with any
Registration Statement, the Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Holder of Registrable Securities covered thereby, the directors, officers,
managers, members, partners, employees, agents and affiliates of each such
Holder and each Person who controls any such Holder within the meaning of either
the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject
under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or
regulation or otherwise, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed
or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus,
or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and the Issuer upon demand by such indemnified party agrees to reimburse each
such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it
in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action or proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Issuer will not
be liable in any case (i) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by such
Holder specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability is caused by any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the preliminary
Prospectus which is corrected in the Prospectus and a copy of the corrected
Prospectus was not sent or given to the person asserting any such loss, claim,
damage or liability who purchased Registrable Securities sold by the Holders at
or before the written confirmation of the sale to such person.

     The Issuer also agrees, to indemnify or contribute to Losses (as defined in
Section 6(d) below) of, as provided in Section 6(d), any Underwriters of
Registrable Securities registered under a Registration Statement, their officers
and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters on substantially
the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Holders provided in this
Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting
agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(k) hereof.

                                     - 13 -
<Page>

     (b)  Each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i)
the Issuer, (ii) each of its directors, (iii) each of its officers who signs
such Registration Statement and (iv) each person who controls the Issuer within
the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Issuer to such Holder, but only with reference to
written information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Issuer
by such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the
foregoing indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
foregoing obligations of any such Holder shall not exceed the amount of proceeds
received by such Holder for the sale of the relevant Registrable Securities
pursuant to the relevant Registration Statement.

     (c)  Promptly after receipt by any person in respect of which indemnity may
be sought pursuant to this Section 6 (such person, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), of
notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding or governmental
investigation or proceeding, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made under this Section 6, notify the party against whom such
indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i)
will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and
to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results
in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses
and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation
provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled
to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying
party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which
indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not
thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified
party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to
represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the
indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
separate counsel (and local counsel) only in the event that (i) the use of
counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party
would, in the opinion of counsel for the indemnified party, present such counsel
with a potential or actual conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential
defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed
counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party
within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv)
the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will
not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending
or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of each

                                     - 14 -
<Page>

indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or
proceeding and does not include any non-monetary terms of settlement relating to
the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but in the event of such consent,
or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall
indemnify and hold harmless any such indemnified parties from and against any
loss, claim, damage or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

     (d)  In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation
to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending same) (collectively "LOSSES") to which such
indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and
such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Registration Statement which
resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other
hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. When determining
such relative benefits, with respect to any Holder, the benefits shall be the
amount of proceeds received by such Holder for the relevant Registrable
Securities pursuant to the relevant Registration Statement and, with respect to
the Issuer, the benefits shall be the benefits to the Issuer of the transactions
contemplated by the Exchange Offer, including the restructuring described in the
Exchange Offer. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Act) with respect to statements in a Registration Statement shall be
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls a
Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each
director, officer, manager, member, affiliate, partner, employee and agent of
such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each
person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the
Exchange Act, each officer of the Issuer who shall have signed the Registration
Statement and each director of the Issuer shall have the same rights to
contribution as the Issuer, subject in each case to the applicable terms and
conditions of this paragraph (d).

     (e)  The provisions of this Section 6 will remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any underwriting agreement or
investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Issuer or any other
indemnified party referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive the sale,
transfer and successive resales of the Registrable Securities.

     (f)  Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an
indemnified party is entitled pursuant to Section 6 shall be paid by the
indemnifying party promptly upon request as such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses are incurred.

     7.   LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. The Issuer and Jefferies, on behalf of the
Holders, agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the Issuer fails to
fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it would
not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision.
Accordingly, the Issuer agrees that if (a) it fails to file any Registration
Statement as required by Section 2 or Section 3 of this Agreement on or before
the date specified for such filing, (b) any Registration Statement is not
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to 105 days after the Closing
Date, or (c) any Registration Statement is declared effective but thereafter
ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of the Registrable
Securities during the periods specified in Section 3 of this Agreement, other
than during a Black Out Period and except as a result of the occurrence of any
event of the kind described in Section 4(c)(2) hereof (each such event referred
to in clauses (a) through (c) above a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), then the interest
rate on either the New Notes or Series B Notes, as applicable, with respect to
the first 90 day period immediately following the occurrence of such
Registration Default will increase ("LIQUIDATED DAMAGES") by 3.5% per annum and
will increase by an additional 0.5% per annum with respect to each subsequent 30
day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum per
annum interest rate on either the New Notes or Series B Notes, as applicable of
18% with respect to all Registration Defaults. All accrued Liquidated Damages
will be paid by the Issuer in the same manner and at the same time as payments
of interest on the Secured Notes. Following the cure of all Registration
Defaults, the accrual of Liquidated Damages will cease.

     8.   MISCELLANEOUS.

     (a)  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement, including
the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, qualified, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof

consent of (i) the Issuer and (ii) the Holders of not less than a majority in

Holder adversely effected by any such Amendment.

Guarantor shall be released from its obligations hereunder.
