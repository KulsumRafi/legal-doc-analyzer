A.   The Company issued to the Holder a Promissory Note (the "Note") in the
     principal amount of $200,000 dated as of October 19, 2001;

     Note have been amended; and

C.   The Holder and the Company now desire to amend the Loan Extension to
     provide for the extension of additional credit under the Note in the
     aggregate principal amount of $25,000 (the "Additional Credit Amount"); and

D.   The Holder and the Company acknowledge that the outstanding principal
     amount under the Note as of January 31, 2003 after giving effect to this
     Amendment is $225,000.

                                    AGREEMENT

     In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises contained herein,

     entirety as follows:

     "1. Section 1 of the Note is hereby amended to read in its entirety as
     follows:

     "1. Conversion. The holder of this Note (the "Holder") is entitled, at its
     option, on the Maturity Date to notify the Company to convert up to fifty
     percent (50%) of the outstanding principal amount of this Note into options
     to purchase fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.0001
     par value, of the Company ("Common Stock"), at the initial price of $.20
     per share of Common Stock (the "Conversion Price"). The Conversion Price
     shall be subject to adjustment as specified in Section 5 hereof. Conversion
     of this Note shall be effected by surrender of this Note to the Company at
     its address specified below (or such other address as the Company shall
     have given written notice to the Holder hereof), together with a request
     that this Note be converted to options to purchase Common Stock as
     specified herein.""

2.   A new paragraph shall be added to the Loan Extension Agreement to read in
     its entirety as follows:

     "7.  Principal Amount. As of January 31, 2003, the principal amount
          outstanding under the Note shall be increased by $25,000 and all
          references to outstanding principal contained in the Note shall hereby
          be changed to "$225,000" (which represents the aggregate principal
          amount outstanding under the Note as of January 31, 2003).
          Notwithstanding the extension of the Additional Credit Amount,
          interest shall not accrue against the Additional Credit Amount prior
          to February 1, 2003; following which date interest shall accrue as
          provided in the Note on the aggregate principal amount of $225,000."

3.   Wire Transfer of Funds. Holder hereby agrees to wire transfer the
     Additional Credit Amount as follows:

     full force and effect.
