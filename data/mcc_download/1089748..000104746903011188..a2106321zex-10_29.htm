<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties hereto have previously entered into Amended and Restated Pooling Agreement, dated as of June&nbsp;26, 2001 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Pooling

Trustee with the written consent of the Funding Agent and without the consent of any Holder under certain circumstances; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

respectively. The term "Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by the Funding Agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York
