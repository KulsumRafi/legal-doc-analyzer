                                       I.

                                  INTRODUCTION

     This First Amended Disclosure Statement amends and restates in its entirety
that certain  Disclosure  Statement relating to Joint Plan of Liquidation of the
Debtors under Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  dated November 22, 2002, (as
amended,  supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Disclosure Statement").  This
Disclosure  Statement  has been prepared by MSCP  Holdings,  Inc.,  ("MSCP"),  a
Delaware  corporation  and its  debtor  affiliates:  MedicaLogic/Medscape,  Inc.
("MedicaLogic/Medscape"),    MedicaLogic    Enterprises,    Inc.   ("MedicaLogic
Enterprises"),  MedicaLogic Pennsylvania,  L.L.C. ("MedicaLogic  Pennsylvania"),
MedicaLogic of Texas, Inc.  ("MedicaLogic  Texas,  Inc.") and MedicaLogic Texas,
L.P. ("MedicaLogic Texas, LP"),  (collectively,  the "Debtors").  On January 24,
2002 (the  "Petition  Date"),  the Debtors  each filed a voluntary  petition for
relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy  Code and are debtors in possession in
the  above-captioned  jointly  administered  chapter 11 cases (the  "Chapter  11
Cases").  The Debtors have filed in their Chapter 11 Cases a First Amended Joint
Plan of Liquidation Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan"), a copy
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

     Unless otherwise  defined in this Disclosure  Statement,  capitalized terms
used  herein  will have the same  meanings  given to them in the  Plan.  If such
capitalized  terms  are not  defined  in the Plan,  they will have the  meanings
assigned to them by the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules.

     In brief, the Plan provides for the  distribution of the Debtors'  estates,
which  consists  primarily of proceeds  from asset sales.  The proceeds  will be
distributed  through a trust to Creditors and Interest  holders  pursuant to the
priorities  set forth in the Bankruptcy  Code.  The Plan does not  substantively
consolidate the Debtors,  therefore, the proceeds of a particular Debtor will be
distributed to the Creditors and Interest Holders of that Debtor. An overview of
the Plan is provided in Section III of this Disclosure  Statement  ("OVERVIEW OF
THE PLAN") and a more detailed  description  of some of the major  provisions of
the Plan is contained in Section VI of this Disclosure  Statement  ("DESCRIPTION
OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION").

     THE DEBTORS  BELIEVE THAT THE PLAN IS IN THE BEST  INTERESTS OF THE DEBTORS
AND THEIR CREDITORS AND INTEREST HOLDERS. ALL CREDITORS AND INTEREST HOLDERS ARE
URGED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN BY NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M.  EASTERN  STANDARD
TIME ON FEBRUARY 24, 2003 (THE "VOTING DEADLINE").

     FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH IN THE ATTACHED  EXHIBIT E, THE EQUITY  COMMITTEE
ALSO SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED PLAN AND URGES HOLDERS OF ALLOWED EQUITY INTERESTS TO
VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN AND TO SUPPORT ITS CONFIRMATION.

                                       II.

                           NOTICE TO HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
                                  AND INTERESTS

     A. Purpose of Disclosure Statement

     This Disclosure  Statement provides information with respect to the Debtors
and the Plan and seeks to assist you,  as a Creditor  whose Claim is impaired or
as an Interest  holder  whose  Interest is impaired  under the Plan,  to make an
informed  decision in exercising  your right to accept or reject the Plan.  This
Disclosure  Statement also sets forth  information  regarding the history of the
Debtors,  their businesses,  the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the asset sales
and the Plan. Finally, this Disclosure Statement enables the Bankruptcy Court to
determine  whether the Plan  complies  with the  provisions of chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code and should be confirmed.

     Each Creditor and interest  holder should read this  Disclosure  Statement,
the Plan and the  exhibits  in their  entirety  before  voting on the  Plan.  No
solicitation of votes on the Plan may be made except pursuant to this Disclosure
Statement.  No person has been authorized to use any information  concerning the
Debtors or their  businesses  other  than this  information  for the  purpose of
solicitation.  For  convenience,  the terms of the Plan are  summarized  in this
Disclosure  Statement.  However, all summaries are qualified by the Plan itself,
which is controlling in the event of any inconsistency.

     For your  convenience,  copies of the  following  documents are attached to
this Disclosure Statement (the "Exhibits"):

o    The Plan (Exhibit A);

o    Order of the Bankruptcy Court, dated December 20, 2002 (the "Disclosure
     Statement Order"), which, among other things, approves the Disclosure
     Statement and establishes certain procedures for the solicitation and
     tabulation of votes to accept or reject the Plan (Exhibit B);

o    MedicaLogic/Medscape, Inc. et al. Liquidation Analysis (Exhibit C);

o    Chart of Corporate Structure of the Debtors (Exhibit D), and

o    A letter from the Equity Committee recommending acceptance of the Plan
    (Exhibit E).


     On December 20,  2002,  after notice and a hearing,  the  Bankruptcy  Court
entered an order pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy  Code approving this
Disclosure  Statement,  including the Exhibits,  as containing  information of a
kind, and in sufficient  detail,  adequate to enable a hypothetical,  reasonable
investor typical of the solicited  classes of Claims or Interests of the Debtors
to make an informed  judgment with respect to the acceptance or rejection of the
Plan.

<PAGE>

     APPROVAL OF THIS  DISCLOSURE  STATEMENT  BY THE  BANKRUPTCY  COURT IS NOT A
DETERMINATION BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT OF THE FAIRNESS OR MERITS OF THE PLAN.

     The statements  contained in this  Disclosure  Statement are made as of the
date on the front  cover  unless  otherwise  specified,  and the  statements  on
Exhibits  are  made  as of the  date  thereof.  Neither  the  delivery  of  this
Disclosure  Statement  nor any  exchange  of rights made in  connection  with it
shall, under any circumstances, imply that there has been no change in the facts
since that date. The information contained in this Disclosure Statement has been
prepared by the Debtors in good faith,  based on  information  available  to the
Debtors.

     THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS DISCLOSURE  STATEMENT CONCERNING THE PLAN
HAS NOT  BEEN  SUBJECT  TO AN  AUDIT.  THIS  DISCLOSURE  STATEMENT  HAS NOT BEEN
APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION,  NOR HAS THE
COMMISSION  PASSED UPON THE  ACCURACY OR  ADEQUACY OF THE  STATEMENTS  CONTAINED
HEREIN.

     All financial information contained herein was compiled from the records of
the Debtors.  The Debtors believe that this Disclosure  Statement  complies with
the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code.


     B. Voting on the Plan

     After carefully reviewing this Disclosure Statement, including the attached
Exhibits,  please indicate your acceptance or rejection of the Plan by voting in
favor of, or against,  the Plan on the enclosed  ballot and return the ballot in
the envelope provided.  Although the Plan is one document, it is structured as a
separate plan of liquidation for each of the Debtors.  You may vote to accept or
reject only the Plan of the Debtor or Debtors  against which you have a Claim or
in which you have an Interest. You may receive a ballot with respect to the Plan
of one or more of the  Debtors.  Mark and return only the ballot or ballots with
respect to the Debtors in which you hold a Claim or Interest. In addition,  your
Claims or Interests may be classified in multiple classes.

     DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS  REGARDING VOTING,  INCLUDING THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
OF THE  PERSONS  YOU MAY  CONTACT  IF YOU HAVE  QUESTIONS  REGARDING  THE VOTING
PROCEDURES,  ARE INCLUDED IN SECTION VII OF THIS DISCLOSURE  STATEMENT  ("VOTING
PROCEDURES"). PLEASE REVIEW THE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH IN THAT SECTION.

     It is important that Creditors and Interest holders exercise their right to
vote to accept or reject  the Plan.  Even if you do not vote to accept the Plan,
you may be bound by the Plan,  if it is  accepted  by the  requisite  holders of
Claims and Interests.

     Pursuant to section 1126 of the Bankruptcy  Code, the only parties entitled
to vote to accept or reject a plan are the  members of classes  whose  claims or
interests are impaired under a plan and who receive or retain property under the
plan.  A class is  impaired  unless  that  class has its  legal,  equitable  and
contractual rights left unaltered by the proposed treatment under the Plan.

     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  only holders of Allowed Claims or Allowed
Interests  in the Voting  Classes are  entitled to vote on the Plan.  A Claim or
Interest as to which a dispute  exists is not Allowed,  and is thus not entitled
to vote  unless and until  either:  (i) the dispute is  determined,  resolved or
adjudicated in the Bankruptcy  Court or another court of competent  jurisdiction
or pursuant to agreement  with the Debtors so as to determine  that the Claimant
or Interest Holder has an Allowed Claim or Allowed  Interest,  respectively,  or
(ii) the Bankruptcy  Court deems the disputed Claim or Interest to be an Allowed
Claim or Allowed Interest on a provisional  basis, for purposes of voting on the
Plan.  Therefore,  even if there  is a  ballot  enclosed  with  this  Disclosure
Statement,  the votes  cast by the  holders of Claims or  Interests  that are in
dispute as of the Voting  Deadline  will not be  counted  unless the  Bankruptcy
Court  provisionally  allows those Claims or Interests for purposes of voting on
the Plan. If your Claim or Interest is disputed, it is your obligation to obtain
an order provisionally allowing your Claim or Interest for voting purposes.

     If the  holder of an  Allowed  Unsecured  Claim in an amount  greater  than
$5,000 makes an election to reduce the Allowed amount of such Claim to an amount
equal to or less than $5,000, such Claim shall be treated as a Convenience Claim
for such  purposes.  A holder of an  Allowed  Unsecured  Claim  who  makes  this
election  shall be deemed to have  accepted  the Plan by such  election and such
election shall be irrevocable.

     Holders of Claims and Interests in the voting  classes may vote on the Plan
only if they are holders as of the Voting Record Date.  The "Voting Record Date"
is December 20, 2002 [the date of the Disclosure Statement hearing].

                              OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN

     The  following  is a brief  overview of the  provisions  of the Plan.  This
overview is  intended  as a summary  only and is  qualified  in its  entirety by
reference to the  provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is attached  hereto as
Exhibit  A,  which  will be  supplemented  by the  Plan  Supplement.  For a more
detailed  description of the terms and provisions of the Plan, see Section VI of
this Disclosure Statement  ("DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION").  For more
information concerning the Plan, please read the Plan in its entirety.

     A. In General

     The Plan consists of separate plans of  reorganization  for each of the six
Debtors.  Because the Debtors have sold  substantially all of their assets,  the
purpose of the Plan is to distribute the proceeds of the Debtors'  assets to the
holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests of each of the Debtors. The Plan
contemplates the implementation of a liquidating Trust as the vehicle from which
distributions  to holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests will be made.
On the  Effective  Date,  the Trust  shall be  established  as a  grantor  trust
pursuant to the Trust Agreement for the purposes of acquiring title to the Trust
Property,  assuming all of the  liabilities of the Debtors and the Estates,  and
liquidating  and  distributing  the Trust  Property for the benefit of the Trust
Beneficiaries.  The Trust Property will be  distributed  in accordance  with the
provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement as promptly and efficiently as is
practicable.  Upon the Effective Date,  title to the Assets shall  automatically
vest in the Trust and shall thereupon  become Trust Property,  free and clear of
all Claims and Interests, except as specifically provided in the Plan. The Trust
shall be deemed the successor to the Debtors and automatically  substituted as a
party  to  all  pending  contested  matters,   adversary  proceedings,   claims,
administrative  proceedings and lawsuits, both within and outside the Bankruptcy
Court,  involving  the Assets or matters  relating to the Trust,  including  the
resolution of Disputed Claims.

         On or prior to the Confirmation Date, the Debtors shall designate the
person or entity who is to serve as Trustee (after consultation with the Equity
Committee). The person or entity

<PAGE>

     designated  shall be appointed  Trustee of the Trust on the Effective Date.
The Trustee shall be authorized and empowered to preserve,  protect and maximize
the value of the Trust Property,  sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust Property
as promptly and efficiently as is reasonably possible, and distribute all income
and proceeds from the Trust  Property in  accordance  with the terms of the Plan
and the Trust Agreement. Upon the Effective Date, a Trust Committee,  consisting
of not more than three (3) members shall be appointed. The Trust Committee shall
oversee,  on an advisory basis, the post-Effective  Date activities of the Trust
and the  Trustee  in  accordance  with the  terms  of the  Trust  Agreement.  In
addition,  on the Effective Date, the positions of officers and directors of the
Debtors shall be eliminated, therefore, the persons then acting as directors and
officers of the Debtors shall be terminated.

     B. Estimated Funds Available to Pay the Claims of Creditors

     1. Assets of the Debtors

     On October 31, 2002, the Debtors had  approximately $42 million in cash and
cash equivalents  ("Cash on Hand") before any deductions or reserves required to
fund the continuing  administration  of the Debtors'  estates or  Administrative
Claims and Other  Priority  Claims under the Plan. In addition,  the Debtors are
not  expected  to have  any  material  uncollected  accounts  receivable  on the
Effective Date.

     Escrow   Accounts:   In  addition  to  Cash  on  Hand,   the  Debtors  have
approximately $3.0 million held in three separate escrow accounts related to the
Debtors' sale of three business  segments as of October 31, 2002:  Transcription
Services; Internet Portals; and Digital Health Records.

     (a)  Transcription  Services.  On August 17,  2001,  the Debtors sold their
Transcription  Services  business to TEM  Holdings,  LLC ("TEM  Holdings"),  for
approximately  $6.0  million in cash.  The  Debtors  received  sale  proceeds of
approximately  $5.4  million.  The  remaining  sales  proceeds of  approximately
$250,000 are being held in an escrow account  pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement  dated  August 17,  2001.  TEM  Holdings  has  asserted a claim to the
remaining escrow funds. The Debtors dispute TEM Holdings' claim. Therefore,  the
remaining  escrowed sales proceeds will not be distributed  until the dispute is
resolved.

     (b) Internet Portals. On December 26, 2001, the Debtors sold their Internet
Portals business to WebMD Corporation for  approximately  $10.0 million in cash.
Upon the sale to WebMD, the Debtors received sale proceeds of approximately $7.5
million  (which is net of  adjustments of  approximately  $1,000,000),  with the
remaining sales proceeds of approximately $1.5 million held in an escrow account
for up to one year  pursuant  to the  terms of an escrow  agreement  dated as of
December 26, 2001. As of September 30, 2002,  approximately  $750,000 remains in
an escrow account.  WebMD believes that the Debtors' interest in any funds being
held in escrow are strictly  limited to the property rights the Debtors may have
as set forth in the Escrow Agreement dated December 26, 2001 between the Debtors
and WebMD. Further, WebMD has asserted various claims against the Debtors which,
if successful,  could result in the funds  currently being held in the escrow to
be paid to WebMD.  In addition,  WebMD filed proofs of claim against the Debtors
in a liquidated amount of approximately  $49,000,  and additional  unliquidated,
contingent claims. The Debtors believe that WebMD's claims to the escrowed funds
are not valid and the  Debtors  have filed an  objection  to  WebMD's  proofs of
claim.  In addition,  even in the event that WebMD prevails on its claims to the
escrowed  funds,  it

<PAGE>

     will have no bearing on  feasibility  of the Plan  because the Debtors have
sufficient funds for appropriate reserves for the wind-up of the Debtors and the
expenses  of the Trust,  and no class of Claims or  Interests  will  receive any
distribution unless and until all Allowed Claims and Interests have been paid in
full,  and a reserve  established  in the full amount of all Disputed  Claims or
Interests. Thus, the Debtors believe that the Plan complies with the feasibility
standard for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code, and that the escrowed funds
relating to the Internet  Portals sale to WebMD have no affect on feasibility of
the Plan.

     (c) Digital Health  Records.  As more fully described  herein,  the Debtors
sold their DHR business  segment to GE Medical Systems for  approximately  $35.3
million,  in cash,  on March 25, 2002.  The Debtors  received  sale  proceeds of
approximately $33.3 million.  The remaining sales proceeds of approximately $2.0
million  are  currently  being held in an escrow  account  for up to nine months
pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement dated as of March 25, 2002.

     With  respect to non-cash  assets,  MedicaLogic/Medscape  holds  promissory
notes (the  "Notes")  for  shares of  restricted  stock of  MedicaLogic/Medscape
purchased  by  certain  individuals,  most of whom are former  employees  of the
Debtors,   (the  "Restricted  Stock  Holders")  which  have  a  face  amount  of
approximately $10 million of principal.  The Notes are generally recourse to the
issuers,  are not secured,  accrue  interest at 6% per year,  and are payable in
full up to 10 years from the date issued.  A majority of the Notes are currently
in default, and the Debtors have filed an action in the Bankruptcy Court seeking
to enforce the Notes according to their terms.

     Certain of the  Restricted  Stock Holders filed proofs of claim against the
Debtors for claims  relating  to their  respective  Notes,  and at least some of
these  claimants  have denied that they have  obligations  under such Notes.  On
November 6, 2002,  MedicaLogic/Medscape commenced an adversary proceeding in the
Chapter 11 Cases against  substantially  all of the Restricted  Stock Holders on
account of their obligations under the Notes seeking both declaratory relief and
damages  (the "Note  Litigation").(1)  The  Debtors  are still in the process of
trying to market the promissory notes.

     Equity  Investments:  Prior to the merger  between  MedicaLogic,  Inc.  and
Medscape,  Inc., and pursuant to a Preferred Share Purchase Agreement dated June
10, 1999  between  Medscape,  Inc.  and  Softwatch  Ltd.  (an Israeli  company),
Medscape,  Inc.  purchased  1,040,170  shares of Series A Convertible  Preferred
Stock at a purchase price of $2.8841 per share ($2,999,954 in the aggregate). In
February 2000,  Softwatch issued shares of Series B Convertible  Preferred Stock
and Series C  Convertible  Preferred  Stock.  In May of 2000,  Softwatch  issued
shares of Series D Convertible  Preferred Stock. Medscape did not participate as
a buyer in any of these  series.  Between  the Series A closing and the Series B
and Series C closing,  Softwatch  effected a 3 for 1 stock split with the result
that the Debtors' total number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
increased to 3,120,510 and its conversion price decreased to $.9614. The Debtors
own  7.82%  fully  diluted  (assuming  exercise  of all  options)  and  9.59% of
outstanding  shares.  In  December  of 1999,  as a  result  of a  spin-off  from
Softwatch,  the Debtors received 1,040,170 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of
Dietwatch,  Inc. The Debtors currently own 3.51% in

(1) As of the date  hereof,  the  Debtors  have not yet  commenced  an action
against  Frank J. Spina on account of his Note,  but expect to do so in the near
future.




<PAGE>

     Dietwatch,  Inc. However,  the current value of the Debtors'  investment in
Softwatch and Dietwatch is unclear as both entities are privately held and there
is  no  readily  determinable  market  price.  The  Debtors  are  exploring  the
possibility  of a sale of these equity  interests,  but there are no  assurances
that the Debtors will realize any value from such equity interests.

     Claims Against Third Parties: MedicaLogic/Medscape, Inc. previously entered
into a Strategic  Alliance,  Services and Development  Agreement,  dated June 6,
2000 with Lifechart.com,  Inc. ("Lifechart").  Lifechart has filed an Assignment
for the Benefit of  Creditors  under  California  law  ("ABC").  Lifechart  owes
MedicaLogic/Medscape,   Inc.   $1,075,000  under  the  parties'   agreement  and
MedicaLogic/Medscape,  Inc.  has filed a claim for this  amount in the ABC,  but
there are no assurances that the Debtors will realize any value from such claim.

     2. Claims Resolution

     As of the date hereof, the Debtors scheduled  approximately $1.2 million in
undisputed,  non-contingent,  and liquidated claims in their Schedules of Assets
and Liabilities filed with the Court, and have received in excess of two hundred
fifty (250) proofs of claim which assert, in the aggregate,  approximately  $221
million in claims  against the Debtors,  in addition to a number of claims filed
in unliquidated  amounts. The Debtors have filed objections to substantially all
of the filed claims that were not scheduled as  undisputed,  non-contingent  and
liquidated.  Set forth below is a summary of the claims  received by the Debtors
to date, along with the Debtors' preliminary views of the claims.

     Although the Debtors'  remaining  employees have been working diligently on
the claims  resolution  process,  they have not yet  completed  their review and
evaluation  of the claims.  In addition,  the Debtors are  continuing to work to
resolve various claims through the settlement  process and analyze the claims in
order to ascertain objections to be made to the claims.  Therefore,  the amounts
listed herein are estimates for  informational  purposes  only,  and will likely
change as the claims  resolution  process moves forward.  These estimates assume
that claims  filed in  unliquidated  amounts will not be allowed in any material
amounts. In addition,  please note that these estimates do not take into account
the  availability  of any of the  Assets  of the  Debtors  described  above  for
distribution to creditors.

     Secured  Claims:  The  Debtors  have  Scheduled  approximately  $850,000 in
undisputed,   non-contingent,   and  liquidated  Secured  Claims.  In  addition,
approximately  $112,000 in alleged  Secured  Claims have been filed  against the
Debtors.  Almost all of the filed  Secured  Claims have been  asserted by Taxing
Authorities  for, among other things,  the alleged failure of the Debtors to pay
franchise,   ad  valorem,   and  sales  and  use  taxes.   The  Debtors  dispute
substantially  all of the filed  Secured  Claims  and have filed  objections  to
substantially  all of these claims,  however,  at this time,  the Debtors cannot
predict  with  certainty  the amount of such  claims  that will  become  Allowed
Claims.

     Administrative  and Priority Tax Claims:  In addition to the Secured Claims
set forth above, various Taxing Authorities have asserted approximately $140,000
in  Administrative  Tax Claims and  approximately  $1.5  million in Priority Tax
Claims  against the Debtors.  These  claims are based  primarily on the Debtors'
alleged  failure  to pay  franchise,  corporate,  and sales and use  taxes.  The
Debtors dispute  substantially all of the Administrative and Priority Tax Claims
and have filed objections to substantially all of these claims, however, at this
time,  the Debtors  cannot predict with certainty the amount of such claims that
will become Allowed Claims.

         Other Priority Claims: Approximately $120,000 in alleged Other Priority
Claims have been filed against the Debtors. Most of these claims have been
asserted by former customers of the Debtors. The Debtors dispute substantially
all of the Other Priority Claims and have filed objections

<PAGE>

     to substantially  all of these claims,  however,  at this time, the Debtors
cannot predict with certainty the amount of such claims that will become Allowed
Claims.

     General  Administrative  Claims:  Approximately $309,000 in alleged General
Administrative  Claims have been filed  against the  Debtors.  These claims have
been filed by former customers of the Debtors and insurance  companies with whom
the Debtors had prepetition  policies.  The Debtors dispute substantially all of
the General Administrative Claims and have filed objections to substantially all
of these  claims,  however,  at this  time,  the  Debtors  cannot  predict  with
certainty the amount of such claims that will become Allowed Claims.

     Unsecured  Claims:  The Debtors have  Scheduled  approximately  $340,000 in
undisputed,  non-contingent,  and  liquidated  Unsecured  Claims.  In  addition,
approximately  $219  million in  Unsecured  Claims  have been filed  against the
Debtors. As of the date hereof, approximately $59 million of the filed Unsecured
Claims have been withdrawn as a result of settlements and negotiations  with the
Debtors.  With respect to the  remaining  filed  Unsecured  Claims,  the Debtors
dispute substantially all of them and have filed objections to substantially all
of these claims on several  non-substantive  and substantive bases.  However, at
this time,  the Debtors  cannot predict with certainty the amount of such claims
that will become Allowed Claims.

     Securities   Litigation   Claims:   Unsecured   Claims  in  the  amount  of
approximately  $96.6 million were filed by plaintiffs to that certain securities
litigation  currently  entitled In re MedicaLogic,  Inc. Initial Public Offering
Securities  Litigation  which is pending in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. A more detailed description of the securities
litigation is set forth in the Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov, the
official  website for the SEC. The Debtors filed an objection to the  Securities
Litigation  Claims on numerous  grounds.  The Debtors also believe that any such
claims that become Allowed Claims should be subordinated under section 510(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code to the claims of general  unsecured  creditors and preferred
equity interests and should have the same priority as common stockholder claims.
However, if the Securities  Litigation Claims are not subordinated under section
510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, such claims could significantly reduce recoveries
to unsecured creditors.

     Restricted Stock Holder Claims:  As mentioned  above,  MedicaLogic/Medscape
commenced the Note Litigation  against the Restricted Stock Holders in an effort
to recover amounts due and owing under the Notes.  Approximately  $62 million in
Unsecured Claims have been filed against the Debtors by Restricted Stock Holders
on  account  of their  respective  Notes.  The  Debtors  filed an  objection  to
approximately  $50 million of the  Restricted  Stock  Holder  Claims as asserted
against  the wrong  Debtor  entity  and/or are  duplicative  of claims  asserted
against other  Debtors.  With respect to the remaining  Restricted  Stock Holder
Claims,  the Debtors plan to file  objections to the these  claims.  The Debtors
also  believe  that any  such  claims  that  become  Allowed  Claims  should  be
subordinated  under  section  510(b)  of the  Bankruptcy  Code to the  claims of
general  unsecured  creditors  and  should  have the  same  priority  as  common
stockholder  claims.  However,  if the  Restricted  Stock Holder  Claims are not
subordinated  under section  510(b) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  such claims could
significantly reduce recoveries to creditors.

         Chapter 11 Administrative Costs: In addition to prepetition
liabilities, the Debtors are responsible for paying the expenses of
administering their Chapter 11 Cases. Such administrative expenses include, but
are not limited to, fees and expenses of the Debtors' and the Equity Committee's
professionals, and other expenses incurred by the Debtors during the Chapter 11
Cases that are not paid in the ordinary course of business. The Debtors estimate
that they will incur administrative expenses of approximately $1,000,000 per
month through the Effective Date,

<PAGE>

although the Debtors  cannot predict with certainty at this time the amount of
expenses they will actually incur.

     Wind-down  and Trust  Expenses:  Pursuant to the Plan,  Wind-down and Trust
Expense  Reserves will be funded to provide for the payment of expenses  related
to the dissolution of the Debtors and expenses of the Trust.  Specifically,  the
Debtors  will incur  costs  necessary  to  wind-down  their  affairs,  including
salaries and retention  bonuses for Key Employees,  the storage of records,  and
the dissolution of the corporate Debtor entities  pursuant to applicable law, to
the extent not paid on the  Effective  Date.  With  respect to  expenses  of the
Trust,  the  Debtors  will set aside  sufficient  reserves  to pay costs,  fees,
expenses,  debts,  charges,  liabilities  and  obligations  with  respect to the
Debtors  to the  extent not paid  prior to the  Effective  Date,  and the Trust,
including,  without limitation,  (i) all costs and expenses,  including those of
professionals  retained by the Trustee,  incurred or  reasonably  expected to be
incurred,  in  connection  with  any  litigation,  (ii)  Trustee's  compensation
pursuant  to the Trust  Agreement,  (iii) all costs  and  expenses  incurred  in
connection with indemnifying the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement and any
amounts necessary to pay postpetition  officers' and directors'  liabilities and
indemnification  claims  that arose  postpetition,  (iv) all fees and  expenses,
including those of professionals and other agents and employees  retained by the
Trustee  incurred in connection with the performance of the Trustee's duties and
obligations,  including  without  limitation,  fees incurred in connection  with
holding,  collecting  upon,  liquidating  or  otherwise  disposing  of the Trust
Property, secretarial and office expenses, all applicable taxes and all expenses
of  effectuating  Distributions  under  the  Plan,  (v) all fees  and  expenses,
including those of professionals and other agents and employees  retained by the
Trustee  incurred in connection with the winding up of the Trust,  the rendering
of  accountings  and the storage  and  disposition  of books,  records and files
pursuant to the Trust Agreement, and (vi) all reasonable, documented expenses of
the  Trust  Committee  appointed  pursuant  to the  Trust  Agreement,  including
professional fees.

     Debtors' Belief Regarding  Distributions:  The Debtors believe that if they
are successful in obtaining one or more orders from the  Bankruptcy  Court prior
to the Effective Date to subordinate  the Securities  Litigation  Claims and the
Restricted  Stock Holder Claims,  that there will be sufficient  funds to pay in
full  all  Allowed  Secured  Claims,  Allowed  Other  Priority  Claims,  Allowed
Unsecured  Claims and to pay a  substantial  recovery  to the  Preferred  Equity
Interests on or shortly after the Effective  Date.  However,  obtaining  such an
order will depend on certain  elements  not within the  control of the  Debtors,
including the schedule of the Bankruptcy  Court,  and there is no assurance that
the Debtors will be successful in obtaining such an order prior to the Effective
Date.

     C. Classification and Treatment of Claims and Interests Under the Plan

     The following tables briefly summarize the  classification and treatment of
Claims and Interests  under the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code sets forth a "priority
structure"  pursuant to which claims are ranked and distributions made according
to such rank. In general, the Bankruptcy Code's priority structure provides that
secured claims are satisfied by the collateral  securing such claims or proceeds
of such  collateral.  Unsecured  claims are paid from the  general  funds of the
estate and are divided into the following priority  categories:  (i) expenses of
administering  the  estate,   (ii)  business  expenses  in  the  gap  period  in
involuntary cases, (iii) wages and salaries,  (iv) employee benefits,  (v) grain
producers and fishermen (claims against processor or storehouse),  (vi) deposits
for consumer  goods or services,  (vii)  alimony,  maintenance or child support,
(viii)  various  taxes,  and  (ix)  claims  arising  out of  federal  depository
insurance. The foregoing "priority" unsecured claims must be paid before general
unsecured claims are entitled to any share in the estate.

<PAGE>

     In   accordance   with  section   1123(a)(1)   of  the   Bankruptcy   Code,
Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims of the kinds specified in sections
507(a)(1) and  507(a)(8),  respectively,  of the  Bankruptcy  Code have not been
classified under the Plan. Where the Plan specifies that  postpetition  interest
shall be paid with respect to any Claim,  such  interest  shall be calculated as
simple interest at the federal judgment rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Administrative Claims

     Each holder of an Allowed  Administrative  Claim  against any Debtor (other

Administrative  Claim  becomes  an  Allowed  Administrative  Claim  (or as  soon
thereafter as practicable), or (b) such other treatment as to which the relevant
Debtor and such  Claim  holder  shall have  agreed  upon in  writing,  provided,
however,  that an  Administrative  Claim  representing  an undisputed  liability
incurred after the Petition Date in the ordinary course of business, may be paid
at the  option of the  Debtors  or the  Trustee  when such  Claim  becomes  due.
Administrative  Claims of the United  States  Trustee  for fees  pursuant  to 28
U.S.C.ss.  1930(a)(6)  shall be paid in Cash in accordance  with the  applicable
schedule for payment of such fees.

     Unless otherwise provided in an Order regarding the payment of professional

under sections 327, 328, 330, 331, 503(b) and 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall
file a final application for allowance of compensation for services rendered and
reimbursement  of expenses  incurred  through the  Effective  Date no later than
sixty (60) days after the Effective  Date (except to the extent that such Person
is an Ordinary  Course  Professional,  in which case the procedures set forth in
the Ordinary Course  Professional Order shall be followed).  Objections to final
applications for

<PAGE>

     payment of  Professional  Fees must be filed no later than ninety (90) days
after the  Effective  Date.  To the extent  that such an award is granted by the
Bankruptcy  Court or Allowed by the  Ordinary  Course  Professional  Order,  the
requesting Person shall receive: (a) payment on the tenth Business Day following
the entry of the Order  approving the Allowed  Administrative  Claim (or as soon
thereafter as  practicable)  of Cash in an amount equal to the amount Allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court or Ordinary Course  Professional Order, (b) payment on such
other  terms  as may be  mutually  agreed  upon  by the  holder  of the  Allowed
Administrative Claim and the applicable Debtor or (c) payment in accordance with
the  terms  of any  relevant  administrative  procedures  order  entered  by the
Bankruptcy Court.

     Priority Tax Claims

     Each  holder of an Allowed  Priority  Tax Claim  against  any Debtor  shall
receive,  at the sole option of the relevant  Debtor:  (a) payment in Cash in an
amount  equal to such  Allowed  Priority  Tax  Claim on the tenth  Business  Day
following  the later of (i) the  Effective  Date, or (ii) the date on which such
Priority Tax Claim becomes an Allowed  Priority Tax Claim (or as soon thereafter
as practicable);  provided that the Debtors have Cash in an amount sufficient to
pay all Allowed Priority Tax Claims as provided herein,  and the Priority Claims
Reserve contains an amount in Cash equal to the sum of all Disputed Priority Tax
Claims,  (b) cash  payments  over a period  not  exceeding  six years  after the
assessment  of the tax on which  such  Claim is  based  or the  duration  of the
Trust),  totaling  the  principal  amount of such  Claim  plus  simple  interest
accruing from the Effective Date,  calculated at the effective interest rate for
90-day  securities  obligations  issued by the  United  States  Treasury  on the
Effective  Date, or, if no such securities were issued on the Effective Date, on
the date of issuance immediately preceding the Effective Date; or (c) such other
treatment agreed to by the relevant Debtor and the holder of such Claim.

                        BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE DEBTORS

     A. General Background

     The Debtors  consist of a parent company,  MedicaLogic/Medscape,  its first
tier subsidiaries,  MedicaLogic Enterprises and MedicaLogic Pennsylvania,  along
with three of its direct and indirect  subsidiaries,  MSCP,  MedicaLogic  Texas,
Inc.,  and  MedicaLogic  Texas,  L.P.  For your  ease of  reference,  a Chart of
Corporate  Structure of the Debtors is annexed  hereto as Exhibit D. For general
background  regarding the Debtors,  Creditors and Equity Interest holders should
read the Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov,  the official website for
the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Form 10-K contains
information  concerning the Debtors,  their assets,  their business segments and
sales of their  business  segments  as well as  audited  consolidated  financial
statements  for the year ended  December  31, 2001 and certain  other  financial
information.

<PAGE>

     B. Supplemental or Updated Information

     1. Legal Proceedings

     Prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors were parties
to certain legal  proceedings as more fully described in the Form 10-K, which is
available  at  www.sec.gov,  the  official  website for the SEC.  Creditors  and
Interest  holders are referred to Item 3, "Legal  Proceedings," of the Form 10-K
for  information  regarding  those  legal  proceedings.  In  addition,  a former
employee of the Debtors,  Omar Amirana,  commenced an action on August 14, 2001,
in the Superior Court of the State of California,  San Francisco County entitled
Amirana v.  MedicaLogic,  Inc., et al., No. 323777.  Mr. Amirana  alleges that a
promissory  note he signed in favor of the  Debtors  in order to receive a bonus
pursuant to his stock bonus agreement is unenforceable. In this regard, he seeks
rescission  of the  promissory  note and  general,  compensatory,  special,  and
punitive damages in an undetermined  amount.  The Debtors have named Mr. Amirana
as a defendant in the Note Litigation.

     2. Taxation

     For a  discussion  of the  federal  tax  attributes  of the Debtors and the
federal tax consequences of the Plan, see Section X of this Disclosure Statement
("CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN").

     3. Equity Ownership

     Common Stock.  MedicaLogic/Medscape  is the ultimate  parent company of the
other  Debtors.  The  common  stock  of   MedicaLogic/Medscape   trades  on  the
over-the-counter  bulletin board  electronic  quotation  system under the symbol
"MDLIQ."  MedicaLogic/Medscape  no longer meets the listing  requirements of the
Nasdaq National Market System  ("NASDAQ") and was delisted from NASDAQ effective
February 15, 2002. Creditors and Equity Interest holders are referred to Item 5,
"Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related  Stockholder  Matters" of the
Form   10-K  for   information   regarding   historic   sales   prices   on  the
MedicaLogic/Medscape  common stock.  MedicaLogic/Medscape never declared or paid
any  cash   dividends   on  its  common   stock.   As  of  October   31,   2002,
MedicaLogic/Medscape  had  52,051,855  shares of common  stock  outstanding  not
including any shares issued on account of not yet exercised warrants.

     Convertible   Redeemable  Preferred  Stock.   MedicaLogic/Medscape   issued
approximately  5.9 million shares of Series 1 convertible  redeemable  preferred
stock  pursuant  to a  financing  round that  closed on  January  4,  2001.  The
preferred  stock  carries a cumulative  annual  dividend of $0.27 per share,  is
convertible  into  common  stock on a share for share basis at the option of the
investors or  automatically  if certain  conditions are met, is redeemable under
certain    circumstances,    is    entitled    to   appoint   a   director    to
MedicaLogic/Medscape's  board of directors,  and contains  approval  rights over
certain  corporate  actions.  As of October 31, 2002,  MedicaLogic/Medscape  had
5,500,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding.  In addition, as of October 31,
2002, no dividends had been declared or paid.

     Upon  liquidation  of  MedicaLogic/Medscape,   the  preferred  shareholders
receive preference in liquidation over the common shareholders.  The liquidation
value for each outstanding  share is $3 per share,  adjusted for any accrued and
unpaid stock dividends.  The preferred stock is subject to mandatory  redemption
features  under  (i) a  change  in  control  or  (ii) a  trigger  event.  In the
occurrence of either event, each preferred  shareholder has the right to require
MedicaLogic/Medscape  to purchase all or a portion of such preferred  stock, for
which funds are legally available for redemption. The per share redemption price
for each series of preferred stock is equal to its per share liquidation  value,
adjusted for any accrued and unpaid  stock  dividends.  As more fully  discussed
below,   on  March  19,  2002,  the  Bankruptcy   Court  approved  the  sale  of
substantially  all of the assets of the Debtors'  remaining DHR business segment
to GE Medical Systems Information  Technologies,  Inc. (the "DHR Sale"). The DHR
Sale closed on March 25, 2002. This transaction qualified as a change in control
under the redemption provisions of the preferred stock agreements.


<PAGE>

     Preferred  Stock  Warrants:  In January 2001,  MedicaLogic/Medscape  issued
approximately  5.9 million shares of Series 1 convertible  redeemable  preferred
stock and granted  warrants with an exercise  price of $0.01 for the purchase of
approximately 4.5 million shares of the MedicaLogic/Medscape's common stock. The
warrants are exercisable at the option of the holder for a period of five years.
As of October  31,  2002,  approximately  3.4 million of these  warrants  remain
outstanding.

     Common Stock Warrants: As a result of the merger between Medscape, Inc. and
MedicaLogic,  Inc.  in May 2000,  outstanding  warrants  to  purchase  shares of
Medscape,  Inc. common stock were converted to warrants to purchase 0.323 shares
of  MedicaLogic/Medscape  common stock. At March 31, 2002,  warrants to purchase
436,747 shares of MedicaLogic/Medscape's common stock were exercisable at $30.96
per share and  warrants to  purchase  436,747  shares of  MedicaLogic/Medscape's
common stock were  exercisable  at $10.84 per share.  These  warrants  expire in
2006. In addition,  upon the closing of the Series 1 preferred  stock  financing
round described above,  MedicaLogic/Medscape  issued additional  warrants to the
agent for the financing  with an exercise  price of $2.40 for 300,000  shares of
MedicaLogic/Medscape's  common stock. The warrants are exercisable at the option
of the holder for a period of five years.  All of these warrants are outstanding
at June 30, 2002.

     Creditors and Interest holders are referred to Item 12, "Security Ownership
of Certain  Beneficial  Owners and Management," of the Form 10-K for information
regarding the ownership of common stock and Series 1 Preferred stock as of April
11, 2001 by  MedicaLogic/Medscape's  directors,  certain executive  officers and
directors  and  executive  officers  as a group,  and each  person  known to own
beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock and Series 1
Preferred Stock based on SEC filings made by those persons or groups.

         4.       Management

     5. Related Party Transactions

     Creditors  and  Interest   holders  are  referred  to  Item  13,   "Certain
Relationships  and  Related  Transactions,"  of the Form  10-K  for  information
regarding the Debtors' transactions with related parties.

                                       V.

                          THE DEBTORS' CHAPTER 11 CASES

     A. Events Preceding the Filing of the Chapter 11 Cases

     Creditors  and  Interest  holders  are  referred  to  Item 7  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation," of the
Form 10-K for a  discussion  of events and factors  preceding  the filing of the
Chapter 11 Cases.

<PAGE>

     B. The Commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases

     The Debtors each filed a voluntary petition commencing the Chapter 11 Cases
on January 24, 2002 (the "Petition  Date") to maximize the value of their Assets
for the benefit of their Creditors and Interest holders.  The Debtors sought and
were granted certain relief from the Bankruptcy  Court necessary to maximize the
value of their remaining DHR business segment and to effectuate the sale of that
business segment to the highest and best bidder.

     First,  due to the  interrelationships  among  the  Debtors,  and to  avoid
duplication  resulting  from separate  handling of their  Chapter 11 Cases,  the
Bankruptcy  Court ordered the joint  administration  of the Debtors'  Chapter 11
Cases. Joint administration allowed the Chapter 11 Cases to be administered as a
single case,  but did not affect the  substantive  rights of the Debtors,  their
Creditors or their Interest  holders.  The assets and liabilities of the Debtors
will remain  separate and distinct from the assets and  liabilities of the other
Debtors, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.

     Second,  the Bankruptcy  Court entered orders  authorizing (i) the Debtors'
continued  use of their  existing bank  accounts,  cash  management  systems and
business  forms;  (ii)  the  waiver  of  the  Debtors'  investment  and  deposit
requirements  under  section  345 of the  Bankruptcy  Code;  (iii) the  Debtors'
payment of certain claims of critical trade vendors;  (iv) the Debtors'  payment
of certain prepetition  employee wages,  salary and other compensation;  and (v)
Debtors' payment of prepetition  sales and use tax obligations owing to federal,
state and local governmental entities.

     On the Petition  Date, the Debtors also filed a motion seeking the entry of
an order  approving  sale  procedures in  connection  with the sale of their DHR
business,  scheduling the auction for the sale,  scheduling a further hearing to
approve the sale,  approving the form of publication  notice of such auction and
sale  procedures  and  approving  the form of cure notice (the "Sale  Procedures
Motion").  Contemporaneously  therewith,  the  Debtors  filed a  motion  seeking
approval  of the sale of the DHR  business  free and  clear  of  liens,  claims,
interests and  encumbrances  under  sections 105, 363 and 365 of the  Bankruptcy
Code, to GE Medical Systems Information Technologies,  Inc. ("GEMS"), subject to
higher and better offers. By order dated February 20, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court
approved the Sale Procedures Motion (the "Sale Procedures  Order").  Pursuant to
the Sale  Procedures  Order,  a public  auction was held for the sale of the DHR
business on March 18, 2002.  GEMS was the winning  bidder in the  auction.  At a
hearing held on March 19, 2002, the Bankruptcy  Court issued an order  approving
the sale of the DHR business to GEMS for  approximately  $35.3 million.  The DHR
Sale closed on March 25, 2002.

     Finally, the Debtors were authorized to retain the following  professionals
to  represent  their  interests  in the  Chapter 11 Cases:  (i)  Gibson,  Dunn &
Crutcher  LLP, 200 Park Avenue New York,  NY 10166,  the Debtors'  Restructuring
Counsel;  (ii) The Bayard Firm, 222 Delaware Avenue,  Wilmington,  DE 19801, the
Debtors' Co-Restructuring Counsel; (iii) KPMG LLP, 1211 South West Fifth Avenue,
Suite 2000, Portland,  OR 97204, the Debtors' Financial Advisors and Independent
Auditors;  (iv) American Appraisal  Associates,  Inc., 701 5th Ave - 36th Floor,
Seattle, WA 98104, the Debtors'  Appraisers;  and (v) The Altman Group, Inc., 60
East 42nd Street,  Suite 405,  New York,  New York 10165,  the Debtors'  Claims,
Solicitation and Balloting Agent.


<PAGE>

     C. Significant Parties in Interest

     1. Equity Committee

     On March  14,  2002,  the  United  States  Trustee  appointed  an  official
committee of equity security  holders (the "Equity  Committee") to represent the
interests of holders of the Debtors' Equity  Interests.  The Equity Committee is
currently  composed of: (i) W. Dalton Tomlin,  Baylor College of Medicine;  (ii)
Dave Swenson,  Coleman Swenson Hoffman IV, L.P.; (iii) Mitchell Kopin, Cranshire
Capital, L.P.; and (iv) John H. Dayani, Sr. The Equity Committee has engaged the
following  professionals to represent its interests in the Chapter 11 Cases: (i)
Salans,  620 Fifth Avenue,  New York, New York 10020, as the Equity  Committee's
general bankruptcy counsel; and (ii) Connolly Bove Lodge & Hutz LLP, 1220 Market
Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, as the Equity Committee's co- bankruptcy counsel.

     D. Events During Chapter 11 Cases

     In addition to the relief granted by the Bankruptcy  Court described above,
the Debtors  sought and were granted the following  relief during the Chapter 11
Cases.  The  Bankruptcy  Court  entered  orders  authorizing:  (i) the  Debtors'
retention and  compensation  of certain  professionals  utilized in the ordinary
course of the Debtors'  businesses,  within certain specified limits in place of
the normal  restriction  imposed by the  Bankruptcy  Code; and (ii) the Debtors'
assumption of certain employment  agreements and the implementation of a pre-DHR
Sale employee retention,  incentive and severance program to ensure the Debtors'
continued business operations and to assist in the successful  transition of the
DHR business to GEMS (the "Retention/Incentive/Severance Program").

     Under the Retention/Incentive/Severance Program, approved by the Bankruptcy
Court on March 19,  2002,  the  Debtors'  made the  following  payments to their
existing Key  Employees:  (i) $380,000 to Senior  Executives;  (ii)  $109,000 to
Senior Management;  (iii) $43,410 to Professional and Managerial Employees;  and
(iv)  $185,257 to the  Director of Sales  Development.  Pursuant to the approved
program,  the Debtors also paid their Associate General Counsel,  who is now the
Debtors'  President,  a total  of  approximately  $175,000  and  will pay her an
additional $125,000 upon occurrence of certain events including approval of this
Disclosure   Statement  and  Confirmation  of  the  Plan.  The  Debtors'  Senior
Management,  Professional  and  Managerial  Employees,  and Office and  Clerical
Employees did not receive any specific retention payments, but were eligible for
severance  payments under the Debtors'  prepetition  severance and flexible time
off policies.

     After the DHR Sale, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order  authorizing
the  Debtors'  implementation  of a post-DHR  Sale key  employee  retention  and
severance  plan  covering  three Key  Employees  to ensure  the  performance  of
necessary  administrative tasks in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, as well
as the  performance of other wind-down  operations of the Debtors  including the
completion of final reporting  requirements,  final tax returns and the proposal
and consummation of a plan of liquidation (the "Post Sale Key Employee Retention
Plan").  The Post Sale Key Employee  Retention  Plan  provides for the following
payments:  (i)  $81,000  to the Chief  Financial  Officer;  (ii)  $40,000 to the
Corporate Controller; and (iii) $55,000 to the Assistant Corporate Controller.

         In connection with the DHR Sale, the Debtors assumed and assigned most
of their executory contracts and one of their nonresidential real property
leases to GEMS. Pursuant to a stipulation between the Debtors, GEMS and
Evergreen Corporate Center LLC, the Debtors

<PAGE>

     assumed a real  property  lease of their  premises  located  in  Hillsboro,
Oregon,  and assigned the lease to GEMS. With respect to three of the other five
real  property  leases that the  Debtors did not assume and assign to GEMS,  the
Debtors received authority from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into the following
agreements  to  resolve  underlying  landlord  claims  for the  benefit of their
estates:  (i) a settlement  agreement  between the Debtors and MB Hamptons  LLC,
concerning  their lease of the premises  located in New York,  New York;  (ii) a
settlement agreement between the Debtors and Highwoods/Tennessee  Holdings, L.P.
for their lease of the premises  located in  Brentwood,  Tennessee;  and (iii) a
settlement  agreement  between the Debtors and Duke Realty  Limited  Partnership
with respect to their lease of the premises located in Nashville, Tennessee. The
Bankruptcy  Court  approved the Debtors'  rejection of two  nonresidential  real
property leases for their premises located in Houston, Texas.

     E. General, Administrative and Governmental Bar Dates

     By order dated May 16, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court established the following
bar dates in the Chapter 11 Cases:  (i) a General Bar Date of July 19, 2002,  as
the  last  date  for  filing  proofs  of  Claim,  other  than  with  respect  to
Administrative  Claims or claims  filed by  governmental  units (as such term is
defined in section 101(27) of the Bankruptcy Code);  (ii) an Administrative  Bar
Date of July 23,  2002,  as the last date for  filing  requests  for  payment of
Administrative  Claims;  and (iii) a Governmental  Bar Date of July 23, 2002, as
the last date for filing proofs of Claim by governmental  units (as such term is
defined in section 101(27) of the Bankruptcy  Code),  other than with respect to
Administrative Claims.

                                       VI.

                     DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION

     A. Overview

     The Plan is a  liquidating  chapter 11 plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to
distribute the proceeds to the Creditors and Interest  Holders of each Debtor of
the  Debtors'  assets that were sold prior to the  Effective  Date.  For a brief
description of certain material  provisions of the Plan, see Section III of this
Disclosure Statement ("OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN"). The description in Section III of
this  Disclosure  Statement is  qualified  in its entirety by the Plan,  and the
provisions of the Plan are controlling in the event of any inconsistency between
them.

     B. Classification and Treatment of Claims and Interests

     The Plan  consists of six separate  plans of  reorganization,  one for each
Debtor entity,  which are as follows:  MSCP;  MedicaLogic/Medscape;  MedicaLogic
Enterprises; MedicaLogic Pennsylvania;  MedicaLogic Texas, Inc.; and MedicaLogic
Texas,  LP. Specific  information  regarding the treatment of Claims against and
Interests  in each  Debtor  is set  forth  in  Section  III of  this  Disclosure
Statement ("OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN").

     C. Implementation and Other Provisions of the Plan

     1. Assumption or Rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

         The Bankruptcy Code authorizes the Debtors, subject to the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court, to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired
leases. The Debtors may assume or reject those contracts or leases during the
Chapter 11 Cases or pursuant to the Plan. As more fully described in Section V
of this Disclosure Statement ("THE DEBTORS' CHAPTER 11 CASES"), pursuant to the
DHR Sale, the Debtors assumed and assigned most of their executory contracts to
GEMS and disposed of all of their nonresidential real property leases through
the assumption and assignment to GEMS or the settlement or rejection of those
agreements as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

<PAGE>

     With respect to the Debtors' remaining  executory  contracts that they have
not  either  rejected  or  assumed  and  assigned  to  third  parties,  the Plan
constitutes  and  incorporates  a motion by the  Debtors  to  reject,  as of the
Effective  Date, all  prepetition  executory  contracts and unexpired  leases to
which any of such  Debtors  are  parties,  except for an  executory  contract or
unexpired lease that (a) has been specifically  assumed and assigned or rejected
pursuant  to a Final  Order of the  Bankruptcy  Court or (b) is the subject of a
separate  motion  filed  pursuant to section 365 of the  Bankruptcy  Code by the
Debtors prior to the Confirmation  Date. The Confirmation Order shall constitute
an order of the  Bankruptcy  Court  approving  the  rejection  of all  executory
contracts and unexpired  leases and such rejection shall be deemed  effective as
of the Effective Date.

     Common Stock Purchase  Warrants.  Regardless of whether any of the Debtors'
common  equity  securities  options  and/or  warrants  are or  may be  executory
contracts,  all options and warrants  may be exercised  pursuant to the terms of
such  option or warrant  until the  Effective  Date.  Any option or warrant  not
exercised prior to the Effective Date shall be rejected and canceled pursuant to
section  1123(a)(5)(F)  of the  Bankruptcy  Code. As of the Effective  Date, the
total number of  MedicaLogic/Medscape  issued and  outstanding  shares of common
stock shall be increased to reflect the exercise of any and all such options and
warrants prior to the Effective Date.

     If the  rejection by the Debtor,  pursuant to this Plan,  of any  executory
contract, unexpired lease, common equity option, warrant, or right of conversion
pursuant  to Section  9.1 of the Plan  gives  rise to a Claim by the  non-Debtor
party or parties to such contract,  lease, option,  warrant or right, such Claim
shall be forever barred and shall not be enforceable  against the Debtors or the
Trust or its  properties  unless a proof of Claim is filed  with the  Bankruptcy
Court and served upon  counsel to the  Debtors  and counsel to the Trust  within
thirty (30) days after the entry of the Confirmation  Order. Any rejection Claim
shall be deemed a Disputed Claim unless Allowed by Final Order.

     Bar  Date  for  Filing  Other  Administrative   Claims.   Pursuant  to  the
Confirmation Order, the Debtors will seek authority to set a Bar Date for Filing
Other  Administrative  Claims.  This  bar  date  will  apply  to  holders  of an
Administrative  Claim  incurred  after April 26, 2002 and through the  Effective
Date, (other than (i) an Administrative  Claim representing a liability incurred
in the ordinary course of business,  or (ii) a Claim described in Section 2.2 of
the Plan).  Such holders will be required to file with the Bankruptcy  Court and
serve on the  Trustee a request  for  payment  of such Claim no later than sixty
(60) days after the Effective Date. Such request for payment shall include, at a
minimum, the name, address and phone number of the holder of the Claim, the date
on which the Claim arose, and a detailed  explanation of the basis of the Claim,
with all pertinent  documents  attached.  The failure to file timely the request
for payment as required  under  Section 2.3 of the Plan will result in the Claim
being forever barred and discharged.  An  Administrative  Claim, with respect to
which a request for payment has been properly  filed  pursuant to Section 2.3 of
the Plan,  shall  become an Allowed  Administrative  Claim,  unless an objection
thereto has been filed.

     2. Plan Distribution Entitlement; Dispute Provisions

     Distribution  as provided in the Plan is available  only for Allowed Claims
and Allowed Interests. Disputed Claims or Disputed Interests that become Allowed
after the Effective Date shall receive the  Distributions in accordance with the
terms of the Plan.  No  Distribution  of  payment  shall be made on account of a
Disputed  Claim or Disputed  Interest  unless and until such  Disputed  Claim or
Disputed Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest. Unless otherwise
ordered by the Bankruptcy Court,  after the Effective Date, the Trust shall have
the exclusive  right to make and file  objections  to and settle,  compromise or
otherwise  resolve Claims and Interests.  After the Effective  Date, the Trustee
may  settle or  compromise  any  Disputed  Claim or  Disputed  Interest  without
approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

     The Debtors, or the Trustee, may request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate
any Disputed  Claim or Disputed  Interest,  subject to estimation  under section
502(c) of the Bankruptcy  Code and for which the Debtors may be liable under the
Plan,  including any Disputed Claim for taxes regardless of whether any party in
interest previously objected to such Claim or Interest.

     In the  event  that  the  Bankruptcy  Court  estimates  any  contingent  or
unliquidated  Disputed Claim or Disputed  Interest,  such estimated  amount will
constitute (at the Debtors'  option,  to be exercised at the commencement of the
estimation  proceeding) either the Allowed amount of such Claim or Interest or a
maximum  limitation  on the  Allowed  amount  of  such  Claim  or  Interest,  as
determined  by the  Bankruptcy  Court.  If the  estimated  amount  constitutes a
maximum limitation on the Allowed amount of such Claim or Interest,  the Debtors
may elect to  pursue  any  supplemental  proceedings  to object to any  ultimate
allowance of such Claim or Interest.

     3. Trust Property Distribution and Reserve Procedures

     Distributions  to holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests shall be
made by the  Trustee  or agent,  as the case may be,  (a) if a proof of Claim is
filed in respect of a particular  Claim,  to the holder of each Allowed Claim at
the address of such  holder set forth in the  relevant  proof of Claim,  as such
address may have been updated  pursuant to Bankruptcy  Rule  2002(g),  (b) if no
proof of Claim is filed in respect of a particular  Claim, to the holder of each
Allowed  Claim at the address of such holder set forth in the relevant  Debtor's
Schedules,  as such address may have been updated  pursuant to  Bankruptcy  Rule
2002(g),  or (c) to the holder of each  Allowed  Interest at the address of such
holder  as  listed  in the  Interest  ledger  maintained  by or on behalf of the
applicable  Debtor as of the  December 20, 2002,  Voting  Record Date.  The Plan
provides that all  distributions of Trust Property from the Trust are to be made
according to the following procedure:

     Payment of Retention Bonuses and Wind-down Reserve.  On the Effective Date,
notwithstanding  the timing of the  payments of the bonuses set forth in the Key
Employee  Retention  Orders,  the Debtors shall pay from Cash on hand all unpaid
bonus  payments to Key  Employees who were employed by the Debtors as of the day
prior to the Effective  Date. On the Effective  Date, the Trust shall  establish
the Wind-down Reserve in accordance with the Wind-down Budget.

     Trust Expense Reserve. On the Effective Date, the Trust shall deposit funds
in the Trust  Expense  Reserve  for the  payment  of Trust  Expenses.  The Trust
Expense  Reserve,  as of the Effective Date,  shall be in an amount set forth in
the Plan  Supplement.  The  Trustee  may,  at any  time,  transfer  any  balance
remaining  in the  Trust  Expense  Reserve  after  the  payment  of all  Trustee
Expenses,  Allowed Claims and Preferred Equity Interests, and reserves have been
established  for payment in full of all Disputed  Claims and payment as provided
by Section 5.2(e) of the Plan for all Disputed  Preferred Equity Interests as if
such Disputed Claims and Disputed  Preferred  Equity Interests had been Allowed,
into the Equity Fund.

<PAGE>

     Increase of Trust Expense Reserve.  To the extent the Trustee in his or her
discretion  determines  that the amount of funds in the Trust Expense Reserve is
at any time or may become insufficient,  the Trustee,  after providing three (3)
Business  Days'  written  notice to the Trust  Committee,  may from time to time
transfer to the Trust Expense Reserve out of the undistributed Equity Fund, such
amount or  amounts as the  Trustee in his or her  discretion  and  judgment  may
reasonably  determine  to be  necessary  or advisable to satisfy all current and
anticipated  obligations of the Trust. In no event shall the Trustee be required
to use his or her personal  funds or assets for such  purposes.  The  Bankruptcy
Court shall  determine any dispute  between the Trustee and the Trust  Committee
over any proposed increase in the Trust Expense Reserve.

     Distributions and Reserve for Secured Claims.

     (a) On the Effective  Date,  the  Trustee  shall  set  aside  and  deposit

Trustee shall establish sub-accounts for each holder of a Secured Claim, that is
Disputed.  Any  prepetition  Liens shall  attach  solely to the  Secured  Claims
Reserve sub-account established by the Trustee for such Claim. Upon Distribution
of any collateral securing an Allowed Secured Claim, such holder's Lien or other
security interest in the relevant collateral shall be deemed released.

     (b) From the Secured  Claims  Reserve,  provided  that the  Secured  Claims
Reserve is fully funded,  the Trustee shall, in accordance with Article V of the

Property   from  the  Equity   Fund  to  each   holder  of  an   Allowed   Class

<PAGE>

     Increases of Funds.  The Trustee shall deposit into the reserve accounts in
the following  order any amounts that become payable to or received by the Trust
after the Effective Date,  including but not limited to, escrowed funds relating
to certain  sales of the Debtors'  business  segments and any proceeds  from the
sale of or  settlement  or other  recovery in respect of the  Promissory  Notes:
first, the Trust Expense Reserve; second, the Secured Claims Reserve; third, the
Priority Claims Reserve;  fourth,  the Unsecured Claims Reserve,  and fifth, the
Equity Fund.

     4. Retention of Causes of Action

     The  Debtors  do not  release or abandon  any  claims,  rights or causes of
action held by them or their  estates,  including  "avoidance  actions," and may
seek to assert such claims, rights and causes of action,  against any persons at
any time, subject to any applicable statutes of limitation.  The Bankruptcy Code
gives a debtor the power to set aside or avoid certain transactions entered into
by the  debtor  prior  to the  filing  of the  petition  ("avoidance  actions"),
including  "preferential  transfers" and "fraudulent  transfers." As of the date
hereof,  the  Debtors do not  believe  there will be any  recovery on account of
avoidance  actions under sections 547 or 548 of the Bankruptcy  Code. A voidable
"preferential  transfer"  is a  transfer  of a debtor's  property  to or for the
benefit  of a  creditor  on  account  of a debt owed by the  debtor  before  the
transfer was made,  if the transfer was made while the debtor was  insolvent and
made within 90 days before the filing of  petition  in  bankruptcy.  Because the
Debtors were solvent at the Petition  Date,  the Debtors do not believe that any
preference  actions could be sustained under section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.
In   addition,   pursuant   to   section   548  of  the   Bankruptcy   Code,   a
debtor-in-possession  has the power to avoid certain  transfers made by a debtor
within  one year  prior to the  filing  of the  petition,  with  the  actual  or
constructive  intent to defraud creditors or to delay or hinder their collection
efforts  ("fraudulent  transfers").  The Debtors have  examined  their books and
records for the one year period  prior to the Petition  Date and,  based on that
examination,  believe  that  there  is no  basis  for  the  commencement  of any
fraudulent   transfer   actions  under  section  548  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code.
Nevertheless,  the Debtors do not believe  that it is in the best  interests  of
their estates to abandon these  possible  causes of action.  Pursuant to section
1123(b)(3) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  the Debtors will transfer to the Trust any
and all claims,  causes of action and rights of the Debtors or the Estates as of
the  Effective  Date,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to seek the
subordination  of claims under  section 510 of the  Bankruptcy  Code.  After the
Effective  Date,  the Trust,  as successors in interest to the Debtors and their
Chapter 11 estates,  will have the exclusive right to pursue,  prosecute and /or
settle any and all causes of action.

     5. Effect of Confirmation of Plan

     Except as otherwise  provided in section 1141(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, on
and after the  Confirmation  Date,  the  provisions of the Plan shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Debtors,  any holder of a Claim or Interest
in the Debtors and their respective  successors and assigns,  whether or not the
Claim or Interest  of such holder is impaired  under the Plan and whether or not
such holder has accepted the Plan.

     On the Effective Date, the Trust shall be established pursuant to the Trust
Agreement for the purposes of assuming all of the liabilities of the Debtors and
the Estates, and liquidating and distributing the Trust Property for the benefit
of the Trust  Beneficiaries,  in accordance  with the provisions of the Plan and
the Trust Agreement as promptly and efficiently as is practicable.  Title to the
Assets shall  automatically  vest in the Trust and shall thereupon  become Trust
Property,  free and clear of all Claims and  Interests,  except as  specifically
provided in the Plan.  The Trust shall be deemed the  successors  to the Debtors
and  substituted  as  a  party  to  all  pending  contested  matters,

<PAGE>

adversary  proceedings,  claims,  administrative  proceedings and lawsuits,
both within and outside the  Bankruptcy  Court,  involving the Assets or matters
relating  to the  Trust.  The  Trustee  shall be  authorized  and  empowered  to
preserve,  protect  and  maximize  the  value  of the  Trust  Property,  sell or
otherwise  liquidate  the Trust  Property  as  promptly  and  efficiently  as is
practicable,  and  distribute all income and proceeds from the Trust Property in
accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement.

     Except  with  respect  to  Equity  Securities  ss.  510(b)  Claims in Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape  7, as of the Effective Date, in exchange for their receipt
of distributions and other treatment contemplated under the Plan, each holder of
a Claim or Interest releases,  unconditionally and forever,  any and all claims,
obligations, suits, judgments, damages, rights, causes of action and liabilities
whatsoever against the Debtors.

     Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan, neither the Debtors,  the
Equity  Committee,  the Trust, the Trustee nor any of their respective  members,
directors, officers, agents, representatives, professionals, financial advisors,
attorneys,  accountants or employees shall have any liability to any holder of a
Claim or Interest or any other entity for any act, event or omission taken or to
be taken in good faith in  connection  with,  or arising  out of, the Chapter 11
Cases,  or in connection  with the  formulation,  negotiation,  confirmation  or
consummation of the Plan, or the  administration  of the Plan or the property to
be distributed under the Plan.

     Except as otherwise  specifically  provided in the Plan or the Confirmation
Order and except as may be  necessary  to enforce or remedy a breach of the Plan
and/or the Trust Agreement, or as may be necessary to assert any entity's rights
in the  proceeds of  insurance  issued on behalf of the  Debtors,  to the extent
available,  as of the Effective  Date,  all entities  that have held,  currently
hold, or may hold Claims or other debts or liabilities  against the Debtors,  or
an  Interest or other  right of an equity  security  holder in any or all of the
Debtors,  are, with respect to any such Claim or Interest,  permanently enjoined
from and after the Confirmation  Date from taking any of the following  actions:
(i)  commencing  or  continuing  in any manner  any  action or other  proceeding
against the Debtors, the Trust or the Trust Property,  (ii) enforcing,  levying,
attaching, collecting or otherwise recovering in any manner any judgment, award,
decree or order against the Debtors,  the Trust,  or the Trust  Property;  (iii)
creating,  perfecting or enforcing any lien or encumbrance  against the Debtors,
the Trust or the Trust Property;  (iv) asserting a setoff,  right of subrogation
or recoupment of any kind against any debtor, liability or obligation due to the
Debtors or the Trust or the Trust Property, and (v) commencing or continuing any
action, in any manner, in any place that does not comply with or is inconsistent
with the provisions of the Plan.

     6. The Trust; Implementing Documents and Transactions; No Transfer Taxes

     As  mentioned  above,  the  Plan  contemplates  the   implementation  of  a
liquidating Trust as the vehicle from which  distributions to holders of Allowed
Claims and Allowed  Interests  will be made.  On the Effective  Date,  the Trust
shall be established as a grantor trust pursuant to the Trust  Agreement for the
purposes  of  acquiring  title  to  the  Trust  Property,  assuming  all  of the
liabilities of the Debtors and the Estates, and liquidating and distributing the
Trust  Property for the benefit of the Trust  Beneficiaries.  The Trust Property
will be distributed in accordance  with the provisions of the Plan and the Trust
Agreement as promptly and  efficiently  as is  practicable.  Upon the  Effective
Date,  title to the  Assets  shall  automatically  vest in the  Trust  and shall
thereupon  become Trust  Property,  free and clear of all Claims and  Interests,
except as  specifically  provided  in the Plan.  The Trust  shall be deemed  the
successor  to  the  Debtors  and  the  Chapter  11  estates  and   automatically
substituted as a party to all pending contested matters,  adversary proceedings,
claims,  administrative  proceedings  and lawsuits,  both within and outside the
Bankruptcy  Court,  involving  the  Assets or  matters  relating  to the  Trust,
including the resolution of Disputed Claims.

<PAGE>

     At least  five  (5)  days  prior  to the  Confirmation  Hearing,  or if the
Confirmation  Hearing  is  adjourned,  then at least  five (5) days prior to the
adjourned  date,  the  Debtors  shall  file with the  Bankruptcy  Court the Plan
Supplement which shall contain Exhibits,  Schedules,  and other documents as may
be necessary or  appropriate  to effectuate  and further  evidence the terms and
conditions  of the Plan.  Such  documents  shall  include  (i) a schedule of the
amounts to be deposited in (a) the Trust Expense Reserve, (b) the Secured Claims
Reserve,  (c) the Priority Claims Reserve, (d) the Unsecured Claims Reserve, and
(e) the Wind-down  Budget,  and (ii) the proposed form of Trust Agreement.  Upon
the filing of the Plan  Supplement  with the Court,  (i) the Debtors  will serve
copies of the Plan  Supplement  to the Office of the United  States  Trustee and
counsel to the Equity Committee and (ii) the Plan Supplement may be inspected in
the office of the Clerk of the  Bankruptcy  Court  during  normal  court  hours.
Holders of Claims or  Interests  may obtain a copy of the Plan  Supplement  upon
written request to the Debtors' counsel. A copy of the Plan Supplement will also
be  available  at  the  Debtors'   website  at   www.mscpholdings.com,   and  at
www.deb.uscourts.gov, the official website for the Bankruptcy Court.

     The Debtors and the Trustee shall be authorized to execute,  deliver,  file
or record such documents, contracts, instruments, releases, and other agreements
and take such other  actions  as may be  necessary  to  effectuate  and  further
evidence the terms and conditions of the Plan and Trust Agreement.

     Pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the issuance,  transfer
or exchange of notes or equity  securities  under the Plan,  the creation of any
mortgage,  deed of trust or other security interest, the making or assignment of
any lease or sublease, or the making or delivery of any deed or other instrument
of transfer under, in furtherance of, or in connection with the Plan,  including
any merger  agreements or agreements of consolidation,  deeds,  bills of sale or
assignments  executed in connection  with any of the  transactions  contemplated
under the Plan shall not be subject to any stamp, real estate transfer, mortgage
recording, or other similar tax.

     7. Corporate Governance Matters

     On the  Effective  Date,  the  positions of officers  and  directors of the
Debtors will be eliminated,  and therefore, the persons then acting as directors
and officers of the Debtors will be terminated.

     8. Amendment of Plan; Severability; Revocation

     Alterations,  amendments  or  modifications  of the Plan may be proposed in
writing by the Debtors at any time prior to the Confirmation  Date, if the Plan,
as altered,  amended or modified,  satisfies the conditions of sections 1122 and
1123 of the Bankruptcy  Code, and the Debtors have complied with section 1125 of
the Bankruptcy  Code.  The Plan may be altered,  amended or modified at any time
after the  Confirmation  Date and before the Effective  Date,  provided that the
Plan, as altered,  amended or modified,  satisfies the  requirements of sections
1122,  1123,  and 1125 of the Bankruptcy  Code,  and the Bankruptcy  Court after
notice and hearing confirms the Plan as altered, amended or modified.

<PAGE>

     A holder of a Claim or  Interest  that has  accepted  the Plan is deemed to
have  accepted  the  Plan  as  altered,  amended  or  modified  if the  proposed
alteration,  amendment or modification  does not materially and adversely change
the treatment of the Claim or Interest of the holder.  Otherwise the Debtors may
alter,  amend or modify the treatment of claims and Interests provided for under
the Plan only if the holders of Claims or Interests  affected  thereby  agree or
consent to any such alteration, amendment or modification.

     In  the  event  that  the  Bankruptcy  Court   determines,   prior  to  the
Confirmation  Date,  that  any  provision  in  the  Plan  is  invalid,  void  or
unenforceable,  the Debtors may, at their  option,  (a) treat such  provision as
invalid,  void or unenforceable,  in which case such provision will not limit or
affect the  enforceability  and operative  effect of any other  provision of the
Plan, or (b) alter, amend, revoke, or withdraw the Plan.

     The Debtors  reserve the right to revoke or withdraw  the Plan prior to the
Confirmation  Date.  If the  Debtors  revoke or  withdraw  the Plan prior to the
Confirmation  Date, then the Plan will be null and void. In such event,  nothing
contained  in the Plan will  constitute  a waiver or release of any claims by or
against the Debtors or any other person or to prejudice in any manner the rights
of the Debtors or any person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors.

     9. Retention of Jurisdiction

     The Plan  provides  for the  Bankruptcy  Court to retain  broad,  exclusive
jurisdiction  over all  matters  arising  out of, and related to, the Chapter 11
Cases and the Plan.

     10. Dissolution of Equity Committee

     On the Effective Date, the Equity  Committee shall dissolve and the members
shall be released  and  discharged  from all rights and duties  arising  from or
related  to the  Chapter  11 Cases.  The  professionals  retained  by the Equity
Committee  and the members  thereof  shall not be entitled  to  compensation  or
reimbursement  of expenses for any services  rendered after the Effective  Date,
except for  services  rendered  and  expenses  incurred in  connection  with any
applications for allowance of compensation and reimbursement of expenses pending
on the Effective  Date or filed and served after the Effective  Date pursuant to
Section 2.2 of the Plan.

     11. Dissolution of Debtors

     Upon the Dissolution  Date, each of the Debtors shall be deemed  dissolved.
The dissolution  shall be approved by the Bankruptcy  Court as part of this Plan
and the  Confirmation  Order,  without  further action of the Bankruptcy  Court.
Notwithstanding  the  determination of the Dissolution Date by the Debtors,  the
Debtors  shall take all steps  necessary to ensure that the Chapter 11 Cases are
properly closed and all past due fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  ss.  1930(a)(6) are
paid.

                                      VII.

                                VOTING PROCEDURES

     A. Parties Entitled to Vote on the Plan

         Pursuant to section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, each class of
"impaired" Claims or Interests that is not deemed to reject the Plan is entitled
to vote on acceptance or rejection of the Plan. A class is impaired unless that
class will have its legal, equitable and contractual rights left unaltered by
the reorganization. A list of classes entitled to vote on the Plan is set forth
in Section II (B) of this Disclosure Statement ("VOTING ON THE PLAN").

<PAGE>

     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  only holders of Allowed Claims or Allowed
Interests  in the Voting  Classes are  entitled to vote on the Plan.  A Claim or
Interest as to which a dispute  exists is not Allowed,  and is thus not entitled
to vote  unless and until  either (i) the  dispute is  determined,  resolved  or
adjudicated in the Bankruptcy  Court or another court of competent  jurisdiction
by final order or pursuant to agreement with the Debtors, or (ii) the Bankruptcy
Court deems the  disputed  Claim or  Interest to be an Allowed  Claim or Allowed
Interest on a provisional basis, for purposes of voting on the Plan.  Therefore,
although there is a ballot  enclosed with this Disclosure  Statement,  the votes
cast by the holders of Claims or  Interests  that are  disputed as of the Voting
Deadline will not be counted unless the Bankruptcy  Court  provisionally  allows
those Claims or Interests  for purposes of voting on the Plan.  If your Claim or
Interest is disputed,  it is your  obligation  to obtain an order  provisionally
allowing your Claim or Interest for purposes of voting.

     Holders of  Interests  in the voting  classes  may vote on the Plan only if
they are  holders as of the Voting  Record  Date.  The "Voting  Record  Date" is
December 20, 2002.

     B. Ballot

     A ballot to be used for voting to accept or reject the Plan,  together with
a return envelope, is enclosed with copies of this Disclosure Statement.

     After carefully reviewing this Disclosure Statement and the Plan, Creditors
and  Interest  holders  entitled to vote should  indicate  their  acceptance  or
rejection of the Plan by completing the enclosed  ballot.  All ballots should be
returned to the voting agent at the address set forth below.  If you believe you
hold a Claim that is entitled  to vote and do not  receive a ballot,  or if your
ballot has been  damaged or lost,  or if you have any  questions  regarding  the
procedures for voting on the Plan, please contact the voting agent as follows:

                             The Altman Group, Inc.

     The following  information is qualified in all respects by the instructions
that will  accompany  your ballot.  Please review those  instructions  carefully
before completing your ballot.

     All Creditors and Interest holders entitled to vote may cast their votes by

Statement,  and by returning  the ballot once it has been  completed,  dated and
signed in the enclosed  envelope.  To be counted,  your vote must be received by
the voting agent at the following address,  prior to the voting deadline of 4:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 24, 2003.

                             The Altman Group, Inc.
                         60 East 42nd Street, Suite 405
                            New York, New York 10165
                                 (212) 681-9600

<PAGE>

To be  counted,  all ballots  must be  completed  and  signed,  and must be
returned in time to be actually  received by the Debtors at the above address by
4:00 p.m.  Eastern  Standard  Time, on February 24, 2003.  Since mail delays may
occur,  it is important  that your ballot be mailed or delivered well in advance
of the specified date.

     Any ballot received after 4:00 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time, on February 24,
2003, will not be counted or otherwise included in any calculations to determine
whether the Plan has been accepted or rejected.

     If the  holder of an  Allowed  Unsecured  Claim in an amount  greater  than
$5,000 makes an election to reduce the Allowed amount of such Claim to an amount
equal to or less than $5,000, such Claim shall be treated as a Convenience Claim
for such  purposes.  Such  election  shall be made on the Ballot,  which must be
completed and received by the voting agent by the voting  deadline.  A holder of
an  Allowed  Unsecured  Claim who makes  this  election  shall be deemed to have
accepted the Plan by such election and such election shall be irrevocable.

     If a ballot is signed  and  returned  without  casting a vote or  providing
other  instruction  as to acceptance or rejection of the Plan, the signed ballot
will not be counted as a vote either to accept or reject the Plan.  The Debtors,
in their discretion, may request that the voting agent attempt to contact voters
to cure any defects in the ballots.

     When a ballot is returned  indicating  acceptance or rejection of the Plan,
but such  ballot is  unsigned,  the  ballot  will not be  counted  or  otherwise
included in any calculations to determine  whether the Plan has been accepted or
rejected.

     Any voter  that has  delivered  a valid  ballot  may  withdraw  its vote by
delivering  a written  notice of  withdrawal  to the voting  agent  prior to the
Voting Deadline. To be valid, the notice of withdrawal must (a) be signed by the
party who signed the ballot to be  revoked,  and (b) be  received  by the voting
agent prior to the Voting Deadline.  The Debtors may contest the validity of any
withdrawals.

     Any  holder  that has  delivered  a valid  ballot  may  change  its vote by
delivering to the voting agent a properly completed  replacement ballot so as to
be  received  prior to the  Voting  Deadline.  In the case  where  more than one
timely,  properly  completed ballot is received,  only the ballot that bears the
latest date will be counted.

     Rule 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy  Procedure governs  objections
to confirmation of the Plan. Unless an objection to confirmation is timely filed
and served, it may not be considered by the Bankruptcy Court.

     At the confirmation hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will consider whether the
Plan  satisfies  the various  requirements  of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  including
whether (i) the Plan has classified  Allowed  Claims and Allowed  Interests in a
permissible  manner,  (ii) the  contents of the Plan  comply with the  technical
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, (iii) the Debtors have proposed the Plan in
good faith,  and (iv) the  Debtors'  disclosures  concerning  the Plan have been
adequate and have included information  concerning all payments made or promised
in connection  with the Plan and the Chapter 11 Cases,  as well as the identity,
affiliations  and  compensation to be paid to all officers,  directors and other
insiders.  The Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies all of the requisites for
confirmation  and will present such evidence and argument as may be necessary or
appropriate at or prior to the hearing on confirmation.

     As further  described  herein,  the Bankruptcy  Code also requires that the
Plan be accepted by requisite votes of creditors and stockholders (except to the
extent  provided in section  1129(b) of the Bankruptcy  Code),  that the Plan be
feasible,  and that confirmation be in the "best interests" of all creditors and
stockholders.  To confirm the Plan, the  Bankruptcy  Court must find that all of
these  conditions are met. Thus,  even if the creditors and  stockholders of the
Debtors accept the Plan by the requisite  votes,  the Bankruptcy Court must make
independent  findings respecting the Plan's feasibility and whether it is in the
best  interests of the Debtors'  Creditors  and Interest  holders  before it may
confirm the Plan.

A.       Classification of Claims and Interests

     The  Bankruptcy  Code  requires  that each claim and interest in a class be
"substantially  similar" to the other claims and  interests  in such class.  The
Debtors  believe that the Claims and  Interests in each class under the Plan are
substantially  similar  and  that  the  classification  proposed  in the Plan is
appropriate under the Bankruptcy Code.

<PAGE>

     B. Best Interests of Unsecured Creditors

     The  Bankruptcy  Code provides that a chapter 11 plan will not be confirmed
unless the  Bankruptcy  Court finds that the plan is in the "best  interests" of
all  classes  of claims  or  equity  interests  which  are  impaired.  The "best
interests"  test will be  satisfied  by a finding of the  Bankruptcy  Court that
either (i) all holders of impaired claims or equity  interests have accepted the
plan, or (ii) the plan will provide such a holder that has not accepted the plan
with a recovery of at least  equal in value to the  recovery  such holder  would
receive if the debtor were  liquidated  under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy  Code.
The "best  interests"  test  requires  that with  respect  to each  holder of an
Allowed  Claim or Allowed  Interest,  either such holder has voted to accept the
Plan or such holder will receive or retain  property of a value that is not less
than the amount  such  holder  would  receive or retain in a  liquidation  under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

     Exhibit C attached  hereto is a  Liquidation  Analysis  that  evaluates the
likely returns to creditors in chapter 7 cases of the Debtors. To determine what
the holders in each Class of Allowed Claims or Allowed  Interests  would receive
if the  Debtors  were to be  liquidated,  the Courts must  determine  the dollar
amount that would be generated from the  liquidation  of the Debtors'  Assets in
the  context of  chapter 7  liquidation  cases.  The cash  amount  that would be
available for  satisfaction  of the Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests of the
Debtors  would consist of the proceeds  resulting  from the  disposition  of the
assets of the Debtors  (primarily  proceeds  from the sale of the  Transcription
Services,   Internet  Portals,  and  Digital  Health  Records  business  lines),
augmented by any Cash held by the Debtors at the time of the commencement of the
chapter 7 case.  The Debtors'  available  Cash would be reduced by the costs and
expenses of the  liquidation  and by any  additional  Administrative  Claims and
Priority Claims that would result from the use of a chapter 7 proceeding for the
purposes of liquidation. See Liquidation Analysis.

     The Debtors believe that the distributions  that would be made in chapter 7
cases would be less than the distributions contemplated by the Plan. The Debtors
therefore  believe  that the Plan is in the best  interests  of all  holders  of
Claims and Interests.

     C. Feasibility

     The  Bankruptcy  Code provides that a chapter 11 plan may be confirmed only
if the Bankruptcy Court finds that such plan is feasible. A feasible plan is one
which will not lead to a need for further  reorganization  or liquidation of the
debtor.  Because the Plan  provides  for the  liquidation  of the  Debtors,  the
Bankruptcy  Court will find that the Plan is feasible only after the  Bankruptcy
Court  determines that the Debtors will have sufficient  funds in their reserves
to  meet  their  post-confirmation  obligations  to pay  for  the  costs  of the
continuing administration of their estates and satisfaction of Claims. Here, the
Debtors will make appropriate  reserves for the wind-down of the Debtors and the
expenses  of the  Trust.  No class of  Claims  or  Interests  will  receive  any
distributions,  unless and until all Allowed  Claims or  Interests in such class
that is prior in right to distribution  have been paid in full and a reserve has
been  established  in the full amount of all Disputed  Claims or  Interests,  as
applicable.  The  Debtors  believe  that the Plan  complies  with the  financial
feasibility standard for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code.

     D. Acceptance

         As a condition to confirmation, the Bankruptcy Code requires that each
impaired class of claims or equity interests accept a plan, with the exceptions
described in the following section. The Bankruptcy Code defines acceptance of a
plan by a class of claims as acceptance by holders of two-thirds in dollar
amount and a majority in number of the claims of that class, but for that
purpose counts only the votes of those creditors who actually vote to accept or
to reject the plan. The Bankruptcy Code defines acceptance of a plan by a class
of equity interests as acceptance by two-thirds of the number of shares, but for
this purpose counts only those shares that actually vote. Holders of claims or
equity interests who fail to vote are not counted as either accepting or
rejecting the plan.

<PAGE>

     Classes of claims and equity interests that are not "impaired" under a plan
are deemed to have  accepted the plan and therefore are not permitted to vote on
the plan.  Classes of claims and equity  interests that receive no distributions
under a plan are deemed to have  rejected the plan.  The Debtors are  soliciting
acceptances  of the Plan only from those  persons who hold  Claims or  Interests
that are impaired under the Plan and who are to receive  distributions or retain
property on account of their Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests.

     A  class  of  claims  or  equity  interests  is  "impaired"  if the  legal,
equitable,  or contractual rights attaching to the claims or equity interests of
that class are  modified in any manner other than those  specifically  permitted
under the  Bankruptcy  Code. A list of impaired  Classes is set forth in Section
II. (B) of this Disclosure Statement ("VOTING ON THE PLAN").

     Section  1129(b) of the  Bankruptcy  Code sets forth the  requirements  for
confirming  a plan where one or more  impaired  classes have not voted to accept
the  plan.  If  a  plan  is  not  accepted  by  an  impaired  class,   including
nonacceptance  by means of deemed  rejection,  the plan may still be  confirmed,
provided  that the plan has been  accepted  by at least  one  impaired  class of
claims,  the Plan does not  discriminate  unfairly,  and is "fair and equitable"
with  respect to each class of claims or  interests  that is impaired  under the
plan but has not accepted the plan by the requisite amounts.

     The requirement for a plan not to discriminate unfairly means there must be
a legitimate  business reasons for any differences in treatment among classes of
creditors and interest holders at the same priority.

     The "fair and  equitable"  standard  requires  that if a class of unsecured
claims  rejects  a plan,  the plan may  still be  confirmed  so long as the plan
provides  that  (i) each  holder  of a claim  included  in the  rejecting  class
receives or retains on account of the claim,  property  that has a value,  as of
the effective date, equal to the allowed amount of the claim, or (ii) the holder
of any claim or  interest  that is junior to the  claims of that  class will not
receive or retain any property on account of the junior claim or interest.  If a
class of equity interests  rejects a plan, the plan may still be confirmed under
the fair and  equitable  standard  so long as the  plan  provides  that (i) each
holder of an  equity  interest  included  in the  rejecting  class  receives  or
retains,  on account of that equity  interest,  property that has a value, as of
the  effective  date,  equal  to  the  greatest  allowed  amount  of  any  fixed
liquidation  preference  to which the holder is entitled,  any fixed  redemption
price to which the holder is entitled,  or the value of that equity interest, or
(ii) the holder of any equity  interest  that is junior to the interests of that
class  will not  receive  or retain  any  property  on  account  of that  junior
interest.

     The "fair and equitable"  standard  requires that with respect to any class
of secured  claims that has not voted to accept the plan, the plan provides that
(i) the lien  securing the claims of each member of the class is  preserved  and
the plan  provides for deferred  cash payments with a present value equal to the
lesser  of the  allowed  amount of their  claims or the value of the  collateral
securing their claims,  (ii) the  collateral  securing the claim be sold free of
the lien  with  the  lien  attaching  to the  proceeds  and with the lien on the
proceeds  being treated under one of the two other  standards  described in this
paragraph,  or (iii)  the  claim  receives  treatment  that is the  "indubitable
equivalent" of the claim.

<PAGE>

     If one or more classes of impaired Claims or Interests  rejects the Plan in
these Chapter 11 Cases,  the Bankruptcy Court will determine at the Confirmation
Hearing  whether the Plan is fair and  equitable  with  respect to, and does not
discriminate  against,  any rejecting  impaired  class.  The Debtors reserve the
right (a) to request  the  Bankruptcy  Court to confirm  the Plan under  section
1129(b) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  (b) to reallocate  distribution  of assets to
Claims and  Interests if necessary  to comply with section  1129(b),  and (c) to
amend the Plan to the extent necessary to comply with section 1129(b).

     The Debtors  expect that at least one  impaired  Class will accept the Plan
for   each   Debtor.    The   Equity    Interests   in   the   public   company,
MedicaLogic/Medscape, will receive a distribution under the MedicaLogic/Medscape
Plan. The Equity Interests,  Membership  Interests and Partnership  Interests of
the following wholly-owned subsidiaries will not receive or retain any property:
MSCP;  MedicaLogic  Enterprises;  MedicaLogic  Pennsylvania;  MedicaLogic Texas,
Inc.;  and  MedicaLogic  Texas,  LP.  Because the Equity  Interests,  Membership
Interests and Partnership Interests of such Debtors will be deemed to reject the
Plan,  the Debtors will seek  confirmation  of the Plan pursuant to the cramdown
provisions  of section  1129(b)  of the  Bankruptcy  Code with  respect to those
Debtors.  The Debtors believe that the Plan may be confirmed pursuant to section
1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

     E. Risk Factors

     With any Chapter 11 plan,  certain  factors create a risk that  anticipated
results  will  not  be  achieved.   However,  these  factors  cannot  always  be
anticipated.  Some events may develop in ways that are  unforeseen,  and some or
all of the  assumptions,  which have been used in this Disclosure  Statement and
the Plan, may not be realized exactly as assumed. The risk of such contingencies
is reduced in these  Chapter 11 Cases  because  the success of the Plan does not
depend upon projected future revenues of the Debtors.

     Substantially  all of the Assets have been  liquidated and reduced to cash.
The Debtors will distribute this cash to the Trust which will make distributions
to holders of Allowed  Claims and  Allowed  Interests  as  provided in the Plan.
Nevertheless,  the timing and amount of  distributions to the various classes of
the Trusts may be affected by the following factors:

     1 The Plan is  subject to  approval  by the Voting  Classes.  Class  MSCP-5
(Equity Interests),  Class MedicaLogic  Enterprises-5 (Equity Interests),  Class
MedicaLogic  Pennsylvania-5  (Membership  Interests),  Class MedicaLogic  Texas,
Inc.-5 (Equity  Interests),  and the Class MedicaLogic  Texas, LP-5 (Partnership
Interests)  are all deemed to have  rejected the Plan. No assurance can be given
that the Plan will be accepted by the Voting  Classes or confirmed by the Court.
Failure of the Voting  Classes to vote in favor of the Plan or  non-confirmation
of the Plan by the  Court  could  lead to delay  and  additional  administrative
expenses.

     2 The estimated return on Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests set forth in
this Disclosure Statement are only estimates.  Any increase in estimated Allowed
Claims or Allowed  Interests  will reduce the  corresponding  actual  percentage
return on Allowed Unsecured Claims and Equity Interests.  As discussed  earlier,
distributions  to Unsecured  Claims and Equity  Interests will be  significantly
reduced if the  Securities  Litigation  Claims or the  Restricted  Stock  Holder
Claims were to become Allowed in any material amounts and determined not subject
to  subordination   under  section  510(b)  of  the  Bankruptcy   Code.   Absent
subordination  of such  Claims,  there can be no  assurances  that there will be
distributions to Preferred or common Equity Interests.

<PAGE>

     3 Distributions to the holders of Disputed Claims or Disputed Interests may
occur over a longer period of time than  anticipated  because of litigation over
the validity and amount of such Claims.

     4 Prior to the  commencement  of the  Chapter 11 Cases,  the  Debtors  were
parties to certain legal  proceedings as more fully described  herein and in the
Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov,  the official website for the SEC.
Creditors and Interest  holders are referred to Item 3, "Legal  Proceedings," of
the Form 10-K for information  regarding those legal proceedings.  The filing of
the Chapter 11 Cases operated as an automatic stay of all litigation against the
Debtors.  The Debtors,  however,  cannot predict the outcome of those litigation
matters or the extent to which the costs of defense and any  settlement or award
will be covered by its insurance  policies.  An adverse  determination on one or
more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on distributions
to holders of Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests.

     The foregoing  risks are inherent in any  liquidation,  including that by a
chapter 7 trustee.

                                       IX.

                            ALTERNATIVES TO THE PLAN

     The Debtors  believe  that the Plan  provides the  Debtors'  Creditors  and
Interest  holders  with the earliest  and  greatest  possible  value that can be
realized  on  their  respective  Allowed  Claims  and  Allowed  Interests.   The
alternatives to  confirmation of the Plan, if the Plan is not accepted,  are (i)
the submission of an  alternative  plan or plans of liquidation by another party
in  interest,  or (ii) the  conversion  of the  Chapter 11 Cases to cases  under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and subsequent liquidation of the Debtors.

     With respect to alternative plans of liquidation,  the Debtors believe that
no other plan would result in  distribution  of greater  value to Creditors  and
Interest  Holders than that  contemplated  under the Plan. Any alternative  plan
would delay confirmation thereby increasing costs from those incurred under this
Plan.  In  addition,  the  Debtors  believe  that the  aggregate  dollar  amount
available for distribution to Creditors and Interest Holders would be reduced if
the Chapter 11 Cases were  converted  to cases under  chapter 7 and the Debtors'
Assets were  distributed by one or more chapter 7 trustees.  The increased costs
of liquidation in a chapter 7 case would include the compensation of a chapter 7
trustee, as well as that of counsel and other  professionals  employed by such a
trustee, applicable taxes, and litigation costs would reduce such distributions.
Moreover,  substantial  time would elapse before  Creditors or Interest  holders
would  receive any  distribution  because the trustee or trustees  would need to
become familiar with the Debtors' books and records and the tax and other issues
affecting  such  distributions.  The  trustee  would need to devote  time to the
administration of the chapter 7 cases.

     For the reasons  described above, the Debtors believe that  confirmation of
the  Plan is  preferable  to any  alternative  because  the Plan  maximizes  the
distributions to all classes of Creditors and Interest holders,  and because any
alternative to  confirmation  will result in reduced  recoveries and substantial
delays  in  the   distribution  of  any  recoveries   available  under  such  an
alternative.

         For the reasons set forth in the attached Exhibit E, the Equity
Committee also supports this proposed Plan and urges holders of Allowed Equity
Interests to vote in favor of the Plan and to support its confirmation.

                                       X.

               CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN

     A. Generally

     The  following  discussion  is a summary of the  significant  United States
federal income tax consequences of the transactions  described herein and in the
Plan to the  Debtors  and to  holders  of  Allowed  Claims,  holders  of Allowed
Interests in Class MedicaLogic/Medscape-5 (Preferred Equity Interests) and Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape-6  (Equity  Interests),  and  holders  of  Claims  in Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape-7  (Equity  Securities ss. 510(b) Claims).  For purposes of
the discussion in this Section X, unless the context otherwise requires, (i) the
term    "Equity    Interests"    refers   to   Equity    Interests    in   Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape-6, and (ii) the term "Trust" refers to the Trust other than
the portion of each of the Secured Claims Reserve,  the Priority Claims Reserve,
and the Unsecured  Claims Reserve that relates to Disputed Claims (such portions
are referred to  collectively  herein as the "Disputed  Claims  Reserve").  This
discussion  is for  informational  purposes  only and is  based on the  Internal
Revenue  Code,  its  legislative   history,   existing  and  proposed   Treasury
regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative rulings and practice, all as
of the date of this  Disclosure  Statement,  and all of  which  are  subject  to
change, possibly with retroactive effect.

     This summary does not discuss all aspects of federal  income  taxation that
may be relevant to a particular holder in light of its individual  circumstances
or to certain types of holders  subject to special  treatment  under the federal
income  tax  laws,  such  as  tax-exempt  organizations,   insurance  companies,
financial   institutions,   dealers  in  securities,   partnerships   and  other
pass-through  entities,  holders that hold their  Claims or Equity  Interests as
part of a hedge, straddle,  conversion, or other risk-reduction arrangement, and
holders whose functional  currency is not the U.S.  dollar;  nor does it address
any foreign,  state, local, or other tax consequences of the consummation of the
Plan.  Further,  this discussion  assumes (i) that holders hold their Claims and
Equity  Interests,  and will hold their  beneficial  interests in the Trust,  as
capital  assets  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,  and (ii) that all  Equity
Securities  ss. 510(b) Claims in Class  MedicaLogic/Medscape-7  will be Disputed
Claims on the Effective Date.

     Except as otherwise  noted,  this discussion is limited to original holders
of Claims and Interests.  Also, this discussion applies only to holders that are
United States persons.  A "United States person" means (1) a citizen or resident
of the United  States (as  defined  for  federal  income  tax  purposes),  (2) a
corporation  created or organized  in or under the laws of the United  States or
any political  subdivision thereof, (3) an estate the income of which is subject
to United States federal income taxation  regardless of its source,  (4) a trust
that is subject to the  supervision  of a court within the United States and the
control of one or more United States  persons,  or (5) certain  electing  trusts
that were in existence and treated as domestic trusts on August 20, 1996.

     The tax consequences  described herein are uncertain.  The Debtors will not
seek a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel  with  respect to any of the
matters  discussed  herein and there can be no  assurance  that the IRS will not
challenge one or more of the conclusions set forth below. Each holder of a Claim
or  Interest  is urged to consult  its own tax  advisor as to the  specific  tax
consequences of the consummation of the Plan,  including the  applicability  and
effect of federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws and applicable tax return
reporting requirements.

<PAGE>

     B. Creation of the Trust and the Disputed Claims Reserve

     1. Receipt of Beneficial Interests in the Trust

     The federal income tax  consequences  of the Plan depend in part on whether
the Equity  Securities  ss. 510(b) Claims are  subordinated  as of the Effective
Date.  If they are,  holders of Allowed  Claims will not, and holders of Allowed
Preferred Equity Interests may not, receive  interests in the Trust, but instead
will  receive  cash for  their  Claim  and for all or a part of  their  Interest
(Holders of Allowed Equity Interests will receive  interests in the Trust in any
event).  If the Equity  Securities  ss. 510(b)  Claims are not so  subordinated,
holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests  will receive  interests in the
Trust.  This  disclosure  discusses the federal income tax  consequences of both
alternatives.

     2.  Characterization of the Trust,  Beneficial  Interests in the Trust, and
the Disputed Claims Reserve

     Although  the  treatment  of the Trust is not free from doubt,  the Debtors
believe that the Trust should be treated as a "grantor trust" for federal income
tax purposes.  Assuming that this  characterization is correct,  the Trust would
not be a separate taxable entity.  Instead,  holders of Allowed Preferred Equity
Interests that become Trust Beneficiaries (if any) and holders of Allowed Equity
Interests would be treated as the grantors, or owners, of the Trust's assets for
federal income tax purposes,  subject to the discussion  below in Part C.3.a.(2)
of this Section X. Further,  although not free from doubt,  the Debtors  believe
that Allowed  Claims (to the extent not paid in full upon the  effectiveness  of
the  Plan)  will  ultimately  be paid in  full,  including  post-Effective  Date
interest,  so that the beneficial  interests in the Trust received by holders of
Allowed  Claims  (if any)  will be  treated  as debt  instruments  of the  Trust
(referred  to herein as the  "Trust  Notes").  Finally,  although  not free from
doubt,  the Debtors  believe that the Disputed Claims Reserve will be segregated
from the Trust for federal income tax purposes and treated as a separate taxable
entity.  See  Part E of this  Section  X below  for a fuller  discussion  of the
consequences of the ownership of a beneficial interest in the Trust as well as a
discussion  of  possible  alternative  characterizations  of the  Trust  and the
Disputed Claims Reserve.

     3. Transfer of Assets to the Trust

     The Debtors  intend to take the position that the transfer on the Effective
Date of assets to the Trust will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
transfer  of such assets to the  holders of Allowed  Claims  that  become  Trust
Beneficiaries  (if any), the holders of Allowed  Preferred Equity Interests that
become  Trust  Beneficiaries  (if  any),  and  the  holders  of  Allowed  Equity
Interests,  followed by the  contribution  of such assets by such holders to the
Trust;  and that,  in  exchange  for such  contribution,  (i) holders of Allowed
Claims,  if they become Trust  Beneficiaries,  will be treated as receiving  the
Trust Notes and (ii)  holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity  Interests,  if they
become Trust  Beneficiaries,  and holders of Allowed  Equity  Interests  will be
treated as receiving beneficial equity interests in the Trust. Accordingly,  the
Debtors  intend to take the  position  that for  federal  income  tax  purposes,
actions which occur on the  Effective  Date to establish the Trust and discharge
Allowed  Claims (to the extent not  discharged by a cash  distribution)  will be
treated as if each holder of an Allowed Claim against a Debtor  surrendered  its
Claim to the Debtor in exchange for a pro rata share of the assets of the Trust.
Likewise,  the Debtors  intend to take the position that for federal  income tax
purposes,  actions which occur on the Effective  Date to establish the Trust and
cancel Allowed Preferred Equity Interests (to the extent not cancelled by a cash
distribution)   and   Allowed   Equity   Interests   will  be   treated   as  if
MedicaLogic/Medscape  redeemed  each such  interest in  exchange  for a pro rata
share of the assets of the Trust.  Although  not free from  doubt,  the  Debtors
intend  to take the  position  that the  establishment  of the  Disputed  Claims
Reserve  will be  treated  as a direct  transfer  of the  assets  thereof to the
Disputed Claims Reserve by the Debtors.

<PAGE>

     The  mechanics  of the  surrender  of Allowed  Claims and the  issuance  to
holders of Allowed Claims of beneficial  interests in the Trust treated as Trust
Notes may be subject to  characterization  different from that described  above.
Accordingly,  holders of Allowed Claims that become Trust Beneficiaries (if any)
should consult their own tax advisors as to the  possibility  and effect of such
alternative characterization,  including with respect to the availability of the
installment  method of reporting any gain realized on the transaction  occurring
on the  Effective  Date.  Except as otherwise  indicated,  the  discussion  that
follows is based on the assumption that the transactions creating the Trust, the
characterization  of the Trust as a grantor trust, and the  characterization  of
the Trust Notes (if any) as debt of the Trust, in each case as described  above,
will be respected for federal income tax purposes.

     C. Consequences to the Holders of Allowed Claims,  Allowed Preferred Equity
Interests, Allowed Equity Interests, and Disputed Claims

     1. Overview

     A holder of an Allowed Claim will be treated as receiving  consideration in
respect of its Allowed Claim on the Effective Date and should  recognize gain or
loss as discussed below in Part C.2 of this Section X. On the deemed  redemption
of  Allowed   Preferred   Equity  Interests  and  Allowed  Equity  Interests  by
MedicaLogic/Medscape  and the receipt of beneficial interests in the Trust (and,
in the case of holders of Allowed  Preferred Equity  Interests,  possibly cash),
each  holder of an  Allowed  Preferred  Equity  Interest  and each  holder of an
Allowed  Equity  Interest  should  recognize  gain or (subject to the discussion
below in Part C.3.d of this  Section X) loss as  discussed  below in Part C.3 of
this Section X. Further, when a Disputed Claim is wholly or partially disallowed
and as a result cash in the Disputed  Claims Reserve is released and credited to
the Equity Fund,  holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity Interests and holders of
Allowed Equity Interests who are Trust  Beneficiaries at such time may recognize
additional gain as discussed below in Part C.3.c of this Section X. Although not
free from doubt, holders of Disputed Claims should not recognize gain or loss on
the Effective  Date but instead  should  recognize gain or loss when such Claims
become  Allowed as  discussed  below in Parts C.4 and C.5 of this  Section X. In
addition,  each holder of a beneficial interest in the Trust other than a holder
of a beneficial  interest  treated as a Trust Note will be required to report on
its federal  income tax return its allocable  share of any income,  gain,  loss,
deduction or credit recognized or incurred through the operation of the Trust as
discussed below in Part E of this Section X.

     2. Holders of Allowed Claims

     a. Amount and Character of Gain or Loss

     On the deemed  transfer of an Allowed  Claim to a Debtor and the receipt of
cash or a beneficial  interest in the Trust,  a holder should  recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash actually received or
deemed  received,  which in either  case  should  be equal to the  amount of the
Allowed Claim,  and (ii) the adjusted tax basis of the Claim deemed to have been
transferred  by the holder to the  Debtor in  exchange  therefor,  except to the
extent

<PAGE>

described  immediately  below with respect to accrued and unpaid  interest.
Any  such  gain or loss  will be  capital  gain or loss,  and will be  long-term
capital gain or loss if the holder held its Allowed Claim for more than one year
at the Effective  Date.  Holders of Allowed Claims may wish to consult their own
tax  advisors  regarding  the  possibility  that any such gain or loss  would be
ordinary  gain or loss  either by reason  of the  character  of the Claim in the
hands of the holder,  the market  discount  rules (in the case of holders  other
than original holders), or otherwise.

     b. Potential Interest Income

         A holder of an Allowed Claim will recognize ordinary income to the
extent that any consideration received or deemed received is allocable to
accrued and unpaid interest on such Claim that has not previously been included
in such holder's gross income for federal income tax purposes. In the event that
the consideration allocable to interest on a Claim is less than the amount
previously included in the holder's gross income, the holder generally
recognizes a loss to the extent of the unpaid interest.

     c. Treatment of the  Beneficial  Interests in the Trust Received By Holders
of Allowed Claims

     As described  above,  the Debtors believe that the beneficial  interests in
the Trust received by holders of Allowed Claims (if any) will be treated as debt
instruments  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  The  consequences  of  owning
beneficial  interests in the Trust treated as Trust Notes are described below in
Part D of this Section X.  Alternatively,  if the IRS were to determine that the
beneficial interests in the Trust received by holders of Allowed Claims, or some
of them,  should not be treated as debt instruments of the Trust,  then any such
holder would be treated as receiving a form of preferred equity of the Trust, in
the same  manner as  (although  having  priority  over) the  holders  of Allowed
Preferred Equity Interests. Among the consequences of such alternative treatment
would be that (i) any loss  realized by any such  holder on the  exchange of its
Allowed  Claim for a  beneficial  interest  in the Trust could be  deferred,  as
discussed  in Part C.3.d of this  Section  X; and (ii) none of the  consequences
described  below in Part D of this Section X (pertaining  to the  requirement to
include  amounts of original  issue  discount in income) would apply to any such
holder.

     3. Holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity  Interests  and Holders of Allowed
Equity Interests

     a. Holders of Allowed Preferred Equity Interests

     (1) Amount and Character of Gain of Loss

         On the deemed redemption of Allowed Preferred Equity Interests by
MedicaLogic/Medscape and the receipt of beneficial interests in the Trust and
possibly cash, a holder will recognize gain or (subject to the discussion below
in Part C.3.d of this Section X) loss equal to the difference between (i) the
sum of (a) the amount of cash actually received, if any, and (b) the fair market
value on the Effective Date of the Trust Property (probably including the fair
market value of the Trust's residual interest in the assets held by the Disputed
Claims Reserve and the full amount of the Trust Expense Reserve and the
Wind-down Reserve), if any, allocable to such holder (as represented by its
interest in the Trust) and (ii) the adjusted tax basis of the Preferred Equity
Interest deemed to have been surrendered by the holder to MedicaLogic/Medscape
in exchange therefor. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will
be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder held its Allowed Preferred
Equity Interest for

<PAGE>

more  than  one  year  at the  Effective  Date.  If the  Trust  were  to be
classified in a different manner,  the transactions  treated as occurring on the
Effective  Date also would  differ.  The  Debtors  expect  that the value of the
Trust's  residual  interest in the assets  initially held by the Disputed Claims
Reserve will constitute a substantial percentage of the value of such assets.

     (2) Treatment of the Beneficial  Interests in the Trust Received By Holders
of Allowed Preferred Equity Interests

     The Debtors believe that the beneficial  interests in the Trust received by
holders of Allowed Preferred Equity Interests (if any) will be treated as senior
equity of the Trust, with the consequences described above. However, in light of
the facts that the Debtors  expect that Allowed Claims (if not paid in full upon
the  effectiveness  of the  Plan)  will  ultimately  be paid in full  (including
post-Effective  Date  interest)  and that it may not be  necessary  to issue any
Trust Notes, it is possible that full payment of the Preferred Equity Redemption
Price would be viewed as sufficiently  certain as of the Effective Date, so that
the IRS would  take the  position  that any  beneficial  interests  in the Trust
received by holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity Interests should be treated as
debt  instruments of the Trust.  If this position were  sustained,  such holders
would be treated in the same  manner as holders of Allowed  Claims  that  become
Trust  Beneficiaries,  with the  result  that  (i) the  amount  realized  on the
Effective  Date by each such holder  would be equal to the sum of (a) the amount
of cash, if any, and (b) the "issue price" (as defined  below) of the beneficial
interest in the Trust received;  (ii) no loss realized by any such holder on the
exchange of its Allowed  Preferred Equity Interest for a beneficial  interest in
the Trust would be deferred;  and (iii) the consequences described below in Part
D of this  Section X  (pertaining  to the  requirement  to  include  amounts  of
original issue discount in income) would apply to each such holder.

     b. Holders of Allowed Equity Interests

     On   the   deemed    redemption    of   Allowed    Equity    Interests   by
MedicaLogic/Medscape  and the receipt of  beneficial  interests in the Trust,  a
holder should  recognize gain or (subject to the discussion  below in Part C.3.d
of this  Section X) loss to the extent of the  difference  between  (i) the fair
market value on the Effective Date of the Trust Property (probably including the
fair  market  value of the Trust's  residual  interest in the assets held by the
Disputed Claims Reserve and the full amount of the Trust Expense Reserve and the
Wind-down  Reserve)  allocable to such holder (as represented by its interest in
the Trust) and (ii) the adjusted tax basis of the Equity Interest deemed to have
been  surrendered by the holder to  MedicaLogic/Medscape  in exchange  therefor.
Such gain or loss would be capital gain or loss, and would be long-term  capital
gain or loss if the holder held its Allowed  Equity  Interest  for more than one
year at the  Effective  Time.  If the Trust were to be classified in a different
manner,  the transactions  treated as occurring on the Effective Date also would
differ.  The Debtors expect that the value of the Trust's  residual  interest in
the assets  initially  held by the Disputed  Claims  Reserve  will  constitute a
substantial percentage of the value of such assets.

     c. Amount Realized on the Exchange

     The fair market value of the assets transferred to the Trust will be agreed
to by the  Debtors  and the  Trustee,  and the  Trustee  will  inform  the Trust
Beneficiaries  in writing as to such value,  which must be used  consistently by
the Trustee and the Trust Beneficiaries for all purposes.

<PAGE>

     As described above,  the Debtors believe that holders of Allowed  Preferred
Equity Interests that become Trust  Beneficiaries  and holders of Allowed Equity
Interests should have a reporting  position that they are required to include in
their amount realized only their  allocable  portion of the fair market value of
the Trust's  residual  interest in the Disputed  Claims Reserve and not the fair
market  value of all of the  assets  held or deemed  to be held by the  Disputed
Claims  Reserve.  However,  it is possible  that the IRS could assert a contrary
view on the ground that the  Disputed  Claims are  contingent  liabilities  that
cannot be used to reduce  the  holders'  amount  realized  unless and until such
Claims are Allowed or are  required to be paid.  If the IRS were  successful  in
this regard,  holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity  Interests that become Trust
Beneficiaries  and  holders of Allowed  Equity  Interests  would be  required to
include in their amount realized their  respective pro rata shares of the sum of
the amount of cash and the fair market value of the assets  initially  dedicated
or credited to the Disputed Claims Reserve.

     If, consistent with the reporting  position described above, a holder of an
Allowed  Preferred Equity Interest that becomes a Trust  Beneficiary or a holder
of an Allowed  Equity  Interest  takes the  position  that only the value of the
Trust's  residual  interest in the Disputed  Claims Reserve is includible in its
amount realized on the Effective Date, as and when Disputed Claims are wholly or
partially  disallowed  and, as a result,  cash in the Disputed Claims Reserve is
released and credited to the Equity Fund, such holder will likely recognize gain
equal to the amount of its allocable  portion of the released cash to the extent
the  aggregate  amount of released  cash  allocable  to such holder  exceeds the
amount previously reported as the residual value in the Disputed Claims Reserve.
On the other hand,  any amounts from the Wind-down  Reserve used to pay expenses
of the  Debtors  likely  will be treated as  reducing  the amount  realized by a
holder at the time paid.

     The  Trustee  will  provide   annual   written   statements  to  the  Trust
Beneficiaries  indicating  the  amount of any cash  released  from the  Disputed
Claims Reserve by reason of any and all disallowances of Disputed Claims and the
amount of any cash paid from the Wind-down  Reserve to pay expenses  during each
calendar year.

     d. Possible Deferral of Loss Recognition

     It is possible that the  recognition of loss, if any,  realized by a holder
of an Allowed  Preferred  Equity Interest that becomes a Trust  Beneficiary or a
holder of an Allowed Equity  Interest will be deferred  because the ultimate pro
rata shares of the Trust Property will not be determinable on the Effective Date
due to the  existence  of  Disputed  Claims.  In  general,  a loss is treated as
sustained  in the taxable  year for which there has been a closed and  completed
transaction,  and  no  portion  of a loss  with  respect  to  which  there  is a
reasonable prospect of reimbursement may be deducted until it can be ascertained
with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be recovered. Although
not free from doubt,  the Debtors believe that a holder of an Allowed  Preferred
Equity  Interest  that  becomes a Trust  Beneficiary  or a holder of an  Allowed
Equity Interest should have a reporting  position that it will recognize gain or
loss on the  Effective  Date to the  extent  described  above.  It is  possible,
however,  that the IRS may assert either that (i) gain or loss recognized on the
Effective Date by a holder of an Allowed Preferred Equity Interest or an Allowed
Equity Interest must be computed including the cash and the fair market value of
the assets  initially  dedicated to the Disputed  Claims  Reserve as well as the
fair market value of such holder's  beneficial interest in the Trust or (ii) the
consideration  to be  received  by each  holder of an Allowed  Preferred  Equity
Interest  or an Allowed  Equity  Interest  does not have an  ascertainable  fair
market value on the  Effective  Date,  and thus any loss realized by such holder
should not be  recognized  until a later  time,  such as the date that the Trust
makes its final Distribution to the holder.

<PAGE>

     Holders of Allowed Preferred Equity Interests and holders of Allowed Equity
Interests  should  consult  with their own tax advisors  regarding  the possible
deferral of the  recognition  of loss.  Because a loss is allowed as a deduction
only for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained,  a holder who claims a
loss in the  incorrect  taxable year risks  denial of a deduction  for such loss
altogether.

     4. Holders of Disputed Claims

     Although not free from doubt,  holders of Disputed  Claims on the Effective
Date should not recognize gain or loss as a result of the transactions occurring
on the Effective Date.  Instead,  such holders should  recognize gain or loss if
and when such Claims become Allowed, to the extent of the difference between (i)
the sum of (a) the  amount of cash,  if any,  received  and (b) the fair  market
value of the assets, if any, allocable to such holder (other than amounts deemed
to have been used to discharge accrued interest on Claims) and (ii) the adjusted
tax  basis of the  Claim  deemed to have  been  exchanged.  It is likely  that a
portion  of any  amounts  received  by such  holder  will be  treated as imputed
interest income, computed from the Effective Date, and taxed as ordinary income.

     5.   Holders   of   Equity   Securities   ss.   510(b)   Claims   in  Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape-7

     Holders   of   Equity    Securities    ss.    510(b)    Claims   in   Class
MedicaLogic/Medscape-7  will initially be treated as holders of Disputed Claims,
and thus  should  not  recognize  gain or loss as a result  of the  transactions
occurring on the Effective Date, as described above. If and when such a Claim is
Allowed,  the  holder  should  recognize  gain  or  loss  to the  extent  of the
difference between the fair market value of the Trust Property allocable to such
holder and the adjusted tax basis of the Claim. Thereafter,  such holder will be
treated as the holder of a  beneficial  interest in the Trust in the same manner
as a holder of an Allowed Equity Interest, as described herein.

     6. Basis and Holding  Period of Property  Received in Exchange  for Claims,
Preferred Equity Interests, or Equity Interests

     The initial tax basis of a beneficial interest in the Trust treated as debt
of the Trust (i.e.,  a Trust Note) will be the issue price (as defined below) of
such Trust Note. The initial tax basis of any other  beneficial  interest in the
Trust  received  will be the amount  that is  included  in the  holder's  amount
realized on the exchange,  which, as described above,  should be the fair market
value of the Trust Property  (probably  including the fair market value, if any,
of the  Trust's  residual  interest in the assets  held by the  Disputed  Claims
Reserve  and the full  amount of the Trust  Expense  Reserve  and the  Wind-down
Reserve)  allocable to such holder (as represented by its interest in the Trust)
as of the date of the exchange.  The tax basis of a holder's beneficial interest
in the Trust will be  increased  by any  amount  treated  as  additional  amount
realized as a result of the release of cash from the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve.
The holding period for such property will begin on the day following the date of
the  exchange.  The initial tax basis of any item of Trust  Property will be the
fair market value thereof on the date of the exchange.

     D. Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of Trust Notes

     1. In General

         As discussed above, the Debtors believe that the beneficial interests
in the Trust received by holders of Allowed Claims (if any) will be treated as
debt instruments of the Trust for federal income tax purposes. The following
paragraphs discuss the consequences of owning and disposing of any beneficial
interests in the Trust that are so treated.

<PAGE>

     2. Original Issue Discount and Issue Price

     A debt instrument is treated as issued with original issue discount ("OID")
if its stated  redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by more than
a de  minimis  amount.  The  "stated  redemption  price at  maturity"  of a debt
instrument  is the sum of all payments to be made on the debt  instrument  other
than payments of qualified stated interest. The term "qualified stated interest"
means,  generally,  stated  interest  that is  unconditionally  payable at least
annually at a single fixed rate.

     As  described  above,  the Debtors  intend to take the  position  that each
holder of an Allowed Claim that becomes a Trust  Beneficiary will contribute its
pro rata share of the assets of the Trust (expected to consist entirely of cash)
to the Trust in exchange for a Trust Note. Accordingly, the Debtors believe that
the Trust Notes will be treated as being issued for money.  The "issue price" of
a debt instrument issued for money is the amount paid for the instrument.  Thus,
the issue price of a Trust Note received by a holder of an Allowed Claim will be
equal to the amount of the Allowed Claim  surrendered by such holder,  including
any amount that is attributable to accrued interest on such Claim.

     Although  interest  will accrue on the Trust Notes at a fixed rate equal to
the federal  judgment  rate,  such  interest  will be payable  only upon a final
Distribution  by the  Trust  to a  holder  of a Trust  Note  and  thus  will not
constitute  qualified  stated  interest.  As a  result,  such  interest  will be
included in the stated  redemption  price at maturity of the Trust Notes and the
Trust Notes will be issued with OID.

     3. Inclusion of Original Issue Discount in Income

     An initial  holder of a Trust Note must include OID in its gross income (as
ordinary  interest  income) for federal  income tax  purposes as it accrues at a
constant  yield equal to the federal  judgment rate in advance of the receipt of
cash payments  attributable to such income,  regardless of such holder's regular
method of  accounting.  In general,  the amount of OID includible by a holder is
the sum of the "daily  portions"  of OID with respect to its Trust Note for each
day  during the  taxable  year on which the holder  held such Trust  Note.  This
amount is referred  to as  "Accrued  OID." The daily  portion is  determined  by
allocating  to each day in any  accrual  period a pro  rata  portion  of the OID
allocable to that  accrual  period.  The amount of OID  allocable to any accrual
period is equal to the product of the Trust Note's  adjusted  issue price at the
beginning of such accrual  period and its yield to maturity  (determined  on the
basis of compounding  at the close of each accrual period and properly  adjusted
for the length of the accrual  period).  The  "adjusted  issue price" of a Trust
Note at the  beginning  of any  accrual  period  is  equal to its  issue  price,
increased by the Accrued OID for each prior accrual period. OID allocable to the
final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity of
the Trust Note and the Trust Note's adjusted issue price at the beginning of the
final  accrual  period.  Special  rules  will apply for  calculating  OID for an
initial short accrual period.

     4. Disposition of a Trust Note

         Upon the sale, exchange, or retirement of a Trust Note, a holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale, exchange, or retirement, other than amounts representing
accrued and unpaid interest on such Trust Note, and

<PAGE>

such holder's adjusted tax basis in the Trust Note. A holder's adjusted tax
basis in a Trust Note generally will be equal to such holder's initial tax basis
in the Trust Note, increased by any OID included in the holder's income pursuant
to the rules set forth above through the day preceding the date of  disposition.
Such gain or loss  generally  will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital  gain or loss if the  holder  held the Trust Note  sold,  exchanged,  or
retired for more than one year.

     E. Taxation of the Operation of the Trust and the Disputed Claims Reserve

     Each holder of a beneficial  interest in the Trust other than a holder of a
Trust  Note will be  required  to report on its  federal  income  tax return its
allocable share of any income,  gain,  loss,  deduction or credit  recognized or
incurred by the Trust, including,  but not limited to, interest income earned on
bank accounts and other  investments of the Trust and expenses of the Trust paid
from the Trust Expense Reserve.

     If an item of Trust Property is sold or otherwise  disposed of by the Trust
in a  transaction  in which gain or loss is  recognized  for federal  income tax
purposes,  each holder of a beneficial interest in the Trust other than a holder
of a Trust Note will be  required to report on its tax return gain or loss equal
to the  difference  between  (i) its pro rata share of the amount of cash and/or
the fair  market  value of any  property  received  in  exchange  for the  Trust
Property so sold or otherwise  disposed of and (ii) its initial tax basis in its
pro rata share of such Trust Property, as subsequently  adjusted.  The character
and  amount of any such  gain or loss will be  determined  by  reference  to the
character of the Trust  Property  sold or otherwise  disposed of in the hands of
each holder of a  beneficial  interest in the Trust and by  reference to whether
the  transaction in which such Trust Property was disposed of constitutes a sale
or exchange for federal income tax purposes.

     Each such  holder's  obligation  to report its share of any trust income or
gain  upon a  disposition  of  Trust  Property  is not  dependent  on the  Trust
distributing  any cash or other  proceeds of such  disposition.  Accordingly,  a
holder may incur a tax liability as a result of owning a beneficial  interest in
the Trust in advance of receipt of cash with respect thereto.

     The  Disputed  Claims  Reserve  should be treated  for  federal  income tax
purposes as a separate  trust.  As such,  the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve will be
subject  to  federal  income  tax on its  taxable  income at  special  tax rates
applicable to trusts.  Currently the maximum  marginal rate is 38.6% for taxable
income in excess of $9,200.  In general,  in computing its taxable  income,  the
Disputed  Claims  Reserve  should be entitled to deductions for its expenses and
for distributions  made to beneficiaries up to the amount of "distributable  net
income" ("DNI"), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.

     A holder of a  beneficial  interest  in the Trust  other than a holder of a
Trust Note will be required to include in income the amount of any distributions
received by the Trust from the Disputed  Claims Reserve in a taxable year, up to
the amount of its pro rata share of the Disputed  Claims  Reserve's DNI for that
year. Such  distribution  will be characterized by reference to the character of
items  included  in DNI (for  example,  capital  gains,  interest  income).  The
treatment of distributions  made by complex trusts,  such as the Disputed Claims
Reserve,  in excess of DNI is unclear  and  therefore  each holder of a Disputed
Claim  is urged to  consult  its own tax  advisor  as to the  treatment  of such
distributions and the timing of recovery of tax basis in its interest.

         As a result of the foregoing rules, the application of which can be
complicated and, in some respects, uncertain, the taxable income, if any, of the
Disputed Claims Reserve should be subject to only one level of federal income
taxation. It is possible, however, that all or a part of

<PAGE>

the Disputed Claims Reserve may be treated as a "Qualified Settlement Fund"
as defined in  applicable  Treasury  regulations  to the extent  that any of the
Disputed  Claims meets all of the  requirements  set forth therein.  For federal
income  tax  purposes,  a  Qualified  Settlement  Fund is  treated as a separate
taxable  corporate  entity  subject to tax on its  modified  gross income and is
entitled to deductions for its administrative and incidental expenses.  However,
amounts   distributed  to  claimants  are  not   deductible.   Recipients  of  a
distribution  from a Qualified  Settlement  Fund must treat the  distribution as
either  taxable or excludible  from income in the same manner as would have been
the case if the payment had been received directly from the transferor.

     Further, on February 1, 1999, proposed Treasury  regulations (the "Proposed
Regulations")  were  promulgated  which  set  forth  rules  relating  to the tax
treatment of certain escrow funds which constitute  "Disputed  Ownership Funds."
In general, a Disputed Ownership Fund is an escrow account,  trust, or fund that
is not a Qualified  Settlement Fund and is established to hold money or property
subject to conflicting claims, is subject to continuing jurisdiction of a court,
and the  money  or  property  of  which  cannot  be paid or  distributed  to the
claimants or transferor  without  approval of the court.  For federal income tax
purposes,  a Disputed  Ownership  Fund  generally is treated as the owner of the
assets it holds.  It is treated as a Qualified  Settlement  Fund,  as  described
above,  if all of the  assets  transferred  to the fund by or on  behalf  of the
transferors are passive assets, such as cash or cash equivalents, stock, or debt
obligations;  otherwise it is treated as a corporation. The Proposed Regulations
are proposed to be effective for Disputed  Ownership Funds established after the
date the  regulations  are  published  as final in the  Federal  Register.  With
respect to a Disputed  Ownership Fund established  after August 16, 1986, but on
or before the date of publication of final  regulations in the Federal Register,
the IRS will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation
for income earned by the fund,  transfers to the fund, and distributions made by
the fund. At this time it is uncertain  whether these Proposed  Regulations will
be  finalized  in their  current  form and,  if so  finalized,  how they will be
interpreted and applied,  although it is possible that the Proposed  Regulations
will,  as  finalized,  apply to the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve.  If the Proposed
Regulations  are finalized in their current form,  the Debtors  believe that the
above-described  method of  taxation of the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve  would be
considered reasonable.

     It is  possible  that  the IRS  could  succeed  in  requiring  a  different
characterization of either the Trust or the Disputed Claims Reserve, or both, or
that  the  Proposed  Regulations  governing  Disputed  Ownership  Funds  will be
finalized and be applicable to the Disputed Claims  Reserve,  which could result
in a different  and possibly  greater tax  liability to the Trust,  the Disputed
Claims Reserve,  the holders of Allowed  Preferred  Equity  Interests or Allowed
Equity Interests, and/or the Debtors than that described herein.

     F. Reporting and Withholding

     1. In General

     The Trustee will  withhold any amounts  required by law to be withheld from
payments to holders of beneficial  interests in the Trust. In addition, a holder
of a Claim, a Preferred Equity  Interest,  or an Equity Interest may be required
to provide  certain  tax  information  to the  Debtors  and to the Trust and the
Disputed  Claims  Reserve as a condition  of receiving  Distributions  under the
Plan.

<PAGE>

     2. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

     Information reporting  requirements will generally apply to payments on the
Effective  Date,  to  amounts  of OID that  accrue  on the Trust  Notes,  and to
Distributions  from the Trust or the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve  in  respect  of
interest.  Such  amounts  may be subject  to backup  withholding,  which,  under
certain  circumstances,  the Internal  Revenue Code imposes at a rate of 30% for
amounts paid in 2002 and 2003,  29% for amounts  paid in 2004 and 2005,  and 28%
for amounts paid thereafter,  increasing to 31% in 2011. Backup withholding will
not apply, however, to a holder who (1) is a corporation or comes within certain
exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (2) furnishes a
correct  taxpayer   identification  number  and  makes  certain  other  required
certifications as provided by the backup withholding rules.  Generally, a holder
will  provide  such  certifications  on  IRS  Form  W-9  (Request  for  Taxpayer
Identification  Number and  Certification).  A holder who does not  furnish  the
Trustee  with his or her  correct  taxpayer  identification  number  may also be
subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax and may be claimed  as a credit  against a holder's  United  States  federal
income tax liability, provided that the required information is furnished to the
IRS.

     3. Reporting In Respect of the Income of the Trust and the Disputed  Claims
Reserve

     The Trust will file IRS Form 1041 (U.S.  Income Tax Return for  Estates and
Trusts),  on which the items of income,  deduction and credit attributed to each
holder of a  beneficial  interest in the Trust  (other  than  holders of a Trust
Note) will be reported on an attached separate  schedule.  Each such holder will
receive  a copy of such  return  and the  schedule  relating  to it and  will be
required to report on its federal income tax return its allocable  share of such
items. The Trustee will be responsible for filing information  returns on behalf
of the  Trust  and  distributing  information  statements  to each  holder  of a
beneficial  interest  in the  Trust,  setting  forth  each  holder's  respective
allocable share of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of the
Trust. The Trust shall determine its income or loss based on the assumption that
each holder of a  beneficial  interest in the Trust has a taxable year that is a
calendar year and  accordingly  shall compute such holder's  income or loss on a
calendar year basis.

     The  Trustee  shall be  responsible  for  filing the annual tax return on a
calendar  year  basis  for the  Disputed  Claims  Reserve,  and shall pay tax in
accordance with such return.

     G. Consequences to the Debtors

     The  Debtors  believe  that there will be no  material  federal  income tax
consequences  to  them  as a  result  of the  implementation  of the  Plan,  the
cancellation  of their  indebtedness  with  respect to Disputed  Claims,  or the
transfer of assets to the Trust.  As a result of the  liquidation of the Debtors
in connection with the formation of the Trust, the Debtors'  previously reported
net operating  losses,  to the extent not already limited for federal income tax
purposes and not utilized in connection  with such  liquidation  or  previously,
will no longer be available.

     As indicated  above,  the foregoing  discussion is intended to be a summary
only and is not a substitute  for careful tax planning with a tax  professional.
The federal,  state, local, and foreign tax consequences of the Plan are complex
and,  in many  areas,  uncertain.  Accordingly,  each  holder  of a Claim  or an
Interest is strongly  urged to consult with its own tax advisor  regarding  such
tax consequences.

                                   CONCLUSION

     This  Disclosure  Statement has been prepared and presented for the purpose
of permitting all Creditors and Interest holders to make an informed judgment to
accept or reject the Plan. Please read this Disclosure Statement and the Plan in
full and consult with your counsel if you have questions.

     If the Plan is confirmed,  its terms and conditions  will be binding on all
Creditors and Interest  holders  whether or not they accept the Plan and whether
or not they  receive  distributions  under the Plan.  The Debtors  believe  that
acceptance  of the Plan by  Creditors  and  Interest  holders  is in their  best
interest and that  confirmation  of the Plan will provide the best  recovery for
Creditors and Interest holders.

shall be calculated as simple interest at the federal judgment rate.

reduce  the  Allowed  amount of such  Claim to an  amount  equal to or less than

Such election shall be made on the Ballot, which shall be completed and returned

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         PROVISIONS REGARDING VOTING AND
                            CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS

     6.1  Voting of Claims  and  Interests.  No  holder of an  Allowed  Claim or
Allowed  Interest in an unimpaired Class is entitled to vote to accept or reject
the Plan in its capacity as a holder of such Claim or  Interest.  Each holder of
an Allowed  Claim or  Allowed  Interest  in an  Impaired  Class that  retains or
receives  property under the Plan shall be entitled to vote separately to accept
or reject  the Plan and  indicate  such vote on a duly  executed  and  delivered
Ballot as provided  in the  Solicitation  Procedures  Order as is entered by the
Bankruptcy  Court,  or any other order or orders of the Bankruptcy  Court.  Each
holder of an Allowed  Claim or Allowed  Interest in an Impaired  Class that does
not retain or receive any property under the Plan is deemed to have rejected the
Plan. The  designation of Classes as "Impaired" or  "Unimpaired" is set forth in
Sections 4.1 and 4.2.

     6.2 Confirmability and Severability of Plan. The confirmation  requirements
of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code must be satisfied separately with respect
to each Debtor.  Therefore,  notwithstanding  the  incorporation of the separate
plans of liquidation  for each Debtor in a single joint plan of liquidation  for
purposes of, among other things,  economy and  efficiency,  Section 5.1 shall be
deemed a separate plan of  liquidation  for MSCP,  Section 5.2 shall be deemed a
separate  plan of  liquidation  for  MedicaLogic/Medscape,  Section 5.3 shall be
deemed a separate plan of liquidation for MedicaLogic  Enterprises,  Section 5.4
shall be deemed a separate plan of  liquidation  for  MedicaLogic  Pennsylvania,
Section  5.5 shall be deemed a  separate  plan of  liquidation  for  MedicaLogic
Texas,  Inc., and Section 5.6 shall be deemed a separate plan of liquidation for
MedicaLogic  Texas, LP. Should any of such separate plans not be confirmed,  the
other Debtors may elect to alter,  amend,  revoke or withdraw the other separate
plans or to seek Confirmation thereof.

<PAGE>

     6.3 Nonconsensual  Confirmation.  If any impaired Class does not accept the
Plan by the  requisite  statutory  majorities  provided in  sections  1126(c) or
1126(d) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  as  applicable,  or if any impaired  Class is
deemed to have rejected the Plan, the Debtors  reserve the right to undertake to
have  the  Bankruptcy  Court  confirm  the Plan  under  section  1129(b)  of the
Bankruptcy Code.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                      MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN

     7.1 Vesting of Assets in the Trust.


     (a) General. On the Effective Date, title to the Assets shall automatically
vest in the Trust and shall thereupon  become Trust Property,  free and clear of
all Claims and Interests, except as specifically provided in the Plan. The Trust
Property shall be held, administered, liquidated and distributed by the Trust in
accordance with the Plan and the Trust  Agreement.  Upon the Effective Date, the
Trust  shall  be  deemed  the  successors  to  the  Debtors  and   automatically
substituted as a party to all pending contested matters,  adversary proceedings,
claims,  administrative  proceedings  and lawsuits,  both within and outside the
Bankruptcy  Court,  involving  the  Assets or  matters  relating  to the  Trust,
including  the  resolution of Disputed  Claims.  Upon the  Effective  Date,  all
privileges,  including the attorney/client  privilege,  to which the Debtors are
entitled,  regardless  of whether such  privileges  relate to matters  occurring
prior to or after the  Petition  Date,  shall vest in, and may be asserted by or
waived on behalf of the Trust.


     (b) Federal Income Tax Treatment. The transfer on the Effective Date of the
Assets to the Trust  pursuant  to the Plan  shall be treated  for United  States
federal  income  tax  purposes  as  a  transfer  of  the  Assets  to  the  Trust
Beneficiaries   followed  by  the  contribution  of  the  Assets  by  the  Trust
Beneficiaries  to the Trust.  For purposes of the foregoing  sentence,  the term
"Trust"  shall  refer to the Trust other than the portion of each of the Secured
Claims Reserve,  the Priority Claims Reserve,  and the Unsecured  Claims Reserve
that  relates to Disputed  Claims (such  portions  collectively,  the  "Disputed
Claims Reserve").  The transfer of certain Assets to the Disputed Claims Reserve
shall be treated for federal  income tax  purposes as a direct  transfer of such
Assets by the Debtors to the Disputed Claims Reserve.


     (c)  Valuation  of Trust  Assets.  The  fair  market  value  of the  Assets
transferred  to the Trust will be agreed to by the Debtors and the  Trustee.  As
soon as practicable  after the Effective Date, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days  thereafter,  the  Trustee  shall  inform the Trust  Beneficiaries  in
writing  as to his or her  good  faith  estimate  of  the  value  of the  assets
transferred  to the Trust.  Such  valuation  shall be used  consistently  by all
parties including,  without limitation,  the Debtors, the Trustee, and the Trust
Beneficiaries, for all federal income tax purposes.

<PAGE>

     7.2  Directors  and  Officers.  On the  Effective  Date,  the  positions of
officers  and  directors  of the Debtors  shall be  eliminated,  therefore,  the
persons  then  acting  as  directors  and  officers  of  the  Debtors  shall  be
terminated.

     7.3 The Trust

     (a) General.  On the Effective  Date,  the Trust shall be  established as a
grantor  trust  pursuant to the Trust  Agreement  for the  purposes of acquiring
title to the Trust Property,  assuming all of the liabilities of the Debtors and
the Estates, and liquidating and distributing the Trust Property for the benefit
of the Trust  Beneficiaries,  in accordance  with the provisions of the Plan and
the Trust Agreement as promptly and efficiently as is reasonably  possible.  For
federal income tax purposes, (i) the Trust Beneficiaries, other than the holders
of Allowed  Claims (if any),  shall be treated as  grantors  and owners of their
allocable  portion of the Trust and (ii) the  beneficial  interests in the Trust
held by holders of Allowed  Claims shall be treated as debt  instruments  of the
Trust. The Trust shall be a liquidating trust that shall not carry on or conduct
a trade or  business,  or accept an  assignment  of any claim or right of action
from, or assume any liabilities of, any person or entity other than the Debtors,
and no part of the Trust Property or the proceeds,  revenue or income  therefrom
shall  be used or  disposed  of by the  Trust  in  furtherance  of any  trade or
business.

     (b)  Governing  Law. The Trust shall be  established  under the laws of the
state as determined by the Debtors and the Trustee.

     (c) Retention and Enforcement of Claims and Rights of the Debtors. Pursuant
to section  1123(b)(3) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  the Trust shall retain and may
enforce  any and all  claims,  causes of action and rights of the Debtors or the
Estates as of the Effective Date,  including,  without limitation,  the right to
seek the subordination of claims under section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code.

     (d)  Prosecution  or Resolution of  Objections to Disputed  Claims.  On the
Effective Date, the Trust shall become  responsible for prosecuting or otherwise
resolving objections to any Claims.

     (e) Duration of Trust.  The Trust shall be  established as of the Effective
Date and shall  continue in full force and effect  until four (4) years from the
Effective  Date;  provided that the Trustee may extend the duration of the Trust
for one or more finite periods,  upon written notice to the Trust Committee,  if
the Trustee determines that such extension is in the best interests of the Trust
Beneficiaries,  but in no event may the  duration of the Trust  exceed seven (7)
years from the Effective Date, provided,  further,  that each such extension has
been specifically  authorized by the Bankruptcy Court after notice to the twenty
(20) largest Trust Beneficiaries and hearing, upon a finding that such extension
is  necessary  to the  liquidating  purpose of the Trust  based on the facts and
circumstances,  and such  extension is granted  within six (6) months before the
beginning of the extended term. Any notice  contemplated  by this Section may be
included on any Trust Report provided under the Trust Agreement.

     7.4 Payment of Retention  Bonuses and Wind-down  Reserve.  On the Effective
Date, notwithstanding the timing of the payments of the bonuses set forth in the
Key Employee

<PAGE>

Retention Orders,  the Debtors shall pay from Cash on hand all unpaid bonus
payments to Key  Employees  who were employed by the Debtors as of the day prior
to the  Effective  Date. On the Effective  Date,  the Trust shall  establish the
Wind-down Reserve in accordance with the Wind-down Budget.

     7.5 Trust Expense  Reserve.  On the Effective Date, the Trust shall deposit
funds in the Trust Expense Reserve for the payment of Trust Expenses.  The Trust
Expense  Reserve,  as of the Effective Date,  shall be in an amount set forth in
the Plan  Supplement.  The  Trustee  may,  at any  time,  transfer  any  balance
remaining in the Trust Expense  Reserve after the payment of all Trust Expenses,
Allowed  Claims  and  Preferred  Equity   Interests,   and  reserves  have  been
established  for payment in full of all Disputed  Claims and payment as provided
by  Section  5.2(e)  for all  Disputed  Preferred  Equity  Interests  as if such
Disputed Claims and Disputed  Preferred Equity Interests had been Allowed,  into
the Equity Fund.

     7.6 Increase of Trust Expense Reserve.  To the extent the Trustee in his or
her discretion  determines that the amount of funds in the Trust Expense Reserve
is at any time or may become  insufficient,  the Trustee,  after providing three
(3) Business Days' written notice to the Trust Committee,  may from time to time
transfer to the Trust Expense Reserve out of the undistributed Equity Fund, such
amount or  amounts as the  Trustee in his or her  discretion  and  judgment  may
reasonably  determine  to be  necessary  or advisable to satisfy all current and
anticipated  obligations of the Trust. In no event shall the Trustee be required
to use his or her personal funds or assets for such purposes.

     7.7 Distributions and Reserve for Secured Claims.


     (a) On the  Effective  Date,  the  Trustee  shall  set  aside  and  deposit

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

     8.1  Method of Making  Distributions  in  Respect  of  Disputed  Claims and
Disputed Interests

     (a) Distributions Upon Allowance of Disputed Claims and Disputed Interests.
Disputed  Claims or Disputed  Interests  that become Allowed after the Effective
Date shall receive the Distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

     (b) Resolution of Disputed Claims and Disputed  Interests.  No Distribution
of payment  shall be made on account of a Disputed  Claim or  Disputed  Interest
unless and until such  Disputed  Claim or Disputed  Interest  becomes an Allowed
Claim or Allowed  Interest.  Unless otherwise  ordered by the Bankruptcy  Court,
after the Effective  Date, the Trust shall have the exclusive  right to make and
file  Objections  to and settle,  compromise  or  otherwise  resolve  Claims and
Interests.  After the Effective  Date,  the Trustee may settle or compromise any
Disputed Claim or Disputed  Interest without  approval of the Bankruptcy  Court;
provided,  however,  .that the Trustee shall consult with the Trust Committee on
any proposed  settlement  affecting  Equity  Securities ss. 510(b) Claims or any
Claim relating to the Promissory Notes.

     (c)  Determination  of  Subordination  Formula.  The average share price of
MedicaLogic/Medscape  stock to be used in computing  the  Subordination  Formula
shall be determined by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the resolution of
objections  to be filed by the  Debtors  to all  Equity  Securities  ss.  510(b)
Claims.

     (d) Estimation of Disputed Claims and Disputed  Interests.  The Debtors, or
the Trustee,  may request that the Bankruptcy  Court estimate any Disputed Claim
or  Disputed  Interest,  subject  to  estimation  under  section  502(c)  of the
Bankruptcy  Code and for  which  the  Debtors  may be liable  under  this  Plan,
including  any  Disputed  Claim for taxes  regardless  of  whether  any party in
interest  previously  objected to such Claim or Interest.  The Bankruptcy  Court
will retain  jurisdiction  to estimate any Disputed  Claim or Disputed  Interest
pursuant  to  section  502(c) of the  Bankruptcy  Code.  In the  event  that the
Bankruptcy  Court  estimates any  contingent or  unliquidated  Disputed Claim or
Disputed Interest, such estimated amount will constitute (at the Debtors' or the
Trustee's  option,  to be  exercised  at  the  commencement  of  the  estimation
proceeding)  either the  Allowed  amount of such Claim or  Interest or a maximum
limitation on the Allowed amount of such Claim or Interest, as determined by the
Bankruptcy  Court. If the estimated amount  constitutes a maximum  limitation on
the  Allowed  amount of such Claim or  Interest,  the Debtors or the Trustee may
elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate allowance
of such  Claim or  Interest.  The above  objection,  estimation  and  resolution
procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive on one another. Disputed
Claims or Disputed  Interests  may be estimated  and  subsequently  compromised,
settled,  withdrawn  or resolved  by any  mechanism  approved by the  Bankruptcy
Court.

8.2 Delivery of Distributions. Distributions to holders of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Interests shall be made by the Trustee or agent, as the case may be, (a)
if a proof of Claim is filed in respect of a particular Claim, to the holder of
each Allowed Claim at the address of such holder set forth in the relevant proof
of Claim, as such address

<PAGE>

may have been updated pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002(g),  (b) if no proof
of Claim of Interest is filed in respect of a particular Claim, to the holder of
each  Allowed  Claim at the  address of such  holder  set forth in the  relevant
Debtor's Schedules, as such address may have been updated pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rule  2002(g),  or (c) to the holder of each Allowed  Interest at the address of
such holder as listed in the Equity Interest  ledger  maintained by or on behalf
of the applicable Debtor as of the Distribution Record Date.

     8.3 Unclaimed  Distributions.  Distribution checks issued by the Trustee or
agent in respect of Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests shall be null and void
if not cashed  within 180 days of the  issuance  thereof.  After such date,  the
distribution  in respect of such Claim or Interest  shall be deemed an Unclaimed
Distribution  and such Claim or Interest shall be forever barred.  The Cash that
otherwise would have been distributed in respect of such Unclaimed  Distribution
shall be transferred to the Equity Fund.

     8.4 De Minimis  Distributions.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
contained in the Plan or the Trust  Agreement,  the Trustee will not be required
to  distribute,  and will not  distribute,  Trust  Property  to the holder of an
Allowed  Claim or Allowed  Interest if the amount of Cash to be  distributed  on
account  of such  Claim or  Interest  is less  than $10.  Any such  holder of an
Allowed  Claim or Allowed  Interest in an amount of less than $10 will have such
Claim or Interest  discharged and will be forever barred from asserting any such
Claim or Interest against the Debtors,  the Trust or their respective  property.
Any Trust Property not distributed  pursuant to this provision will be placed in
the Equity Fund, free of any restrictions thereon.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                    EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

     9.1  Executory  Contracts  and  Unexpired  Leases to be Rejected.  The Plan
constitutes  and  incorporates  a motion by the  Debtors  to  reject,  as of the
Effective  Date, all  prepetition  executory  contracts and unexpired  leases to
which any of such  Debtors  are  parties,  except for an  executory  contract or
unexpired lease that (a) has been specifically  assumed and assigned or rejected
pursuant  to a Final  Order of the  Bankruptcy  Court or (b) is the subject of a
separate  motion  filed  pursuant to section 365 of the  Bankruptcy  Code by the
Debtors prior to the Confirmation  Date. The Confirmation Order shall constitute
an order of the  Bankruptcy  Court  approving  the  rejection  of all  executory
contracts and unexpired  leases and such rejection shall be deemed  effective as
of the Effective Date.

     9.2 Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrants.  Regardless  of  whether  any of the
Debtors'  common  equity  securities  options  and/or  warrants  are  or  may be
executory  contracts,  all options and warrants may be exercised pursuant to the
terms of such option or warrant until the Effective  Date. Any option or warrant
not  exercised  prior to the  Effective  Date  shall be  rejected  and  canceled
pursuant to section  1123(a)(5)(F)  of the Bankruptcy  Code. The total number of
MedicaLogic/Medscape  issued and  outstanding  shares of common  stock  shall be
increased  to reflect  the  exercise of any and all such  options  and  warrants
exercised prior to the Effective Date.

<PAGE>

     9.3 Bar Date for Rejection  Damage Claims.  If the rejection by the Debtor,
pursuant to this Plan, of any executory contract, unexpired lease, common equity
option,  warrant, or right of conversion pursuant to Section 9.1 gives rise to a
Claim by the  non-Debtor  party or  parties  to such  contract,  lease,  option,
warrant  or  right,  such  Claim  shall  be  forever  barred  and  shall  not be
enforceable against the Debtors or the Trust or its properties unless a proof of
Claim is filed with the Bankruptcy  Court and served upon counsel to the Debtors
and  counsel  to the  Trust  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the entry of the
Confirmation  Order. Any rejection Claim shall be deemed a Disputed Claim unless
Allowed by Final Order.

     9.4  Damages  for  Rejection.  To the extent  all or a part of the  damages
asserted in such a rejection Claim are Allowed by Final Order,  such Claim shall
be classified  and treated  under the Plan as a Class 3 Unsecured  Claim for the
relevant Debtor.

 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTs TO FIRST AMENDED JOINT PLAN OF LIQUIDATION OF THE DEBTORS
                     UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

         MSCP Holdings, Inc. and its affiliated debtors and debtors in
possession (collectively, the "Debtors") hereby file these Technical Amendments
to the First Amended Joint Plan of Liquidation of the Debtors Under Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code Dated as of December 20, 2002 (the "Plan"1):

     1. Section 2.4 of the Plan is hereby  amended and restated as follows:

     2.4 Priority Tax Claims

     Each  holder of an Allowed  Priority  Tax Claim  against  any Debtor  shall
receive,  at the sole option of the relevant  Debtor:  (a) payment in Cash in an
amount  equal to such  Allowed  Priority  Tax  Claim on the tenth  Business  Day
following  the later of (i) the  Effective  Date, or (ii) the date on which such
Priority Tax Claim becomes an Allowed  Priority Tax Claim (or as soon thereafter
as practicable);  provided that the Debtors have Cash in an amount sufficient to
pay all Allowed Priority Tax Claims as provided herein,  and the Priority Claims
Reserve contains an amount in Cash equal to the sum of all Disputed Priority Tax
Claims;  (b) cash  payments  over a period  not  exceeding  six years  after the
assessment  of the tax on which  such  Claim is  based  on the  duration  of the
Trust),  totaling  the  principal  amount of such  Claim  plus  simple  interest
accruing from the Effective Date,  calculated at the effective interest rate for
90-day  securities  obligations  issued by the  United  States  Treasury  on the
Effective  Date, or, if no such securities were issued on the Effective Date, on
the date of issuance immediately preceding the Effective Date; or (c) such other
treatment agreed to by the relevant Debtor and the holder of such Claim

     2. Section 11.2 of the Plan is hereby amended and restated as follows:

     11.2 Injunction Except as otherwise  specifically  provided in this Plan or
the  Confirmation  Order and except as may be  necessary  to enforce or remedy a
breach of this Plan and/or the Trust Agreement, or as may be necessary to assert
any  entity's  rights  in the  proceeds  of  insurance  issued  on behalf of the
Debtors,  to the extent  available,  as of the Effective Date, all entities that
have held,  currently  hold,  or may hold Claims or other  debts or  liabilities
against the Debtors,  or an Interest or other right of an equity security holder
in any or all of the Debtors,  are,  with respect to any such Claim or Interest,
permanently enjoined from and after the Confirmation Date from taking any of the
following  actions:  (i)  commencing  or  continuing in any manner any action or
other  proceeding  against the Debtors,  the Trust or the Trust  Property,  (ii)
enforcing, levying, attaching,  collecting or otherwise recovering in any manner
any  judgment,  award,  decree or order against the Debtors,  the Trust,  or the
Trust Property; (iii) creating,  perfecting or enforcing any lien or encumbrance
against the Debtors,  the Trust or the Trust Property;  (iv) asserting a setoff,
or right of subrogation or recoupmentof  any kind against any debtor,  liability
or  obligation  due to the Debtors or the Trust or the Trust  Property,  and (v)
commencing or continuing any action,  in any manner,  in any place that does not
comply with or is inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan.

     3. Section 11.3 of the Plan is hereby amended and restated as follows:

     11.3  Limitation  of  LiabilityNotwithstanding  any other  provision of the
Plan, neither the Debtors, the Equity Committee,  the Trust, the Trustee nor any
of their  respective  members,  directors,  officers,  agents,  representatives,
professionals,  financial  advisors,  attorneys,  accountants or employees shall
have any  liability to any holder of a Claim or Interest or any other entity for
any  postpetition  act,  event or omission taken or to be taken in good faith in
connection  with, or arising out of, the Chapter 11 Cases, or in connection with
the formulation,  negotiation,  confirmation or consummation of the Plan, or the
administration  of the Plan or the property to be distributed under the Plan. In
no event shall "good faith" (as the term is used in this paragraph) be construed
to limit the liability of an entity for willful misconduct or gross negligence."


     4. Except as expressly amended hereby,  all other aspects of the Plan shall
remain unaffected and in full force and effect.


(1) Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Plan or in the First Amended Disclosure Statement
relating to the Plan (the "Disclosure Statement").

                           ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUST

     1.1 Declaration of Trust.  Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, all
Assets will vest in the Trust, to be held and  administered by the Trust for the
Trust Beneficiaries  pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Plan.
The Trust will be deemed for all purposes to be the  successor of the Debtors in
accordance with the Plan. Section 7.3 of the Plan provides that on the Effective
Date,  the Trust shall be  established as a grantor trust pursuant to this Trust
Agreement for the purposes of assuming all of the debts and  liabilities  of the
Debtors and their Estates,  and liquidating and  distributing the Trust Property
for the benefit of the Trust Beneficiaries, in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan and this Trust  Agreement as promptly and  efficiently as is reasonably
practicable.  The Plan further  provides  that the Trust shall be a  liquidating
trust  that  shall not carry on or  conduct  a trade or  business,  or accept an
assignment of any claim or right of action from, or assume any  liabilities  of,
any person or entity  other than the Debtors.  No part of the Trust  Property or
the proceeds,  revenue or income  therefrom  shall be used or disposed of by the

any time constituting the Trust Property and the Trustee hereby declares that it
shall hold such property in trust to be administered and disposed of pursuant to
the terms of this  Trust  Agreement  and the Plan for the  benefit  of the Trust
Beneficiaries.  The  Trustee is further  authorized  to make  disbursements  and
payments from the Trust Property in accordance with the provisions of this Trust
Agreement and the Plan.

     1.4 Creation of Trust Expense  Reserve.  The funds  constituting  the Trust
Expense  Reserve are to be used by the Trustee solely to satisfy the expenses of
the Trust as set forth in the Plan.

     1.5 Purposes of Trust. The sole purposes of this Trust are to (i) liquidate
the Trust Property in a manner calculated to conserve,  protect and maximize the
value of the Trust  Property and (ii) collect and  distribute the Trust Property
and the income and proceeds therefrom to the Trust  Beneficiaries,  in as prompt
and orderly a fashion as  practicable  after the payment of, or  provision  for,
expenses and  liabilities  of the Trust.  In the  exercise of such  powers,  the
Trustee  shall be  authorized  to (i)  pursue  all  claims  and causes of action
assigned  by the  Debtors  to the Trust,  (ii)  institute  or defend  litigation
affecting  the Trust  Property;  (iii)  contest  or settle  Claims;  (iv)  file,
litigate to final judgment,  settle or withdraw objections to Claims (subject to
Section 4.4 hereof); and (v) exercise offsets or recoupments against Claims. The
Plan  further   provides  that  the  Trust  will  be   responsible   for  making
distributions  to the  holders  of  Allowed  Claims  and  Allowed  Interests  in
accordance with the Plan. Pursuant to these express purposes, and subject to the
provisions of Article IV hereof,  the Trustee is hereby  authorized and directed
to take all  reasonable  and necessary  actions to hold,  conserve,  protect and
maximize the Trust Property and to collect upon, sell, or otherwise liquidate or
dispose of the Trust Property,  and to distribute  Trust Property and the income
and proceeds  thereon to the Trust  Beneficiaries,  in as prompt,  efficient and
orderly a fashion as reasonably practicable in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan and this Trust Agreement.

     1.6  Instruments of Further  Assurance;  Information.  The Debtors and such
persons  as shall  have the right  and power  after  the  Effective  Date,  upon
reasonable  request of the Trustee or its successors or assigns,  shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may
be  necessary  or proper to  effectively  carry out the  purposes  of this Trust
Agreement and the Plan, to transfer any property intended to be conveyed hereby,
and to vest in the Trust,  the Trust  Property,  powers and instruments in trust
hereunder.

     1.7 Valuation of Trust Assets.  As soon as practicable  after the Effective
Date, but in no event later than ninety (90) days thereafter,  the Trustee shall
inform the Trust  Beneficiaries  and the Debtors in writing as to its good faith
estimate of the value of the Assets  transferred  to the Trust.  Such  valuation
shall be used consistently by all parties,  including,  without limitation,  the
Debtors, the Trustee,  and the Trust  Beneficiaries,  for all federal income tax
purposes.

                                   ARTICLE II

                        DURATION AND TERMINATION OF TRUST

     2.1 Duration.  This Trust shall terminate four (4) years from the Effective
Date unless an earlier  termination  is required  by  applicable  law, or unless
earlier  terminated  following the  distribution of all of the Trust Property in
accordance  with  Section 3.3 hereof,  provided,  however,  that the Trustee may
extend the duration of the Trust if the Trust Property has not been  distributed
or if the Trustee determines that such extension is in the best interests of the
Trust and the Trust Beneficiaries; provided, further, that any such extension of
the term of the Trust shall be subject to the approval of the  Bankruptcy  Court
upon a finding that such  extension is necessary to the  liquidating  purpose of
the  Trust  based on the  particular  facts  and  circumstances,  and that  such
approval  is obtained  within six (6) months of the  beginning  of the  extended
term;  provided,  further,  that in no event shall the  duration of the Trust be
extended beyond the day that is seven (7) years after the Effective Date.

     2.2 Continuance of Trust for Winding Up. After the termination of the Trust
and for the purpose of liquidating and winding up the affairs of the Trust,  the
Trustee  shall  continue to act as such until all duties under the Plan and this
Trust Agreement have been fully performed. Upon distribution of all of the Trust
Property,  the Trustee shall hold the books,  records and files  delivered to or
created by the  Trustee for a period of four (4) years.  All costs and  expenses
associated with the storage of such documents shall be paid by the Trust. At the
Trustee's  discretion,  all such records and  documents  may be destroyed at any
time after four (4) years from the  distribution  of all of the Trust  Property.
Except as otherwise  specifically  provided herein, upon the distribution of all
of the Trust  Property,  the Trustee shall have no further duties or obligations
hereunder  except (i) to account and report as provided in Sections 2.3, 3.4 and
3.5 hereof and (ii) to perform such other acts as may be required by law.

     2.3 Final Accounting. Upon termination of the Trust, the Trustee shall file
an accounting  with the Bankruptcy  Court setting forth the amount he or she has
collected and disbursed, and the fees and expenses incurred in administering the
Trust,  including  the  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by the  Trustee  and  its
professionals  and the  professionals,  if any, retained by the Trust Committee.
The Trustee shall seek the issuance and entry of any orders necessary to approve
such  accounting  and  discharge  it from any and all  liability  for  acting as
Trustee under the Plan and this Trust Agreement. The Trust's professionals,  and
the professionals,  if any, retained by the Trust Committee shall be required to
maintain accurate time and expense records.

     3.1.  Payment of Expenses  and  Liabilities.  The  Trustee  shall pay Trust
Expenses  as set  forth in  Section  1.18 of the Plan  from  funds in the  Trust
Expense Reserve.

     3.2 Increase of Trust Expense Reserve Using Trust  Property.  To the extent
the Trustee in its discretion  determines  that the amount of funds in the Trust
Expense Reserve is at any time or may become  insufficient,  the Trustee,  after
providing  three (3) Business Days' written notice to the Trust  Committee,  may
from time to time transfer to the Trust Expense Reserve out of the undistributed
Equity  Fund,  such  amount or amounts  as the  Trustee  in its  discretion  and
judgment  may  reasonably  determine to be necessary or advisable to satisfy all
current and anticipated  obligations of the Trust. In no event shall the Trustee
be required to use its personal funds or assets for such purposes.

     3.3  Disbursement to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed  Interests.  The

in  accordance  with  Article  VII of the  Plan  and  the  following  terms  and
conditions:

     (a) Any payments to be made by the Trust to the Trust  Beneficiaries  shall
be made only from the Trust Property and only to the extent that the Trust shall

meet  Claims  and  contingent  liabilities  (including  Disputed  Claims)  or as
otherwise  required by the Plan.  The Trust shall not be permitted to receive or
retain cash or cash equivalents in excess of a reasonable  amount to meet Claims
and contingent liabilities (including Disputed Claims), to maintain the value of
the Trust Property during liquidation, or as otherwise required by the Plan. Any
such "excess" cash or cash  equivalents  shall be available for  distribution in

of the Trustee.  Unclaimed distributions shall be treated in accordance with the
terms of the Plan.

     (d) Upon resolution of a Disputed Claim, any  distributions  reserved in an
amount  greater than that  required to be  distributed  as a result of the order
allowing or  disallowing  such  Disputed  Claim shall become Trust  Property and
available for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

     (e) The  Trustee  may  require  any holder of an  Allowed  Claim or Allowed
Interest  entitled to a distribution  from the Trust,  to furnish to the Trustee
such  holder's  Employer  Identification  Number or Federal  Tax  Identification

such holder upon receipt of such identification number.

     (f) All checks shall be  transmitted  by United  States Post  Office--First
Class Mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the payee at the last known address
of the payee supplied by the Claims Agent.

each calendar  quarter or upon the  termination of the Trust,  the Trustee shall
distribute to the Trust Committee,  a written report and account showing (i) the

with respect to debt instruments  issued with original issue discount ("OID"), a
statement  indicating  the amount of OID accruing on the interests  held by such
Trust Beneficiaries.

     3.5 Income Tax Information.

     (a) The Trust  will be treated as a grantor  trust for  federal  income tax
purposes and, to the extent  permitted under applicable law, for state and local
income tax purposes. The Trust Beneficiaries, other than those that were holders
of Allowed  Claims,  will be treated as grantors  and owners of their  allocable
portion of the Trust for federal income tax purposes.  The beneficial  interests
in the Trust held by Trust  Beneficiaries  that were  holders of Allowed  Claims
will be  treated  as debt  instruments  of the  Trust  for  federal  income  tax
purposes. The portion of each of the Secured Claims Reserve, the Priority Claims
Reserve,  and the Unsecured Claims reserve that relates to Disputed Claims (such
portions  collectively,  the "Disputed  Claims Reserve") will be segregated from
the Trust for federal  income tax  purposes  and  treated as a separate  taxable
entity.

     (b) The Trust shall prepare,  consistent  with Section  3.5(a) hereof,  and
file on behalf of the  Trust,  at the time and in the manner  prescribed  by the
Internal  Revenue Code and applicable  state and local law, such tax returns and
reports as may be  required,  including  but not  limited to returns and reports
required by Treasury Regulations section 1.671-4(a),  and shall promptly furnish
copies of such returns and reports as filed to the Trust Committee.  The Trustee
shall  pay or cause to be paid any and all  taxes  imposed  on the  Trust or the
Disputed Claims Reserve.

     (c) As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Trustee
shall mail to the Trust  Committee a statement  showing the dates and amounts of
all distributions  made by the Trust and such other information as is reasonably
available to the Trust which may be relevant to the proper reporting of income.

     (d) The Trust may retain  professionals  to perform  the  Trustee's  duties
under  this  Section  3.5  and,  subject  to  Section  5.6,  may  rely  upon the
performance of such professionals with respect to such duties.

     3.6 Withholding of Taxes and Other Charges. The Trust may withhold from any
amounts distributable at any time to the Trust Beneficiaries such sum or sums as
may be  necessary  to pay any taxes or other  charges  which have been or may be
imposed on the Trust or the Trust Beneficiaries under the income tax laws of the
United  States or of any state or political  subdivision  or entity by reason of
any  distribution  provided  for in Section 3.3 hereof or in the Plan,  whenever
such withholding is required by any law, regulation,  rule, ruling, directive or
other  governmental  requirement,  and  the  Trustee,  in  the  exercise  of its
discretion  and  judgment,  may  enter  into  agreements  with  taxing  or other
authorities  for the payment of such  amounts as may be  withheld in  accordance
with the  provisions  of this Section 3.6.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  but
without prejudice to the Trust's rights hereunder, the Trust Beneficiaries shall
have the right  with  respect  to the  United  States or any state or  political
subdivision  or entity to contest the  imposition  of any tax or other charge by
reason of any distribution hereunder or under the Plan.

     3.7  Other.  The  Trustee  shall  file,  or cause to be  filed,  any  other
statements,  returns, or disclosures  relating to the Trust that are required by
any governmental unit or applicable law.

this Trust  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the Trustee may liquidate such
investments if the Trustee determines in its discretion that such liquidation is

The Trustee  shall charge its  customary  hourly  rates of $275-$300  for senior
managers and $50 for staff assistants.

     5.2  Resignation.  The  Trustee  may  resign  as  Trustee  hereunder  by an
instrument in writing signed by the Trustee and filed with the Bankruptcy  Court
with a copy served on each member of the Trust Committee. Such resignation shall
become  effective  [ninety 90] days  following the giving of such notice or upon
the earlier  appointment of a successor  Trustee pursuant to Section 5.4 of this
Trust Agreement.

for cause shown and upon notice and a hearing.

     5.4  Appointment of Successor  Trustee.  In the event of the resignation or

subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, after notice and a hearing. The
successor  Trustee shall give written  notice of his or her  appointment  to the
Trust Beneficiaries as soon thereafter as is practicable.  Any successor Trustee
appointed  hereunder  shall execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to the Bankruptcy
Court and the retiring Trustee an instrument duly accepting such appointment and
agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Trust  Agreement  and  thereupon  such
successor Trustee, without further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become vested

Agreement. All fees and expenses of the Trustee shall be paid unless disputed by
the successor Trustee, in which case such dispute shall be subject to resolution
by the Bankruptcy Court.

     5.5 Trust Continuance.  The resignation or removal of the Trustee shall not
operate to terminate the Trust or to revoke any existing agency created pursuant
to the terms of this Trust Agreement or invalidate any action  theretofore taken
by the Trustee or any prior Trustee.  In the event of the resignation or removal
of the Trustee,  such Trustee shall promptly execute and deliver such documents,
instruments  and other writings as may be reasonably  requested by the successor
Trustee to effect the  termination  of the Trustee's  capacity  under this Trust
Agreement and the  conveyance of the Trust  Property then held by the Trustee to
such  Trustee's  successor;  deliver to the  successor  Trustee  all  documents,
instruments,  records and other  writings  related to the Trust as may be in the
possession of the Trustee;  and otherwise  assist and cooperate in effecting the
assumption of his or her obligations and functions by such successor Trustee.

     5.6 Reliance by Trustee. The Trustee may rely, and shall be fully protected
personally in acting upon, any resolution, statement,  certificate,  instrument,
opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  consent,  order,  or other  instrument  or
document  which the  Trustee  believes  to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented  by the  proper  party  or  parties  or,  in  the  case  of  facsimile
transmissions  or  electronic  mail,  to have been sent by the  proper  party or
parties,  in each case without  obligation  to satisfy  itself that the same was
given  in  good  faith  and  without  responsibility  for  errors  in  delivery,
transmission,  or receipt. In the absence of fraud,  willful misconduct or gross
negligence  on the Trustee's  part,  the Trustee may rely as to the truth of any
statements contained therein in acting thereon. The Trustee may consult with and
rely  on  the  advice  of  legal  counsel  and  such  other  experts,  advisors,
consultants or other  professionals as shall have been retained pursuant to this
Trust  Agreement and shall be fully  protected in respect of any action taken or
suffered by them in accordance with the written opinion of legal counsel.

     5.7 Standard of Care.  Except in the case of fraud,  willful  misconduct or
gross  negligence,  the  Trustee  shall not be liable  for any loss or damage by
reason of any action taken or omitted by the Trustee pursuant to the discretion,
power and authority  conferred on the Trustee by this Trust Agreement,  the Plan
and the Confirmation Order.

     5.8 No Liability for Acts of  Predecessor  Trustees.  No successor  Trustee
shall be in any way liable for the acts or omissions of any predecessor  Trustee
unless a successor Trustee expressly assumes such responsibility.

     5.9  Insurance.  The  Trustee  may  purchase,  at the expense of the Trust,
errors and omissions insurance with regard to any liabilities,  losses, damages,
claims, costs and expenses it may incur, including but not limited to attorneys'
fees,  arising out of or due to its actions or omissions or consequences of such
actions or omissions,  other than as a result of its fraud,  gross negligence or
willful misconduct,  with respect to the implementation of this Trust Agreement,
the Plan or the Confirmation Order.

     5.10 No  Implied  Obligations.  No Trustee  shall be liable  except for the
performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth herein,
and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Trust.

<PAGE>

     5.11 No Personal Liability. Persons dealing with the Trust must look solely
to the Trust or Trust  Property for the  enforcement  of any claims  against the
Trust or to satisfy any  liability  incurred  by the Trustee to such  persons in
carrying  out the terms of this  Trust,  and  neither  the Trustee nor the Trust
Committee shall have any personal liability or individual  obligation to satisfy
any such liability.

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Trust
