                      [Berthel Fisher & Company Letterhead]

                                                                 January 9, 2003

Mr. Gene Davis, CEO
Murdock Communications Corporation

Dear Gene:

     Pursuant to discussions in preparation of the filing of the S-4 for the
merger of Murdock Communications Corporation ("MCC") and Polar Molecular
Corporation ("Polar"), Berthel Fisher & Company Financial Services, Inc.
("BFCFS") has been requested to specify an amount for which BFCFS and Berthel
Fisher & Company Management Corp. would settle all outstanding investment
banking fees, success fees, office rental payments, expenses and other amounts
due from MCC.

     Therefore, we make the following offer to settle all such amounts that may
be outstanding as of the closing of the MCC/Polar merger or due in conjunction
with the MCC/Polar merger.

          .    750,000 shares of MCC common stock, issuable immediately prior to
               the merger;
                                     - and -
          .    Pursuant to our previous understanding, BFCFS is to receive up to
               $90,000 in cash for these fees, expenses, etc. from MCC loans
               from Polar with respect to funds raised in the Polar Additional
               Offering. With respect to this, BFCFS will take MCC common shares
               valued at $1/share for any cash shortfall related to this
               $90,000, issuable immediately prior to the merger.

     Gene, the current accrual of fees, expenses, etc. on MCC's books are
roughly $510,000 + with, obviously, additions being accrued each month. We
believe this would be the best way to handle for both parties.

     If this is agreeable to MCC, please acknowledge below and return a copy of
this letter to my attention. If you have any questions, please contact me.

                                              Sincerely,


                                              /s/ Ronald O. Brendengen

                                              Ronald O. Brendengen
                                              Chief Financial Officer
