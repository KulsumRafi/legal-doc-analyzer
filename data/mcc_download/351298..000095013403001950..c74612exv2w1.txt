<PAGE>



shall agree to pay, perform and discharge when due only the following
liabilities of Seller (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"):

     (a) the Purchased Contracts (including liability for customer deposits
under such contracts as set forth in Schedule 2.2(a) in an amount equal to the
customer cash deposits included as Purchased Assets);

     (b) any and all implied and/or express warranty obligations for any and all
Products and/or services related to the Business sold by Seller pursuant to the
Purchased Contracts;

     (c) the Real Property Leases, in each case to the extent such Liabilities
relate to the period from and after the Closing;

     (d) Purchaser will not assume or be liable for any Excluded Liabilities;
and

Transferred Employees; provided, however, that Purchaser shall assume no
liability relating to any Benefit Plan maintained by Seller or its affiliates

2.3      Equity Consideration from Purchaser to Seller.
         ---------------------------------------------

         In consideration for the Purchased Assets, in addition to the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser shall issue to Seller one
million (1,000,000) HEI Shares (the "Shares") at Closing.

2.4      Rights and Obligations Associated With the Shares.
         -------------------------------------------------

     (a) Registration Rights Agreement. Purchaser and Seller agree to execute at
Closing the form of Registration Rights Agreement at Exhibit B (the
"Registration Rights Agreement").

     (b) Efforts to Find Purchaser. For so long as Seller owns more than three
percent (3%) of the issued and outstanding HEI Shares, Purchaser agrees that it
will use commercially reasonable efforts to find a qualified purchaser of the
Shares, provided that such commercially reasonable efforts shall in no event be
deemed to require (i) travel by any of Purchaser's directors, officer,
employees, shareholders or representatives or (ii) solicitations or sales
efforts that would rise to the standard typically expected of a placement agent.

     (c) Co-Sale Right. For so long as Seller owns any of the Shares, Purchaser
agrees that prior to any issuance and sale of HEI Shares (other than pursuant to
an equity compensation plan for employees or in connection with existing
obligations to issue or sell any


                                       14
<PAGE>



equity securities) (a "Triggering Issuance"), the Purchaser shall promptly
deliver to Seller written notice (the "Co-Sale Notice"). The Co-Sale Notice
shall set forth a description of the proposed Triggering Issuance, including the
name of the proposed purchaser, the number of HEI Shares involved, the purchase
price, the date on or about which the proposed Triggering Issuance is to be made
and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Triggering Issuance.

          (i) Seller may exercise its co-sale right hereunder by notifying
     Purchaser in writing, within 20 days after Seller's receipt of the Co-Sale
     Notice, of the number of Shares that Seller desires to sell pursuant to the
     terms of the proposed Triggering Issuance. The Seller shall be entitled to
     sell, at the price and on the terms and conditions of the proposed
     Triggering Issuance, such number of the Shares that equals the number of
     HEI Shares as Purchaser shall sell pursuant to the Co-Sale Notice.

     (d) Restrictions on Transfers of Shares. In addition to restrictions on
transfer set forth elsewhere, the Shares shall be subject to the conditions on
transfer specified in this Section 2.5(d), which conditions are intended to
ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and state securities
laws with respect to the transfer of any such shares.

          (i) Each certificate representing the Shares shall bear a legend
     substantially in the following form until such time as the conditions of
     such legend have been met:

         "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
         REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT").
         THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW
         TO DISTRIBUTION OR RESALE, AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN
         EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR SUCH SHARES UNDER THE ACT, OR
         PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER THE ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
         SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER
         SUCH ACT. THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN QUALIFIED UNDER THE LAWS OF
         ANY STATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH QUALIFICATION
         REQUIREMENT, THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES OR THE PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF
         ANY PART OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH SECURITIES PRIOR TO SUCH
         QUALIFICATION IS UNLAWFUL.

          (ii) Purchaser may also impose any additional legend required by any
     agreement between Seller and Purchaser or other stockholders of Purchaser
     or applicable federal or state securities laws, and shall be entitled to
     issue stop transfer notices on its stock books with respect to any Shares
     until the conditions set forth in the applicable legends or in this
     Agreement or in any such other agreements have been met.

          (iii) Further Limitations on Disposition. Seller shall not make any
     disposition of all or any portion of the Shares acquired by Seller
     hereunder unless and until: (a) there is then in effect a registration
     statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed disposition and
     such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement



                                       15
<PAGE>



and any applicable requirements of state securities laws, or (b)(i) Seller
shall have notified Purchaser of the proposed disposition and shall have
furnished Purchaser with a detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding
the proposed disposition, and (ii) if reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller
shall have furnished Purchaser an opinion of counsel (except for dispositions
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which dispositions shall not so
require an opinion of counsel) reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, that such
disposition will not require registration of such Shares under the Securities
Act or the consent of or permit from appropriate authorities under any
applicable state securities law.

2.5      Subordinated Debenture.
         ----------------------

         In consideration for a loan by Seller to Purchaser of $2.6 million
(separate and in addition to the Purchased Assets and any cash included
therein), Purchaser shall issue to Seller a Subordinated Promissory Note in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Note"). The Seller shall send the
proceeds of the Note by wire transfer directly to the parties indicated on
Schedule 2.5, in the amounts indicated thereon. Schedule 2.5 shall indicate that
$1,803,000 of the Note proceeds (of which $3,000 shall constitute the Escrow
Agent's fee) shall be sent by wire transfer directly to LaSalle Bank National
Association, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Such funds shall be held in
escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement").

business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties owned or

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the terms
hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of a material benefit under, or give rise to any obligation of Seller to
make any payment under, or to the increased, additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person under, or result in the creation
of any Liens upon any of the Purchased Assets of Seller under any provision of
(i) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Seller; (ii) any Contract, or
Authorization to which Seller is a party or by which any of the Purchased Assets

applicable to the Purchased Assets as of the date hereof; or (iv) any applicable

defaults, termination, cancellation and acceleration rights and Liens that in
the aggregate would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, materially
hinder or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

Effect on Seller.

3.3      Consents.

approval, licenses, or Authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing

Purchased Intellectual Property. Seller has not received written (including,
without limitation, by electronic mail) notice of any such threatened claim and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, there are no facts or circumstances that would form
the basis for any claim of infringement, unauthorized use, or violation by any
Person against Seller, or challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any material Purchased Intellectual Property. All of Seller's
rights in and to material Purchased Intellectual Property are valid and
enforceable.

in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

5.2      Reasonable Best Efforts.
         -----------------------

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities
and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings
with Governmental Authorities, if any), and the taking of all reasonable steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties (including Seller
obtaining all of the consents listed on Schedule 5.2(d) hereof) and (iii) the

<PAGE>



execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser and Seller each shall furnish to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with obtaining
any consents required to be obtained by it hereunder.

         (b) In the event that any and all consents, approvals or waivers
necessary for the assignment, assumption or transfer of any Purchased Contract,
Purchased Intellectual Property, or Assumed Liability or issuance of the Shares
or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, shall
not have been obtained prior to the Closing Date, then as of the Closing, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to the extent permitted by Law, shall
constitute a full and equitable assignment by Seller to Purchaser and assumption
by Purchaser of all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to, and all of
Seller's obligations and liabilities under, such Purchased Contract, Purchased
Intellectual Property, or Assumed Liability. In the case of Purchased Contracts,

steps and actions to provide Purchaser with the benefits of such Purchased
Contracts and Purchased Intellectual Property, and, in the case of Contracts and

obligations thereunder, including entry into subcontracts for the performance of
Contracts.

         (c) In the event that Seller shall be unable to make the equitable
assignment and assumption described in Section 5.2(b), or if such attempted
assignment would give rise to any right of termination, or would otherwise
adversely affect the rights of Seller or Purchaser under such Purchased
Contract, Purchased Intellectual Property or Assumed Liability or would not
assign all of Seller's rights, liabilities and obligations thereunder at the
Closing, each party shall continue to cooperate with the other and, subject to
Section 5.2(a), use all reasonable best efforts to provide the other party with
all intended rights, liabilities and obligations. To the extent that any such
consents and waivers are not obtained, or until the impediments to such
assignment are resolved, each party shall, subject to Section 5.2(a), use all
reasonable best efforts to (i) provide to Purchaser, at the request of
Purchaser, the benefits of any such Purchased Contract or Purchased Intellectual
Property, (ii) provide to Seller, at the request of Seller, the relief of the
performance, liability and other obligations thereunder and under any such
Assumed Liability, (iii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement
designed to provide such benefits to either party, and (iv) enforce, at the
request of and for the account of the other party, any rights, or relief, of
such other party arising from any such Purchased Contract, Purchased
Intellectual Property or Assumed Liability against any third Person, including

upon the advice of such other Party. To the extent that Purchaser is provided
the benefits of any Purchased Contract or Purchased Intellectual Property
referred to herein (whether from Seller or otherwise), Purchaser shall perform
the obligations of Seller thereunder or in connection therewith.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
in this Section 5.2 shall require Seller or Purchaser to expend any sum (other
than an immaterial sum), make a financial commitment (other than an immaterial
financial commitment) or grant or


                                       43
<PAGE>



agree to any concession (other than an immaterial concession) to any Third Party
or Governmental Authority to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver.

5.3      Non-Solicitation; Non-Compete.
         -----------------------------

         (a) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not
and shall use its reasonable efforts (provided that Seller shall not be required
to incur more than an immaterial cost) to cause its Affiliates not to: (i)
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of Seller who are or become
employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates to leave such employment or hire,
employ or otherwise engage any such individual; (ii) cause, induce or encourage
any material actual or prospective client, customer, supplier, or licensor of
the Business, (including any existing or former customer of Seller and any
Person that becomes a client or customer of the Business after the Closing) or
any other Person who has a material business relationship with the Business, to
terminate or change any such actual or prospective relationship in a manner
which would be materially adverse to the Business; or (iii) conduct, participate
or engage, directly or indirectly, in any business (A) involving the provision
of any Products and services currently provided by Seller in connection with the
Business or (B) that is otherwise directly and substantially competitive with
the Business anywhere in the world (a "Restricted Business"); provided, however,
that (1) the restrictions contained in this Section 5.3 shall not restrict the
acquisition by Seller, directly or indirectly, of less than 2% of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted
Business, (2) that Seller's subsidiary, CIVCO Medical Instruments Co., Inc., an
Iowa corporation ("CIVCO"), shall not be prohibited from engaging in the
provision of any products or services currently provided by it in connection
with its business, including without limitation, researching, designing,
developing, manufacturing or selling products and services in the ultrasound and
minimally invasive markets, (3) that clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section
5.3(a) shall not be deemed to prohibit a purchaser of Seller or CIVCO from
engaging in the activities contemplated in (ii) and (iii) in any manner,
including, but not limited to, engaging in such activities through Seller or
CIVCO, and (4) that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such purchaser of Seller or
CIVCO shall not be permitted to solicit with respect to the subject matter of an
existing Contract of the Business.

         (b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 5.3 relate
to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this Section 5.3 will cause irreparable injury
to the parties, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine
and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, Purchaser will be
entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 5.3.
The rights and remedies provided by this Section 5.3 are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder or
at law or in equity. In the event that Purchaser were to seek damages for any
breach of this Section 5.3, the portion of the consideration delivered to Seller
hereunder which is attributed by the parties to the foregoing covenant shall not
be considered a measure of or limit on such damages.

         (c) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time
period, a specified geographical


                                       44
<PAGE>



area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this
Section 5.3 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser
time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
which is determined to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public
policy may be enforced against the applicable party.

         ------------

         Upon completion of the Closing, Seller shall cease using all Trade
Names and all other Purchased Intellectual Property. Seller agrees that

of ninety (90) days following the Closing Date on packaging materials, displays,
signs, promotional materials and other materials and (ii) on existing inventory

manufactured Products; provided that Purchaser shall cease to use such names and
marks on newly manufactured products as soon as reasonably practicable.

         -------------------

         The parties shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.

5.6      Announcements.
         -------------

         Prior to the Closing, neither Seller nor Purchaser nor their respective
Affiliates will issue any press release or otherwise make any written public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of the Nasdaq National Market (including pursuant to U.S.
federal securities laws), in which event the party required to make the release
or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time, in light of the
circumstances, to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate concerning the timing and content
of all press releases and public statements concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5.7      Certain Information.
         -------------------

         After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Purchaser and Seller
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other and their respective
accountants, counsel and other representatives access, during normal business
hours, to such information as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting
and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, reports
or forms or the defense of, prosecution of, or response required under, or
pursuant to, any lawsuit, action or proceeding or in order to enable the parties
to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement. Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, retain until seven
(7) years after the Closing Date all such records pertaining to the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities which are owned by such Person


                                       45
<PAGE>



immediately after the Closing; provided, however, that, from and after the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, a party may dispose of such records if,
before disposing of any such records, the applicable party shall give notice to
such effect to the other and shall give the other, at the other's cost and
expense, the opportunity to remove and retain all or any part of such records as
the other may select. Each party shall reimburse the other party for reasonable
Third Party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the
requesting party, pursuant to this Section 5.7. Neither party shall be required
by this Section 5.7 to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations.

5.8      Further Assurances.
         ------------------

         (a) From time to time, as and when requested by any party, each of the
parties hereto shall, at its expense except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, execute such documents and other instruments and take such further
actions (subject to Section 5.2) as may be reasonably required or desirable to
carry out the provisions hereof and consummate and evidence the transactions
contemplated hereby (including causing the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI to be satisfied as promptly as practicable) or, at and after the
Closing Date, to evidence the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including executing and delivering or causing to be executed to
the other party such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, assumption agreements,
consents and other instruments of transfer or assumption as the other party or
its counsel may reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

         (b) Without limiting the provisions of Article X, if, following the
Closing, Purchaser identifies (or, as hereinafter provided, receives a copy of)
a Material Contract that Seller incorrectly failed to include on Schedule
3.8(a), Purchaser may, at its election, assume such Contract promptly following
such identification, in which event such Contract shall constitute a Purchased
Contract as of such date of assumption. If Seller identifies any such Contract
following the Closing, Seller shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to
Purchaser.

         For so long as Seller holds any of the Shares, and provided that Seller
does not purchase or otherwise acquire any additional HEI Shares, Purchaser
agrees not to take any action to redeem, purchase or exchange any of its equity
securities if such action would result in Seller holding 20% or more of the
outstanding capital stock of Purchaser. In the event such an action is taken,
Purchaser agrees to immediately repurchase, at a price per share equal to the
greater of (a) the current trading price or (b) $3.00, such number of the Shares
as is necessary to reduce Seller's holding below 20%.

         ---------------------------------

         Neither Purchaser nor Seller may rely on the failure of any condition

         shall not have been waived by Purchaser;

                  (iii) by Seller if any of the conditions set forth in Sections

9.1      Transferred Employees.

         Within two (2) business days following the Closing, Purchaser shall

(the "Purchaser Indemnifiable Costs").

this Agreement and the Closing Date, and shall only survive and be of effect
until the date that is two years after the Closing Date.

         (c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any party pursuant
to Section 10.2 shall be effective only when the applicable representation or
warranty is effective pursuant to this Section 10.1

10.2     Indemnification.
         ---------------

         (a) Subject to Section 10.1(c), Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its managers, officers, employees and agents (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Damages arising
out of, based upon or with respect to (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any Purchaser Ancillary
Document, (ii) the breach by Purchaser of any of the covenants and agreements on
its part to be performed under this Agreement or the Purchaser Ancillary
Documents, (iii) any Assumed Liabilities and (iv) subject to the other
provisions of this Section 10.2, the ownership of the Purchased Assets or the
operation of the Business by Purchaser after the Closing Date, except for the
Excluded Liabilities. To the extent that a given claim for indemnification in
favor of the Seller Indemnified Parties actually arises under both Section
10.2(a)(i) (without regard to the applicable Survival Period) or 10.2(a)(ii) and
Section 10.2(a)(iii), then to such extent such claim shall be deemed to only
have arisen under Section 10.2(a)(iii).

         (b) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Damages arising out of,

of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any Seller Ancillary Document, (ii)
the breach by any Seller of any of the covenants and agreements on its part to
be performed under this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents and (iii)
any Excluded Liability. To the extent that a given claim for indemnification in
favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties actually arises under both Section
10.2(b)(i) (without regard to the applicable Survival Period) or 10.2(b)(ii) and
Section 10.2(b)(iii), then to such extent such claim shall be deemed to only
have arisen under Section 10.2(b)(iii).


                                       54
<PAGE>



         (c) For the purposes of administering the indemnification provisions of
this Section 10.2, the following procedures shall apply from and after the
Closing Date:

                  (i) Each indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of any
         Indemnification Event in writing and in reasonable detail within ten
         (10) Business Days following the receipt of notice of the commencement
         of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim against such
         indemnified party, or giving rise to indemnity pursuant to Section 10.2
         (any notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of a
         claim which is amended so as to give rise to an Indemnification Event,
         from the first day such claim is amended to include any claim which is
         an Indemnification Event hereunder) and shall indicate in such
         notification whether such indemnified party is requesting
         indemnification with respect to such Indemnification Event and the
         amount of indemnification initially anticipated (if the same is capable
         of estimation). The failure to give notice as required by this Section
         10.2(c)(i) in a timely fashion shall not result in a waiver of any
         right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the
         Indemnitor's ability to defend against the event with respect to which
         indemnification is sought is actually adversely affected by the failure
         of the indemnified party to give notice in a timely fashion as required
         by this Section 10.2 (except that the Indemnitor shall not be liable
         for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified
         party failed to give such notice).

                  (ii) After notification is given as aforesaid, the Indemnitor
         shall be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the defense or
         settlement of any such action or proceeding, or to participate in any
         negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim;
         provided, however, that in the event the Indemnitor assumes any such
         defense or settlement or any such negotiations, it shall actively
         pursue such defense, settlement or negotiations in good faith. If the
         Indemnitor fails to elect in writing within twenty (20) Business Days
         after the notification referred to above to assume the defense, the
         indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise
         dispose of such action or proceeding.

                  (iii) In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense or
         settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
         shall be entitled to assume the defense or settlement thereof with
         counsel of its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably
         satisfactory to the indemnified party, provided that the Indemnitor
         shall not be entitled to settle, compromise, decline to appeal, or
         otherwise dispose of any such action, proceeding or claim without the
         consent or agreement of the indemnified party (which consent will not
         be unreasonably withheld or delayed and will be granted if required by
         the last sentence of Section 10.2(c)(v)).

                  (iv) In any case in which the Indemnitor assumes the defense
         or settlement thereof, the indemnified party shall be entitled to
         continue to participate at its own cost in any such action or
         proceeding or in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise
         eliminate any claim for which indemnification is being sought and shall
         have the right to employ its own counsel (which counsel shall be
         reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor) in any such case (it being
         understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense), but the
         fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
         indemnified party unless (A) the employment of such counsel shall have
         been authorized in writing by the Indemnitor in


                                       55
<PAGE>



         connection with the defense of such suit, action, claim or proceeding,
         (B) the Indemnitor shall not have employed counsel (reasonably
         satisfactory to the indemnified party) to take charge of the defense of
         such action, suit, claim or proceeding reasonably promptly after notice
         of commencement of the action, suit, claim or proceeding, or (C) such
         indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel in writing that
         there may be defenses available to it which are different from or
         additional to those available to the Indemnitor which, if the
         Indemnitor and the indemnified party were to be represented by the same
         counsel, would reasonably be expected to result in a conflict of
         interest for such counsel or materially prejudice the prosecution of
         the defenses available to such indemnified party. If any of the events
         specified in clauses (B) or (C) of the preceding sentence shall have
         occurred or shall otherwise be applicable, then the reasonable fees and
         expenses of one counsel or firm of counsel selected by the indemnified
         party shall be borne by the Indemnitor.

                  (v) In the event indemnification is requested, the relevant
         Indemnitor, its representatives and agents shall have access to the
         premises, books, records and employees of the indemnified party or
         parties seeking such indemnification to the extent reasonably necessary
         to assist it in defending or settling any action, proceeding or claim;
         provided, however, that such access shall be conducted in such manner
         as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of
         the indemnified party or parties and shall only take place in the
         presence of a representative of the indemnified party or parties unless
         otherwise so agreed and the indemnified party shall not be required to
         disclose any information with respect to itself or any of its
         Affiliates or former Affiliates (other than any such Affiliate or
         former Affiliate which is a party to this Agreement), and shall not be
         required to participate in the defense of any claim to be indemnified
         hereunder (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein), unless such
         disclosure or participation is otherwise required or reasonably
         necessary in the defense of any claim to be indemnified hereunder. In
         the event indemnification is requested, the indemnified parties shall
         (i) retain all records and information that are reasonably relevant to
         the claim to be indemnified hereunder, (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor,
         within five (5) Business Days after the relevant indemnified party's
         receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
         papers) received by such indemnified party relating to the claim to be
         indemnified hereunder and (iii) make employees available on a mutually
         convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
         any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnitor assumes
         the defense or settlement of a claim to be indemnified hereunder, the
         indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
         settle, compromise or discharge, such claim without the Indemnitor's
         prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld). If the Indemnitor assumes the defense or settlement of a
         claim to be indemnified hereunder, the indemnified party shall agree to
         any settlement, compromise or discharge of such claim that the
         Indemnitor may recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnitor
         to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such claim
         and which (x) releases the indemnified party completely in connection
         with such claim and (y) has no material and adverse effect on Purchaser
         (or its Affiliates) after the Closing.

                  (vi) In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
         against any Indemnitor that does not involve a claim being asserted
         against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party by any
         other person, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim
         with reasonable promptness to the Indemnitor. Subject to Section 10.1,
         the failure by any


                                       56
<PAGE>



         indemnified party so to notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the
         Indemnitor from any liability that it may have to such indemnified
         party under Section 10.2, except to the extent that the Indemnitor
         demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced by such failure. If
         the Indemnitor does not notify the indemnified party within fifteen
         (15) Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the
         Indemnitor disputes its liability to the indemnified party under
         Section 10.2, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such
         notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor under
         Section 10.2 and the Indemnitor shall pay the amount of such liability
         to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in
         which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on
         such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof)
         becomes finally determined. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its
         liability with respect to such claim as provided above, the Indemnitor
         and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
         resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations,
         such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
         competent jurisdiction.

                  (vii) Any amount which is required to be paid by an Indemnitor
         to any party including any reimbursement to which such party is
         entitled shall be paid by such Indemnitor promptly.

         (d) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the
indemnification obligation with respect to the subject matter of such Document
or the (ii) fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, each party to this Agreement
agrees to use all reasonable efforts to retain all Documents with respect to all
matters as to which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (except to the
extent that such Documents in the possession of a party may be transferred to
the possession of another party at the Closing pursuant to or as contemplated by
this Agreement). Before disposing of or otherwise destroying any such Documents,
the possessor thereof shall give reasonable notice to such effect and deliver to
any Indemnitor, at such Indemnitor's expense and upon its request, a copy of any
such Documents. In addition, each party to this Agreement agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cooperate and cause its employees to cooperate with and
assist the appropriate Indemnitor and indemnified party in connection with any
claim, action or proceeding for which indemnity is sought hereunder or with
respect to which an Indemnitor has elected to participate in the defense. Each
party to this Agreement agrees to make commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate or resolve any claim or liability for which indemnity is sought
hereunder; provided, however, that in the event that Purchaser or Seller shall
fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any
claim or liability, such failure shall not affect the indemnified party's right
to indemnification with respect to such claim or liability or otherwise give
rise to any claim or cause of action against the indemnified party.

         (e) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be liable to, or be required to
indemnify, any Person under Section 10.2(b)(i) or 10.2(a)(i), respectively, (A)
until the aggregate amount of Damages sustained by that party exceeds $50,000,
in which case such party shall be indemnified for the entire amount of such
Damages up to the Cap, or (B) for an aggregate amount of Damages exceeding
$2,000,000 (the "Cap") in connection with Damages related to the breach of any
representation and warranty of Seller and Purchaser in Articles III and IV ,
respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Cap
shall not apply with respect



                                       57
<PAGE>



to Damages relating to (i) Excluded Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities, (ii)
any of the covenants of Seller or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or (iii)
the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.1, 3.13,
and 4.1 of this Agreement.

         (f) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Article X shall be net of any amounts actually recovered (regardless
of when recovered) by the indemnified party under insurance policies or pursuant
to indemnity rights against persons or entities not parties to this Agreement
with respect to such Damages and shall be (i) increased to take account of any
net tax cost incurred by the indemnified party arising from the receipt of
indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to
take account of any net tax benefit realized by the indemnified party arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Damage. Purchaser and Seller shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to recover any amounts recoverable under insurance policies with respect to
Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article X.

10.3     Payment of Brokers' or Finders' Fees.
         ------------------------------------

         Seller shall pay any and all brokers' or finders' fees, or any other
commission or similar fee, payable to any person acting on behalf of Seller or
any of its Affiliates or under the authority of any of them, in connection with
any of the transactions contemplated herein, and Purchaser shall pay any and all
brokers' or finders' fees, or any other commission or similar fee, payable to
any person acting on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or under the
authority of any of them, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated herein, in each case regardless of whether any claim for payment is
asserted before or after the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
before or after any termination of this Agreement.

10.4     Purchase Price Allocation.
         -------------------------

         Not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to Seller for its review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, copies of Form 8594 and any required exhibits
thereto (the "Asset Acquisition Statement") allocating the purchase price
(including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets. Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller for its review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, from time to time revised copies of the Asset
Acquisition Statement (the "Revised Statements") so as to report any matters on
the Asset Acquisition Statement that need updating (including purchase price
adjustments, if any). The purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be
allocated in accordance with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if applicable,
the last Revised Statements, provided by Purchaser to Seller, and all income Tax
Returns and reports filed by Purchaser and Seller shall be prepared consistently
with such allocation.

10.5     Tax Matters.
         -----------

         (a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser
will (and will cause their Affiliates to) treat any indemnification payment made
or received under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price and not
as an item subject to Tax or as a reduction of a deductible item.


                                       58
<PAGE>




         (b) Seller and Purchaser shall each bear one-half of the responsibility
for (and shall indemnify and hold harmless each other against one-half of) any
sales taxes applicable to the Purchased Assets and for all other applicable
sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or
taxes or governmental charges (including real property transfer gains taxes,
UCC-3 filing fees, FAA, ICC, DOT, real estate and motor vehicle registration,
title recording or filing fees and other amounts payable in respect of transfer
filings) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than taxes measured by or with respect to income imposed on Purchaser or
its Affiliates). Seller shall file all necessary documents (including all Tax
Returns) with respect to all such amounts in a timely manner.

         (c) For purposes of clause (vii) of the definition of Excluded
Liabilities, in the case of a taxable period that includes the Closing Date,
Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets shall be allocated to the periods before
and after the Closing Date as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes such as property
taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated to periods before and after the Closing
Date on a per diem basis and (ii) in the case of Taxes based on net or gross
income, or transactional taxes such as sales taxes, the portion of such Taxes
allocable to the period before the Closing Date shall be computed on the
assumption that the taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

11.10    Severability; Enforcement.
         -------------------------

contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be brought exclusively in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the state courts of New York
located in New York County and each party hereto agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that
the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be
enforced in or by such court. Each party hereto further and irrevocably accepts
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in personam
with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding and
