<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PURPOSE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Community Bancorp is the sponsor of this incentive plan (the "Plan"). First Community Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the "Company") have designed the Plan to
focus First Community Bancorp executives on achieving the annual business plan in 2003. The Plan provides aggressive award opportunities and is intended to provide significant rewards to First
Community Bancorp's executive team for exceptional corporate performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>APPROVAL AND ADMINISTRATION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan has been approved for 2003 by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and will be administered by the Incentive Plan Committee (the "IP
Committee") which is comprised of First Community Bancorp's CEO and executives reporting directly to the CEO. The IP Committee will recommend Plan Participants; Plan Performance Measures; Performance
Measure Weights; Achievement Levels and corresponding Award Opportunities; and the Financial Threshold (each as defined herein) to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors for their
approval as early in the Plan Year as possible. At the end of the Plan Year, the IP Committee will review achievements against Performance Measures and recommend Awards (as defined herein) to the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors for their approval. In the case of any Awards granted to the CEO, the Compensation Committee will make a recommendation to the independent directors of
the Board for their approval. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretation
and application of the Plan to a particular circumstance will be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. Subject to any
authority
granted to the full Board of Directors or a committee of the independent directors thereof, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the sole and absolute power and authority to make
all factual determinations, construe and interpret terms and make eligibility and Award determinations in accordance with its interpretation of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PLAN YEAR  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is an annual plan adopted for the 2003 calendar year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>ELIGIBILITY  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives in salary grades&nbsp;1, 2, 3, A, and B are eligible for participation in the Plan. The IP Committee will review those eligible and recommend
Participants to the Board of Directors for their approval. The IP Committee may recommend executives in salary grade C for participation in the Plan on an exception basis for approval by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PARTICIPANT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual who has been selected for participation in the Plan by the IP Committee and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is a
Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PERFORMANCE MEASURES  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IP Committee will select one to two Performance Measures for the Plan for approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All Performance
Measures will be key indicators of financial performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Performance Measure will operate independently i.e. it is possible for one Performance Measure to generate an award and not the other; likewise, it is possible for one Performance
Measure to be achieved at a higher level than the other. Performance Measures will be individually weighted i.e. one Performance Measure may be counted more heavily in calculating Awards than the
other. Weights for each Performance Measure will be established at the beginning of the Plan Year by the IP Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. Achievement Levels will be established for
each Performance Measure along with corresponding Award Opportunities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
2003, the IP Committee has selected Earnings Per Share (EPS) as the sole Performance Measure for Grades&nbsp;1, 2, 3 and A. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS AND AWARD OPPORTUNITIES  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievement Levels and Award Opportunities for 2003 have been approved and are expressed as a percentage of base salary. This assumes that EPS is achieved at
various percentages of the established First Community Bancorp Plan for 2003 and illustrates the maximum Award Opportunity at each specified Achievement Level. Mathematical interpolation will be used
to calculate Awards for achievement between the levels established below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>AWARDS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards under the Plan will be determined by the IP Committee based upon achievement of Performance Measures and will be submitted to the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors for approval. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of the Plan, salary means annual base salary in effect at the end of the performance year. Awards will be made through the payroll system, minus legally required and
authorized deductions. Awards under the Plan will be considered eligible compensation or not as defined by each specific employee benefit plan for purposes of employee benefit calculations. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards
for individuals who are Participants for less than a full Plan Year will be prorated using Participant's actual base salary paid during the time of participation in the Plan.
Awards for Participants who leave First Community Bancorp during a Plan Year due to retirement, total and permanent disability or death will be prorated using the same method. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
be eligible to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must have a performance descriptor of "Achieves Expectations" or better for 2003. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>ADJUSTMENTS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Measures, Achievement Levels and Award Opportunities may be adjusted during the Plan Year only upon approval by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors as it deems </FONT></P>

appropriate. It is anticipated that such adjustments will be made infrequently and only in the most extraordinary circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the Plan has aggressive Award Opportunities intended for use with below market base salaries, some adjustments may need to be made to Awards if some Participant base salaries are
currently above market. In such cases, the IP Committee may reduce an Award as it deems appropriate to achieve a reasonable level of total compensation for each participant. All adjustments are
subject to approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PAYMENT OF AWARDS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards will be paid as soon as administratively feasible after review of performance against targets and approval by the IP Committee and the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. To be eligible for Award payment, a Participant must have been an employee of First Community Bancorp for at least three months and be an employee of First
Community Bancorp on the date that Awards are paid or have left First Community Bancorp during the Performance Period due to retirement, total and permanent disability or death. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants
otherwise eligible to receive an Award and who were assigned to different parts of the organization during the Performance Period will have their Award calculated based upon
the part of the organization they are in at the end of the Performance Period and the Performance targets achieved by that group for the Performance Period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of the Plan, salary means annual base salary in effect at the end of the performance year. Awards will be made through the payroll system, minus legally required and
authorized deductions. Awards under the Plan will be considered eligible compensation or not as defined by each specific employee benefit plan for purposes of employee benefit calculations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>NO RIGHT OF ASSIGNMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No right or interest of any Participant in the Plan is assignable or transferable. In the event of a Participant's death, payment of any earned but unpaid Awards
will be made to the Participant's legal successor, if not prohibited by law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>NO RIGHT OF EMPLOYMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan does not give any employee any right to continue in the employment of First Community Bancorp and does not constitute any contract or agreement of
employment or interfere in any way with the right the organization has to terminate such person's employment. First Community Bancorp is an "at will" employer and as such, can terminate an employment
relationship between itself and any of its employees at will, with or without cause, and with or without notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Community Bancorp reserves the right to change, amend, modify, suspend, continue or terminate all or any part of the Plan either in an individual case or in
general, at any time without notice. </FONT></P>
