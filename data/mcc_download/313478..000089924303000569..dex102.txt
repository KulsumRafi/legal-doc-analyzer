                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTE

     The U.S. $1,705,000 Promissory Note Due 1 September 2003 (the "Note" or
"Notes") of Harken Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") is
constituted by, and authorized to be issued pursuant to these Terms and
Conditions and resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company by unanimous
written consent effective on 3 March 2003.

     Certain terms not otherwise defined in the text hereof are defined in
Condition 19 herein.

1. Form, Denominations, and Title, and Certain Administrative Provisions

     (A) The Note is issued in registered certified form in denominations of
U.S. $1,000 or multiples thereof (the "Authorized Denomination") and with such
numerical and other identification designation as the Company shall deem
desirable.

     (B) Title to the Note will pass by form of transfer as set out in Schedule
B and reregistration of new ownership in the Note Register. The Company may (to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws) deem and treat the registered
Holder of the Note as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes (whether or
not the Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary).

     (C) The Note shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its President
and Chief Operating Officer under its corporate seal or a facsimile of such seal
reproduced thereon and attested by its Senior Vice President-Finance and
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. The signature of any of these officers on
the Note may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such
authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Note.

     The Note bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were
at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the delivery of the Notes or did not hold such offices at the
date of the Note.

     Upon surrender for transfer or exchange of the Note to an office of the
Note Registrar designated by the Company for that purpose, the Company shall
execute and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note or
Notes of the same series and interest rate and in Authorised Denominations, and
for the aggregate principal amount the owner is entitled to receive. No transfer
of the Note shall be binding upon the Company, unless made at such office and
shown on the Note Register. The Bank of New York will initially serve as the
Note Registrar.

     In case the Company, pursuant to Conditions 3(B) and 3(C), shall be
consolidated or merged with or into any other Person or shall convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of its Properties and assets substantially as an
entirety to any Person, and the successor Person resulting from such
consolidation, or surviving such merger, or into which the Company shall have
been merged, or the Person which shall have received a conveyance, transfer,
lease or other disposition as aforesaid, shall have entered into an amendment
hereto, the Note may, from time to time, at the request of the successor Person,
be exchanged for another Note executed in the name of the successor Person with
such changes in phraseology and form as may be appropriate, but otherwise in
substance of like tenor as the Note surrendered for such exchange and of like
principal amount.

     (D) Except as otherwise provided herein, no service charge shall be made
for any exchange or redemption of Notes, but the Company may require payment of
a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any exchange of Notes.

     (E) (1) The Holder of this Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize
any person to take any action which a Noteholder is entitled to take under these
Terms and Conditions.


                                                                               3

<PAGE>


     (2) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize any transfers of
this Note otherwise than in accordance with the Securities Act. Unless otherwise
required by applicable law, the Company shall not recognize or give effect to
any attempt to transfer any Note or any interest therein in violation of the
Securities Act.

     (F) The Noteholder by acceptance of the Note hereby covenants and agrees
that neither the Note nor the Redemption Shares will be offered, sold,
transferred, pledged, converted or otherwise disposed of unless the Note and/ or
the Redemption Shares have been registered under the Securities Act or any
applicable state securities or blue sky laws or exemptions from the registration
requirements of such laws are available.

     (G) If (i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Company or the Note
Registrar, or (ii) the Company or the Note Registrar, as the case may be,
receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Note, and there is delivered to the Company and the Note Registrar such security
and/or indemnity as may be required by them to save them harmless, then, in the
absence of notice to the Company or the Note Registrar that such Note has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver, in
exchange for any such mutilated Note or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or
stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not
contemporaneously Outstanding.

     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of
issuing a new Note, pay such Note, as the case may be.

     Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Condition, the Company may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected
therewith.

     Every new Note issued pursuant to this Condition in lieu of any destroyed,
lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual
obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note
shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all
benefits hereunder equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly
issued hereunder.

     The provisions of this Condition are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note.

     (H) The Company shall maintain an office or agency where the Note may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an
office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent" or
"paying agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Note and of its
transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one
or more additional paying agents. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar
and the term "Paying Agent" or "paying agent" includes any additional paying
agent. The Company may change any paying agent or Registrar without notice to
any Holder. The Company shall notify the Noteholder in writing of the name and
address of the Registrar or any paying agent, if the Company is not serving as
such. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or
Registrar. The Bank of New York will initially act as Registrar and paying
agent.

2. Status

     The Note is a direct, unconditional and unsecured obligation of the
Company. The Note will rank senior to all Subordinated Obligations of the
Company, present and future, but, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of
the Company, only to the extent permitted by the applicable laws relating to
creditors' rights. The Notes will not be secured by any assets or property of
the Company. The Note will rank pari passu with all other present and future
Indebtedness of the Company (including the Company's 5.0% Senior Convertible
Notes due 2003) other than Subordinated Obligations.


                                                                               4

<PAGE>


3. Covenants

     (A) The Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights
(charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer in
the best interests of the Company and the conduct of its business, and that the
loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Noteholders;
and provided, further, that nothing contained in this Condition 3(A) shall
prohibit any transaction permitted by Condition 3(B) or Condition 3(C) herein.

     (B) The Company will not merge or consolidate with or sell, convey,
transfer or lease or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all of its
Properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless: (a)
either (i) the Company shall be the surviving Person or (ii) the Person (if
other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company
is merged or the Person which acquired by conveyance or transfer, or which
leases, the Properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety
(1) shall be a Person organized and validly existing under the laws of the
United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and (2)
shall expressly assume, by a written instrument, the Company's obligation for
the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on the Note and
the performance and observance of every Term and Condition contained herein.

     (C) Upon any consolidation of the Company with or merger of the Company
with or into any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the
Properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety to any person,
the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is
merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to,
and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company
under the Terms and Conditions contained herein with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Company herein, and in the event of any
such conveyance or transfer, the Company, except in the case of a lease, shall
be discharged of all obligations and covenants under the Note and may be
dissolved and liquidated.

     (D) The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (a) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or upon the income,
profits or Property of the Company and (b) all lawful claims for labour,
materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the
Property of the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax,
assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.

     (E) The Company will not amend its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
except as required by law, except in respect to such amendments that the Board
of Directors reasonably determines do not materially adversely affect the rights
of the Noteholder, or except to the extent that such amendment would not have a
material adverse effect on (a) the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under the Note or (b) the rights of the Noteholder, except that
neither (i) increases in the number of Shares and issuance thereof with related
securities, nor (ii) designations of Preferred Stock of the Company,
modifications of the terms of such designations and issuance thereof with
related securities, nor (iii) modification or expansion of the indemnity
provisions provided by the Company to its directors and officers, nor (iv)
change of the Company's registered agent shall be deemed an amendment hereunder.

     (F) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will provide to the
Noteholder such statements, certificates or other documentation concerning the
organization or operations of the Company as may be reasonably necessary to
establish any exceptions or exemptions from United States federal income tax
withholding and reporting requirements.



                                                                               5

<PAGE>


     (G) The Company shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or such
other form as the Company may determine is appropriate or required under the
rules of the Commission), within ninety (90) days following the issue of any
Redemption Shares in respect of all Shares that may be issuable at any time upon
the redemption of the Note. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the
Commission to declare such registration statement (and any necessary amendments
thereto) effective. The Company shall also use its best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement, and to refile such a registration
statement from time to time in the event its effectiveness lapses, until all
such Shares that either are issued or that may be issued are Freely Tradable in
the United States once the registration statement has been declared effective.

     The Company will use its best efforts to list and maintain a listing of all
Shares issued upon redemption of the Note on a Stock Exchange. In the event a
Stock Exchange requires stockholder approval in order to complete the listing of
the Shares to be so issued upon redemption of the Note, then the Company will
use its best efforts to obtain such stockholder approval at the earliest
possible stockholder meeting. In this event, the redemption in Shares will occur
only if and when stockholder approval has been obtained. If the Company is
unable to obtain or maintain such listing of Shares, it will forthwith give not
less than 30 calendar days notice to the Noteholder of the listing, de-listing
or quotation or lack of quotation of the Shares (as a class) by any such Stock
Exchange.

     (H) If the Company shall at any time act as its own paying agent, it will,
on or before the due date of the principal on any of the Notes, segregate and
hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient
to pay the principal so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such
Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided.

4. Interest

     The Note does not bear interest other than default interest at the Default
Rate.

     Any money held by the Company in trust for the payment of the principal of
or default interest on the Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such
principal or default interest has become due and payable shall be discharged
from such trust; and the Holder of the Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured
general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all
liability of the Company with respect to such trust money, and all liability of
the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.

     Default interest is calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of
12 months of 30 days each and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of
days elapsed.

5. Payments

     Payments of default interest on the Note shall be paid by the Company or
its paying agent on the last Business Day of each calendar month, commencing
October 31, 2003, to the Holder of such Note as shown on the Note Register at
the close of business on the Special Record Date, such payment to be made as
provided in the next paragraph.

     Payments of principal in respect of the Note will only be made, against
presentation and surrender of the certificate for the Note at the specified
office of the Company or its paying agent. All payments of principal and default
interest shall be made in U.S. dollars. Each such payment will be made at the
specified office of the Company or its paying agent, at the option of the
Holder, by U.S. dollar cheque mailed to an address, or, with respect to a Holder
of at least $1,000,000 in principal amount of Notes, delivered in accordance
with the Holder's instructions, or by transfer to a U.S. dollar account
maintained by the Holder in accordance with the holder's instructions, subject
in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations, but without
prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9, provided that the final payment of
principal shall be made upon presentation of the Notes at the office of the
Company or the specified office of the Paying Agent.



                                                                               6

<PAGE>

     If, at any time, in the opinion of the Company or of the paying agent,
payments in U.S. dollars cannot be so made, payments will be made in U.S.
dollars in such other manner as may be approved by the Company and the paying
agent and notice of the alternative manner of payment will be given to the
Noteholder in accordance with Condition 15.

     All monies paid by the Company to a paying agent for the payment of
principal or default interest on any Note which remain unclaimed at the end of
two (2) years after the principal on such Note will have become due and payable
will be repaid to the Company and the Holder of such Note will thereafter have
only the rights of a creditor of the Company as described in these Terms and
Conditions or such rights as may be otherwise provided by applicable law.

     A Holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a
Presentation Date and shall not be entitled to any further payment if a
Presentation Date is after the due date.

     When making payments to Noteholders, fractions of one cent will be rounded
down to the nearest whole cent.

6. Conversion

     A Noteholder does not have any right to convert the Note into any
securities of the Company.

7. Redemption and Purchase

     (A) Unless previously redeemed or purchased and canceled as provided
herein, the Company will redeem the Note at its principal amount on 1 September,
2003.

     (B) (i) The Company may, at its option and after having given not less than
30 nor more than 60 calendar days' notice to the Noteholder(s) in accordance
with Condition 15 (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem the Note(s) for
cash, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to 100 per cent of their
principal amount together with default interest (if any) accrued to (but
excluding) the Redemption Date. If the Company elects to redeem less than all
the Notes, Company or its paying agent will select which Notes to redeem by lot,
random, or such other method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. Upon expiry
of any such notice period as is referred to in this Condition 7(B) (and subject
as provided above), the Company shall be bound to redeem Notes at their
principal amount, together with default interest accrued to but excluding the
Redemption Date.

     (ii) Provided that the Shares which may be issued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be Freely Tradeable and listed on a Stock Exchange following the
registration statement referred to in Condition 3(G) being declared effective,
on 1 September 2003, the Company may redeem upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days notice, pursuant and subject the Conditions listed above, up to 100% of
the Outstanding Notes for Shares. If the Company elects to redeem all or part of
the Notes for Shares, each Note will be redeemed for the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the sum of the face value of the Note redeemed divided by
the average of the Market Price of the Shares over all the Stock Exchange
Business Days during August 2003. If the Company elects to redeem less than all
the Notes, the Company will select which Notes to redeem by lot, random, or such
other method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. Upon expiry of any such
notice period as is referred to in this Condition 7(B) (and subject as provided
above), the Company shall be bound to redeem Notes as described above.

     (C) Subject to applicable law, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
at any time purchase Notes in any manner and at any price in the open market or
by private treaty. If purchases are made by tender, tenders must be available to
all Noteholders alike. Notes purchased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will forthwith be surrendered for cancellation and shall no longer be deemed
Outstanding.



                                                                               7

<PAGE>

     (D) All Notes which are redeemed by the Company will forthwith be canceled
and may not be reissued or resold.

8. Taxation

     All payments in respect of the Notes by the Company shall be made without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature ("Taxes") imposed
or levied by or on behalf of the U.S. or any political sub-division of, or any
authority in, or of, the U.S. having power to tax, unless the withholding or
deduction of the Taxes is required by law. In that event, the Company will pay
such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by the Noteholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the
respective amounts which would have been receivable in respect of the Notes in
the absence of the withholding or deduction; except that no additional amounts
shall be payable in relation to any payment in respect of any Note:

     (A) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder who is liable for the
Taxes in respect of the Note by reason of such Holder having some connection
with the U.S. other than the mere holding of the Note; and

     (B) presented for payment more than 30 calendar days after the Relevant
Date except to the extent that a Holder would have been entitled to additional
amounts on presenting the same for payment on the last day of such period of 30
calendar days; or

     (C) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder who would not be liable
or subject to the withholding or deduction by making a declaration of
non-residence or other similar claim for exemption to the relevant tax
authority.

     Any reference in these Terms and Conditions to any amounts in respect of
the Notes shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be
payable under this Condition.

9. Additional Covenants

     During the term of the Note, the Company will, save with the approval of an
Extraordinary Resolution:

     (1) at all times after ninety (90) days from the date of the initial
issuance of the Notes keep available for issuance free from any preemptive
rights out of its authorized but unissued capital such number of Shares as would
enable the rights of redemption into Shares to be satisfied in full;

     (2) maintain a listing for all the issued Shares and all Shares to be
issued on the exercise of any redemption rights on a Stock Exchange, it being
understood that if the Company is unable to obtain or maintain such listing of
Shares and will forthwith give notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 15 of the listing, de-listing or quotation or lack of quotation of the
Shares (as a class) by any such Stock Exchange; and

     (3) not in any way modify the rights attaching to the Shares with respect
to voting, dividends or liquidation.

10. Prescription

     Notes will become void unless presented for payment within periods of ten
(10) years (in the case of principal) and five (5) years (in the case of default
interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the Notes, as the case may be,
subject to the provisions of Condition 5.

11. Events of Default and Enforcement

     (A) Event of Default



                                                                               8

<PAGE>

     "Event of Default," wherever used in these Terms and Conditions, means any
one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default,
whether voluntary or involuntary or effected by operation of law or pursuant to
any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of
any administrative or governmental body) which shall have occurred and is
continuing:

          (1) if default is made for a period of five (5) Business Days or more
     in the payment of principal due in respect of the Notes or any of them; or

          (2) if the Company fails to perform or observe any of its other
     obligations, covenants, conditions or provisions under the Notes, these
     Terms and Conditions, the Company's 5.0% Senior Notes due 2003, or the
     trust indenture pursuant to which such 5.0% Senior Notes due 2003 were
     issued, and such failure continues for the period of 30 calendar days (or
     such longer period as the Majority Holders may in their absolute discretion
     permit) next following the service by the one or more of the Holders on the
     Company of notice requiring the same to be remedied; or

          (3) if (i) any other Indebtedness of the Company becomes due and
     payable prior to its Stated Maturity by reason of an event of default
     (howsoever defined) or (ii) any such Indebtedness of the Company is not
     paid when due or, as the case may be, within any applicable grace period or
     (iii) the Company fails to pay when due (or, as the case may be, within any
     applicable grace period) any amount payable by it under any present or
     future guarantee for, or indemnity in respect of, any Indebtedness of any
     Person or (iv) any security given by the Company or any subsidiary for any
     Indebtedness of any Person or any guarantee or indemnity of Indebtedness of
     any Person by the Company becomes enforceable by reason of default in
     relation thereto and steps are taken to enforce such security save in any
     such case where there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the relevant
     Indebtedness or any such guarantee or indemnity as aforesaid shall be due
     and payable (following any applicable grace period); provided, however,
     that in each such case the Indebtedness exceeds in the aggregate U.S.
     $2,000,000 and in each such case such event continues unremedied for a
     period of 30 calendar days (or such longer period as the Majority Holders
     may in their sole discretion consent to in writing upon receipt of written
     notice from the Company); or

          (4) if the Company shall generally fail to pay its debts as such debts
     come due (except debts which the Company may contest in good faith

     insolvent or bankrupt, shall consent to the entry of an order of relief
     against it in an involuntary bankruptcy case, shall enter into any
     assignment or other similar arrangement for the benefit of its creditors or
     shall consent to the appointment of a custodian (including, without
     limitation, a receiver, liquidator or Company); or

          (5) if a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator or other
     similar official shall be appointed in relation to the Company or in
     relation to the whole or a substantial part its undertaking or assets or a
     distress, execution or other process shall be levied or enforced upon or
     sued out against, or an encumbrancer shall take possession of, the whole or
     a substantial part of the assets of any of them and in any of the foregoing
     cases is not paid out or discharged within 90 calendar days (or such longer
     period as the Majority Holders may in their absolute discretion consent to
     in writing upon receipt of written notice from the Company); or

          (6) if the Company institutes proceedings to be adjudicated a
     voluntary bankrupt, or shall consent to the filing of a bankruptcy
     proceeding against it, or shall file a petition or answer or consent
     seeking organization under the laws of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any
     similar applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign law, or shall consent to
     the filing of any such petition, or shall consent to the appointment of a
     receiver or liquidator or trustee or assignee (or other similar official)
     in bankruptcy or insolvency of it or its Property, or shall make an
     assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its
     inability to pay its debts generally as they come due; or

          (7) if a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the
     premises shall have been entered adjudging the Company a bankrupt or
     insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking the
     reorganization of the Company under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any
     other similar applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign


                                                                               9

<PAGE>

     law, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged or unstayed
     for a period of 90 calendar days; or a decree or order of a court having
     jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a receiver or
     liquidator or trustee or assignee (or other similar official) in bankruptcy
     or insolvency of the Company or of all or substantially all of its
     Property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have
     been entered, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged
     and unstayed for a period of 90 calendar days; or

          (8) if a warranty, representation, or other statement made by or on
     behalf of the Company contained herein or any certificate or other
     agreement furnished in compliance herewith is false in any material respect
     when made and such falsity continues for a period of 30 calendar days (or
     such longer period as the Majority Holders may in their absolute discretion
     permit) next following the service by one or more of the Holders on the
     Company of notice requiring the same to be remedied; or

          (9) if there is any final judgment or judgments for the payment of
     money exceeding in the aggregate U.S. $2,000,000 outstanding against the
     Company which has been outstanding for more than 60 calendar days from the
     date of its entry and shall not have otherwise been discharged in full or
     stayed by appeal, bond or otherwise.

     (B) Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment

     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
Condition 11(A)(6) or 11(A)(7)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such
case the Majority Holders may declare the principal amount of all the Notes to
be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company, and upon
any such declaration such principal amount shall become immediately due and
payable.

     If an Event of Default specified in Condition 11(A)(6) or Condition
11(A)(7) occurs and is continuing, then the principal amount of all the Notes
shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of any Noteholder.

     At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Majority Holders as hereinafter in this Condition provided, the Majority
Holders, with written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences if

          (1) the Company has paid or deposited in a manner satisfactory to such
     Holders a sum sufficient to pay

               (i) all unpaid principal of any Outstanding Notes which has
          become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, and

               (ii) all reasonable sums paid or advanced by the such Holders
          hereunder; and

          (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of
     principal on Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of
     acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Condition 11(K)

     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

     (C) Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by the Majority
Holders

     The Company covenants that if default is made in the payment of the
principal of any Note at the Maturity thereof and such default continues for a
period of five (5) Business Days, the Company will, upon demand of the


                                                                              10

<PAGE>


Majority Holders, pay to the Holders of the Notes, the whole amount then due and
payable on the Notes for principal and default interest on any overdue principal
and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable,
upon any overdue installment of interest, at the rate prescribed therefor in the
Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Holders, their agents and counsel, and the
reasonable compensation of such agents and counsel.

     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Majority Holders in their name, may institute a judicial proceeding for the
collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to
judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any
other obligor upon the Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be
payable in the manner provided by law out of the Property of the Company or any
other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.

     If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Majority Holders may
in their discretion proceed to protect and enforce their rights and the rights
of the other Noteholders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such
Holders shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in these terms
and conditions or to enforce any other proper remedy.

     (D) Majority Holders May File Proofs of Claim

     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes
or the Property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the
Majority Holders (irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then
be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Majority Holders shall have made any demand on the
Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

     (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and default
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes and to file such other papers
or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Holders (including any claim for the reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances of such Holders, their agents and counsel) and of the other Noteholders
allowed in such judicial proceeding, and the reasonable compensation of such
agents and counsel, and

     (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other Property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Noteholder to make such payments to the Majority Holders due them for the
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances of such Holders, their agents
and counsel and the reasonable compensation of such agents and counsel, and to
pay to the Paying Agent (where one is appointed) all such other sums due under
the Notes. In the absence of such appointment, any such sums shall be paid for
the rateable benefit of all the Noteholders.

     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Majority Holders,
except as permitted by law and these Terms and Conditions, to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or
the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the such Holder to vote in
respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding, except to the
extent permitted by law.



                                                                              11

<PAGE>


     (E) Majority Holders May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Notes

     All rights of action and claims under these Terms and Conditions may be
prosecuted and enforced by the Majority Holders without the possession of any of
the Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Majority Holders shall be brought in their own
name and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Majority
Holders, their agents and counsel, be paid to the Paying Agent (where one is
appointed) for the rateable benefit of all the Noteholders in respect of which
such judgment has been recovered.

     (F) Application of Money Collected

     Any money collected by the Majority Holder pursuant to this Condition shall
be applied in the following order in case of the distribution of such money on
account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Notes and the
notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender
thereof if fully paid:

          FIRST: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal
     of and default interest on the Notes in respect of which or for the benefit
     of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or
     priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such
     Notes for principal and default interest, respectively; and

          SECOND: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled
     thereto.

     (G) Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and Default
Interest

     Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions, the
Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment, as provided herein and in such Note of the principal of and
default interest on, such Note on the respective Stated Maturity or expressed in
such Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall
not be impaired without the consent of such Holder; provided, that all monies
paid by the Company to the Paying Agent (if appointed) for the payment of
principal or default interest on any Note which remain unclaimed at the end of
two (2) years after the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date of such Note will be
repaid to the Company and the Holder of any Note shall thereafter have only the
rights of a creditor of the Company or such rights as may be otherwise provided
by applicable law.

     (H) Restoration of Rights and Remedies

     If the Majority Holders or any Noteholder has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions and such proceeding
has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined
adversely to the Majority Holders or to such Noteholder, then and in every such
case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Majority
Holders and the Noteholders shall be restored severally and respectively to
their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the
Majority Holders and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such proceeding
had been instituted.

     (I) Rights and Remedies Cumulative



                                                                              12

<PAGE>

     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes as provided herein, no right or
remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Noteholders is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

     (J) Delay or Omission Not Waiver

     No delay or omission of the Majority Holders or Holder of any Note to
exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
deemed expedient, by the Noteholders.

     (K) Waiver of Past Defaults

     Subject to Condition 11(B), the Majority Holders may on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes waive any past default hereunder and its consequences,
except a default

          (1) in respect of the payment of the principal of or default interest
     on any Note, or

          (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Condition
     17 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
     Outstanding Note affected.

     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of these Terms and Conditions; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

     (L) Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws

     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of these Terms and Conditions; and the Company (to the extent that
it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any
such law.

     (M) Requirements Regarding Agents (if appointed)

          (1) At any time after an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing the Majority Holders shall notify in writing the Company and the
     Paying Agent (if appointed), and may by notice in writing to the Company
     and the Paying Agent (if appointed):

               (i) require the Paying Agent, until notified to the contrary by
          Majority Holders, to hold all Notes and all moneys, documents and
          records held by it in respect of Notes to the order of the Holders; or

               (ii) require the Paying Agent to deliver to the Holders on a pro
          rata basis all funds held by it for the benefit of the Holders, and to
          deliver the documents and records held by it in respect of Notes to
          the Holders, provided that such notice shall be deemed not to apply to
          any documents or records which the relevant Paying Agent is obliged to
          release by any law or regulation; and


                                                                              13

<PAGE>


               (iii) require the Company to make all subsequent payments in
          respect of the Notes to or to the order of the Holders and not to the
          Paying Agent.

          (2) The Majority Holders shall notify the Paying Agent immediately
     upon the cure or waiver of an Event of Default. Upon receipt of such
     notice, the provisions of this Condition 11(M) shall no longer apply.

          (3) Prior to taking any action under this Agreement at the direction
     of any Person with respect to the Notes, the Paying Agent shall be entitled
     to receive (and shall receive) indemnity or security satisfactory to it.

12. Liability Solely Corporate

     No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or default
interest on any Notes or any part thereof, or for any claim based thereon or
otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or
upon any obligation, covenant or agreement in these Terms and Conditions,
against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, officer or director, as
such, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any predecessor or
successor Person, either directly or through the Company or any such predecessor
or successor Person, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of
law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, it being
expressly agreed and understood that the Notes and these Terms and Conditions
which are a part thereof are solely corporate obligations, and that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be insured by, any such incorporator,
stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the
Company or of any predecessor or successor Person, either directly or through
the Company or any such predecessor or successor Person, because of the
indebtedness hereby authorized or under or by reason of any of the obligations,
covenants, promises or agreements contained in the Notes or the these Terms and
Conditions which constitute a part thereof or to be implied herefrom; and that
any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a
condition of, and as part of the consideration for the exchange transaction
pursuant to which the Notes were issued; provided, however, that nothing herein
contained shall be taken to prevent recourse to and the enforcement of the
liability, if any, of any stockholder or subscriber to capital stock of the
Company upon or in respect of shares of capital stock not fully paid up.

13. Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

     (A) Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance

     The Company may, at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with
respect to the Notes, elect to have either Condition 13(B) or Condition 13(C)
applied to all Outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth
below in this Condition, The Company shall promptly give notice of such election
to the Holders.

     (B) Legal Defeasance and Discharge

     Upon the Company's exercise under Condition 13(A) of the option applicable
to this Condition 13(B), the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged
from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Notes on the date the
conditions set forth in Condition 13(D) are satisfied (hereinafter, "legal
defeasance"). For this purpose, such legal defeasance means that the Company
shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented
by the Outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding"
only for the purposes of Condition 13(E) and the other Conditions of these Terms
and Conditions referred to in (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all its
obligations under such Notes, including the obligation to pay default interest
on the Notes, and these Terms and Conditions insofar as such Notes are concerned
(and the Holders, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper
instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall
survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of
Holders of Outstanding Notes to receive, solely from the trust fund described in
Condition 13(D) and as more fully set forth in such Condition, payments in
respect of the principal of and default interest on such Notes when such
payments are due, and (B) the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes
under Conditions 1(D), 1(E), 1(H), 3(D) or 3(L). Subject to compliance with this
Condition, the


                                                                              14

<PAGE>

Company may exercise its option under this Condition 13(B) notwithstanding the
prior exercise of its option under Condition 13(C) with respect to the Notes.

     (C) Covenant Defeasance

     Upon the Company's exercise under Condition 13(A) of the option applicable
to this Condition 13(C), the Company shall be released from its obligations
under any covenant contained in Condition 3 (except Condition 3(D) with respect
to the Outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in
Condition 13(D)) are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and the
Notes shall thereafter be deemed not to be "Outstanding" for the purposes of any
request, demand, authorization, direction, declaration, notice, consent, waiver
or Act of Noteholders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with
such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other
purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with
respect to the Outstanding Notes, the Company may omit to comply with and shall
have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in
any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference
elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such
covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such
omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under
Condition 11(A)(4), but, except as specified above, the remainder of these and
the Notes shall be unaffected thereby.

     (D) Conditions to Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance

     The following shall be the conditions to application of either Condition
13(B) or Condition 13 (C) to the Outstanding Notes:

          (1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
     deposited with a paying agent as trust funds in trust for the purpose of
     making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and
     dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Notes, (A) money in
     an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled
     payment of principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will
     provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money
     in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a
     nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
     written certification thereof delivered to the paying agent, to pay and
     discharge, and which shall be applied by the paying agent to pay and
     discharge, the principal of the Outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity
     (or Redemption Date, if applicable) of such principal; provided that the
     paying agent shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or
     the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to said payments with
     respect to the Notes; and provided further that, upon the effectiveness of
     this Condition 13(D), the money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited
     shall not be subject to the rights of the Noteholders pursuant to the
     provisions of this Condition. Before or after such a deposit, the Company
     may give to the paying agent a notice of its election to redeem all of the
     Outstanding Notes at a future date in accordance with Condition 7, which
     notice shall be irrevocable. Such irrevocable redemption notice, if given,
     shall be given effect in applying the foregoing.

          (2) No Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall
     have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as
     paragraphs (6) and (7) of Condition 11(A) hereof are concerned, at any time
     during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it
     being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until
     the expiration of such period).

          (3) No event or condition shall exist that pursuant to the provisions
     of Condition 13(B) or 13(C) would prevent the Company from making payments
     of the principal of the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any time
     during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it
     being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until
     the expiration of such period).


                                                                              15

<PAGE>

          (4) Such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a
     breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material
     agreement or material instrument to which the Company is a party or by
     which it is bound.

          (5) In the case of an election under Condition 13(B), the Company
     shall have delivered to the paying agent an Opinion of Counsel stating that
     the Holders of the Outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or
     loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance
     and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
     manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance
     had not occurred.

          (f) The Company shall have delivered to the paying agent an Officers'
     Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
     precedent provided for relating to either the legal defeasance under
     Condition 13(B) or the covenant defeasance under Condition 13(C) (as the
     case may be) have been complied with.

     (E) Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust;
Other Miscellaneous Provisions

     Subject to the provisions of the disposition of unclaimed moneys contained
herein, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds
thereof) deposited with the paying agent pursuant to Condition 13(D) in respect
of the Outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the paying agent,
in accordance with the provisions of these terms and conditions, to the payment,
either directly or through the paying agent (including the Company acting as its
own paying agent) to the Holders of the Notes of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal, but such money and U.S. Government Obligations
need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

     (F) Reinstatement

     If the paying agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government
Obligations in accordance with Condition 13(E) by reason of any order or
judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under
these Terms and Condition shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit
had occurred pursuant to Condition 13(B) or 13(C), as the case may be, until
such time as the paying agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S.
Government Obligations in accordance with Condition 13(E); provided, however,
that no action taken in good faith by the Company after a deposit of money or
U.S. Government Obligations or both pursuant to Condition 13(E) and prior to the
revival and reinstatement of obligations under these Terms and Conditions
pursuant to this Condition 13(F) shall constitute the basis for the assertion of
