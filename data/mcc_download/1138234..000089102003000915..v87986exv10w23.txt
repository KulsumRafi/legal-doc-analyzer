                           FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

                                   ARTICLE 1.
                           PURPOSE AND EFFECTIVE DATE

1.1. PURPOSE

      The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success of AT&T Wireless
Services, Inc. and its affiliated companies that participate in the Plan by:

      (a) Providing non-employee directors with the ability to defer cash
compensation on a pretax basis in order to permit them to supplement their
retirement savings; and

      (b) Providing non-employee directors who are participating in the "Equity
Program for Non-Employee Directors Under the AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. 2001
Long Term Incentive Plan" with a mechanism for deferring non-cash compensation,
vested restricted shares and receipt of gains on non-qualified stock option
grants otherwise payable under such Director Equity Program, thereby providing
an effective means for non-employee directors to maintain beneficial ownership
of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. common stock.

      It is intended that the Plan provide deferred compensation for
non-employee directors and, therefore, because it provides no benefits to
employees, that it be exempt from all the provisions of ERISA.

1.2. EFFECTIVE DATE

      The Effective Date for the Plan, as set forth herein, shall be September
1, 2001.

Committee's discretion.

      4.3.9 DIRECTOR EQUITY PROGRAM. The Plan governs the deferral of receipt of
AWS Stock issuable upon the Director's election to receive all or a portion of
his Directors' Fees in the form of AWS Stock rather than in cash. Such an

pays, in cash or through an attestation acceptable to the Committee, the
exercise price in shares of AWS Stock that is non-compensable or that the
Participant owns and has owned continuously for the six (6) month period ending
on the date of exercise, and (iv) such Director complies with all other rules
the Committee may establish. Subject to the discretion of and such procedures as
may be established by the Committee, at the time of the deferral election, a
Director may also choose to use some of the shares acquired pursuant to the

exercise.

Deferral Election shall be made in writing and in such form and manner as may be

expire, by its terms, before the end of the six (6) month period commencing with
the date that the Stock Option Gain Deferral Election is submitted to and
received by the Committee. If only a portion of the Net Shares is deferred, the
portion of the Net Shares that is not deferred will be distributed under the
Director Equity Program at the time of exercise. If a Stock Option Grant, as to
which a Director has made a Stock Option Gain Deferral Election, terminates
prior to the exercise date selected by the Director, or if the Director dies or
fails to deliver personally owned shares in payment of the exercise price, then
the Participant's Stock Option Gain Deferral Election shall not become
effective. Upon exercise of a Stock Option Grant covered by a properly filed
Stock Option Gain Deferral Election, the Company shall not deliver the shares of
AWS Stock. Instead following such deferral election, the number of deferred
shares will be credited as Share Equivalents under the Director's Deferred
Shares Account under the Plan. The Committee may establish additional procedures
to effect the deferral of gains from Stock Option Grants.

AWS Stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options will have no rights as
stockholders of AWS with respect to allocations of Share Equivalents made to
their Deferred Shares Account.

date (if any) of the deferral election.

      4.5.4 DEFERRAL OF RESTRICTED SHARES. A Restricted Share Deferral
Agreement's election may expire according to its terms. A Director may choose to
defer receipt of all or only a portion of the AWS Stock to be received upon the
vesting of such Restricted Shares; provided, however, that an award will not be
deferred if it will vest, by its terms, before the end of the six (6) month
period commencing with the date that the Restricted Share Deferral Election is
submitted to and received by the Committee. If only a portion of the Restricted
Shares are deferred, the portion of the Restricted Shares that is not deferred
will be distributed under the Director Equity Program at the time of vesting. If
a grant of Restricted Shares, as to which a Director has made a Restricted Share
Deferral Election, vests prior to the deferral date selected by the Director,
then the Participant's Restricted Share Deferral Election shall not become
effective. Upon vesting of Restricted Shares covered by a properly filed
Restricted Share Deferral Election, the Company shall not deliver the shares of
AWS Stock. Following such deferral election, the number of deferred shares will
be credited as Share Equivalents under the Director's Deferred Shares Account
under the Plan. The Committee may establish additional procedures to effect the
deferral of vested Restricted Shares.

      4.5.5 SHARE EQUIVALENTS. The deferred amounts of Restricted Shares will be

Separate Accounts may be maintained on the books of the Company to reflect the
different types of Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts described in Section
5.1.2 that are chosen by the Participant, and the Participant shall designate
the portion of each Cash Compensation deferral that will be credited to each
Deferred Cash Compensation Account. These Accounts shall be used solely to
calculate the amount payable to each Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan
and shall not constitute a separate fund of assets. Each Deferred Cash

Deferred Cash Compensation Account to be maintained in the name of the
Participant with respect to whom all or a portion of his Cash Compensation has
been deferred.

      5.1.2 TYPES OF DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall
establish and maintain at least one (1) Termination of Service Account within
each Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Account.

      5.1.3 PROCEDURES FOR CREDITING DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION. The amount of
Cash Compensation that a Participant elects to defer in his Cash Compensation
Deferral Agreement shall cause an equivalent reduction in the amount of the
Participant's Cash Compensation that is paid to the Participant. A Participant's
deferred Cash Compensation shall be credited to each Deferred Cash Compensation
Account designated by the Participant within fifteen (15) business days after
the last day of the month during which the deferred Cash Compensation would have
otherwise been payable to the Participant. Any withholding of taxes or other
amounts with respect to deferred Cash Compensation that may be required by
local, state or federal law shall be withheld from the Participant's
corresponding non-deferred portion of the Cash Compensation to the maximum
extent possible, and any remaining amount shall reduce the amount credited to
the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Account in a manner specified by
the Committee.

Account shall be increased by any deferred Cash Compensation credited to such
Account in accordance with Section 5.1.3 since such prior Determination Date in
the proportion chosen by the Participant, except that no amount of new deferrals
shall be credited to an Account at the same time that a distribution or
withdrawal is to be made from that Account.

      (b) DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS. Each Deferred Cash Compensation Account
shall be reduced by the amount of each benefit payment made from that Account
since the prior Determination Date. Distributions or withdrawals shall be deemed
to have been made proportionally from each of the Valuation Funds maintained
within such Deferred Cash Compensation Account based on the proportion that such
Valuation Fund bears to the sum of all Valuation Funds among which such Account
is allocated by that Participant as of the Determination Date immediately
preceding the date of payment.

      (c) EARNINGS. Each Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be increased
or decreased by the Earnings credited to such Account pursuant to Article 5
since the prior Determination Date as though the balance of that Account had
been invested in the applicable Valuation Funds chosen by the Participant in his
applicable Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.1.5 RESTRICTIONS ON REALLOCATIONS AMONG ACCOUNTS. Once an amount of Cash
Compensation deferred by a Participant under the Plan and any Earnings thereon
have been credited to one of the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation
Accounts, such amount may not be thereafter reallocated or transferred to
another one of the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts or to the
Participant's Deferred Shares Account.

5.2. DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT

      5.2.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT. The Committee shall
establish a Deferred Shares Account for each Participant who enters into a
Non-Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement, a Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement

be credited with the number of Share Equivalents equal to the number of shares
of AWS Stock the Participant would have otherwise received had he not made an
election to defer the applicable Non-Cash Compensation.

      5.2.3 STOCK OPTION DEFERRAL CREDITS. The Participant's Deferred Shares
Account shall be credited with a Share Equivalent for each Net Share deferred,
as of the date of the stock option exercise.

      5.2.4 RESTRICTED SHARE DEFERRAL CREDITS. The Participant's Deferred Shares
Account shall be credited with a Share Equivalent for each vested Restricted
Share deferred, as of the date the Restricted Share vests.

      5.2.5 DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. Dividend Equivalents equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the dividends payable on AWS Stock shall be credited to a

held in such Participant's Deferred Shares Account on the dividend date (as
determined by the Committee). Dividend Equivalents credited to the Deferred
Shares Account shall be reinvested in Share Equivalents based on the Fair Market
Value of AWS Stock on the dividend date. No fractional Share Equivalents shall
be credited.

      5.2.6 NO ALLOCATION AMONG VALUATION FUNDS. The balance in a Participant's
Deferred Shares Account shall be credited with Share Equivalents at all times. A
Participant's Deferred Shares Account is not eligible to be credited with
Earnings based on any Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.2.7 DILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. In the event of any change in the
outstanding shares of AWS Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization, combination
or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, the Committee, in its
sole discretion, shall make the appropriate adjustment in each Participant's
Deferred Shares Account. If any such adjustment shall result in a fractional
share, such fraction shall be disregarded. Such adjustments made by the
Committee shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.

5.3. VALUATION FUNDS AND EARNINGS

      5.3.1 PARTICIPANT VALUATION FUND ALLOCATIONS. A Participant or Beneficiary
shall make a Valuation Fund Allocation to designate, at a time and in a manner
acceptable to the Committee, one or more Valuation Funds for each Participant's
Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts for the sole purpose of determining the
amount of Earnings to be credited or debited to such Account as if such Accounts
held actual assets and such assets were among such investment funds as the
Company may designate. Such Valuation Fund Allocation shall designate (i) the
Deferred Cash Compensation Account(s) to which it applies; (ii) the portion of
each Deferred Cash Compensation Account balance that shall be allocated among
the available Valuation Funds; and (iii) the portion of each future deferral of
Cash Compensation made to each Deferred Cash Compensation Account that shall be
allocated among the available Valuation Funds. Any Valuation Fund Allocation
shall apply to each succeeding deferral of Cash Compensation until such time as
the Participant or Beneficiary shall file a new Valuation Fund Allocation with
the Committee. If a Participant or Beneficiary fails, for any reason, to make a
valid Valuation Fund Allocation for any of his Accounts, the Participant or
Beneficiary shall be deemed to have elected the Money Market Valuation Fund for
the entire Account balance until such time as the Participant or Beneficiary
makes a valid Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.3.2 COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH VALUATION FUND ALLOCATION PROCEDURES. Any
Valuation Fund Allocation shall be subject to such rules as the Committee may
prescribe, including, without limitation, (i) rules concerning the minimum
percentage of the total Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts that may be
allocated to any specific Valuation Fund; (ii) the manner of providing Valuation
Fund directions; (iii) the frequency of changing such Valuation Fund directions;
and (iv) the method of crediting Earnings for any portion of a Deferred Cash
Compensation Account that is not covered by any valid Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.3.3 CHANGES IN VALUATION FUND ALLOCATION. A Participant or Beneficiary
may change his Valuation Fund Allocation for any designated Deferred Cash
Compensation Account by making a new Valuation Fund Allocation for the Account
at any time. Any modified Valuation Fund Allocation submitted via the Plan's
electronic Internet system and received by the Committee or its designee by 3:00
p.m. Eastern time shall generally be effective as of the

next succeeding Determination Date. Any modified Valuation Fund Allocation
submitted to the Committee in paper form shall generally be effective no late
than the third Determination Date after the Determination Date on which such
form is received by the Committee.

      5.3.4 DETERMINATION OF VALUATION FUNDS TO BE OFFERED. The Committee shall
have the sole discretion to determine the number of Valuation Funds to be
designated under the Plan and may change or eliminate prospectively the
Valuation Funds from time to time.

      5.3.5 NO REQUIREMENT TO FOLLOW INVESTMENT REQUESTS. Neither the Committee
nor the Company shall be obligated to comply with, or be liable for the failure
to comply with, the investment requests of any Participant or Beneficiary. The
Company shall have sole discretion whether or not to invest any of the Company's
funds (whether or not in trust) in the manner requested by the Participant or
Beneficiary. However, if the Committee allows the Participant or Beneficiary to
request that Earnings be credited in accordance with instructions from the
Participant or Beneficiary, Earnings shall be credited in accordance with the
instructions directed by the Participant or Beneficiary, whether or not the
Committee actually invests funds in accordance with the instructions.

      5.3.6 NO REQUIREMENT TO FUND. The Company shall not be required to fund
its obligations under the Plan in any manner and shall not be required to invest
in any particular investment, including any Valuation Funds. The Company may,
without limitation, purchase life insurance or any security or other property
with respect to any or all of its obligations under the Plan. Participants and
Beneficiaries shall have no right, title or interest in any assets held by the
Company (or any trust) by reason of a Participant's participation in the Plan.

5.4. VESTING OF ACCOUNTS

      Each Participant shall at all times be one hundred percent (100%) vested
in his Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and Deferred Shares Account.

5.5. PARTICIPANT ACCOUNT STATEMENTS

      Each Participant shall be provided with a statement showing the balances
in the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and Deferred Shares
Account as of the last day of each calendar quarter. Such statements shall be
provided as soon as practicable, but generally no later than sixty (60) days
after the end of each calendar quarter.

5.6. COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS

      The Company provides no matching or other form of contributions under the
Plan.

time to time, the benefits payable from any Account under the Plan shall be paid
in the form of benefit as provided in Section 6.4.2, as specified by the
Participant in his latest Distribution Election timely filed with and accepted
by the Committee. The Participant's Distribution Election shall be effective for
the entire Account balance to which it pertains. If at the time payment of
benefits under the Plan becomes due and payable the Participant's Distribution
Election was made within one (1) year of the requested payment, then such
Distribution Election shall be deemed ineffective and the most recent
Distribution Election made by the Participant more than twelve (12) months prior
to the time of payment shall be used to determine the form of payment.

      6.4.2 PERMISSIBLE FORMS OF BENEFIT PAYMENT. The permissible forms of
benefit payments under the Plan are as follows:

      (a) TERMINATION BENEFIT PAYMENTS. Termination benefit payments made

the final installment payment from the Account, the entire remaining value of

Distribution Election for the applicable distribution event exists at the time
of a Participant's death or Termination of Service Commencement Date, as
applicable, distribution of the applicable Account shall be made in annual
installments to the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary if the
Participant is deceased) over a period of five (5) years.

      6.4.6 SMALL ACCOUNT LUMP SUM PAYMENT RULE. Notwithstanding any
Distribution Election made by the Participant to the contrary, if the balance
credited to a Participant's Termination of Service Account or Deferred Shares
Account as of the time payments are to commence from such Account is less than
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), the remaining unpaid balance of that
Account shall be paid in a lump sum.

6.5. CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION ELECTIONS

      A Participant may change the form of benefit payment designated in a
Distribution Election previously made pursuant to Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3;
provided, however, that such new Distribution Election shall be subject to the
following conditions and limitations:

      (a) A change in the time or form of payment shall be effective only if the
Committee receives the new Distribution Election at least twelve (12) full
months prior to January 1 of the Plan Year during which payments from the

Committee approves such Distribution Election.

      (b) If a Participant changes the form of payment for an Account and then
incurs a Termination of Service (other than due to death) within twelve months
(12) months of the date the applicable Distribution Election is changed, the

it was revoked or changed.

Date or death of a Participant occurs that entitles a Participant (or a

thereafter for the remainder of the distribution period.

6.7. UNSCHEDULED LUMP-SUM WITHDRAWALS

      6.7.1 ELECTION OF UNSCHEDULED LUMP-SUM WITHDRAWALS. Notwithstanding any

withdrawal election shall be made in a form and manner acceptable to the
Committee and shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:

      (a) The Participant's unscheduled withdrawal election must specify the
Account or Accounts from which the amount is to be withdrawn and, if the
withdrawal is to be made from more than one Account, the relative amounts to be
withdrawn from each Account.

      (b) The Participant's unscheduled withdrawal election must specify the
amount of an Account (in whole dollars) or the percentage of an Account
(determined as of the most recent Determination Date) to be withdrawn in
response to the Participant's unscheduled withdrawal election.

      (c) If a partial withdrawal is to be made from an Account, the amount
shall be withdrawn on a pro rata basis from each Valuation Fund then applicable
for such Account under the Participant's Valuation Fund Allocation.

      (d) Payment of any unscheduled withdrawal under this Section 6.7.1 shall
be made in a single lump sum payment within thirty (30) days after the

terminated, and the Participant's right to make deferrals of Cash Compensation,
Non-Cash Compensation, gain on the exercise of a Stock Option Grant or vested

Committee and for the immediately following Plan Year.

6.8. HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS

      Upon a finding by the Committee that a Participant has suffered a
Financial Hardship, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, (i) amend the
Participant's existing Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement, Non-Cash
Compensation Deferral Agreement, Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement or
Restricted Share Deferral Agreement or (ii) make distributions from any or all
the Participant's Accounts as the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
determine. The amount of any such distribution shall be limited to the amount
reasonably necessary to meet the Participant's needs resulting from the
Financial Hardship, and will not exceed the Participant's Account balances.
Distributions due to a Financial Hardship may not be made to the extent that a
Participant's Financial Hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant's
assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause
severe Financial Hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. If a
distribution is made due to a Financial Hardship, the Participant's deferrals
under the Plan shall cease for the period of the Financial Hardship and for six
(6) months thereafter. Any resumption of the Participant's deferrals under the
Plan after such six (6) month period shall be made only at the election of the
Participant in accordance with Article 3.

6.9. TAX WITHHOLDING

      Benefit payments hereunder shall be subject to applicable federal, state
or local tax withholding laws, and the Company shall withhold from payments made
hereunder any taxes required to be withheld from such payments under such law.
Subject to approval by the Committee, a Participant may sell AWS Stock
distributed under the Plan on the open market to facilitate payment of the
Participant's tax withholding obligation. In no circumstance will the Company
purchase or otherwise issue cash for any AWS Stock distributed under the Plan.

6.10. FACILITY OF PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

      If a Plan benefit is payable to a minor or a person declared incompetent
or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of the property, the
Committee may direct payment to the guardian, legal representative or person
having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or person. The Committee
may require proof of incompetency, minority, incapacity or guardianship as it
may deem appropriate prior to such distribution. Such distribution shall
completely discharge the Committee and the Company from all liability with
respect to such benefit.

      The full payment of the balance credited to all of a Participant's
Accounts shall completely discharge all obligations on the part of the Company
to the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary if the Participant is

Beneficiary's) rights under the Plan shall terminate.

6.12. SPECIAL RULES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT

      The Company shall distribute each Participant's Deferred Shares Account
following Termination of Service subject to the following rules:

      6.12.1 PAYMENT ELECTION. At the time elected by the Participant for
distribution of AWS Stock attributable to allocations under the Participant's
Deferred Shares Account, the Company shall issue to the Participant, as soon as
practicable after the date of distribution, whole shares of AWS Stock equal to
the number of Share Equivalents credited to the Deferred Shares Account, any
fractional number of Share Equivalents thereafter remaining to be paid in cash.
Prior to distribution and pursuant to any rules the Committee may adopt, a
Participant may authorize the Company to withhold a portion of the shares of AWS
Stock to be distributed for the payment of all federal, state, local and foreign
withholding taxes required to be collected in respect of the distribution.

      6.12.2 FORM OF DISTRIBUTION. The distribution to a Participant from his
Deferred Shares Account shall be made in AWS Stock. Distributions in cash shall
not be permitted. If distribution is to be made from the Participant's Deferred
Shares Account in the form of installment payments, the number of shares of AWS
Stock distributed annually shall be determined by dividing the total number of
Share Equivalents on the initial distribution date by the number of installments
to be made. The number of shares distributed annually to the Participant shall
be recalculated each year thereafter to reflect changes in the number of Share
Equivalents and the remaining number of annual installments to be made.

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

7.1. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY

      Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any
person, persons or entity as a Beneficiary (both primary and contingent) to whom
benefits under the Plan shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death
prior to complete distribution of the balance of all the Participant's Accounts.

      If the Participant is married, Beneficiary designation made by the
Participant that provides for payment of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
value of all the Participant's Accounts to a Beneficiary other than the
Participant's Spouse shall not be effective unless either (i) the Participant's
Spouse executes a written consent in a form satisfactory to the Committee that
acknowledges the effect of the Beneficiary designation or (ii) it is established
that the Spouse's consent cannot be obtained because the Participant's Spouse
cannot be located.

7.2. CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

      A Participant may change any Beneficiary designation at any time without
the consent of any designated Beneficiary by the filing of a new Beneficiary
designation with the Committee in the manner provided for in Section 7.1;
provided, however, that if the Participant is married, the new Beneficiary
designation shall be subject to the consent requirements in Section 7.1. The
filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel all Beneficiary
designations previously filed for the Plan.

7.3. NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

      If any Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided
in this Article 7, if the Participant's Beneficiary designation is void, or if
all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or are not in existence
at the time of the Participant's death, then the Participant's designated
Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Participant's estate and all benefits
shall be paid in a lump sum.

7.4. CHANGE IN MARITAL STATUS

      If the Participant's marital status changes after the Participant has
designated a Beneficiary, the following rules shall apply:

      (a) If the Participant is married at time of death but was unmarried when
the Beneficiary designation was made, the Beneficiary designation shall be void
unless the Participant's Spouse has consented to it in the manner prescribed in
Section 7.1.

      (b) If the Participant is unmarried at the time of death but was married
when the designation was made:

                           FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS


            (i)  The designation shall be void if the Spouse was named as
                 Beneficiary.

            (ii) The designation shall remain valid if a non-Spouse Beneficiary
                 was named.

      (c) If the Participant was married when the designation was made and is
married to a different Spouse at the time of death, the designation shall be
void unless the Participant's Spouse at time of death has consented to it in the
manner prescribed in Section 7.1.

7.5. EFFECT OF PAYMENT TO BENEFICIARY

      The payment to the designated Beneficiary of the balance of all the

                                 ADMINISTRATION

8.1. ADMINISTRATION BY COMMITTEE

      The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Any decision of the
Committee that does not constitute an abuse of discretion must be upheld by a
court of law or by an arbitrator.

8.2. DUTIES AND POWER OF COMMITTEE

      The Committee shall be responsible for the general operation and
administration of the Plan and the proper execution of its provisions. It shall
also be responsible for the interpretation of the Plan and the determination of
all questions arising thereunder. It shall maintain all necessary books of
accounts and records. It shall have power to establish, interpret, enforce,
amend and revoke, from time to time, such rules and regulations for the
administration of the Plan and the conduct of its business as it deems
appropriate, including the right (i) to decide or resolve any and all questions
including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan;
and (ii) to remedy ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions (provided such
rules and regulations are uniformly applied to all persons similarly situated).
Any action that the Committee is required or authorized to take shall be final
and binding on each and every person who is or may become a Participant or
Beneficiary. The Committee may delegate its authority to administer the Plan.

8.3. AGENTS

      In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time,
employ accountants, actuaries, advisors, attorneys, consultants, record-keepers
and agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and
may from time to time consult with legal counsel who may be counsel to AT&T
Wireless.

8.4. BINDING EFFECT OF DECISIONS

      The decision or action of the Committee in respect to any question arising
out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application
of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final
and conclusive and binding on all persons having any interest in the Plan.

8.5. INDEMNITY OF COMMITTEE

      To the extent permitted by applicable law, AT&T Wireless shall indemnify,
hold harmless and defend the members of the Committee against any and all
claims, loss, damage, expense or liability arising from any action or failure to

the part of any Committee member.

                                   ARTICLE 9.
                               SOURCE OF PAYMENTS

9.1. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST

      AT&T Wireless may, in its sole discretion, establish one or more trusts to
acquire and hold cash, stocks (including, without limitation, AWS Stock), bonds,
mutual funds, insurance policies or other assets to be used to make payments of
benefits under the terms of the Plan. Funds invested hereunder shall, for
purposes of the Plan, be considered to be part of the general assets of the
Participating Company that contributed the funds, and no Participant or
Beneficiary shall have any interest or right in such funds. To the extent trust
assets are available, they may be used to pay benefits arising under the Plan
and, to the extent permitted by such trust, all costs, charges and expenses
relating thereto. To the extent that the funds held in the trust are
insufficient to pay such benefits, costs, charges and expenses, each
Participating Company shall pay such benefits, costs, charges and expenses from
its respective general assets.

9.2. OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY

      Notwithstanding the fact that a trust may be established under Section
9.1, the Company shall remain liable for paying the benefits under the Plan.
However, any payment of benefits to a Participant or Beneficiary made by such a
trust shall satisfy the Company's obligation to make such payment to such
Participant or Beneficiary.

9.3. UNFUNDED STATUS

      The Plan at all times shall be entirely unfunded for purposes of the Code,
and, except as provided in Section 9.1, no provision shall at any time be made
with respect to segregating any assets of AT&T Wireless or the Participating
Company for payment of any benefits hereunder. The Plan constitutes a mere
promise by each Participating Company to make payments, if any, in the future.
No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any particular assets
of AT&T Wireless or any Participating Company by reason of the Participant's or
Beneficiary's right to receive benefits under the Plan, and, to the extent the
Participant or Beneficiary acquires a right to receive benefits under the Plan,
such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor
of the Participating Company.

      10.4.1 REVIEW PROCESS. The claim relating to the adverse benefit
determination shall be reviewed by the Committee, which may, but shall not be
required to, grant the Claimant a hearing. On review, the Claimant may have
representation, examine pertinent documents, and submit issues and comments in
writing. The Claimant or his duly authorized representative may, but need not,

type of benefits payable to any Participant or Beneficiary, and the construction
of all terms of the Plan.

rights described in Article 10 before he seeks any other legal recourse
regarding claims for benefits.

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

11.1. RIGHT TO AMEND PLAN

      The Plan may be amended, in whole or in part, by the Board of Directors at
any time. Notice of any such amendment shall be given in writing to the
Committee and to each Participant (or Beneficiary if a Participant is deceased).
The Board of Directors shall have the right to amend the Plan to clarify the
provisions of the Plan, to change administrative provisions of the Plan and to
effect legal compliance. No amendment shall decrease the value of a
Participant's Accounts or deprive the Participant or Beneficiary of any rights
to which the Participant would have been entitled if the Plan had been
terminated immediately prior to the effective date of such amendment.

11.2. COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE PLAN

      The Board of Directors may partially or fully terminate the Plan and may
terminate any deferral Election pertaining to the Participant at any time. In
the event of any such termination, the Participant shall be entitled to the
amount of that Participant's Account as of the Determination Date immediately
following such termination. Such benefit shall be paid to the Participant in
monthly installments over a period of no more than ten (10) years, except that
the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay out such benefit in a lump sum or
in installments over a period shorter than ten (10) years. In the event benefits
are paid out in installments, the Committee shall have the sole authority to
choose the Valuation Funds used to value the balance in each Account.

11.3. RIGHT TO SUSPEND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

      If the Committee determines that payments of benefits under the Plan would
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's ability to carry on its
business, the Committee may suspend such benefit payments temporarily for such
time as in its sole discretion it deems advisable, but in no event for a period
in excess of one (1) year. During the period of suspension, earnings and losses
shall continue to be credited to each Participant's Accounts, if any, and any
subsequent Dividend Equivalents due shall be paid in cash to the Participant or
Beneficiary. The Company shall pay such suspended payments or distributions in a
lump sum immediately upon the expiration of the period of suspension.

11.4. RESTRICTIONS ON PLAN MODIFICATIONS AFTER A POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CHANGE IN
CONTROL

during a Potential Change in Control Period or upon the occurrence of a Change
in Control:

      (a) No provision of the Plan pertaining to the amount or types of
permissible deferrals, the crediting of Earnings to Accounts, the right to elect
and change elections for the distribution of Accounts, the allowable forms of
benefit payments, the authority of the

Committee or the definitions of the terms "Potential Change in Control" or
"Change in Control" may be amended, modified or suspended, unless the Committee
obtains the written consent of at least eighty percent (80%) of the affected
Participants (or the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant);

      (b) No other amendment that may adversely affect the rights of a
Participant or Beneficiary shall be effective unless the affected Participant or
Beneficiary gives written consent to the adoption of the specific provision in
advance; and

      (c) The Plan may not be terminated until all benefit liabilities have been
satisfied by the Company.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

12.1. UNFUNDED PLAN

      The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to
provide deferred compensation benefits for non-employee Directors of the Company
and therefore is exempt from all the provisions of ERISA.

12.2. NO RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUST

      Any trust, and any assets held thereby to assist the Company in meeting
its obligation under the Plan, shall in no way be deemed to controvert the
provisions of Section 12.1.

12.3. NO IMPLIED RIGHTS

      Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any amendment thereof shall be
construed as giving any Participant, Beneficiary or any other person any legal
or equitable right unless such right shall be specifically provided for in the
Plan or conferred by specific action of the Company in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Plan. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, the
Company shall not be required or be liable to make any payment under the Plan.

12.4. UNSECURED GENERAL CREDITOR

      Neither the Participant nor any other person shall acquire by reason of
the Plan any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company
whatsoever, including, without limiting the generality of, the foregoing, any
specific funds, assets or other property that the Company, in its sole
discretion, may set aside. Any benefits that become payable hereunder shall be
paid from the general assets of the Company. Any property held by Company for
the purpose of generating the cash flow for benefit payments shall remain its
general, unpledged and unrestricted assets. The Company's obligation under the
Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future. With
respect to amounts credited to any Accounts hereunder and any benefits payable
hereunder, a Participant or Beneficiary shall have the status of general
unsecured creditors of the Company by which such Participant is employed and may
look only to the Company and its general assets for payment of such benefits
with no secured or preferential rights to any assets of Company or any other
party for payment of benefits under the Plan. The Participant shall have only a
contractual right to the amounts, if any, payable hereunder unsecured by any
asset of the Company. Nothing contained in the Plan constitutes a guarantee by
the Company that the assets of the Company shall be sufficient to pay any
benefit to any person. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
Participants and Beneficiaries shall be unsecured general creditors.

12.5. NONASSIGNABILITY

      Neither the Participant nor any other person shall have any voluntary or
involuntary right to commute, sell, assign, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or
otherwise encumber, transfer,

hypothecate or convey in advance of receipt the amounts, if any, payable
hereunder, or any part thereof, that are expressly declared to be nonassignable
and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable shall be, prior to actual
payment, subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts,
judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owned by the Participant or any other
person, or be transferable by operation of law in the event of the Participant's
or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.

12.6. PROHIBITION AGAINST ALIENATION

      Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or benefit under the
Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to so anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be
void. No such right or benefit shall be liable for or subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the person entitled to such
right or benefit.

12.7. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED DIRECTORSHIP

      The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute an
agreement providing that any Director will be continued in such a position for
any period of time or any restriction on the right of any appropriate persons to
remove such person from a position as a Director of the Company.

12.8. GOVERNING LAW

      The Plan shall be construed, interpreted and governed in accordance with
applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by such federal law, the
laws of the State of Washington.

12.9. SAVINGS CLAUSE

      If any provision of the Plan is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision, and the remaining provisions hereof shall continue
to be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable provision had
not been included.

12.10. NOTICE

      Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee
under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by
registered or certified mail, to the Committee at the Company's principal place
of business. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if
delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt
for registration or certification. Mailed notice to a Participant or Beneficiary
shall be directed to the individual's last known address in Company's records.

12.11. SUCCESSORS

      The Plan and any deferral election thereunder shall bind and inure to the
benefit of (i) the Company and its successors and assigns, including, without
limitation, any corporation into which the Company may be merged or
consolidated, or which acquires all or substantially all of the assets and
business of the Company, and successors of any such corporation or other

information requested by the Company, in order to facilitate the payment of
benefits hereunder, and taking such other action as may be requested by the
Company.

12.13. GENDER, NUMBER AND HEADING

      Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they shall be
construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases
where they would so apply. Whenever any words are used herein in the singular
