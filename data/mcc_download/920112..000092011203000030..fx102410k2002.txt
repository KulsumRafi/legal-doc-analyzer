 Exhibit 10.24

                    Agreement to Organize and
                      Stockholder Agreement

      This  Agreement to Organize and Stockholder Agreement (this
"Agreement")  dated  as of February 1, 2003, is  among  Heartland
Financial USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),  and
those   individuals  who  are  signatories  to   this   Agreement
(individually  referred to as an "Investor" and  collectively  as
the "Investors").

                            Recitals

      A.    A  new bank has been organized under the laws of  the
State of Arizona known as "Red Mountain Bank" (the "Bank"), and a
board  of  directors  (the  "Board")  has  been  established   to
supervise and govern the Bank's operations.

     B.    The  Company  and  the  Investors  (individually,  an
"Organizer,"  and  collectively,  the  "Organizers")  desire   to
provide additional capital to the Bank, all pursuant to the terms
of  this  Agreement,  and to take all other  steps  necessary  to
prepare  the  Bank to commence retail operations and  transact  a
banking business initially in Mesa, Arizona, and to effect all of
the  other actions contemplated by this Agreement  (collectively,
the "Transaction").

     C.   The Organizers understand that the Transaction requires
the  approval  of  the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve
System  (the  "Federal Reserve"), the Banking Department  of  the
State  of  Arizona  (the "Department"), and the  Federal  Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").

      D.    Upon the completion of the organization of the  Bank,
the  Bank  will  issue  shares of its capital  stock  (the  "Bank
Stock")  to  each  of  the  Organizers  in  proportion  to  their
contributions  to  the  Bank's capitalization  and  as  otherwise
provided in this Agreement.

     E.    The Organizers desire to impose certain restrictions on
the  sale, transfer or other disposition of the Bank Stock  owned
by  the  Investors and to give the Company and the Investors  the
option  to  purchase and sell the shares of Bank Stock  owned  by
them under certain circumstances specified in this Agreement.

      F.    With  the  advice  of counsel,  the  Board  carefully
considered  and  negotiated with the Company  the  terms  of  the
initial  draft of this Agreement, and have approved the  form  of
this   Agreement  as  the  same  was  revised  based  upon   such
negotiations.

      Now,  therefore,  in consideration of the mutual  covenants
herein  contained and for other good and valuable  consideration,
the  receipt  of  which  is  hereby  acknowledged,  each  of  the
Organizers,  intending  to be legally  bound  hereby,  agrees  as
follows:

                           Agreements

                            Article 1
            Bank Organization and Stock Subscription

      Section 1.1    Charter.  The Organizers agree to use  their
best  efforts to cause the Department to authorize the Bank under
the  laws  of the State of Arizona to commence a banking business
and  otherwise  to  effect the Transaction.  The  date  the  Bank
commences  a banking business with the public is referred  to  as
the  "Charter Date."  Each of the undersigned authorizes John  K.
Schmidt,  an  executive  officer of the Company,  or  such  other
individual who may be chosen from time to time by the Company  to
serve  as  the undersigned's lawful agent in connection with  the
Transaction   (the   "Agent"),  and  further   acknowledges   the
employment  of  William  F. Frank as the  Bank's  president  (the
"President").   The  President and the Agent shall  be  primarily
responsible  for preparing and filing all regulatory applications
deemed  by  them  to  be  necessary to  effect  the  Transaction,
including,  but  not limited to, applications  with  the  Federal
Reserve,  the  Department and the FDIC.  Each of  the  Organizers
agrees  to  cooperate fully with the President and the  Agent  in
such efforts.

     Section 1.2    Subscriptions for Bank Stock.

           (a)  The  Organizers  agree that  the  Bank's  initial
capitalization  shall be Fourteen Million Five  Hundred  Thousand
Dollars ($14,500,000) comprised of One Million Four Hundred Fifty
Thousand  (1,450,000) common shares issued  at  a  price  of  Ten
Dollars  ($10.00)  per  share.  The  Organizers  acknowledge  and
accept the following subscriptions for Bank Stock:

                (i)  the  Company  agrees  to subscribe  for  and
purchase One Million Two Hundred Thousand (1,200,000) shares,  or
approximately  Eighty  Two  and Seventy  Six  Hundredths  Percent
(82.76%),  of the initial issuance of Bank Stock at an  aggregate
issuance price of Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000); and

               (ii)  the  Investors  agree  to subscribe for and
purchase,  in the aggregate, Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (250,000)
shares  (the  "Initial  Organizers'  Shares"),  or  approximately
Seventeen  and  Twenty Four Hundredths percent (17.24%),  of  the
initial issuance of Bank Stock at an aggregate issuance price  of
Two  Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000), and each
of  the  Investors  individually  agrees  to  subscribe  for  and
purchase Bank Stock in the amount set forth opposite his  or  her
name on Exhibit A attached hereto, provided, however, that it  is
further acknowledged and reflected on Exhibit A that the Bank has
previously received and expended subscription funds from  certain
of  the Investors (the "Prior Funds") and such Investors shall be
given  full credit against the total amount of subscription funds
that  would  otherwise  be  due and  payable  by  such  Investors
pursuant to the terms of this Section.

           (b)  The Organizers agree that Fifty Thousand (50,000)
shares   of  additional  Bank  Stock,  and  any  of  the  Initial
Organizers'  Shares  up  to a maximum  of  Twenty  Five  Thousand
(25,000) shares that have not been subscribed for by the  Charter
Date  (collectively, the "Additional Shares"), shall be  reserved
for  issuance to additional investors who are mutually acceptable
to  the  Company and the President (individually, an  "Additional
Investor"),  provided that the issuance price for any  Additional
Shares  which shall be determined by the Board and acceptable  to
the Company is no less than Eleven Dollars ($11.00) per share and
that no Additional Shares shall be issued after the date which is
eighteen  months  (18)  after  the  Charter  Date,  and  provided
further, that any Additional Investor becomes a signatory to this
Agreement.   Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,  any
Additional  Investor who becomes a signatory  to  this  Agreement
shall  for  all  purposes of this Agreement be deemed  to  be  an
"Organizer" and an "Investor" and shall be entitled to all of the
same rights and privileges, and be bound by the same obligations,
of any other Organizer or Investor.

           (c)  The  Organizers  agree that if the  Charter  Date
shall not have occurred by the date which is eighteen (18) months
after  the  date of this Agreement, unless such delay shall  have
been caused by the material breach by the Company of any material
term of this Agreement, or unless such time is extended by mutual
agreement  of the Organizers, this Agreement shall terminate  and
each of the Organizers shall:

                (i)  receive  a pro rata portion of  any  of  the
subscription funds previously contributed (after the satisfaction
of  all  expenses  incurred in attempting to organize  the  Bank,
including  the preparation and filing of all necessary regulatory
applications as described in this Agreement); and

               (ii)  accept  such  distribution  in   full
satisfaction of any amounts due under this Agreement to  or  from
any of the other Organizers, including the Company.

           (d)  Except as provided below in this Section, payment
by  an Organizer of the aggregate cash amount for the Organizer's
subscription for the Bank Stock (the "Subscription Amount") shall
be  made  in two installments, with the first installment  in  an
amount  equal  to Ten Percent (10%) of the Organizer's  aggregate
Subscription  Amount (the "First Installment"),  and  the  second
installment  equal to the balance of the Organizer's Subscription
Amount (the "Second Installment").  Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence,  however, the amount of the Company's First Installment
shall  be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and the amount
of  its  Second Installment shall be Eleven Million Five  Hundred
Thousand   Dollars   ($11,500,000).   Each  of   the   Organizers
irrevocably  agrees  to  deliver to the  Agent  either  cash,  or
check(s) made payable to "Red Mountain Bank Escrow Fund," in  the
amount of the Organizer's:

                (i)  First Installment by no later than ten (10)
days  after  the  date  of  each Organizer's  execution  of  this
Agreement; and

               (ii)  Second  Installment  by  no  later  than the
Charter   Date,  unless  the  Agent  and  the  President  jointly
determine that the Bank needs additional funds prior to that time
in order to complete the Transaction.

Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Section  to   the
contrary,  the  full  cash amount for the  subscription,  or  the
purchase,  as  the case may be, of Bank Stock by  any  Additional
Investor  shall  be  made  at the time  the  Additional  Investor
becomes a signatory to this Agreement .

          (e)  The Bank has previously been tendered a "Letter of
Intent"   by  certain  prospective  shareholders  expressing   an
interest  in  investing in the Bank.  The  Bank  has  elected  to
terminate  all such Letters of Intent by a Letter of  Termination
sent  to  each such shareholder together with the uncashed  check
tendered  by  each such shareholder together with the  Letter  of
Intent.

     Section 1.3    Deposit and Expenditure of Organizers' Funds.
All   funds  collected  from  the  Organizers  pursuant  to  this
Agreement  (the  "Organizers' Funds") shall be deposited  into  a
bank  account (the "Organization Account") established  with  the
Dubuque  Bank  and  Trust  Company, Dubuque,  Iowa  (the  "Escrow
Bank").   Upon  the  signature of the  President,  funds  may  be
withdrawn from the Organization Account to be used to pay  normal
and  customary  expenses relating to the Transaction,  including,
but not limited to, the following:

            (a)  expenses  arising  from   or  relating  to   the
organization, capitalization and operation of the Bank, including
the  filing  of  all necessary regulatory applications  with  the
Federal  Reserve,  the  Department and the  FDIC  to  effect  the
Transaction;

            (b)  accounting, auditing, legal, investment banking,
due diligence and appraisal expenses relating to or in connection
with the Transaction;

            (c) salary payments to the President and to any other
officers  or  employees of the Bank that are deemed necessary  by
the Agent; and

            (d)  other expenses arising from or directly relating
to the Transaction;

provided,  however,  that  any expenditures  in  excess  of  Five
Thousand  Dollars ($5,000) shall require the joint  authorization
of   the   President  and  the  Agent.   The  Organizers   hereby
acknowledge  that  the President and the Agent may  begin  making
withdrawals  from  the  Organization  Account  immediately,   and
accordingly,   if   the  Transaction  is  not  consummated,   the
Organizers  will not receive a refund of 100% of the  Organizers'
Funds.

      Section  1.4    Books  and  Records.  The  President  shall
ensure   that  proper  records  of  all  expenditures  from   the
Organization  Account are maintained and such  records  shall  be
available  for  inspection by any Organizer.  The President  will
prepare  and  distribute to each Organizer  a  monthly  financial
report and a copy of the monthly account statement issued by  the
Escrow Bank with respect to the Organization Account.

      Section  1.5    Additional Capital.  Each of the Organizers
agrees  that any additional capital needed by the Bank  shall  be
contributed  by  the  Company  in  return  for  the  issuance  of
additional Bank Stock, provided, however, that:

           (a)  each Investor shall receive the right to purchase
only  that number of shares that would be necessary to allow such
Investor to maintain the same percentage ownership of outstanding
Bank  Stock  he  or  she enjoyed prior to  the  issuance  of  any
additional shares of Bank Stock to the Company;

           (b)   any  right  of  an  Investor  to   purchase  any
additional  shares  of Bank Stock pursuant to the  provisions  of
this  Section would not be transferable or assignable (except  as
provided  in Section 3.6) and any shares of Bank Stock  purchased
in connection with the exercise of such right would be subject to
all the terms of this Agreement;

           (c)  any purchase  of additional shares by an Investor
pursuant  to the terms of this Section must be made on  the  same
terms and conditions as the Company; and

           (d)  any  such offer to purchase additional Bank Stock
could  be made to all the Investors in compliance with applicable
law and without material expense to the Bank.

Except  as  expressly  provided in  this  Section,  each  of  the
Investors  hereby  waives any right granted  to  him  or  her  by
applicable  law  or  otherwise to subscribe for  additional  Bank
Stock,  or  if  the same is not waivable, each of  the  Investors
hereby  agrees  to  assign to the Company any  such  subscription
right as the same may arise in the future.

                            Article 2
               Repurchase Options and Obligations

     Section 2.1    Repurchase Obligation at Fifth Anniversary.

           (a)  Upon  the fifth (5th) anniversary of the  Charter
Date  (the  "Fifth Anniversary"), the Company agrees to  purchase
from  the Investors, and each of the Investors agrees to sell  to
the  Company,  all of the Bank Stock then owned by the  Investors
(the  "Investors' Stock") on the terms set forth in this Section.
The  total  purchase price for the Investors' Stock shall  be  an
amount equal to the "Repurchase Price," as defined below.

           (b) Except as provided in this Section, the Repurchase
Price shall be the appraised value of the Investors' Stock as  of
the Fifth Anniversary as determined by Alex Sheshunoff Management
Services, Inc. or its successor, or if neither such firm nor  its
successor is still in existence and performing appraisals of  the
stock  of  commercial  banks, then by an independent,  nationally
recognized  appraisal firm with no less than (ten)  10  years  of
experience  in appraising the stock of commercial banks,  jointly
selected  by  the  Company  and  the  Investors  (the  "Appraised
Value").   For  purposes of such an appraisal, the value  of  the
Investors'  Stock shall be determined as if the whole  Bank  were
being sold.

           (c)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to  the
contrary, if on the Fifth Anniversary:

               (i)  the Bank has total assets of greater than Two
Hundred  Million  Dollars ($200,000,000) and has  earned  greater
than  a  Ten Percent (10%) average annual return on equity during
the  prior  twenty four (24) months (computed in accordance  with
generally  accepted accounting principles and based upon  average
equity  during such twenty four month period), then in  no  event
shall the Appraised Value represent a multiple on the Bank's  net
earnings  for  the prior twelve (12) months of less  than  twelve
times  (12x)  or greater than eighteen times (18x) such  trailing
twelve (12) months' earnings; and

              (ii)  the   Bank  has  total assets  of  less  than
Two  Hundred  Million Dollars ($200,000,000) or has  earned  less
than  a  Ten Percent (10%) average annual return on equity during
the  prior  twenty four (24) months (computed in accordance  with
generally  accepted accounting principles and based upon  average
equity  during such twenty four month period), then in  no  event
shall the Appraised Value represent a multiple on the Bank's  net
earnings for the prior twelve (12) months of less than six  times
(6x) or greater than twelve times (12x) such trailing twelve (12)
months' earnings.

For  purposes of this Section: (x) the total assets of  the  Bank
shall  not  include the amount of the assets (calculated  at  the
time  of  acquisition)  of any bank, thrift  or  other  financial
institution, or any branch, office or part thereof,  acquired  by
the  Bank  between  the  date of this  Agreement  and  the  Fifth
Anniversary;  and  (y)  in computing return  on  equity,  if  the
corporate  overhead  allocation attributed to  the  Bank  by  the
Company  is greater than that attributed proportionately  to  the
Company's other subsidiaries (based on the average assets of each
subsidiary),  then  the  return on  equity  calculation  will  be
adjusted  such  that  the  Bank's corporate  overhead  allocation
equals  its  pro  rata  percentage share based  upon  the  Bank's
percentage of total average assets to the Company's total average
consolidated assets.

           (d)   The  Repurchase Price shall be paid to Investors
(pro rata based upon their respective percentage ownership of the
Investors' Stock) in two parts:

               (i)  the first part of the Repurchase Price, which
shall  be equal to each Investor's total capital contribution  as
reflected  on  Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be  paid  to  the
Investor,  at the Investor's election (but subject to  compliance
with any applicable securities laws) in cash, common stock of the
Company  ("Company Stock") or a combination of cash  and  Company
Stock; and

              (ii)  the second part of the Repurchase Price,
which shall be equal to each Investor's appropriate share of  the
remaining balance of the total Repurchase Price, shall be paid to
the   Investor,  at  the  Company's  election  (but  subject   to
compliance with any applicable securities laws) in cash,  Company
Stock  or  a combination of cash and Company Stock.  For purposes
of  this  Section, the per share value of Company Stock shall  be
equal  to  the average per share value based upon all  trades  of
Company  Stock  as reported by the media services  of  Bloomberg,
L.P.,  or its successor, during the ninety (90) day period  prior
to the Fifth Anniversary, provided, however, that if on the Fifth
Anniversary  purchase and sale transactions of the Company  Stock
are  reported on the Nasdaq, then the per share value of  Company
Stock  shall  be equal to the average closing prices for  Company
Stock  as  reported on Nasdaq during the ninety (90)  day  period
prior to the Fifth Anniversary.

      Section  2.2    Tender Right.  Each of the Investors  shall
have the right, exercisable at any time after the date hereof and
through  the Fifth Anniversary, to tender all of the  Bank  Stock
owned  by  such Investor to the Company for purchase  at  a  cash
price equal to such Investor's original investment in Bank Stock,
plus  a  Six Percent (6%) annually compounded rate of  return  on
such  original investment (the "Tender Right").  An Investor  may
exercise  the  Tender Right by delivering to the Company  written
notice  of  such  Investor's  intention  to  tender  all  of  the
Investor's  shares  of  Bank Stock to the Company  for  purchase.
Upon  proper  exercise of the Tender Right,  the  Company  hereby
agrees to purchase for cash all of the shares of Bank Stock owned
by the Investor selling such Bank Stock at the purchase price and
on the terms set forth in this Article.

      Section  2.3    Repurchase Upon Company Change of  Control.
If  at  any  time  after the date hereof and  through  the  Fifth
Anniversary  there is a "Change of Control of  the  Company"  (as
defined below), the Company, or its successor, agrees to purchase
from  the  Investors,  and the Investors agree  to  sell  to  the
Company, all of the Bank Stock then owned by the Investors  at  a
price  per  share equal to the Control Premium Price, as  defined
below.  For purposes of this Section, a "Change of Control of the
Company"  shall mean the acquisition by any person or  entity  (a
"Company  Acquirer") of:  (a) legal or beneficial  ownership  (as
defined  by Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities  Exchange
Act  of 1934, as amended) of greater than Two Thirds (2/3) of the
then  issued and outstanding voting stock of the Company  through
any transaction; or (b) all or substantially all of the assets of
the  Company.  The "Control Premium Price" shall be equal to  the
per  share  book value of the Investors' equity interest  in  the
Bank,  multiplied by the same multiple of book value as  paid  by
the Company Acquirer for the stock or assets of the Company.  For
example, if the Company is sold to another entity for three times
the  Company's  book value, the Control Premium  Price  would  be
equal  to  three times the per share book value of the Investors'
equity interest in the Bank.

     Section 2.4    Terms, Time and Place of Closing.

           (a)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by  the
terms  of  this  Article, the purchase price of  any  Bank  Stock

provisions of this Article (the "Closing") shall be held at  such
place and time and on such date as may mutually be agreed upon in

Article,  the  Company  shall  make  the  delivery  described  in

purchased and sold, duly endorsed in blank, with all taxes on the

           (d)  The  consummation  of any purchase of Bank  Stock
pursuant  to this Article (the "Sale Stock") shall be subject  to

which  the  Company agrees to use its best efforts to  obtain  as
soon  as  practicable, provided, however, that if the Company  is
unable,  after  the  exercise  of diligent  efforts,  within  one
hundred  twenty (120) days after the last date provided  in  this
Agreement  for the closing of the purchase of the Sale Stock,  or
such longer period of time as may be mutually agreed upon by  the
prospective purchasers and prospective sellers of the Sale Stock,
to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, then:

               (i)  each  of the  prospective sellers of the Sale
Stock shall be released from any further obligations pursuant  to
the  terms  of  this Agreement solely with respect to  such  Sale
Stock  and shall be free to sell the Sale Stock to any person  or
entity  free of any lien or encumbrance imposed by the  terms  of
this Agreement; and

              (ii)   the  Company  shall  be  released  from  any
further obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement  with
respect  to  the  purchase of the Sale Stock and  shall  have  no
further rights with respect to the Sale Stock.

                            Article 3

           (f)  The Organizer, individually or acting through its
executive   officers,  has  such  knowledge  and  experience   in
financial  and business matters so as to enable the Organizer  to
utilize  the  information made available to him,  her  or  it  in
connection with his, her or its investment in the Bank  in  order
to  evaluate  the merits and risks of such an investment  and  to
make an informed investment decision with respect thereto and the
Organizer has carefully evaluated the risk of such investment.

           (g)   The  Organizer is not relying on the Agent,  the
President,  any  other Organizer or any other  person  acting  on
behalf of the Bank, the Agent, the President or any of the  other
Organizers    with   respect   to   the   Organizer's    economic
considerations relating to this investment; and in regard to such
considerations, the Organizer has relied on the advice of, or has
consulted with, his, her or its own Advisor(s).

           (h)   The Organizer is making the investment evidenced
hereby  solely for the Organizer's own account as principal,  for
investment  purposes only and not with a view to  the  resale  or
participation of any portion thereof, and no other person  has  a
direct or indirect beneficial interest in such investment.

           (i)     Any   Organizer  that  is  also  an   Investor
acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to  register
any  Company Stock that the Organizer may receive pursuant to the
terms  of  this  Agreement,  and further  acknowledges  that  the
receipt by the Organizer of any Company Stock is subject  to  the
Company's  ability to satisfy the requirements of any  applicable
federal or state securities laws, provided, however, that  during
the  two-year period following the issuance by the Company to any
Investor of any shares of the Company's common stock pursuant  to
the  terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to use its  best
efforts  to  file in a timely manner all reports required  to  be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

           (j)  The Organizer acknowledges that a legend will  be
placed   on   each  certificate  representing  the   Bank   Stock
substantially as follows:

           Voluntary and involuntary transfer of any of  the
     shares represented by this certificate are governed  by
     and in all respects subject to the terms and conditions
     of  that  certain Agreement to Organize and Stockholder
     Agreement  among  Heartland  Financial  USA,  Inc.  and
     certain other holders of the Bank's capital stock dated
     as  of February 1, 2003, an executed copy of which  has
     been  deposited  with the Cashier of the  Bank  at  its
     registered  office  in Mesa, Arizona.   Such  Agreement
     imposes  certain  obligations on the  holder  of  these
     shares in certain circumstances, which obligations  and
     circumstances  are described therein.  No  transfer  of
     such  shares  will  be made on the books  of  the  Bank
     unless  accompanied by evidence of compliance with  the
     terms of such Agreement.

           (k)  The  Organizer recognizes that an investment  in
Bank  Stock  involves a number of significant  risks,  including,
without limitation, the following considerations:

               (i)    no Federal or state agency has passed  upon
the  Bank  Stock or made any finding or determination as  to  the
fairness of the investment in Bank Stock; and

              (ii)  there is no established market for  the
Bank  Stock and it is unlikely that a public market for the  Bank
Stock will develop.

           (l)   The Organizer acknowledges receipt of copies  of
certain  financial and other information concerning the  proposed
operations of the Bank, and recognizes that the Bank is a de novo
bank  to  be  organized in the future and  has  no  financial  or
operating  history, that the organization and  operation  of  the
Bank  entails  significant risks, including, without  limitation,
that  the  organization  of  the Bank is  subject  to  regulatory
approvals  and  that there are no assurances that such  approvals
will be obtained.

           (m)   Within five (5) days after receipt of a  request
from  the Agent or the President, the Organizer hereby agrees  to
provide  such  information  and  to  execute  and  deliver   such
documents  as  may  be  reasonably  necessary  to  complete   the
necessary  applications to organize the Bank and to  comply  with
any and all laws and ordinances to which the Bank is subject.

           (n)   The  foregoing representations,  warranties  and
agreements,   together   with  all  other   representations   and
warranties  made or given by the Organizer in any  other  written
statement   or   document  delivered  in  connection   with   the
transactions  contemplated hereby, shall be true and  correct  in
all  respects  on  and  as of the date of the  delivery  of  such
statement or document as if made on and as of such date and shall
survive such date.

      Section  3.3    Indemnification.  Each Organizer agrees  to
indemnify  and hold harmless the Bank, the Agent,  the  President
and  each  of  the  other Organizers and all of their  respective
agents   and   representatives  who  are  associated   with   the
Transaction and all of the proposed officers and directors of the
Bank  against  any  and all loss, liability,  claim,  damage  and
expense  whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any  and  all
expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  investigating,  preparing  or
defending against any litigation commenced or threatened  or  any
claim  whatsoever)  arising  out  of  or  based  upon  any  false
representations  or  warranty  or  breach  or  failure   by   the
undersigned to comply with any covenant or agreement made by  the
undersigned  herein  or in any other document  furnished  by  the
undersigned  to  any  of  the foregoing in  connection  with  the
Transaction.

       Section  3.4     Additional  Information.   Each  of   the
undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Agent or  the
President  may make or cause to be made such further inquiry  and
obtain such additional information from any of the undersigned as
he  may  deem  appropriate, and each of  the  undersigned  hereby
agrees  to  cooperate fully with the Agent and the  President  in
this regard.

      Section 3.5    Irrevocability; Binding Effect.  Each of the
undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that:

           (a)   the  undersigned  is  not  entitled  to  cancel,
terminate or revoke this Agreement or any agreements of  each  of
the undersigned hereunder; and

           (b)   this  Agreement and such other agreements  shall
survive  the  death or disability of each of the undersigned  and
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their   heirs,   executors,  administrators,  successors,   legal
representatives and assigns.

     Section 3.6    Transfer Restrictions.  Each of the Investors
hereby  agrees  that he or she will not sell,  exchange,  assign,
transfer,  pledge, hypothecate, give away (by lifetime  transfer)
or  otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of Bank Stock  at
any  time  owned by him or her without the express prior  written
consent  of  the Company, provided, however, that  the  foregoing
shall  not  prohibit  the transfer of shares  of  Bank  Stock  by
testamentary transfer so long as each recipient of any shares  of
Bank  Stock  becomes a party to this Agreement and agrees  to  be
bound by its terms.

except  Saturday, Sunday and any day on which the Escrow Bank  is
authorized  or  required  by law or other  government  action  to
close.

     Section 4.3    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed
through  the use of separate signature pages or in any number  of
counterparts,  and  each  of  such counterparts  shall,  for  all
purposes,  constitute  one  agreement  binding  on  all  parties,
notwithstanding that all parties are not signatories to the  same
counterpart.

the  entire agreement of the parties with respect to the  subject

affect the validity or legality of the remainder hereof.

     Section  4.6     Assignability.   This   Agreement   is  not
transferable or assignable by any of the undersigned,  except  as
otherwise provided by Section 3.6.

Organizer  may  have  to  transfer or change  the  venue  of  any
litigation  brought against the undersigned by the  Bank  or  the
Agent.

     Section 4.8    Certificate of Non-Foreign Status.  Each  of
the  undersigned  declares that, to the best of  the  Organizer's
knowledge and belief, the following statements are true,  correct
and complete:

           (a)  unless an Internal Revenue Service Form 4224  has
been  completed, each of the undersigned is not a foreign  person
for  purposes of U.S. income taxation (i.e., the Organizer is not
a nonresident alien, nor executing this document as an officer of
a  foreign corporation, as a partner in a foreign partnership, or
as  a fiduciary of a foreign employee benefit plan, foreign trust
or foreign estate);

           (b)  the following information contained elsewhere  in
the  subscription  documents is true, correct and  complete:  the
U.S.  taxpayer  or employee identification number  (e.g.,  social
security number) and the home address; and

           (c)  the undersigned agrees to inform the Bank promptly
if the undersigned becomes a nonresident alien.

      Section  4.9    Director Benefits.  Directors of  the  Bank
will  be afforded the same benefits as directors of the Company's
other financial institution subsidiaries.

      Section  4.10    Solicitation of  Customers  or  Employees.
Commencing with the date of this Agreement and ending on the date
that is two (2) years after the effective date of the sale by  an
Investor  of  all of his or her Bank Stock (the "Non-Solicitation
Period"),  such Investor shall not, directly or indirectly,  call
on,  sell to, solicit business from or render services to any  of
the  Bank's  customers who were customers  of  the  Bank  at  the
commencement  of,  and  during, the Non-Solicitation  Period,  or
recruit,  persuade or attempt to recruit or persuade any employee
of  the  Bank who was an employee of the Bank at the commencement
of  the  Non-Solicitation Period and at  the  time  of  any  such
prohibited act, to leave the Bank's employ, or to become employed
by any other person other than the Bank.

      Section   4.11    Dispute  Resolution.   Unless  otherwise
specifically  provided  for  in  this  Agreement,  all  disputes,
controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or relating
to  this  Agreement, (singularly, a "Dispute," and  collectively,
"Disputes")  shall  be  resolved in  the  following  manner  (the
"Dispute  Resolution  Process"),  provided,  however,  that   the
Dispute   Resolution   Process  shall  be   commenced   only   if
(x)  requested  in  a  written notice (the "Notice  of  Dispute")
describing the Dispute that is delivered to all parties  to  this
Agreement  and  signed  by either the Company,  or  by  Investors
owning  a  majority of the Bank Stock owned by all Investors  and
representing the joint position of all such Investors signing the
Notice  of Dispute and (y) the Dispute has a liquidated  monetary
value of greater than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000):

           (a)  First, within ten (10) days after the receipt  of
Notice of Dispute the parties representing the two opposing sides
of  the Dispute, or representatives of such parties with decision
making  authority  (collectively,  the  "Dispute  Parties,"   and
individually, a "Dispute Party") shall meet and negotiate in good
faith  for a period of fifteen (15) days in an effort to  resolve
the Dispute.

           (b)   Second, if within such fifteen (15) day  period,
the   Dispute  Parties  have  not  succeeded  in  negotiating   a
resolution  of the Dispute, they agree to submit the  Dispute  to
mediation in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with the Commercial
Mediation   Rules   of   the  American  Arbitration   Association
("Mediation")  and  to bear equally the costs of  the  Mediation.
The  Dispute  Parties will jointly appoint a mutually  acceptable
mediator,  provided, however, they if they are  unable  to  agree
upon such appointment within ten (10) days from the conclusion of
the  negotiation period, then the Dispute Parties  shall  request
the  American  Arbitration Association to appoint an  appropriate
mediator.  The Dispute Parties shall agree to participate in good
faith  in  the Mediation and negotiations related thereto  for  a
period of thirty (30) days.

           (c)  Third, if the Dispute Parties are still unable to
resolve the Dispute within such thirty (30) day mediation period,
the  Dispute Parties shall resolve the Dispute by submitting  the
Dispute to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, pursuant  to
the procedures set forth in Section 4.11(d) ("Arbitration").

           (d)   Each  Dispute Party shall submit the Dispute  to
Arbitration  in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration  Rules
of the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois, and
under the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association in
Chicago, Illinois, subject to the following provisions:

               (i)  Each Dispute Party shall set forth in writing
and  deliver  to the arbitrators its position on the issue(s)  in
Dispute, provided, however, that in all Disputes, there shall  be
only  two  positions:   the  Company's  position  and  the  joint
position of all Investors who signed the related Dispute  Notice.
The arbitrators shall have the authority only to rule in favor of
one  of  the  two stated positions of one of the Dispute  Parties
with  respect  to  each different issue, with no  compromises  or
alternative solutions permitted.  The arbitrators shall have  the
authority  to rule for a different Dispute Party with respect  to
each  different  issue presented.  If one of the Dispute  Parties
fails  to submit its position to the arbitrators within the  time
period provided therefor, the arbitrators shall rule in favor  of
the   stated  position  of  the  Dispute  Party  submitting  such
position.

              (ii)      Within  ten (10) days  after submittal of
the  Dispute to Arbitration, the Dispute Parties shall agree upon
an  arbitrator.  If the Dispute Parties are unable to agree  upon
an  arbitrator,  within  fifteen (15)  days  after  submittal  to
arbitration,  each Dispute Party shall appoint an arbitrator  and
within ten (10) days of their appointment the two arbitrators  so
chosen  shall  nominate a third arbitrator.  If within  such  ten
(10)  day  period the two arbitrators fail to nominate the  third
arbitrator,  upon  written request of either Dispute  Party,  the
third  arbitrator shall be appointed by the American  Arbitration
Association from its commercial dispute panel of arbitrators  and
both  Dispute Parties shall be bound by the appointment so  made.
If  either  of  the  Dispute Parties shall  fail  to  appoint  an
arbitrator  as  required  under  this  Section  4.11(d)(ii),  the
arbitrator appointed by the other Dispute Party shall be the sole
arbitrator of the matter.

             (iii)     The decision  of the  arbitrators (or such
single  arbitrator) shall be made within thirty (30) days of  the
close  of  the  hearing  in respect of the Arbitration  (or  such
longer  time  as may be agreed to, if necessary, which  agreement
shall  not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)  and
the  award rendered by a majority of the panel of arbitrators (or
such  single  arbitrator) when reduced to writing and  signed  by
them  shall  be  final, conclusive and binding upon  the  Dispute
Parties.   Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive  upon
the  Dispute Parties and upon all other Investors and a  judgment
thereon may be entered in the highest court of a forum, state  or
federal,  having  jurisdiction.  The expenses of the  Arbitration
shall be borne equally by the Dispute Parties, provided that each
party  shall  pay  for  and bear the cost  of  its  own  experts,
evidence  and  attorneys' fees, provided, however,  that  in  the
discretion of the arbitrators, any award may include the fees and
costs  of  a Dispute Party's attorney if the arbitrator expressly
determines  that  the Dispute Party against whom  such  award  is
entered  has  caused  the Dispute, controversy  or  claim  to  be
submitted  to  Arbitration in bad faith or as a dilatory  tactic.
No Arbitration shall be commenced after the date when institution
of  legal or equitable proceedings based upon such subject matter
would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

              (iv)       Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in
this  Section  4.11(d), any Dispute Party shall be  entitled  to:
(A)   commence   legal   proceedings  seeking   such   mandatory,
declaratory or injunctive relief as may be necessary to define or
protect  the rights and enforce the obligations contained  herein
or  to  maintain  the "status quo ante" of the  parties  to  this
Agreement pending the settlement of a Dispute in accordance  with
the  arbitration  procedures set forth in this  Section  4.11(d);
(B)  commence legal proceedings involving the enforcement  of  an
Arbitration  decision or award or judgment arising  out  of  this
Agreement,  or  (C)  join  any Arbitration  or  legal  proceeding
arising out of this Agreement with any other Arbitration or legal
proceeding arising out of this Agreement.  The "status quo  ante"
is  defined as the last peaceable, uncontested status between the
parties  to  this Agreement, provided, however, that neither  the
party  bringing  the  action nor the party defending  the  action
thereby   waives  its  right  to  Arbitration  of  any   dispute,
controversy  or  claim arising out of or in  connection  with  or
relating to this Agreement.

      Section 4.12   Federal and State Securities and Other Laws.
Each  of  the  undersigned should also be aware of the  following
additional considerations:

     THE INVESTMENTS EVIDENCED BY THIS AGREEMENT ARE NOT, AND THE
BANK STOCK TO BE ISSUED WILL NOT BE, SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OR DEPOSITS
AND  ARE  NOT  AND  WILL NOT BE INSURED BY  THE  FEDERAL  DEPOSIT
INSURANCE CORPORATION, ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR OTHERWISE.

      THE  INTERESTS EVIDENCED BY THIS AGREEMENT  HAVE  NOT  BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATES  OR  UNDER  OTHER APPLICABLE BANKING LAWS OR  REGULATIONS.
SUCH  INTERESTS  HAVE  NOT BEEN APPROVED OR  DISAPPROVED  BY  THE
SECURITIES   AND   EXCHANGE  COMMISSION,  ANY  STATE   SECURITIES
COMMISSION  OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, NOR HAVE  ANY  OF  THE
FOREGOING AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF  SUCH
INTERESTS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNLAWFUL.
