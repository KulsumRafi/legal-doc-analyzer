                                           PART B

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions will apply to the Transaction.

1. Calculation of Interest Amounts

On or as soon as practicable following the first Business Day (or in the case of
a Base Rate Swap, the last Business Day) of each Calculation Period the
Calculation Agent will determine the amount payable by each party in respect of
that Calculation Period on the Payment Date falling at the end of (or in the
case of a Base Rate Swap, next following) that Calculation Period (each a
"Payment") in accordance with the following formulae;

Counterparty Payment = Notional Amount x Fixed Rate x Day Count Fraction

Bank Payment = Notional Amount x Floating Rate x Day Count Fraction

"Base Rate Swap" means a Transaction pursuant to which the Floating Rate is
calculated by reference to the Bank's base lending rate.

"Calculation Period" means in respect of a party, each period from and including
one Period End Date for that party to, but excluding, the next following Period
End Date for such party during the term of this Transaction, except that the
initial Calculation Period will commence on, and include, the Effective Date and
(b) the final Calculation Period will end on, but exclude, the Termination Date:
and



<PAGE>

                     [THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND LETTERHEAD]


"Day Count Fraction" means the actual number of days in the Calculation Period
in respect of which payment is being made divided by 365.

"Effective Date" means the first day of the term of the Transaction, as
specified in Part A above.

"Payment Date" means, in respect of the Counterparty, each Counterparty Payment
Date and, in respect of the Bank, each Bank Payment Date.

"Period End Date" means each Payment Date, provided that in the case of a Base
Rate Swap it shall mean, in respect of the Counterparty, each date specified as
a Counterparty Period End Date in Part A, and in respect of the Bank, each date
specified as a Bank Period End Date in Part A.

"Termination Date" means the last day of the term of the Transaction, as
specified in Part A above.

The Calculation Agent will advise the parties of the Floating Rate, its
calculation of the Counterparty Payment and the Bank Payment on or about the
next following Payment Date.

2. Payments

On each Payment Date the parties will, subject to (1) the condition precedent
that no Event of Default or potential Event of Default with respect to the other
party has occurred and is continuing, and (2) the condition precedent that no
Early Termination Date in respect of the Transaction has occurred or been
effectively designated, make the Payments specified in Part A.

On each Payment Date each party's obligation to make payment of any amount will
be automatically satisfied and discharged and replaced by an obligation upon the
party by whom the larger amount would have been payable to pay to the other
party the excess of the larger amount over the smaller amount. If the amounts
payable by each party on any Payment Date are the same, then no payment shall be
made by either party on such Payment Date.

3. Business Days

Where "Following" is specified in Part A hereof as the applicable Business Day
Convention and a date on which a Payment Date is due to fall is not a Business
Day then such Payment Date will be the next following day that is a Business
Day.

Where "Modified Following" is specified in Part A hereof as the applicable
Business Day Convention and a date on which a Payment Date is due to fall is not
a Business Day then such Payment Date will be the next following day that is a
Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case
that Payment Date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day.

"Business Day" shall mean (i) if "London" is specified in Part A as the
applicable Business Day, any day on which commercial banks are open for general
business in London, and (ii) if "TARGET" is specified in Part A as the
applicable Business Day, any day on which TARGET (the Trans-European Automated
Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system) is open.

               the obligations of that party (a "Credit Support Provider") fails

       (ii)    the expiration or termination of any credit support in respect of
               the obligations of that party or the failing or ceasing of such

       transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity, or
       any person or entity acquires directly or indirectly the beneficial
       ownership of equity securities having the power to elect a majority of
       the board of directors

      of that party or otherwise acquires directly or indirectly the power to
      control the policy-making decisions of that party, and the
      creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is
      materially weaker than that of that party (which party shall be the
      Affected Party) immediately prior to such action, provided that this
      Termination Event shall not apply to a Counterparty that is a private
      individual; and

(d)   Any Additional Termination Event as set out in Part A.

6. Notice of Termination

(a)   Immediately following the occurrence of an Event of Default or Termination
      Event the defaulting party or the party in respect of which the
      Termination Event occurs (in each case, the "Affected Party"), shall
      notify the other party (the "non-Affected Party"), specifying the nature
      of that Event of Default or Termination Event, and will also give such
      other information about that Event of Default or Termination Event as the
      other party may reasonably require.

(b)   The non-Affected Party may, in the notice described in Section 6(a) above
      or in a later notice, elect to designate a date on which the Transaction
      will terminate (the "Early Termination Date"), immediately whereupon each
      party shall be released and discharged from its obligations under the
      Transaction subject always to Section 7 below and providing always that
      the foregoing shall be without prejudice to any rights, obligations or
      liabilities of the parties hereto under the Transaction which may have
      accrued up to and including the date of such notice.

7. Payments on Termination

(a)   The Calculation Agent, in good faith and acting reasonably, will determine
      an amount, if any, (the "Termination Payment") that would be paid by
      (expressed as a positive) or to (expressed as a negative) the non-Affected
      Party in consideration of an agreement between the non-Affected Party and
      a Reference Market Maker that would have the effect of preserving for the
      non-Affected Party the economic equivalent of any payment in respect of
      the Transaction that would, but for the occurrence of the Early
      Termination Date, have been required after that date.

(b)   An amount will be payable equal to the amount determined by the
      Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 7(a) plus any amounts which
      have fallen due but remain unpaid as at the Early Termination Date owing
      to the non-Affected Party, and less any amounts which have fallen due but
      remain unpaid as at the Early Termination Date owing to the Affected
      Party.

(c)   If the amount determined in accordance with Section 7(b) above is a
      positive number, the Affected Party will pay that amount to the
      non-Affected Party; if it is a negative number then the non-Affected Party
      will pay that amount to the Affected Party.

(d)   Any amount payable under this Section 7 will, at the option of the
      non-Affected Party, be reduced by its set-off against any amounts payable
      (whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a
      contingency) by or to, as appropriate, the non-Affected Party
      (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the
      obligation) under any other agreement(s) between the parties or
      instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or executed by one party to, or in
      favour of, the other party.

For the purposes of this Section 7, the term "Reference Market Maker" shall mean
a leading dealer in interest rate swaps that is (a) a dealer of the highest
credit standing which satisfy all criteria that the Calculation Agent applies
generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make an extension of
credit and (b) to the extent practicable, a dealer having an office in the same
city.
