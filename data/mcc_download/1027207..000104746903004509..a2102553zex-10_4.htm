liability for failure to issue and sell Stock to satisfy the Option until such time as such authority is obtained. </FONT></P>

his intention to acquire the Stock for his private investment only and not for resale or distribution to the public. The Company may stamp any
certificate representing such Stock with a legend to the effect that such Stock has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and that it may not be sold or transferred until
so registered, or until an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company is received to the effect that such registration is not necessary. In the event any Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement is
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, then the investment representations and restrictions imposed pursuant to federal securities law shall automatically be inoperative with respect
to such Stock. Whenever the Company next files a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-8, Company will include in that registration statement all of the Option Shares. </FONT></P>
