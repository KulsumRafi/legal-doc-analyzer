creation of additional Licensed Hematology Products.&#160; Upon approval by the Steering Committee of those additional Designated Hematology Antigen Sets, SMC will have the option to obtain an exclusive license to the THP Technology with regard to the use of each Designated Hematology Antigen Set for the development, manufacture and sale of Licensed Hematology Products.&#160; To enable SMC, with reasonable due diligence, to develop and produce Licensed Hematology Products under any Hematology Commercial Licenses granted therefor, THP will provide THP Animals to SMC.&#160; While the majority of Licensed Hematology Product development efforts will be directed and conducted by SMC, the Parties will work collaboratively in such efforts, including the design of isolation, purification and development strategies.&#160; The goal of such efforts is, if the Licensed Hematology Product has the appropriate technical characteristics, to seek to obtain the requisite Regulatory Approvals for a Licensed Hematology
Product in an expeditious manner.&#160; </font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A Steering Committee will be formed to control certain aspects of the Hematology Alliance.&#160; Unless otherwise agreed by the Steering Committee, SMC will be primarily responsible for preclinical testing, clinical testing, activities in pursuit of Regulatory Approval, and commercial activities related to marketing and selling any Licensed Hematology Products.&#160; Further, SMC and its Sublicensees will have the exclusive, worldwide right to commercialize each Licensed Hematology Product.&#160; THP will have the right to participate in the funding of development of Licensed Hematology Products and if it does so fund, to share in the profits from sales of such Licensed Hematology Products.<b>&#160; </b>The Parties will manage the development of each Licensed Hematology Product through the Steering Committee and, as applicable, a joint development committee (the &#147;<b>Joint Development Committee</b>&#148; or &#147;<b>JDC</b>&#148;), each as discussed in further

The Steering Committee will be the same Steering Committee as that formed pursuant to the hTG Collaboration Agreement, and will continue on even if the hTG Collaboration Agreement expires or is terminated prior to the termination of this Hematology Alliance Agreement.&#160; The Parties will endeavor to designate employees with the appropriate skills and experience necessary to perform the tasks and supervisory functions of the Steering Committee, and with seniority sufficient to facilitate decision-making on
