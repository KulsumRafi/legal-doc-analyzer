<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In addition to creating
rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are
responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan.&#160; The people who operate the Plan, called
&#147;fiduciaries&#148; of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest
of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.&#160; No one, including your employer, your union or any other person,
may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you
from obtaining a Plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">If your claim for a Plan
benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why
this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without
charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Under ERISA, there are steps
you can take to enforce the above rights.&#160;
For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest
annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may
file suit in a Federal court.&#160; In such a
case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and
pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials
were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">If you have a claim for
benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in
a state or Federal court.&#160; In addition,
if you disagree with the Plan&#146;s decision or lack thereof concerning the
qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support
order, you may file suit in Federal court.</font></p>
