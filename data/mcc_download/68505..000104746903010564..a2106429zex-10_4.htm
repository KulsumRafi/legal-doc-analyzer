SHARE OPTION PLAN OF 1991  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Plan shall be known as the "Share Option Plan of 1991" (hereinafter referred to as the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain key employees of Motorola,&nbsp;Inc.
(the "Company") and its subsidiaries with additional incentive to increase their efforts on the Company's behalf and to remain in the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by granting key
employees from time to time options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company. The options granted under this Plan may, but need not, constitute "incentive stock options" (referred to herein
as "Incentive" options) within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422, or any successor section, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). An option granted which does not constitute
an Incentive option shall for purposes of the Plan constitute a "Non-Qualified" option. The terms "subsidiary" and "subsidiaries" mean and include any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business entity or organization in which a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest is, at the time, directly or indirectly, owned by the Company or by one or more subsidiaries or by
the Company and one or more subsidiaries, except that with respect to any key employee who is subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "1934 Act"), the
terms "subsidiary" or "subsidiaries" mean and include any corporation or other entity at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares of which (other than directors' qualifying shares) is, at the
time, directly or indirectly owned by the Company or by one or more subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing definitions, with respect to Incentive options, "subsidiary" shall mean "subsidiary
corporation" as defined in Section&nbsp;424(f) of the Code. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"), or such other
committee as may be designated by the Board of Directors. The Committee shall have full authority to act in all matters pertaining to the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
provision, the Committee is authorized and shall have full power and authority, subject to the provisions of the Plan, from time to time, to establish such rules and regulations as it may deem
appropriate for the proper administration and operation of the Plan, and to make such determinations under, and such interpretations of, and to take such steps in connection with the Plan and the
options granted thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable. All determinations of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment
for Shares purchased upon exercise of an option granted hereunder shall be made in full for all Shares purchased at the time of purchase. An optionee may pay the
option price (a)&nbsp;in cash, (b)&nbsp;by transferring to the Company Shares owned by the optionee equal in Fair Market Value, as herein defined, to all or part of the aggregate option price of
the Shares being purchased, or (c)&nbsp;by a combination of the means specified in (a)&nbsp;or (b). No fractional Shares may be purchased. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph&nbsp;4
hereof, the Fair Market Value of Shares shall be determined as follows: (i)&nbsp;if the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading on the date of the purchase or grant and Shares trade on the New
York Stock Exchange on that day, the Fair Market Value shall be the average of the high and low prices for Shares as reported on the Composite Tape, or (ii)&nbsp;if the New York Stock Exchange is
not open for trading on the date of the purchase or grant or if Shares do not trade on the New York Stock Exchange on that day, the Fair Market Value shall be the closing price for Shares as reported
on the Composite Tape for the last previous day on which Shares did so trade. </FONT></P>

the Company is required to withhold any tax for Federal Insurance Contribution Act ("FICA") purposes and/or any federal, state or local income tax or taxes in
connection with the exercise of a Non-Qualified option by an optionee, the Committee may permit the optionee, subject to the restrictions herein contained, to satisfy, in whole or in part,
the optionee's obligation to pay to the Company the amount of such tax or taxes by electing (a)&nbsp;to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares which would otherwise be issuable to such
optionee upon exercise of the option, or (b)&nbsp;to deliver and transfer to the Company Shares previously owned by the optionee, or (c)&nbsp;by a combination of the means specified in
(a)&nbsp;and (b); provided, however, that the amount of federal, state and local income taxes that may be paid by delivery or withholding of Shares shall not exceed the applicable statutory minimum
withholding requirements. The amount of any withholding tax not paid by delivery or withholding of Shares shall be paid by the optionee to the Company in cash. Any fractional Share shall also be paid
in cash. Shares delivered or withheld shall have a Fair Market Value equal (as near as possible) to the amount of tax required to be withheld, or such part of such tax that the optionee elects to pay
with Shares. The Fair Market Value of the Shares delivered to or withheld by the Company shall be determined as provided in this Section&nbsp;9 as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is
determined (the "Tax Date") or if Shares did not
trade on the New York Stock Exchange on the Tax Date, as of the last previous date Shares did so trade. An election by an optionee to deliver Shares or to have Shares withheld to satisfy tax
withholding requirements shall be subject to the following restrictions: (1)&nbsp;if the election is made by an optionee other than an optionee who is a director or officer of the Company subject to
Section&nbsp;16 of the 1934 Act: (i)&nbsp;the election shall be made on or prior to the option exercise date, (ii)&nbsp;the election shall be irrevocable unless revocation is approved by the
