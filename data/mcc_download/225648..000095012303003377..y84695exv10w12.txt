                                                               December 20, 2002


The Special Committee of the Board of Directors
Danielson Holding Corporation
767 Third Avenue
New York, NY 10017
Attention: David M. Barse


Dear David:

      This letter agreement (the "Agreement") will confirm the understanding
between the Special Committee (the "Special Committee") of the Board of
Directors of Danielson Holding Corporation ("DHC," and together with its
subsidiaries, the "Company") and Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and its
affiliates, successors and assigns, as appropriate ("CSFB" or "we"), pursuant to
which the Special Committee has retained CSFB to serve as its financial advisor,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in connection with
Restructuring Transactions and other matters referred to herein.

1.    Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement, all defined
      references shall have the meanings as set forth herein (including the
      schedules hereto).

2.    Services. The Special Committee hereby retains CSFB, and CSFB agrees to
      act, as financial advisor to the Special Committee, and, if appropriate
      and if requested by the Special Committee during the period prior to the
      Plan Presentation (as defined below), the Company and DHC's wholly-owned
      subsidiary, American Commercial Lines LLC (separately, and together with
      its subsidiaries and AC Lines LLC and American Commercial Lines Holdings
      LLC, "ACL"), in connection with all Restructuring Transactions and any
      other matters referred to herein. As used herein, "Restructuring
      Transaction" shall not include any sales of ACL stock or assets or ACL
      purchases of assets from third parties. As part of this engagement, CSFB
      will, as requested and appropriate:

      (a)   assist and provide advisory and analytical support to the Special
            Committee and, as appropriate upon the Special Committee's request,
            the Company and ACL, in developing and evaluating a restructuring
            plan with respect to ACL (an "ACL

            Restructuring Plan") to be presented on December 27, 2002 (the "Plan
            Presentation") to the lenders under the Bank Facility (the "Bank
            Lenders");

      (b)   after December 27, 2002, advise the Special Committee, as
            appropriate upon the Special Committee's request, with respect to
            any amendments or updates to the ACL Restructuring Plan;

      (c)   if requested by the Special Committee and appropriate and
            customarily rendered by CSFB and consented to by CSFB in its sole
            discretion, render an opinion as to the fairness from a financial
            point of view to the Company of the consideration to be received or
            paid, as the case may be, in a proposed Restructuring Transaction
            that is the type of transaction for which CSFB customarily renders
            fairness opinions; provided, however, that the Company, Special
            Committee and/or ACL shall retain their own legal counsel and
            accountants for legal and tax advice. If we are requested to and it
            is appropriate and we agree to render an opinion, the nature and
            scope of our analysis as well as the form and substance of our
            opinion shall be such as we deem appropriate. If requested by you,
            our opinion shall be delivered in writing; and

      (d)   perform such other financial advisory services as CSFB and the
            Special Committee may from time to time agree upon.

3.    Compensation. As compensation for services rendered and to be rendered
      hereunder by CSFB, the Company and ACL agree, subject to the provisions of
      Section 3 below, to jointly and severally pay CSFB (or cause CSFB to be
      paid) non-refundable cash fees as follows:

      (a)   If ACL completes a Restructuring Transaction, a transaction fee (the
            "Restructuring Fee"), payable immediately in immediately available
            funds upon completion of the first Restructuring Transaction, equal
            to $1,800,000. CSFB's engagement hereunder shall terminate upon the
            payment of such Restructuring Fee;

      (b)   A fee of $1,000,000 (the "Opinion Fee") payable to CSFB upon
            rendering of an opinion, if any, pursuant to Section 2(b), to the
            Special Committee. The Opinion Fee will be fully creditable (to the
            extent paid) against the Restructuring Fee; and

      (c)   In addition to the compensation to be paid to CSFB as provided
            above, and without regard to whether any Restructuring Transaction
            is consummated, the Company and ACL shall jointly and severally pay
            to, or on behalf of CSFB, all out-of-pocket expenses (including all
            fees and expenses of CSFB's counsel if any, and any other advisor
            retained by CSFB (it being understood that the retention of any such
            advisor, other than legal counsel, will be made with the prior
            approval of the
<PAGE>

            Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld))
            incurred by CSFB in connection with its services to be rendered
            hereunder.

4.    Termination or Resignation. Subject to Section 9 hereof, CSFB's engagement
      hereunder may be terminated at any time by either CSFB or the Special
      Committee upon ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other party;
      provided, however, that in the event of any termination or expiration of
      CSFB's engagement hereunder, if at any time prior to the expiration of 12
      months after any such termination or expiration (the "Extended Term") the
      Company or any Related Entity, including ACL, proceeds with any
      Restructuring Transaction, CSFB will continue to be entitled to receive
      the full amount of compensation provided for in Section 3 hereof as if
      CSFB had served as financial advisor or in any other specified role herein
      in connection therewith as though this Agreement had not been terminated
      or expired; and provided further that no termination or expiration of
      CSFB's engagement hereunder shall affect the Company's and ACL's
      obligations to jointly and severally pay CSFB promptly all fees accrued
      prior to such termination or expiration and reimburse all of CSFB's
      out-of-pocket expenses as described above, and to indemnify CSFB and
      certain related persons and entities as provided in Schedule I, and during
      the Extended Term only, the Company's obligations pursuant to Section 3
      hereof.

5.    Indemnity. As CSFB will be acting on behalf of the Special Committee, the
      Company and ACL, as appropriate and if requested by the Special Committee,
      the Company and ACL agree to indemnify the Indemnified Persons as set
      forth in Schedule I hereto, which is incorporated herein and made a part
      hereof.

6.    Representations and Warranties of Company. The Company and ACL represent
      and warrant to CSFB that at the commencement, throughout the continuance,
      and at the consummation of each Restructuring Transaction

      (a)   Each of the Offer Documents will comply in all material respects
            with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
            the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
            Act"), and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"
            and collectively with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the
            "Acts"), as such Acts may be applicable, and in each case the
            applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
            Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") thereunder, and with all
            material applicable rules or regulations of any governmental or
            regulatory authority or body, including applicable Blue Sky or
            similar securities laws or statutes, and no consent or approval of,
            or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority or body is
            required in connection with the commencement or consummation of any
            such transaction, other than those consents or approvals which will
            have been obtained or any filing which will have been made prior to
            the consummation of each such transaction and other than notice
            filings

            which may be made after the consummation of such transaction without
            any adverse effect upon the Company and/or any Related Entity,
            including ACL;

      (b)   None of the Offer Documents and no other report, filing, document,
            release or communication published or filed by or on behalf of the
            Company or any Related Entity, including ACL, in connection with any
            of such transactions will contain any untrue statement of a material
            fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
            statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
            were made, not misleading;

      (c)   Any new securities offered in consideration of any Old Securities
            ("New Securities") that are debt instruments (the "New Debt
            Securities"), if any, and the indentures pertaining to the New Debt
            Securities and any supplemental indentures pertaining to any
            amendments to the Old Securities (together, the "Indentures") will
            be duly authorized by the Company and any other appropriate Related
            Entity, and when the Indentures are duly executed in accordance with
            such authorization and when the New Securities are issued, the
            Indentures and the New Debt Securities will be the legal, valid and
            binding obligations of the Company and/or any appropriate Related
            Entity, enforceable against the Company and/or any appropriate
            Related Entity in accordance with their respective terms, except
            that such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
            reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
            effect relating to creditors' rights generally and general
            principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
            a proceeding in equity or at law), and each of the New Securities
            and the Indentures, if any, will conform to the description thereof
            in the Offer Documents in all material respects;

      (d)   The New Securities that are capital stock, if any, will be duly
            authorized by the Company and/or any Related Entity, including ACL
            and, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and
            non-assessable;

      (e)   The New Debt Securities, if any, and the Indentures, if any, will
            comply in all material respects with the TIA;


      (f)   The issuance of the New Securities and the consummation of the
            transactions contemplated by the Offer Documents will not result in
            a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
            default or cause an acceleration of any obligation under, the
            Company's charter or bylaws or any material bond, note, debenture or
            other evidence of indebtedness or any material indenture, mortgage,
            deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company
            and/or any Related Entity, including ACL is a party or by which it
            or any of them is bound, or any order of any court or governmental
            agency or authority entered in any proceeding to which the

            Company and/or any Related Entity, including ACL was or is a party
            or by which it or any of them is bound, except as could not, singly
            or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
            properties, business, results of operations or condition (financial
            or otherwise) of the Company, taken as a whole;

      (g)   This Agreement will be duly authorized and validly executed and
            delivered by the Company, ACL and the Special Committee and will

            other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors'
            rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of
            whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)

            or indirectly, for soliciting or recommending such 3(a)(9) Offer to
            any soliciting broker, dealer, salesman, agent, employee or director
            of the Company, or any other person involved in any way on behalf of
            the Company in conflict with such Section 3(a)(9).

            information and data furnished to it by the Company's officers,

      (c)   The Company, ACL and the Special Committee acknowledge and agree

            Company and ACL, if CSFB provides services to the Company and ACL,
            upon request of the Special Committee;

      (d)   If this Agreement becomes subject to approval by a United States
            Bankruptcy Court, concurrently with the filing of a chapter 11

            the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Company shall
            further act in good faith to obtain a hearing date as soon as
            practicable, subject to the Court's calendar, for approval of the
            terms and conditions of this Agreement, and shall further at such
            hearing use its best efforts to obtain approval of the terms and
            conditions of this Agreement; and

      (e)   Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impose
            or create any liability upon any officer or director of Company or
            ACL, or any person who is a member or ex officio member of the
            Special Committee for any fee, compensation, expense or
            indemnification liability whatever.

8.    Confidentiality. Except to the extent authorized by the Special Committee,
      the Company, or ACL or required by any Federal or state law, rule or
      regulation or any decision or order of any court or regulatory authority,

and each such entity or person, an "Indemnified Person") from and against any
losses, claims, damages, judgments, assessments, costs and other liabilities
(collectively "Liabilities"), and will reimburse each Indemnified Person for all
fees and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
(collectively, "Expenses") as they are incurred in investigating, preparing,
pursuing or defending any claim, action, proceeding or investigation, whether or
not in connection with pending or threatened litigation and whether or not any
Indemnified Person is a party (collectively, "Actions"), (i) caused by, or
arising out of or in connection with, any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the offer documents referred to in the
agreement (including any amendments thereof and supplements thereto) ("Offer
Documents") or by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (other than untrue statements or
alleged untrue statements in, or omissions or alleged omissions from,
information relating to an Indemnified Person furnished in writing by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Person expressly for use in the Offer Documents) or
(ii) otherwise arising out of or in connection with advice or services rendered
or to be rendered by any Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any Indemnified Person's actions or
inactions in connection with any such advice, services or transactions; provided
that, in the case of clause (ii) only, the Company will not be responsible for
any Liabilities or Expenses of any Indemnified Person to the extent such
Liabilities or Expenses are determined by a judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction which is no longer subject to appeal or further review to have
resulted primarily from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with any of the advice, actions, inactions or services
referred to above.

      Upon receipt by an Indemnified Person of actual notice of an Action
against such Indemnified Person with respect to which indemnity may be sought
under this agreement, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Company
in writing; provided that failure so to notify the Company shall not relieve the
Company from any liability which the Company may have on account of this
indemnity or otherwise, except to the extent the Company shall have been
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Company may assume the defense of any
such Action including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to CSFB.
Any Indemnified Person shall have the
<PAGE>
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Person, unless: (i) the Company has failed promptly
to assume the defense and employ counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such
Action (including any impleaded parties) include such Indemnified Person and the
Company, and such Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from
or in addition to those available to the Company; provided that the Company
shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the fees and expenses of
more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with any Action in the same
jurisdiction, in addition to any local counsel. The Company shall not be liable
for any settlement of any Action effected without its written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld). In addition, the Company will not, without
prior written consent of CSFB (which shall not be unreasonably withheld),
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek
to terminate any pending or threatened Action in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any
Indemnified Person is a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified
Person from all Liabilities arising out of such Action.

      In the event that the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to an Indemnified
Person other than in accordance with this Agreement, the Company shall
contribute to the Liabilities and Expenses paid or payable by such Indemnified
Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits
to the Company and its shareholders, on the one hand, and to CSFB, on the other
hand, of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding clause is not permitted by the applicable
law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company,
on the one hand, and CSFB, on the other hand, in connection with the matters as
to which such Liabilities or Expenses relate, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations; provided that in no event shall the Company contribute
less than the amount necessary to ensure that all Indemnified Persons, in the
aggregate, are not liable for any Liabilities and Expenses in excess of the
amount of fees actually received by CSFB pursuant to this Agreement. For
purposes of this paragraph, the relative benefits to the Company and its
shareholders, on the one hand, and to CSFB, on the other hand, of the matters
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as
(a) the total value paid or contemplated to be paid or received or contemplated
to be received by the Company or the Company's shareholders, as the case may be,
in the transaction or transactions that are within the scope of this Agreement,
whether or not any such transaction is consummated, bears to (b) the fees paid
to CSFB under this Agreement.

      The Company also agrees that no Indemnified Person shall have any
liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the
Company for or in connection with advice or services rendered or to be rendered
by any Indemnified Person pursuant to this agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or any Indemnified Person's actions or inactions in
connection with any such advice, services or transactions except to the extent
that Liabilities (and related Expenses) of the Company are determined by a
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction which
<PAGE>
is no longer subject to appeal or further review to have resulted primarily from
such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection
with any such advice, actions, inactions or services in connection with
subsection (ii) in the second paragraph of this Schedule I.

      The reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations of the Company
set forth herein shall be joint and several shall apply to any modification of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
termination of, or the completion of any Indemnified Person's services under or
in connection with, this Agreement. Anything else in this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the reimbursement, indemnity and contribution
obligations of the Company, nor any other obligations of the Company, set forth
herein shall apply with respect to any Liabilities or Expenses arising out of
the securities trading and brokerage activities referred to in Section 18 of the
Agreement.
