Agreement), and (D) the Subordinated Lender shall have consented to the creation
of ORC Telecom by SHS and to the terms and conditions of this Amendment to the
extent it has the right to do so.

     The foregoing consent is specifically limited in time and scope to the
individual occurrences described above and shall not be deemed to extend or
apply to any other event or occurrence in existence as of the date hereof
(including, without limitation, any event or occurrence not listed on any
Schedule to the Credit Agreement) or arising hereafter.

     4.   Additional Covenants. Borrowers hereby covenant and agree as follows:

     (a)  In the event that (i) an Event of Default occurs under Section 6.1(A)
or (ii) Borrowers breach any of the financial covenants as set forth in Sections
4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Agreement, within forty-five (45) days
after (A) an Event of Default occurs under Section 6.1(A) or (B) the financial
statements for the respective period set forth in clause (ii) above are required
to be delivered pursuant to Section 4.8 of the Agreement, the Borrower shall:

          (x)  engage, at Borrower's expense, an investment banker selected by
     Borrowers and acceptable to Agent and the Requisite Lenders, for the
     purpose of conducting the sale of ORC ProTel, Inc. Within such time period,
     the Agent, Requisite Lenders, and Borrowers shall agree upon a mutually
     satisfactory timeline for completing such sale, including, without
     limitation, establishing milestone dates for, among other things,
     completing marketing materials, soliciting bids, completing due diligence
     and establishing closing dates; or

          (y)  engage, at Borrower's expense, a consultant or financial advisor
     selected by Borrowers and acceptable to Agent and Requisite Lenders (the
     "Advisor"), to, among other things: analyze the business and operations of
     Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, identify cost cutting measures, conduct
     analysis of United States market research business, and formulate a plan
     for effectuating such measures (collectively, the "Plan"). Borrowers shall
     cause the Advisor to prepare and issue the Plan and to deliver to Agent and
     Lenders a copy thereof within thirty (30) days after the Advisor is
     engaged. Promptly thereafter, Borrowers, Agent, and Lenders shall meet to
     review and discuss the Plan, after which Borrowers shall promptly and with
     due diligence implement the recommendations set forth in such plan.

          The foregoing shall not limit or impair any rights, privileges and/or
     remedies available to Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents and
     applicable law as a result of any such Event of Default, all of which are
     expressly reserved.

     (b)  Not later than May 1, 2003, Borrower shall obtain and deliver to Agent

following conditions precedent:

     (a)  Borrowers shall have executed and delivered this Amendment, and such

clause (e), "Aggregate Commitment" shall mean, with respect to the Lenders who
have executed this Amendment, the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment of such
Lenders plus the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans of such Lenders, in

hereof.

     7.   Severability. Any provision of this Amendment held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable shall not impair or

instrument or agreement executed in connection with the Agreement shall be
deemed to be a reference to the Agreement as modified by this Amendment.

     9.   Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in one or more

together shall be one and the same instrument.

     10.  Ratification. The terms and provisions set forth in this Amendment
shall modify and supersede all inconsistent terms and provisions of the
Agreement and shall not be deemed to be a consent to the modification or waiver
of any other term or condition of the Agreement. Except as expressly modified
and superseded by this Amendment, the terms and provisions of the Agreement are
ratified and confirmed and shall continue in full force and effect.

     11.  Reaffirmation. Each Loan Party party hereto has executed and delivered
one or more of the Security Documents and/or the other Loan Documents as debtor,
grantor, pledgor, guarantor, assignor, or in other similar capacities in which
such Person has granted liens or security interests in their respective
properties or otherwise acted as an accommodation party or guarantor, as the
case may be. Each Loan Party party hereto hereby ratifies and reaffirms all of
its respective payment and performance obligations, contingent or otherwise,
under the Security Documents and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party
and, to the extent any such Person has granted liens on or security interests in
any of their respective properties pursuant to any of the Security Documents or
any of the other Loan Documents as security for or otherwise guaranteed the
Obligations under or with respect to the Agreement or any other Loan Documents,
hereby ratifies and reaffirms such payment and performance obligations,
guarantee and grant of security interests and liens and confirms and agrees that
such security interests and liens hereafter secure all of the Obligations. Each
Loan Party party hereto agrees that each of the Security Documents and each
other Loan Document remains in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and
reaffirmed, and agrees that the Amendment shall not (i) operate as a waiver of
any right, power or remedy of Agent or Lenders under the Loan Documents or (ii)
constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan Documents or serve to
effect a novation of the Obligations.
