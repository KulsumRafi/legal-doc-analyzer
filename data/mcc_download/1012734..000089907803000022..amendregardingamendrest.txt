         of a Credit and Security Agreement with TMRC, L.L.P. ("TMRC") regarding
         loan(s) to Borrower (the "TMRC Loan Agreement") and CDF has agreed,  in

         the IRS Refund Loan on the terms and conditions stated herein.

E.       CDF and Borrower have agreed to the  provisions set forth herein on the

                                    Agreement

         Therefore,  in consideration of the mutual  agreements herein and other
sufficient consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,  Borrower
and the Lender hereby agree as follows:

defined herein have the meanings given them in the Original Loan Agreement.

2.  Conditions  to  Effectiveness  of  Agreement.  This  Agreement  shall become
effective  when, and only if, each of the following  conditions have been met to
the  satisfaction  of CDF: (i) this  Agreement has been executed by Borrower and

3. Waiver of Certain  Defaults;  No Other Waiver.  Borrower hereby  acknowledges
that (a)  Defaults  have  occurred  due to  Borrower's  breach of Section  2.2.2
(Payment  Terms for Floorplan  Inventory)  and/or  financing  terms  pursuant to
Statements of Transaction  relating to the SAU, the Unpaid Matured Inventory and
the Unpaid Curtailments, and (b) Borrower is in default to Hibernia Bank for the
Hibernia  Undecalred  Default.  Borrower  further  acknowledges  that, as of the
Modification  Date,  the  amount of the SAU is  $756,266.50,  the  amount of the
Unpaid  Matured   Inventory  is  $59,890.08,   and  the  amount  of  the  Unpaid
Curtailments  is  $642,048.28.  Additionally,  Borrower  will  pay  CDF  on  the

additional  Floorplan  Inventory or Revolving  Loan  availability  ($146,160.32)
based on Eligible  Inventory  transferred  to a Borrower  from an  affiliate  in
Florida or Georgia  (such net amount  being the  "Uncollateralized  SAU" and the
remaining  SAU  being  the  "Collateralized  SAU");  Borrower  will  pay CDF the
remaining  Collateralized  SAU together  with all Unpaid  Matured  Inventory and
Unpaid  Curtailments  on  or  before  April  30,  2003.  Borrower  warrants  and
represents to CDF that as of the  Modification  Date, no payment  Defaults exist
under the Original Loan Agreement  except the SAU, the Unpaid Matured  Inventory
and the Unpaid  Curtailments.  Borrower  further  warrants and represents to CDF
that (1)  Borrower  is not in default to Hibernia  Bank except for the  Hibernia
Undeclared  Default,  and (2)  Hibernia  Bank  has  not  declared  the  Hibernia
Undeclared  Default to be a default or event of default upon which Hibernia Bank
may exercise any rights or remedies against any Borrower or Affiliate.  Upon the
effectiveness  of this Agreement,  except for the Non-Waived  Defaults  (defined
below)  CDF  waives  all  Defaults  under the  Original  Loan  Agreement  or any
agreement,   document  or  instrument   entered  into  in  connection   with  or
contemplated  by the Original  Loan  Agreement and events in existence as of the
Modification Date which with the passage of time would become Defaults,  and all
Defaults and events which with the passage of time would become Defaults,  other
than the Non-Waived Defaults,  arising through the date that is thirty (30) days
after the  Modification  Date.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  contained
herein, CDF hereby waives the Defaults described in the preceding  sentence.  As
used  herein,  "Non-Waived  Defaults"  shall  mean  any of any of the  following
Defaults  under the  Original  Loan  Agreement  or any  agreement,  document  or

Agreement:

(D)  Any  Default  arising  as  a  result  of  any  material  violation  of  any
     representation  or  warranty  or any  violation  of any  representation  or

     Borrower; or

(E)  Any Default  arising as a result of any violation of any covenant  relating
     to granting of liens,  other than  permitted  liens,  or the  incurrence of
     indebtedness, other than Permitted Indebtedness, of Borrower, other than as
     contemplated for the IRS Refund Loan; or

(F)  Any  Default  arising as a result of any  Borrower  becoming  insolvent  or

     basis as  required  in  accordance  with the  terms  of the  Original  Loan
     Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument relating to the Original
     Loan Agreement any borrowing base  certificate or other report  relating to
     inventory  and/or  accounts  receivable  (other  than  the  report  of  the
     independent  auditors or the 10K to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
     provided that such audit report and 10K are delivered by January 14, 2003);
     or (ii) any  misrepresentation  contained in any borrowing base certificate
     or other report relating to inventory and/or accounts receivable; or

(I)  Hibernia  Bank  declaring  orally or in  writing  the  Hibernia  Undeclared
     Default to be a default or event of default  upon which  Hibernia  Bank may
     exercise any rights or remedies against any Borrower or Affiliate.


 Upon any  further  Defaults  after the date that is thirty  (30) days after the
Modification Date or upon the occurrence of any Non-Waived Defaults at any time,
all rights and remedies of CDF, whether pursuant to the Original Loan Agreement,
