<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
WAIVER AND AMENDMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of September&nbsp;25, 2002 (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), is made and entered into by

in its capacity as a Bank, Related Bank and Lender Group Agent), and GenHoldings I, LLC ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Borrower</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference
is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March&nbsp;15, 2002 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Credit Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), among
Borrower, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, as Administrative Agent and a Lead Arranger, Citibank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lead Arranger, the other
agents and arrangers listed on the signature pages thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as issuer of the Letters of Credit, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, and the
other persons party thereto from time to time. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Credit Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, an Inchoate NEG Downgrade Event has occurred and is continuing and therefore, pursuant to the proviso to </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.15.1(a)(i)</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> of the Credit Agreement, on any date on which Project Costs are due and payable, Borrower is required to make, or cause to
be made, Cash Equity Contributions in an amount that, after giving effect to any Alternatively Sourced Equity Contributions then available to pay such Project Costs, is sufficient to pay such Project
Costs in an aggregate amount up to the then current Available Equity Commitment; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties hereto wish to clarify that Cash Equity Contributions made pursuant to the proviso to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.15.1(a)(i)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to
the Credit Agreement are not intended to be treated as Alternatively Sourced Equity Contributions by amending the definition of Alternatively Sourced Equity Contributions; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties hereto wish to clarify that Borrower will be responsible for the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of (a)&nbsp;Luskin, Stern&nbsp;&amp; Eisler LLP which
shall serve as special counsel to Administrative Agent and (b)&nbsp;a financial consultant to Administrative Agent, in each case in connection with certain ongoing issues related to the Credit
Documents, by amending </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;11.4.1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Credit Agreement; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties hereto wish to clarify the process pursuant to which disbursements are made from the Construction Account to pay Project Costs under circumstances in which no
Borrowing is requested and therefore the parties would like to make clarifying changes to the form of Construction Requisition in order to address such circumstances (including circumstances in which
Borrower is making Cash Equity Contributions pursuant to the proviso contained in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.15.1(a)(i)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Credit Agreement); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
to facilitate the making of Equity Contributions by Borrower (specifically Equity Contributions in the form of payments made directly by or on behalf of Borrower for the payment
of Project Costs), the parties hereto wish to permit certain Alternatively Sourced Equity Contributions to be credited against the Total Equity Commitment whether or not such amounts have been
disbursed from the Construction Account in accordance with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;4.1.2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Depositary Agreement (as required by </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.7.5</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Credit
Agreement) so long as the other conditions in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.7</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of
the Credit Agreement have been met and therefore the parties wish to amend the Credit Agreement to eliminate the requirement that all Alternatively Sourced Equity Contributions must be disbursed in
accordance with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;4.1.2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Depositary Agreement; and </FONT></P>
