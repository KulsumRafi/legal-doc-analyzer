following parenthetical immediately after the word "Loan Documents" in the first
instance such word appears in such subsection:

          "(other than any Interest Rate Hedge Agreement, the provisions of
     which shall be amended, modified, terminated or waived in accordance with
     its terms; provided, that any amendment, modification or waiver of any
     provision of an Interest Rate Hedge Agreement that is adverse to the
     interests of Borrowers or any Lender shall be consented to by Requisite
     Lenders)"

          (d)  The definition of "Loan Document" contained in subsection 10.1 of
the Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety and as so amended shall read as
follows:

     Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loans and other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, all as amended, supplemented or modified
     from time to time; but excluding all Capitalization/Acquisition Documents.

          (e)  Subsection 10.1 of the Agreement is further amended by adding
thereto the following definitions in the correct alphabetical order:

          "Hedge Counterparty" means the Lender (or any affiliate of such
Lender) party to an Interest Rate Hedge Agreement with Borrowers.

     is defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code) between Borrowers and a
     Lender and any other agreements or arrangements entered into in connection
     therewith designed to provide protection against fluctuations in interest
     rates, the form, substance, terms and conditions of which have been
     consented to in writing by Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld.

below and after giving effect to the amendments to the Agreement set forth
above, the Security Documents are amended as follows:

          (a)  To the extent any of the Security Documents grant Liens to Agent

amended to provide that such Lien is granted for the benefit of Agent, the
Lenders and any Hedge Counterparty; provided, however, that the maximum
aggregate dollar amount of Obligations that Borrowers owe at any

                                        2

one time under all Interest Rate Hedge Agreements then in effect that shall be
secured by the Collateral shall not exceed $1,500,000.

          (b)  To the extent secured by the Collateral in accordance with the
immediately preceding clause (a), for purposes of Section 14 of that certain
Security Agreement dated as of May 26, 1999 among Parent, ORC and Agent, and
Section 14 of that certain Subsidiary Security Agreement dated as of May 26,
1999 among Agent and the direct and indirect Subsidiaries of Borrowers from time
to time party thereto, all Obligations outstanding under any Interest Rate Hedge
Agreement shall share in the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon,

amounts of the Secured Obligations.

     4. Conditions. The effectiveness of this Amendment is subject to the
following conditions precedent:

          (a)  Borrower shall have executed and delivered this Amendment, and
such other documents and instruments as Agent may require shall have been

all material respects as of the date hereof.

     6.   Severability. Any provision of this Amendment held by a court of

instrument or agreement executed in connection with the Agreement shall be
deemed to be a reference to the Agreement as modified by this Amendment.

     8.   Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which taken
together shall be one and the same instrument.

     9.   Ratification. The terms and provisions set forth in this Amendment
shall modify and supersede all inconsistent terms and provisions of the
Agreement and shall not be deemed to be a consent to the modification or waiver

and superseded by this Amendment, the terms and provisions of the Agreement are
ratified and confirmed and shall continue in full force and effect.

     10.  Reaffirmation. Each Loan Party party hereto has executed and delivered
one or more of the Security Documents and/or the other Loan Documents as debtor,
grantor, pledgor, guarantor, assignor, or in other similar capacities in which
such Person has granted liens or security interests in their respective
properties or otherwise acted as an accommodation party or guarantor, as the
case may be. Each Loan Party party hereto hereby ratifies and reaffirms all of
its respective payment and performance obligations, contingent or otherwise,
under the Security Documents and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party
and, to the extent any such Person has granted liens on or security interests in
any of their respective properties pursuant to any of the Security Documents or
any of the other Loan Documents as security for or otherwise guaranteed the
Obligations under or with respect to the Agreement or any other Loan Documents,
hereby ratifies and reaffirms such payment and performance obligations,
guarantee and grant of security interests and liens and confirms and agrees that
such security interests and liens hereafter secure all of the Obligations. Each
Loan Party party hereto agrees that each of the Security Documents and each
other Loan Document remains in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and
reaffirmed, and agrees that the Amendment shall not (i) operate as a waiver of
any right, power or remedy of Agent or Lenders under the Loan Documents or (ii)
constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan Documents or serve to
effect a novation of the Obligations.
