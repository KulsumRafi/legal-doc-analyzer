RE: Investment Banking Fees

Dear Mr. Davis:

Pursuant to discussions with Murdock Communications Corporation's ("Murdock's")
attorney, this letter is a follow up to recent Board of Directors meetings. At
those meetings, Murdock agreed that it would pay to Berthel Fisher & Company
Financial Services, Inc. ("Berthel Fisher"), the current and past due investment
banking fees and any investment banking fees which are yet to be earned,
including but not limited to any merger fees to be earned at the Merger Closing
between Polar Molecular Corporation ("Polar") and Murdock (the "Investment
Banking Fees"), in the following manner.

     (1)  Murdock agrees to pay to Berthel Fisher, one half of all the funds
          Murdock receives from the proceeds of the Polar Molecular Corporation
          ("Polar") Additional Offering (the "Additional Offering"), which is
          currently taking place as said funds are received by Murdock, so long
          as Murdock retains sufficient funds to reasonably operate during such
          time period.

     (2)  In the event that all Investment Banking Fees due to Berthel Fisher
          are not paid out of the Additional Offering funds due to Murdock,
          Murdock will pay to Berthel Fisher one half of any funds received as a
          result of the exercise of Murdock options and/or warrants or Polar
          options and/or warrants as said funds are received by Murdock, so long
          as Murdock retains sufficient funds to reasonably operate during such
          time period.

     (3)  In the event that all Investment Banking fees due to Berthel Fisher
          are not paid as the result of (1) or (2) above, then Murdock agrees to
          issue to Berthel Fisher, at the time of the Merger Closing between
          Polar and Murdock, shares of Murdock common stock at a price of One
          Dollar per share, in a number of shares equal to the remaining amount
          of Investment Banking Fees outstanding divided by one

Please acknowledge below, your agreement with the terms of this letter.

Very truly yours,
Berthel Fisher & Company Financial Services, Inc.
