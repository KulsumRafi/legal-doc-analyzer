Agreement</B></FONT></DIV>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between Weyerhaeuser
Company (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Company&#148;)
and&nbsp;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>
(hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Executive&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Company
entering into severance agreements with certain key executives of the Company;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Company;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company
arise, the Board believes it is imperative that the Company and the Board
should be able to rely upon the Executive to continue in his position, and that
the Company should be able to receive and rely upon the Executive&#146;s advice, if
requested, as to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without
concern that the Executive might be distracted by the personal uncertainties
and risks created by the possibility of a Change in Control; and
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control arise, in addition
to his regular duties, the Executive may be called upon to assist in the
assessment of such possible Change in Control, advise management and the Board
as to whether such Change in Control would be in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might
determine to be appropriate.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, to assure the Company that it will have the continued
dedication of the Executive and the availability of his advice and counsel
notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control
of the Company, and to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the
Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the
Executive agree as follows:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Article&nbsp;1. Term of the Agreement</B></FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in
effect for three (3)&nbsp;full calendar years. However, at any time prior to the end
of such three-year (3)&nbsp;period and, at any time prior to the end of any extended
term, the Committee may, in its discretion, extend the term of this Agreement
for any period of time up to three (3)&nbsp;additional years. If the Committee
elects not to extend the term of this Agreement, it must deliver written notice
six (6)&nbsp;months prior to the end of such term, or extended term, to the
Executive, that the Agreement will not be extended. In such case, the Agreement
will terminate at the end of the term, or extended term, then in progress.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the event a Change in Control occurs during the original or
any extended term, this Agreement will remain in effect for the longer of: (i)
twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months beyond the month in which such Change in Control
occurred; (ii)&nbsp;until all obligations of the Company to the Executive hereunder
have been fulfilled, and until all benefits required hereunder have been paid
to the Executive.

becomes entitled to CIC-Related Severance Benefits or any other payment or
benefit under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with or plan of the
Company (in the aggregate, the &#147;Total Payments&#148;), if any of the Total Payments
will be subject to the tax (the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;) imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the
Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed), the Company shall pay
to the Executive in cash an additional amount (the &#147;Gross-Up Payment&#148;) such
that the net amount retained by the Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax
upon the Total Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax and Excise
Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment provided for by this Section&nbsp;7.1 (including
FICA), shall be equal to the Total Payments. Such payment shall be made by the
Company to the Executive as soon as practical following the effective date of

however, that the Executive&#146;s CIC-Related Severance Benefits shall be grossed
up only in the
event that application of the gross-up feature would result in the
Executive receiving additional after-tax CIC-related amounts of at least fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000) when compared with capping such
Change-in-Control-Related Severance Benefits at the maximum amount that may be
paid without incurring Excise Taxes. In the event that a gross-up of the
Executive&#146;s CIC-Related Severance Benefits under this Agreement would result in
less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) additional after-tax CIC-related
amounts, the Executive&#146;s CIC-Related Severance Benefits shall be capped at the
maximum amount that may be paid without incurring Excise Taxes. If the
CIC-Related Severance Benefit becomes subject to the cap described above, the
