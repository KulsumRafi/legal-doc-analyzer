         SECTION 2.01      REVOLVING ADVANCES. (a) Each Lender severally agrees,
on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Revolving Advances to
the Borrowers from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Effective Date to and including the Termination Date in an aggregate amount not
to exceed at any time outstanding the amount set forth opposite such Lender's

B/A Advances, each Borrowing consisting of Revolving Advances shall be in an
aggregate amount that

                                       27

or Base Rate Advances, the aggregate unused Commitments, if less) and shall
consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably
according to their respective Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Foreign Lender shall not accept Bankers' Acceptances, and shall not be required
to make Prime Rate Advances and no Lender (other than a Foreign Lender pursuant
to Section 2.11(i)) shall be required to make Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate
Advances. If a Borrowing of Prime Rate Advances is requested, a Foreign Lender
will participate in such Borrowing by way of Base Rate Advances. If a Borrowing
by way of Bankers' Acceptances is requested, a Foreign Lender will participate
in such Borrowing by way of Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with Section 2.11(i). Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the

(unless the Commitments shall have been terminated in full pursuant to Article

applicable Borrower of like amount. Term Advances that are repaid or prepaid,
and not Continued, may not be reborrowed; provided, however, that Advances may
be Continued, at the election of the applicable Borrower, through the Final
Maturity Date by the delivery of a Notice of Continuation. Eurodollar Rate
Advances and B/A Loans for which the Interest Period shall not have terminated
as of the Revolving Commitment Termination Date shall be Continued as Eurodollar
Rate Advances or B/A Loans, as the case may be, for the then applicable Interest
Period and Prime Rate Advances and Base Rate Advances shall be Continued as
Prime Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances, as applicable, after the Revolving
Commitment Termination Date, unless the applicable Borrower shall have elected
otherwise by delivery of a Notice of Continuation. In accordance with

                                       28
<PAGE>
Section 2.08, the applicable Borrower may elect to Continue Borrowings as
Borrowings of the same or a different Type or, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate
Advance or B/A Advance, may elect Interest Periods or Contract Periods therefor;
provided that the Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect to Continue any
Borrowings if the Interest Period or Contract Period requested with respect
thereto would end after the Final Maturity Date. After the Revolving Commitment
Termination Date, no Lender shall have any further Commitment to make additional
Advances.

         SECTION 2.02      MAKING THE ADVANCES.

         (a)      Each Borrowing shall be made on notice by the applicable
Borrower to the Administrative Agent (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") received by the
Administrative Agent:

         (i)      in the case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Prime Rate
     Advances or Base Rate Advances on the day of notice, provided that notice
     is received by the Administrative Agent not later than 9:00 A.M. (Calgary

     Rate Advances, not later than 10:00 a.m. (Calgary local time) on the third
     Business Day prior to the date of such proposed Borrowing; and

         (iii)    in the case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of B/A Advances,
     not later than 10:00 a.m. (Calgary local time) on the second Business Day
     prior to the date of such proposed Borrowing or, if such Borrowing shall
     include B/A Loans, on the third Business Day prior to the date of such

         Each Notice of Borrowing shall be by telecopy, telefax or other
teletransmission or by telephone (and if by telephone, confirmed promptly by
telecopier, telefax or other teletransmission), in substantially the form of
Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (w) date of such Borrowing,
(x) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, additionally, whether such
Borrowing consists of Revolving Advances or Term

                                       29
<PAGE>
Advances, (y) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (z) in the case of a
Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the initial Interest Period and
currency for each such Advance, and in the case of a B/A Advance, the initial
Contract Period for such B/A Advance. Promptly following receipt of the Notice
of Borrowing (and in any event not later than 10:00 a.m. (Calgary local time) on
the date of the proposed Borrowing), the Administrative Agent shall advise each
Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Advance to be
made as part of the requested Borrowing. Each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m.
(Calgary local time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent in care of
its Payment Office, or at such other location designated by notice from the
Administrative Agent to the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.02, in same day funds,
such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing. Immediately after the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, but no later than 12:00 noon
(Calgary local time) on the same date the Administrative Agent will make such
funds available to the applicable Borrower at the Payment Office of the
Administrative Agent, or at any account of the applicable Borrower maintained by
the Administrative Agent (or any successor Administrative Agent) designated by
the applicable Borrower and agreed to by the Administrative Agent (or such
successor Administrative Agent), in same day funds.

         (b)      If no election as to the Type or duration of Advance is
specified, then the requested Advance shall be a Prime Rate Advance (if
denominated in Cdn. Dollars) or a Base Rate Advance (if denominated in U.S.
Dollars). If no currency is specified, the Advance shall be denominated in Cdn.
Dollars.

         (c)      Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on
the applicable Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice
of Borrowing specified is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, if such
Advances are not made as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the
date specified for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article
3, the applicable Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Lender as a result of such failure, including any loss,
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or

                                       30
<PAGE>
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing.

         (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsections (a) and (c) of this Section 2.02 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Prime Rate for such day. If such Lender shall repay
to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid
shall constitute such Lender's Advance to the applicable Borrower as part of
such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         (e)      The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it
as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation,
if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

         (a)      Each Borrower shall repay to each Lender on the Final Maturity
     Date the aggregate principal amount of the Advances made to it, together
     with accrued interest thereon, then owing to such Lender.

         (b)      Subject to Section 2.05(c), after the Revolving Commitment
     Termination Date, the applicable Borrower shall repay the principal amount
     of the Advances made to it in equal semi-annual installments, each in an
     amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of the Advances made to it on the Revolving
     Commitment Termination Date. Such installments shall be due and payable on
     each June 30 and December 31 of each year, the first such installment being
     due and payable on the first December 31 occurring after the Revolving
     Commitment Termination Date, with the final installment due and payable on
     the Final Maturity Date in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid
     principal amount of such Advances made to it outstanding on the Final
     Maturity Date.

         (c)      Subject to Article 6, but notwithstanding any other provision
     of this Agreement, neither Borrower shall be required to repay more than
     25% of the principal amount (as defined in the Income Tax Act) of the
     Advances made to it prior to five years and one day after the Revolving
     Commitment Termination Date, including, but not limited to payments under
     Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.10(b).

         (d)      The Borrowers shall provide written notice to the
     Administrative Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto of any
     repayments pursuant to this Section 2.05 at least 2 Business Days prior to
     such repayment.

         SECTION 2.06      INTEREST ON ADVANCES.

         (a)      ORDINARY INTEREST. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Advance

     is (x) a Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
     times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Cdn.
     Dollar Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate
     Margin in effect from time to time plus, following the Revolving Commitment
     Termination Date, as additional interest in lieu of the facility fee, the
     Facility Fee Percentage in effect from time to time, payable on the last
     day of each such Interest Period and, if any such Interest Period has a
     duration of more than three months, on each day which occurs during such
     Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest
     Period and, if such Advance is Continued as a Prime Rate Advance on any
     date other than the last day of any

                                       34
<PAGE>
     Interest Period for such Advance, on the date of such Continuation or, if
     later, the Business Day on which the applicable Borrower shall have
     received at least one Business Day's prior notice from the Administrative
     Agent or the applicable Lender of the amount of unpaid interest accrued on
     such Advance to the date of such Continuation and (y) a U.S. Dollar
     Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each
     Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the U.S. Dollar Eurodollar
     Rate for such Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate Margin in effect
     from time to time plus, following the Revolving Commitment Termination
     Date, as additional interest in lieu of the facility fee, the Facility Fee
     Percentage in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of each

     more than three months, on each day which occurs during such Interest
     Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and,
     if such Advance is Continued as a Base Rate Advance on any date other than
     the last day of any Interest Period for such Advance, on the date of such
     Continuation or, if later, the Business Day on which the applicable
     Borrower shall have received at least one Business Day's prior notice from
     the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender of the amount of unpaid
     interest accrued on such Advance to the date of such Continuation.

         (iv)     B/A ADVANCES. Each Advance comprised of Bankers' Acceptances
     shall be subject to an Acceptance Fee, payable by the applicable Borrower
     on the date of acceptance of the relevant B/A and computed as set forth in
     the definition of "Acceptance Fee" in Section 1.01 plus, following the
     Revolving Commitment Termination Date, as an additional acceptance fee in
     lieu of the facility fee, the Facility Fee Percentage in effect from time
     to time, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
     September and December during such periods and on the date such B/A Advance
     shall be Continued or due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or

         (v)      ADDITIONAL INTEREST. In addition to amounts payable under
     clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above and under Section 2.03(c) in respect
     of any Advance

                                       35
<PAGE>
     following the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, each Borrower shall
     pay to each Lender hereunder as additional interest an amount in lieu of
     the utilization fee equal to 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of
     such Lender's Term Advances made to it during any period (each such period,
     an "ADDITIONAL INTEREST PERIOD") during the term of this Agreement
     commencing on the Termination Date or on a subsequent January 1, April 1,
     July 1 or October 1 and ending in each case on the earliest to occur of the
     next succeeding March 31, June 30, September 30 or December 31 and the
     Final Maturity Date (or, if any Term Advances made to such Borrower remain
     outstanding after the Final Maturity Date, such later date on which all
     such Advances are repaid in full). Additional interest owing in respect of
     any Additional Interest Period shall be payable on the last day of such
     Additional Interest Period; provided that additional interest owing after
     the Final Maturity Date shall be payable on demand.

         (b)      DEFAULT INTEREST. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to it that is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from the date on
which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand,
at a rate per annum equal at all times (i) from such due date to the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, in the case of each Eurodollar Rate
Advance, to 1% per annum above the interest rate per annum required to be paid
on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due
and (ii) from and after the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, in the case of each Eurodollar Rate Advance, and at all times in the
case of each Prime Rate Advance and each Base Rate Advance, to 1% per annum
above the Prime Rate or Base Rate, as applicable, in effect from time to time,
plus, in the case of a Term Advance, any additional interest payable pursuant to
Section 2.06(a)(iii).

         (c)      INTEREST ACT CANADA. For the purposes of the Interest Act
(Canada) and disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or fee to be paid
hereunder or in connection herewith is to be calculated on the basis of any
period of time that is less than a calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to
which the rate used in such

                                       36
<PAGE>
calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of
days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by
360 or 365, as applicable. The rates of interest under this Agreement are
nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed
reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this
Agreement.

         (d)      NO CRIMINAL RATE. If any provision of this Agreement would
oblige a Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any
Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or
would result in a receipt by that Lender of "interest" at a "criminal rate" (as
such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then,
notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been
adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as
the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt
by that Lender of "interest" at a "criminal rate", such adjustment to be
effected, to the extent necessary (but only to the extent necessary), as
follows:

         (i)      first, by reducing the amount or rate of interest or the
     amount or rate of any Acceptance Fee required to be paid to the affected
     Lender under Section 2.06(a)(iv); and

         (ii)     thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and
     other amounts required to be paid to the affected Lender which would
     constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code
     (Canada).

         SECTION 2.07      [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

         SECTION 2.08      RATE DETERMINATION.

         (a)      All interest hereunder shall be payable for the actual number
of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Any
Advance that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest
for one day unless such repayment and notice thereof are received by 12:00 noon,
Toronto, Ontario time, on such day. The applicable Prime Rate, Base Rate,
Eurodollar Rate or Discount Rate shall be determined by the Administrative
Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                                       37
<PAGE>
         (b)      Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative
Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If
any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information
to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest
rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis
of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. Each Schedule
II/III Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent timely
information for the purpose of determining each Discount Rate. If any one or
more of the Schedule II/III Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely
information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining such
Discount Rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such Discount Rate on
the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Schedule II/III
Reference Banks.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrowers and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), the
applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(iii), and the
applicable Discount Rate, if any, furnished by each Schedule II/III Reference
Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable Discount Rate under Section
2.11(f).

         (d)      If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information
to the Administrative Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
applicable Advances,

         (i)      the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrowers and each
     Lender prompt notice by telephone (confirmed in writing) that the interest
     rate cannot be determined for such applicable Advances,

         (ii)     (x) to the extent such applicable Advances are Cdn. Dollar
     Eurodollar Rate Advances, each such Advance will automatically, on the last
     day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Continue as a Prime Rate
     Advance (or if such Advance is then a Prime Rate Advance, will Continue as
     a Prime Rate Advance), and (y) to the extent such applicable Advances are
     U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, each such Advance will automatically,
     on the last

                                       38
<PAGE>
     day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Continue as a Base Rate
     Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will Continue as a
     Base Rate Advance), and

         (iii)    the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to Continue
     Advances as, Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances or U.S. Dollar Eurodollar
     Rate Advances, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the
     Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
     circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         (e)      If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority
Lenders determine and give notice to the Administrative Agent that as a result
of conditions in or generally affecting the relevant market, the rates of
interest determined on the basis of the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period
for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders
of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon:

         (i)      (x) to the extent such Advances are Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar
     Rate Advances, each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
     last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Continue as a Prime
     Rate Advance and (y) to the extent such Advances are U.S. Dollar Eurodollar
     Rate Advances, each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
     last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Continue as a Base
     Rate Advance, and

         (ii)     the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Continue Advances
     as, Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances or U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate
     Advances, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the Administrative
     Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances
     causing such suspension no longer exist.

         (f)      If a Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "INTEREST PERIOD" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify such

                                       39
<PAGE>
Borrower and the Lenders and (i) to the extent such Advances are Cdn. Dollar
Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Advances will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, Continue as Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar
Rate Advances with an Interest Period of one month and (ii) to the extent such
Advances are U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Advances will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Continue as U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances with an Interest Period of one
month. If a Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Contract Period
for any B/A Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the
definition of "CONTRACT PERIOD" in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent will
forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such B/A Advances will be
automatically Continued as B/A Advances with a Contract Period of one month.

         (g)      On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or
otherwise, to less than Cdn.$5,000,000, such Advances shall, (i) if they are (x)
Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, automatically Continue as Prime Rate
Advances and (y) U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, automatically Continue as
Base Rate Advances, and on and after such date the right of the applicable
Borrower to Continue such Advances as Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate;
provided, however, that if and so long as each such Advance shall be, or be
elected to be Continued as, Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances or U.S. Dollar
Eurodollar Rate Advances, as applicable, having the same Interest Period as
Eurodollar Rate Advances of the same Type comprising another Borrowing or other
Borrowings, and the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such Eurodollar
Rate Advances of the same Type shall, or upon such Continuation will, equal or
exceed, with respect to Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, Cdn. $10,000,000
or, with respect to U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, U.S.$10,000,000, the
applicable Borrower shall have the right to Continue all such Advances as
Eurodollar Rate Advances of the same Type having such Interest Period, and (ii)
if they are B/A Advances, automatically Continue as Prime Rate Advances, and on
and after such date the right of the applicable Borrower to Continue such
Advances as B/A Advances shall terminate; provided, however, that if and so long
as each such Advance shall

                                       40
<PAGE>
be, or be elected to be Continued as, B/A Advances having the same Contract
Period as B/A Advances comprising another Borrowing or other Borrowings, and the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such B/A Advances shall, or upon
Continuation will, equal or exceed Cdn.$10,000,000, the applicable Borrower
shall have the right to Continue all such B/A Advances as B/A Advances having
such Contract Period.

         SECTION 2.09      VOLUNTARY CONTINUATION OF ADVANCES. Each Borrower may
on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent, not later
than the time specified in Section 2.02 for the making of an Advance of the same
Type as that of the existing Advances being Continued if such Advance were being
made on the date of the proposed Continuation, and subject to the provisions of
Section 2.08, 2.12 and 2.14, Continue all Advances to such Borrower of one Type
comprising the same Borrowing as Advances of another Type in the same currency;
provided, however, that any Continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Advances as
Prime Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances, as the case may be, made on any day
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 9.04(b), and any Continuation of
any B/A Advances as Prime Rate Advances made on any day other than the last day
of the Contract Period for such B/A Advance shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 2.11. Each such notice of a Continuation (a "NOTICE OF CONTINUATION")
shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B (i) the date of such Continuation, (ii) the
Advances to be Continued, (iii) if such Continuation is as Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Type of Eurodollar Rate Advance and the duration of the Interest
Period for each such Eurodollar Rate Advance, and (iv) if such Continuation is
as B/A Advances, the duration of the Contract Period for each such B/A Advance.

         SECTION 2.10      PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      The applicable Borrower may prepay the Revolving Advances or
the Term Advances made to it, provided however that a Borrower may not prepay
any Bankers' Acceptances or B/A Loans; provided, however, that a Borrower may
defease any B/A or B/A Loan by depositing with the Administrative Agent an
amount that, together with interest accruing thereon to the end of the

                                       41
<PAGE>
Contract Period or Interest Period (as applicable) therefor, is sufficient to
pay such maturing Bankers' Acceptances or B/A Loans when due. A Borrower may,
upon (i) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, at least three Business Days
notice or (ii) in the case of Prime Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances,
telephonic notice not later than 8:00 a.m. (Calgary local time) on the date of
prepayment followed as promptly as practicable by written notice, to the
Administrative Agent which specifies the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment and the Type of Advances to be prepaid, and if such
notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of
the Advances comprising the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not less than Cdn.$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
Cdn.$1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Prime Rate Advances and Cdn.
Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, and U.S.$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
U.S.$1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Base Rate Advances and U.S.
Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of
Eurodollar Rate Advances on any day other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, the applicable Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to, and to the
extent required by, Section 9.04(b); provided, further, however, that such
Borrower will use its best efforts to give notice to the Administrative Agent of
the proposed prepayment of Base Rate Advances on the Business Day prior to the
date of such proposed prepayment.

         (b)      If on any date, after giving effect to all Advances and all
repayments and prepayments to occur on such date, and based on the Exchange Rate
then in effect, the Administrative Agent determines that the aggregate Cdn.
Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding Advances hereunder shall have exceeded for
more than three consecutive Business Days an amount equal to 105% of the total
Commitments of the Lenders under the Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Borrower of such occurrence and the Borrowers shall on the next
succeeding Business Day prepay Advances in an aggregate amount sufficient to
eliminate such excess.

                                       42
<PAGE>
         SECTION 2.11      BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES.

         (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Borrower may request a Borrowing by presenting drafts for acceptance and, if
applicable, purchase, as B/As by the Lenders.

         (b)      No Contract Period with respect to a B/A to be accepted and,
if applicable, purchased, as a Revolving Advance shall extend beyond the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date and no Contract Period with respect to a
B/A to be accepted and, if applicable, purchased, as a Term Advance shall extend
beyond the Final Maturity Date.

         (c)      To facilitate availment of B/A Advances, each Borrower hereby
appoints each Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf (in
accordance with a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation relating to a
B/A Advance), in handwriting or by facsimile or mechanical signature as and when
deemed necessary by such Lender, blank forms of B/As in the form requested by
such Lender. In this respect, it is each Lender's responsibility to maintain an
adequate supply of blank forms of B/As for acceptance under this Agreement. Each
Borrower recognizes and agrees that all B/As signed and/or endorsed by a Lender
on behalf of such Borrower shall bind such Borrower as fully and effectually as
if signed in the handwriting of and duly issued by the proper signing officers
of such Borrower. Each Lender is hereby authorized (in accordance with a Notice
of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation relating to a B/A Advance) to issue such
B/As endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by such Lender;
provided that the aggregate amount thereof is equal to the aggregate amount of
B/As required to be accepted and purchased by such Lender. No Lender shall be
liable for any damage, loss or other claim arising by reason of any loss or
improper use of any such instrument except the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Lender or its officers, employees, agents or representatives.
Each Lender shall maintain a record with respect to B/As (i) received by it in
blank hereunder, (ii) voided by it for any reason, (iii) accepted and purchased
by it hereunder, and (iv) canceled at their respective maturities. On request by
or on behalf of either Borrower, a Lender shall cancel all forms of B/As which
have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of such Borrower and that are
held by such Lender and are not required to be issued in accordance with such
Borrower's irrevocable notice.

                                       43
<PAGE>
Alternatively, each Borrower agrees that, at the request of the Administrative
Agent, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a "depository
note" which complies with the requirements of the Depository Bills and Notes Act
(Canada), and consents to the deposit of any such depository note in the
book-based debt clearance system maintained by the Canadian Depository for
Securities.

         (d)      Drafts of a Borrower to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be
signed as set forth in this Section 2.11. Notwithstanding that any Person whose
signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any
Lender or a Borrower at the date of issuance of a B/A, such signature shall
nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had
remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed shall
be binding on the applicable Borrower.

         (e)      Promptly following the receipt of a Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Continuation specifying a Borrowing or Continuation of a Borrowing by
way of B/As, the Administrative Agent shall so advise the Lenders and shall
advise each Lender of the aggregate face amount of the B/As to be accepted by it
and the applicable Contract Period (which shall be identical for all Lenders).
In the case of Advances comprised of B/A Advances, the aggregate face amount of
the B/As to be accepted by a Lender shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of
Cdn.$100,000 and shall be a whole multiple of Cdn.$100,000, and such face amount
shall be in the Lenders' pro rata portions of such Borrowing, provided that the
Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion increase or reduce any Lender's
portion of such B/A Advance to the nearest Cdn.$100,000 without reducing the
overall Commitments.

         (f)      Each Borrower may specify in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice
of Continuation that it desires that any B/As requested by such Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Continuation be purchased by the Lenders, in which case
the Lenders shall, upon acceptance of a B/A by a Lender, purchase, or arrange
for the purchase of, each B/A from such Borrower at the Discount Rate for such
Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Administrative
Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of such Borrower. The Acceptance Fee
payable by each Borrower to a Lender under Section 2.06(iv) in

                                       44
<PAGE>
respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the
Discount Proceeds payable by such Lender under this Section 2.11.

         (g)      Where a Borrower so specifies in its Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Continuation, it shall make its own arrangements for the marketing of
B/As, in which case, by subsequent notice to the Administrative Agent, it shall
provide the Administrative Agent, who shall in turn notify each Lender, with
information as to the discount proceeds payable by the purchasers of the B/As
and the party to whom delivery of the B/As by each Lender is to be made against
delivery to each Lender of the applicable discount proceeds, but if it does not
do so, such Borrower shall initiate a telephone call to the Administrative Agent
by 9:00 a.m. (Calgary local time) on the date of advance, and provide such
information to the Administrative Agent. Any such telephonic advice shall be
confirmed by a written notice by the applicable Borrower to the Administrative
Agent prior to 2:00 p.m. (Calgary local time) on the same day.

         (h)      Each Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell,
rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/As accepted and purchased by it.

         (i)      If a Lender is not a bank listed on Schedule I, II or III of
the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent in
writing that it is otherwise unable to accept bankers' acceptances, such Lender
shall give notice to such effect to the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00
a.m., (Calgary local time), on the date of the requested credit extension (which
notice may, if so stated therein, remain in effect with respect to subsequent
requests for extension of credit by way of Bankers' Acceptance until revoked by
notice to the Administrative Agent) and shall make available to the
Administrative Agent, in accordance with Section 2.01 hereof prior to 11:00 a.m.
(Calgary local time), on the date of such requested credit extension, a Canadian
Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advance (a "BA LOAN") in the principal amount equal to
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the total amount of credit requested to
be extended by way of Bankers' Acceptances. Such BA Loan shall have an Interest
Period equal to the Contract Period of the Bankers' Acceptances for which it is
a substitute and shall bear interest throughout the Interest Period applicable
to such BA Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Canadian Dollar Eurodollar Rate
plus

                                       45
<PAGE>
the Eurodollar Rate Margin. Subject to repayment requirements, on the last day
of the relevant Interest Period for such B/A Loan, the applicable Borrower shall
be entitled to Continue each such B/A Loan as another Type of Advance, or to
roll over each such B/A Loan into another B/A Loan, all in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement.

         (j)      With respect to each B/A Advance, at or before 9:00 a.m.
(Calgary local time) two Business Days before the last day of the Contract
Period of such B/As, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent by irrevocable telephone notice, followed by a notice of rollover in
substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto on the same day, if such
Borrower intends to issue B/As on such last day of the Contract Period to
provide for the payment of such maturing B/As. If the applicable Borrower fails
to notify the Administrative Agent of its intention to issue B/As on such last
day of the Contract Period, such Borrower shall provide payment to the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders of an amount equal to the
aggregate face amount of such B/As on the last day of the Contract Period of
such B/As. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment, such maturing
B/As shall be deemed to have been Continued on the last day of such Contract
Period as a Prime Rate Advance in an amount equal to the face amount of such
B/As.

         (k)      Each Borrower waives presentment for payment and any other
defense to payment of any amounts due to a Lender in respect of a B/A accepted
and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by
reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its
own right, and each Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such
Lender, as holder, sues such Borrower on the B/A for payment of the amount
payable by the applicable Borrower thereunder. On the last day of the Contract
Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required or permitted pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement, the applicable Borrower shall pay the
Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A
and, after such payment, the applicable Borrower shall have no further liability
in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and
be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.

                                       46
<PAGE>
         (l)      Except as required by any Lender upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, no B/A Advance may be repaid by a Borrower prior to the expiry
date of the Contract Period applicable to such B/A Advance.

         SECTION 2.12      INCREASED COSTS.

         (a)      If, due to either (i) the introduction after the Effective
Date of, or any change after the Effective Date (including any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve requirements or assessments) in or in the
interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request issued or made after the Effective Date from or by any
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), (the occurrence
of any of the foregoing events being herein referred to as a "change in law") in
each case above other than with respect to matters covered by Section 2.13 or
2.16, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make,
fund or maintain, or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances
funded in the interbank Eurodollar market, then the applicable Borrower shall
from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender additional amounts sufficient to reimburse such Lender for all such
increased costs (except those incurred more than 60 days prior to the date of
such demand; for the purposes hereof any cost or expense allocable to a period
prior to the publication or effective date of such an introduction, change,
guideline or request shall be deemed to be incurred on the later of such
publication or effective date). Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable
efforts promptly to notify the Borrowers of any event referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) above, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the rights of any Lender under this Section 2.12(a) (except as otherwise
expressly provided above in this Section 2.12(a)). A certificate as to the
amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error. After one or more Lenders have notified the Borrowers of any
increased costs pursuant to this Section 2.12, the Borrowers may specify by
notice to the Administrative Agent and the affected Lenders that, after the date
of such notice whenever the election of a Eurodollar Rate Advance by a Borrower
for an Interest Period or portion

                                       47
<PAGE>
thereof would give rise to such increased costs, such election shall not apply
to the Advances of such Lender or Lenders during such Interest Period or portion
thereof, and such Advances shall during such Interest Period or portion thereof
be (x) Prime Rate Advances in lieu of Cdn. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances and
(y) Base Rate Advances in lieu of U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each
Lender agrees to use its best reasonable efforts (including a reasonable effort
to change its Applicable Lending Office or to transfer its affected Advances to
an Affiliate of such Lender) to avoid, or minimize the amount of, any demand for
payment from the Borrowers under this Section 2.12, provided that such avoidance
would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

         (b)      In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be reasonably exercised and shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) at any time that the making of
or continuance of any Advance denominated in a currency other than Cdn. Dollars
has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with
any applicable law, or by any applicable guideline or order (whether or not
having the force of law), or impossible as a result of the market unavailability
of such currency, then, in any such event, such Lender shall give prompt notice
(by telephone and confirmed in writing) to the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to the other Lenders). Upon the giving of the notice to the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, each Borrower's right to request (by
Continuation or otherwise), and such Lender's obligation to make, Advances
denominated in a currency other than Cdn. Dollars shall be immediately
suspended, and thereafter, any requested Borrowings of Advances denominated in a
currency other than Cdn. Dollars shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed to be
a request for a Prime Rate Advance, and if the affected Advance or Advances are
still outstanding, the applicable Borrower shall immediately, or if permitted by
applicable law, no later than the latest date permitted thereby, upon at least
one Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the
affected Lender, Continue each such Advance denominated in a currency other than
Cdn. Dollars as a Prime Rate Advance, provided that if more than one Lender is
affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same
pursuant to

                                       48
<PAGE>
this Section 2.12(b).

         SECTION 2.13      INCREASED CAPITAL. If either (i) the introduction of,
or any change in or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii)
compliance by any Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender (including any determination
after the Effective Date by any such central bank, governmental authority or
comparable agency that, for purposes of capital adequacy requirements, the
Commitments hereunder do not constitute commitments with an original maturity of
one year or less) and such Lender determines that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend
hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, within ten days after
demand, and delivery to the Borrowers of the certificate referred to in the last
sentence of this Section 2.13 by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such
Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such
corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender
reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder (except any such increase in
capital incurred more than, or compensation attributable to the period before,
90 days prior to the date of such demand; for the purposes hereof any increase
in capital allocable to, or compensation attributable to, a period prior to the
publication or effective date of such an introduction, change, guideline or
request shall be deemed to be incurred on the later of such publication or
effective date). Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable efforts promptly
to notify the Borrowers of any event referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights of any
Lender under this Section 2.13 (except as otherwise expressly provided above in
this Section 2.13). A certificate in reasonable detail as to the basis for, and
the amount of, such compensation submitted to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent by such Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding for all purposes.

                                       49
<PAGE>
         SECTION 2.14      ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation
of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances of a particular Type or to continue to fund or maintain
such Advances hereunder, such Lender may, by notice to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent, suspend the right of the Borrowers to elect Eurodollar
Rate Advances of such Type from such Lender and, if necessary in the reasonable
opinion of such Lender to comply with such law or regulation, Continue all such
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender as Prime Rate Advances or Base Rate
Advances, as applicable, at the latest time permitted by the applicable law or
regulation, and such suspension and, if applicable, such Continuation shall
continue until such Lender notifies the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
that the circumstances making it unlawful for such Lender to perform such
obligations no longer exist (which such Lender shall promptly do when such
circumstances no longer exist). So long as the obligation of any Lender to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Type has been suspended under this Section
2.14, all Notices of Borrowing specifying Advances of such Type shall be deemed,
as to such Lender, to be requests for Prime Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances,
as applicable. Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable efforts (including
a reasonable effort to change its Applicable Lending Office or to transfer its
affected Advances to an Affiliate) to avoid any such illegality, provided that
such avoidance would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

         SECTION 2.15      PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

         (a)      Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (including
under Section 2.03, 2.05, or 2.06) and under the Notes, whether the amount so
paid is owing to any or all of the Lenders or to the Administrative Agent, not
later than 2:00 p.m. (Calgary local time) without set-off, counterclaim, or any
other deduction whatsoever, on the day when due in (i) Cdn. Dollars, in the case
of all fees required to be paid under Section 2.03, and all amounts payable
(whether principal or interest) in respect of Prime Rate Advances and Cdn.
Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances and all amounts payable

                                       50
<PAGE>
(including the Acceptance Fee) in respect of B/A Advances, and (ii) in U.S.
Dollars, in the case of amounts payable (whether principal or interest) in
respect of Base Rate Advances and U.S. Dollar Eurodollar Rate Advances, to the
Administrative Agent in care of its Payment Office, or at such other location
designated by notice to the Borrowers from the Administrative Agent and agreed
to by the Borrowers, in same day funds. Each such payment made by a Borrower for
the account of any Lender hereunder, when so made to the Administrative Agent,
shall be deemed duly made for all purposes of this Agreement and the Notes,
except that if at any time any such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of such Borrower or otherwise, such payment shall
be deemed not to have been so made. The Administrative Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, 9.04(b) or 9.04(c)) to the Lenders for the
account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating
to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after the effective date
specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make
all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned
thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment
and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for
periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

         (b)      All computations of interest based on the Prime Rate and under
clause (i) of the definition of "Base Rate" and all computations of Acceptance
Fees (in the case of Bankers' Acceptances) and facility fees and utilization
fees (or amounts in lieu thereof) shall be made by the Administrative Agent on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations
of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Effective Federal Funds Rate
shall be made by the Administrative Agent, on the basis of a year of 360 days,
in each case for the actual number of days (including the

                                       51
<PAGE>
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
(or, in the case of Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, 9.04(b) or 9.04(c), by each
Lender with respect to its own Advances) of an interest rate or an increased
cost, loss or expense or increased capital or of illegality or taxes hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes if made reasonably and in good
faith.

         (c)      Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fees, as
the case may be; provided, however, that except with respect to the Final
Maturity Date, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal
of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month,
such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

         (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at a rate equal to the Prime Rate for such day.

         SECTION 2.16      TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by each Borrower or the Parent hereunder
or under the Notes shall be made in accordance with Section 2.15, free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Government of Canada or of any
province or territory thereof or by any authority or agency therein or thereof
having power to tax (hereinafter "CANADIAN TAXES"), unless either Borrower is
required to withhold or deduct Canadian Taxes by law or by the interpretation or
administration thereof. If either Borrower is so required to withhold or deduct
any amount for or on account of Canadian Taxes from any payment made under or
with respect to this Agreement or the Notes, such Borrower will pay to each
Indemnified Party as additional interest such additional amounts as may be
necessary so that the net amount received by each Indemnified Party after such
withholding or deduction (and after deducting any Canadian Taxes on such
additional amounts) will not be less than the amount the Indemnified Party would
have received if such Canadian Taxes had not been withheld or deducted. No
additional amounts will be payable with respect to a payment made to an
Indemnified Party under this Section 2.16(a) where such Indemnified Party (i) is
subject to Canadian Taxes by reason of the Indemnified Party being a resident,
domicile or national of, or engaging in business or maintaining a permanent
establishment or other physical presence in or otherwise having some connection
with Canada or any province or territory thereof otherwise than by the mere
making or holding of the Notes or by the receipt of payments thereunder, or (ii)
is subject to Canadian Taxes by reason of its failure to comply with Section
2.16(g), provided, that should an Indemnified Party become subject to Canadian
Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the
applicable Borrower or the Parent shall take such administrative steps as such
Indemnified Party shall reasonably request to assist such Indemnified Party to
recover such Canadian Taxes, and provided further, that each Indemnified Party,
with respect to itself, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Borrowers and
the Parent from any Canadian Taxes, penalties, interest and other expenses,
costs and losses incurred or payable by either Borrower or the Parent as a
result of the

                                       53
<PAGE>
failure of the Borrowers or the Parent to comply with its obligations under this
Section 2.16(a) in reliance on any form or certificate provided to it by such
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 2.16. Each Borrower will also make
such withholdings or deductions and remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (b)      Any and all payments by the Parent (or by either Borrower to
the extent either Borrower causes a payment to be made from any jurisdiction
other than Canada) hereunder or under the Notes shall be made in accordance with
Section 2.15, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction outside Canada, excluding in the case of each Indemnified Party all
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, imposed on or determined by reference to its
income or profits, and all franchise taxes and all other taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings in effect at the time that such Indemnified
Party executed this Agreement or otherwise became an "Indemnified Party"
hereunder, and liabilities with respect thereto, imposed on it by reason of the
jurisdiction in which such Indemnified Party is organized, domiciled, resident
or doing business, or any political subdivision thereof, or by reason of the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office or any other office from which it
makes or maintains any extension of credit hereunder or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments under this
Agreement or under the Notes being herein referred to as "NON-CANADIAN TAXES"
and, together with Canadian Taxes, "TAXES"). If the Parent (or either Borrower,
as applicable) shall be required by law to deduct any Non-Canadian Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable by it hereunder or under any Note to any
Indemnified Party, (i) the sum payable by it shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) such Indemnified
Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Parent (in the case of payments by it) (or
applicable Borrower (in the case of payments by it) or the

                                       54
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent, as applicable) shall make such deductions at the
applicable statutory rate and (iii) the Parent (in the case of payments by it)
(or the applicable Borrower (in the case of payments by it) or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable) shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law, provided that the Parent shall not be required to pay any additional amount
(and shall be relieved of any liability with respect thereto) pursuant to this
subsection (b) (or pursuant to Section 2.16(e), except to the extent Section
2.16(e) relates to Other Taxes) to any Indemnified Party that has failed to
submit any form or certificate that it was required to file or provide pursuant
to Section 2.16(f) and is entitled to file or give, as applicable, under
applicable law, provided, further, that should an Indemnified Party become
subject to Non-Canadian Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
hereunder, the Parent shall take such administrative steps as such Indemnified
Party shall reasonably request to assist such Indemnified Party to recover such
Non-Canadian Taxes, and provided further, that each Indemnified Party, with
respect to itself, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent from any
taxes, penalties, interest and other expenses, costs and losses incurred or
payable by the Parent as a result of the failure of the Parent to comply with
its obligations under clauses (ii) or (iii) above in reliance on any form or
certificate provided to it by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
2.16.

         (c)      If any Indemnified Party receives a net credit or refund in
respect of Taxes or amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.16 by either
Borrower or the Parent, it shall promptly notify such Borrower or the Parent of
such net credit or refund and shall promptly pay such net credit or refund to
the applicable Borrower or the Parent, provided that the applicable Borrower or
the Parent, as applicable, agree to return such net credit or refund if the
Indemnified Party to which such net credit or refund is applicable is required
to repay it.

         (d)      In addition, the Parent and the applicable Borrower agree to
pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution,

                                       55
<PAGE>
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the
Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

         (e)      The applicable Borrower or the Parent will indemnify each
Indemnified Party for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.16 but excluding Canadian Taxes to the extent that such Indemnified
Party is described in either Section 2.16(a)(i) or (ii) hereof) paid by such
Indemnified Party and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto except as a result of the gross
negligence (which shall in any event include the failure of such Indemnified
Party to provide any form or certificate that it was required to provide either
to the Borrowers pursuant to subsection (g) below or to the Parent pursuant to
either subsection (f) or (g) below) or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Party, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such
Indemnified Party makes written demand therefor.

         (f)      On or prior to the date on which each Indemnified Party that
is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Internal Revenue Code) executes this Agreement or otherwise becomes an
"Indemnified Party" hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall provide the Parent
and the Administrative Agent with U.S. Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service, certifying, if it is entitled to so certify, that such
Indemnified Party is fully exempt from United States withholding taxes with
respect to all payments to be made to such Indemnified Party hereunder, or other
documents satisfactory to the Parent indicating that all payments to be made to
such Indemnified Party hereunder are fully exempt from such taxes, if such is
the case. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Indemnified Party shall
submit to the Parent and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed
and signed copies of one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as
shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing
authorities) as may be (i) notified by the Parent to such Indemnified Party and
(ii) required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid

                                       56
<PAGE>
United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be
received by such Indemnified Party hereunder or under the Notes, including fees,
if the particular Indemnified Party is eligible for such exemption. Upon the
request of the Parent from time to time, each Indemnified Party that is a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal
Revenue Code) shall submit to the Parent a certificate to the effect that it is
such a United States person. If any Indemnified Party determines that it is not
fully exempt from United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments
to be received hereunder and is therefore unable to submit to the Parent any
form or certificate that such Indemnified Party would otherwise be obligated to
submit pursuant to this subsection (f), or that such Indemnified Party is
required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted
because it is no longer entitled to such an exemption, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent of such fact.

         (g)      In the event that, as a result of a Change in Law, Canada or
any political subdivision thereof introduces certification, identification,
information, documentation or other reporting requirements which require
compliance by an Indemnified Party as a pre-condition to an exemption from
withholding on Canadian Taxes for any payment made from Canada by the Borrowers
or the Parent, hereunder or under the Notes (the "CANADIAN CERTIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS"), then such Indemnified Party shall provide the Parent, the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with any applicable forms, certificates
or other documentation, as appropriate and as prescribed by the appropriate
Canadian governmental authority, certifying, if it is entitled to so certify,
that such Indemnified Party is so exempt from Canadian withholding taxes with
respect to payments to be made to such Indemnified Party, if such is the case.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Indemnified Party shall submit to
the Parent, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent such additional duly
completed and signed copies of one or the other of such forms, certificates or
other documentation as may be notified by the Parent or by the Borrowers to such
Indemnified Party and required under then-current Canadian law or regulations
(or the law or regulations of any political subdivision of Canada, if
applicable) to avoid Canadian withholding taxes on payments in respect of all
amounts to be received by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this

                                       57
<PAGE>
Agreement or the Notes, including fees, if the particular Indemnified Party is
eligible for such exemption. If any Indemnified Party determines that it is not
exempt from Canadian withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be
received hereunder and is therefore unable to submit to the Parent, the
Borrowers or the Administrative Agent any form, certificate or other
documentation that such Indemnified Party would otherwise be obligated to submit
pursuant to this subsection (g), or that such Indemnified Party is required to
withdraw or cancel any such form, certificate or documentation previously
submitted because it is no longer entitled to such an exemption, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Parent, the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent of such fact. The Borrowers and the Parent acknowledge that
no such Canadian Certification Requirements currently exist under Canadian law.
The obligations of each Indemnified Party under this Section 2.16(g) shall not
be effective with respect to such Indemnified Party unless and until either the
Parent, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent provides written notice to
such Indemnified Party of any such Canadian Certification Requirements and
extends to such Indemnified Party a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30
days, to comply with any such requirements.

         (h)      Any Indemnified Party claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall use its best reasonable efforts (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Indemnified Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Indemnified Party.

         (i)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrowers and the Parent hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrowers, the Parent and each Indemnified Party contained in this Section 2.16
shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under
the Notes.

         SECTION 2.17      SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If any Lender shall obtain
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of

                                       58
<PAGE>
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it (other than
pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, 9.04(b) or 9.04(c)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the
Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them,
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and each Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such Lender's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of the participation purchased from such Lender as
a result of such excess payment to (ii) the total amount of such excess payment)
of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (B) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

         SECTION 2.18      EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of each Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such Lender hereunder, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time
to time hereunder.

         (b)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts and records
in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the type
of Advance and, in the cases of B/A Advances and Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
relevant Contract Period or Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount
of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from
each Borrower to each Lender hereunder,

                                       59
<PAGE>
and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder
for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

         (c)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
Sections 2.18(a) and (b) shall be conclusive evidence (absent manifest error) of
the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the
applicable Borrower to repay the Advances made to it in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and any Lender, the records maintained by
the Lender shall govern. Any Lender may request that Loans (other than B/As)
made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto. Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
after assignment pursuant to Section 9.07) be represented by one or more Notes
in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such Note
is a registered Note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

         SECTION 2.19      USE OF PROCEEDS. Proceeds of the Advances may be used
for general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and of
Parent and any of its other Subsidiaries, including for acquisitions and for
payment of commercial paper issued by either Borrower or any such other Person.

         SECTION 2.20      INCREASE OF COMMITMENTS. (a) At any time after the
Effective Date, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Borrowers may request an increase of the aggregate Commitments
by notice to the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount (the "OFFERED
INCREASE AMOUNT") of such proposed increase (such notice, a "COMMITMENT INCREASE
NOTICE"). Any such Commitment Increase Notice must offer each Lender the
opportunity to subscribe for its pro rata share of the increased Commitments. If
any portion of the increased Commitments is not subscribed for by the Lenders,
the Borrowers may, in their sole

                                       60
<PAGE>
discretion, but with the consent of the Administrative Agent as to any Person
that is not at such time a Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), offer to any existing Lender or to one or more additional banks or
financial institutions the opportunity to participate in all or a portion of
such unsubscribed portion of the increased Commitments pursuant to paragraph (b)
or (c) below, as applicable.

         (b)      Any additional bank or financial institution that the
Borrowers select to offer participation in the increased Commitments, and that
elects to become a party to this Agreement and obtain a Commitment, shall
execute a New Lender Agreement with the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent,
substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a "NEW LENDER AGREEMENT"), whereupon
such bank or financial institution (a "NEW LENDER") shall become a Lender for
all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be
bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement, and the signature pages
and Schedule III hereof shall be deemed to be amended to add the name and
Commitment of such New Lender, provided that the Commitment of any such New
Lender shall be in an amount not less than Cdn.$5,000,000.

         (c)      Any Lender that accepts an offer to it by the Borrowers to
increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall, in each case,
execute a Commitment Increase Agreement with the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit F (a "COMMITMENT
INCREASE AGREEMENT"), whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment
as so increased, and Schedule III hereof shall be deemed to be amended to so
increase the Commitment of such Lender.

         (d)      The effectiveness of any New Lender Agreement or Commitment
Increase Agreement shall be contingent upon receipt by the Administrative Agent
of such corporate resolutions of the Borrowers and legal opinions of counsel to
the Borrowers as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request with respect
thereto, in each case, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

         (e)      If any bank or financial institution

                                       61
<PAGE>
becomes a New Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(b) or any Lender's Commitment is
increased pursuant to Section 2.20(c), additional Advances made on or after the
effectiveness thereof (the "RE-ALLOCATION DATE") shall be made pro rata based on
the Commitment Percentages in effect on and after such Re-Allocation Date
(except to the extent that any such pro rata borrowings would result in any
Lender making an aggregate principal amount of Advances in excess of its
Commitment, in which case such excess amount will be allocated to, and made by,
such New Lender and/or Lenders with such increased Commitments to the extent of,
and pro rata based on, their respective Commitments), and continuations of
Eurodollar Rate Advances outstanding on such Re-Allocation Date shall be
effected by repayment of such Eurodollar Rate Advances on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto and the making of new Eurodollar Rate
Advances pro rata based on such new Commitment Percentages. In the event that on
any such Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Prime Rate
Advances or Base Rate Advances, the existing Lenders shall be deemed to have
made partial assignments thereof to the New Lenders and/or Lenders with such
increased Commitments in such amounts that, after giving effect thereto, the
Prime Rate Advances and Base Rate Advances outstanding are held pro rata based
on such new Commitment Percentages. In the event that on any such Re-Allocation
Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances, such
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall remain outstanding with the respective holders
thereof until the expiration of their respective Interest Periods (unless the
applicable Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement), and interest on and repayments of such
Eurodollar Rate Advances will be paid thereon to the respective Lenders holding
such Eurodollar Rate Advances pro rata based on the respective principal amounts
thereof outstanding. In the event that on any such Re-Allocation Date there is
an unpaid principal amount of B/A Advances, such B/A Advances shall remain
outstanding with the respective holders thereof until the expiration of their
respective Contract Periods, and repayments of such B/A Advances will be paid
thereon to the respective Lenders holding such B/As based on the respective face
amounts thereof.

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20,
(i) no increase pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be effective without the
consent of

                                       62
<PAGE>
the Required Lenders, (ii) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its
Commitment unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion and (iii) the
aggregate amount by which the Commitments hereunder are increased pursuant to
this Section 2.20 shall not exceed Cdn. [$141,426,000].

         (g)      Each Borrower shall execute and deliver a Note to each new
bank or other financial institution becoming a Lender that requests one.

         SECTION 2.21      EXTENSION OF REVOLVING COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE.
(a) Not earlier than 65 days prior to and not later than 45 days prior to the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date then in effect, provided that no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrowers may request an
extension of such Revolving Commitment Termination Date by submitting to the
Administrative Agent an Extension Request containing the information in respect
of such extension specified in Exhibit G, which the Administrative Agent shall
promptly furnish to each Lender. Each Lender shall, by the later of (i) the date
30 days after its receipt from the Administrative Agent of the applicable
Extension Request and (ii) the date 30 days prior to the Revolving Commitment
Termination Date, notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of its
consent to extend or its refusal to extend the Revolving Commitment Termination
Date as requested in such Extension Request. Any such Extension Request shall be
approved if the Required Lenders shall approve in writing the extension of the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date requested in such Extension Request. The
Borrowers may request no more than ten extensions pursuant to this Section 2.21,
so that the Revolving Commitment Termination Date shall not in any event extend
beyond the tenth anniversary of the initial Revolving Commitment Termination
Date hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and
the Borrowers of any extension of the Revolving Commitment Termination Date
pursuant to this Section 2.21 and shall promptly notify the Borrowers of any
Lender that has notified the Administrative Agent of its consent to extend or
its refusal to extend the Revolving Commitment Termination Date.

         (b)      If any such Extension Request is approved but there are one or
more Lenders that do not consent to the Extension Request in writing within the
period specified in paragraph (a) above (an "Objecting Lender"),

                                       63
<PAGE>
the Borrowers shall be entitled to choose any of the following options prior to
the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, provided that if the Borrowers do not
make an election prior to such date, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
irrevocably elected to exercise the option in clause (iii)(y) below:

         (i)      the Borrowers may elect to cause the Commitments and Advances
     of any Objecting Lender to be transferred or assigned pursuant to Section
     2.21(c); and/or

         (ii)     the Borrowers may elect to voluntarily prepay the Advances, if
     any, of Objecting Lenders together with accrued interest thereon, any
     amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16 and 9.04(b) and
     any accrued and unpaid facility fee or utilization fee or other amounts
     payable with respect to such Objecting Lenders, and the Commitments of such
     Objecting Lenders shall be terminated; or

         (iii)    the Borrowers may elect to revoke and cancel the Extension
     Request by giving notice of such revocation and cancellation to the
     Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof) and
     concurrently therewith shall have the option to (x) voluntarily prepay the
     Advances, if any, of all Lenders, together with accrued interest thereon,
     any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16 and 9.04(b)
     and any accrued and unpaid facility fee or utilization fee or other amounts
     payable with respect to the Lenders, and the Commitments of all Lenders
     shall be terminated or (y) have the outstanding Advances continue as term
     loans repayable in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of
     Section 2.05 of this Agreement.

         (c)      If any Lender becomes an Objecting Lender, the Borrowers may,
at their own expense and in their sole discretion and prior to the then
Revolving Commitment Termination Date, require such Lender to transfer or
assign, without recourse (in accordance with Section 8.07), all of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and, if the Borrowers
shall so determine in their sole discretion, all or part of its interest, rights
and obligations under the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the
U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may

                                       64
<PAGE>
be) to an Eligible Assignee (provided that the Borrowers, with the full
cooperation of such Lender, can identify an Eligible Assignee that is ready,
willing and able to be an assignee with respect thereto) which shall assume such
assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if such assignee
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) the assignee or the
applicable Borrower, as the case may be, shall have paid to such Lender in
immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of
such payment on the Advances made by it hereunder and the "Advances" made by it
under, and as defined in, the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement or the
U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may be, and all other
amounts owed to it hereunder and thereunder, including any amounts owing
pursuant to Section 9.04(b) (or the comparable provision of the U.S. Long-Term
Revolving Credit Agreement or the U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as
the case may be) and any amounts that would be owing under such Section (or
comparable provision) if such Advances and "Advances" (as so defined) were
prepaid on the date of such assignment, and (B) such assignment does not
conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any governmental
authority. Any assignee that becomes a Lender as a result of such an assignment
made pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be deemed to have consented to the
applicable Extension Request and, therefore, shall not be an Objecting Lender.

         SECTION 2.22      REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests
compensation under Sections 2.11 or 2.13 or if either Borrower is required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any taxing authority or other
authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any
Lender suspends the right of the Borrowers to elect Eurodollar Rate Advances
from such Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender defaults in its
obligation to fund Advances hereunder, then the Borrowers may, at their sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.07), all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement and, if the Borrowers shall so
determine in their sole discretion, the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit
Agreement and/or the U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the
Borrowers may determine in their sole discretion and specify by notice to such
Lender, (other than "B Advances" under,

                                       65
<PAGE>
and as defined in, the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the U.S.
Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may be) to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrowers shall have received
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances hereunder and, if the
Borrowers shall have so determined as specified above, its "Advances" (other
than "B Advances") (each under and as defined in the U.S. Long-Term Revolving
Credit Agreement and/or the U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the
case may be), and all accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, accrued costs in
connection with compensation under Sections 2.12 or 2.13 or payments required to
be made pursuant to Section 2.16, if any, and all other amounts (other than "B
Advances") payable to it hereunder and, if the Borrowers shall have so
determined as specified above, under the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit
Agreement and/or the U.S. Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may
be, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts)
and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Sections 2.12 or 2.13 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

         SECTION 2.23      CURRENCY INDEMNITY. If, for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement or any
other Financing Document, it becomes necessary to convert into the currency of
such jurisdiction (the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY") any amount due under this Agreement
or under any other Financing Document in any currency other than the Judgment
Currency (the "CURRENCY DUE"), then conversion shall be made at the rate of
exchange prevailing on the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is
given. For this purpose, "rate of exchange" means the rate at which the
Administrative

                                       66
<PAGE>
Agent is able, on the relevant date, to purchase the Currency Due with the
Judgment Currency in accordance with its normal practice at its head office in
Toronto, Ontario. In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange
prevailing between the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is
given and the date of receipt by the Administrative Agent of the amount due, the
applicable Borrower will, on the date of receipt by the Administrative Agent,
pay such additional amounts, if any, or be entitled to obtain reimbursement of
such amount, if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the amount received by
the Administrative Agent on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency
which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of receipt
by the Administrative Agent is the amount then due under this Agreement or under
such other Financing Document in the Currency Due. If the amount of the Currency
Due which the Administrative Agent is so able to purchase is less than the
amount of the Currency Due originally due to it, the applicable Borrower shall
indemnify and save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from and
against all loss or damage arising as a result of such deficiency. This
indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other
obligations contained in this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, shall
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply
irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Administrative Agent from time to
time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or
order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due under this Agreement or
any other Financing Document or under any judgment or order.

         SECTION 2.24      EXCHANGE RATE CALCULATIONS. (a) Not later than 12:00
noon, Calgary local time, on each Calculation Date, the Administrative Agent
shall (i) determine the Exchange Rate as of such Calculation Date and (ii) give
notice thereof to the Borrowers and to each Lender that shall have requested
such information. The Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective on the
first Business Day immediately following the relevant Calculation Date (each, a
"RESET DATE") and shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date.

         (b)      Not later than 12:00 noon, Calgary local time, on each Reset
Date, the Administrative Agent shall (i) determine the Cdn.$ Equivalent of the
Advances

                                       67
<PAGE>
outstanding on such date, or to be outstanding after giving effect to any
Borrowing to occur on such date, and (ii) notify the Borrowers and each Lender
that shall have requested such information of the aggregate outstanding
Advances, based on information provided by each Borrower after giving effect to
all Advances and all repayments and prepayments to occur on such date.

                                    ARTICLE 3

         The Borrowers and the Initial Lenders agree that upon the Effective
Date the "Commitments" of the Initial Lenders shall be as set forth on Schedule
III hereof under the caption "Commitments".

         SECTION 3.02      CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO EACH BORROWING. The

delivered hereunder) and the other Financing Documents, if any, when delivered
hereunder shall constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the

proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrowers and Parent threatened,
against or involving Parent or any Material Subsidiary in any court, or before
any arbitrator of any kind, or before or by any governmental body, which in the
reasonable judgment of the Borrowers and Parent (taking into account the

effect or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or the other
Financing Documents, if any.

or a "company" controlled by an "investment company" within the meaning of the

making of the Advances and the execution and delivery to the Lenders of this

         SECTION 5.01      AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any Advance, Note
or other amount payable either Borrower

                                       73

hereunder shall remain unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder,
Parent will, unless the Majority Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing:

         (a)      PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, ETC. Preserve and maintain, and
cause each Material Subsidiary to preserve and maintain, its existence, rights
(organizational and statutory) and material franchises, except as otherwise
contemplated or permitted by Section 5.02(c) or 5.02(d); provided, that any
Material Subsidiary may change its form of organization to a partnership or
other form of Business Entity, provided further that in the case of any such
change by a Borrower, its jurisdiction of organization remains in Canada, and in
connection with any such change by a Borrower, such Borrower shall cause to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Administrative Agent to the effect that the successor entity to such
Borrower continues to be bound by, or has assumed by instrument or by operation
of law, all of such Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the Notes.

         (b)      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. Comply, and cause each Subsidiary
to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders (including all environmental laws and laws requiring
payment of all taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed upon it or
upon its property except to the extent contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings) the failure to comply with which would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (c)      VISITATION RIGHTS. At such reasonable times and intervals as
the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may desire, permit the
Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders to visit each Borrower and to discuss
the affairs, finances, accounts and mineral reserve performance of Parent and
any of its Subsidiaries with officers of the Borrowers and Parent and
independent certified public accountants of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries,
provided that if an Event of Default, or an event which with the giving of
notice or the passage of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, has
occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, in
addition to the other provisions of this subsection (c) and at such reasonable
times and intervals as the Administrative Agent or any of the

                                       74
<PAGE>
Lenders may desire, visit and inspect, under guidance of officers of Parent (or,
in the case of properties of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries, of the
Borrowers), as the case may be, any properties significant to the consolidated
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and to examine the books and records
of account (other than with respect to any mineral reserve information that
Parent determines to be confidential, except, during the continuation of an
Event of Default, if such Lenders shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with respect to such information satisfactory in form and substance to
Parent) Parent and any of its Subsidiaries and to discuss the affairs, finances
and accounts of any of the Subsidiaries of Parent with any of the officers of
such Subsidiary.

         (d)      BOOKS AND RECORDS. Keep, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct entries
shall be made of all financial transactions and the assets and business of
Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent in accordance with GAAP either (i)
consistently applied or (ii) applied in a changed manner that does not, under
GAAP or public reporting requirements applicable to Parent either require
disclosure in the consolidated financial statements of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries or require the consent of the accountants which (as
required by Section 5.03(b)) report on such financial statements for the fiscal
year in which such change shall have occurred, or (iii) applied in a changed
manner not covered by clause (ii) above provided such change shall have been
disclosed to the Administrative Agent and shall have been consented to by the
accountants which (as required by Section 5.03(b)) report on the consolidated
financial statements of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal
year in which such change shall have occurred, provided further that if any
change referred to in clause (ii) or (iii) above would not meet the standard set
forth in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 1.03, the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders, the Borrowers and Parent agree to amend the covenants contained in
Section 5.01 and 5.02 so that the relative protection afforded thereby to the
Lenders and the relative flexibility afforded thereby to each Borrower will in
substance be retained after such amendment, provided further, however, that
until such amendment becomes effective hereunder, the covenants as set forth
herein shall remain in full force and effect and those

                                       75
<PAGE>
accounting principles applicable to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
which do meet the standards set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 1.03
shall be applied to determine whether or not each Borrower is in compliance with
such covenants.

         (e)      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES, ETC. Maintain and preserve, and
cause each Material Subsidiary to maintain and preserve, all of its properties
which are used in the conduct of its business in good working order and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to the extent that any failure to do
so would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (f)      MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Maintain, and cause each Material
Subsidiary to maintain, insurance with responsible and reputable insurance
companies or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties
in the same general areas in which Parent or such Subsidiary operates.

         SECTION 5.02      NEGATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any Advance, Note or
other amount payable by either Borrower hereunder shall remain unpaid or any
Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, Parent will not, unless the Majority
Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing:

Material Subsidiary to create or assume, any Liens upon or with respect to any
other assets material to the consolidated operations of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole securing the payment of Debt and

that the amount of a Guaranty will be excluded to the extent the Debt Guaranteed
thereby is included in computing such aggregate amount)) exceeding the greater
of (x) U.S.$250,000,000 and (y) 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth as at the
date of such creation or assumption; provided, however, that this subsection (a)

Debt or Guaranty is not increased (except by the amount of costs reasonably
incurred in connection with the issuance thereof) and such Debt or Guaranty is
not secured by any additional assets that would not have been permitted by this
Section to secure the Debt or Guaranty refinanced, extended, renewed or
refunded; and

         (G)      Liens on products and proceeds (including dividend, interest
and like payments on, and insurance and condemnation proceeds and rental, lease,
licensing and similar proceeds) of, and property evidencing or embodying, or

consolidated Subsidiaries is less than 60% of Capitalization, provided that Debt
for borrowed money either maturing within one year and evidenced by instruments
commonly known as commercial paper, or evidenced by variable demand notes or

constituting all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Parent and
its Material Subsidiaries, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
or any Material Subsidiary may sell, lease or otherwise transfer any Permitted

other transfer, no Event of Default, and no event which with lapse of time or
the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have
occurred and be continuing or (2) Parent or the relevant Material Subsidiary, as

Borrower under the laws of Canada or any province thereof, the continuing

                                       79

any and all other Plans with respect to which a Termination Event shall have
occurred and then exist (or in the case of a Plan with respect to which a
Termination Event described in clause (ii) of the definition of Termination
Event shall have occurred and then exist, the liability related thereto), in
each case in respect of which Parent or any ERISA Affiliate has liability, is
equal to or greater than U.S.$50,000,000; or

         (h)      Parent or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been notified by the

if as a result of such reorganization or termination the aggregate annual

increased over the amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the
respective plan years which include the Original Effective Date by an amount
exceeding U.S.$50,000,000; or

         (j)      Upon completion of, and pursuant to, a transaction, or a

(within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
other than Parent, a Subsidiary of Parent or any employee benefit plan
maintained for employees of Parent and/or any of its respective Subsidiaries or
the trustee therefor, shall have acquired direct or indirect ownership of and
paid for in excess of 50% of the outstanding capital stock of Parent entitled to
vote in elections for directors of Parent and (ii) at any time before the later
of (x) six months after the completion of such tender offer and (y) the next
annual meeting of the shareholders of Parent following the completion of such
tender offer more than

                                       87
<PAGE>
half of the directors of Parent consists of individuals who (a) were not

claimed by Parent, either Borrower or any Subsidiary of Parent not to be) valid
or in full force and effect; provided that if within one Business Day after the
Borrowers or Parent receive notice from the Administrative Agent or otherwise
becomes aware that such Guaranty is not valid or in full force and effect,
Parent delivers written notice to the Administrative Agent that it intends to
deliver a valid and effective Guaranty, or to reinstate such Guaranty, as soon
as possible, then an Event of Default shall not exist pursuant this Section
6.01(l) unless Parent shall fail to deliver or reinstate a Guaranty having
substantially the same effect as the Guaranty set forth in Article 8 within four
Business Days after the delivery of such written notice of intent.

         (m)      Any "Event of Default" as defined in the U.S. Short-Term
Revolving Credit Agreement or the U.S. Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement
shall occur and be continuing; then, and in any such event, the Administrative
Agent shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by
notice to the Borrowers and Parent, (i) declare the obligation of each Lender to
make Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate,
and (ii) declare the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts
payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the
Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers and Parent;
provided, however, that if an Event of Default under subsection (e) of this
Section 6.01 (except under clause (i)(A) thereof) shall occur, (A) the
obligation of each Lender to make Advances shall

                                       88
<PAGE>
automatically be terminated and (B) the Advances, all interest thereon and all
other amounts payable under this Agreement shall automatically become and be
forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers and Parent.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 7.01      AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement or collection of the
Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be
binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the
Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each
Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrowers pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall impose upon any
Co-Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent, in its capacity as such, any
duty or liability whatsoever.

         SECTION 7.02      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under
or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment
and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of such Note, as
assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as

                                       89
<PAGE>
provided in Section 9.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
for the Borrowers and Parent), independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this
Agreement; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Agreement on the part of the Borrowers and Parent or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of the Borrowers or Parent; (v) shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile,
electronic mail, telegram, telecopy, cable or telex) believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

         SECTION 7.03      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND AFFILIATES. With respect to
its Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any
kind of business with, Parent, the Borrowers, any of their Subsidiaries, and any
Person who may do business with or own securities of Parent, the Borrowers or
any of their Subsidiaries, all as if the Administrative Agent were not the
Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the other
Lenders.

         SECTION 7.04      LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to

                                       90
<PAGE>
in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.05      INDEMNIFICATION. THE LENDERS AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED BY THE BORROWERS OR PARENT),
RATABLY ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF THE ADVANCES THEN HELD
BY EACH OF THEM (OR IF NO ADVANCES ARE AT THE TIME OUTSTANDING OR IF ANY
ADVANCES ARE HELD BY PERSONS WHICH ARE NOT LENDERS, RATABLY ACCORDING TO THE
RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS OF THEIR COMMITMENTS OR THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS OF THEIR
COMMITMENTS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO TERMINATION IF THE COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN
TERMINATED), FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES,
DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DISBURSEMENTS
OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR
ASSERTED AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENT OR OTHER
INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR
ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR
ANY OF THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENT OR OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT
FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH; PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER
SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY PORTION OF SUCH LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES,
DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS
RESULTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILFUL MISCONDUCT.

         Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse
the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for such Lender's ratable share of
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings, in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or
otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, any of the Notes or any other

                                       91
<PAGE>
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or in connection herewith to
the extent that the Administrative Agent acts in its capacity as Administrative
Agent and is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers or Parent.

         SECTION 7.06      SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative
Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders,
the Borrowers and Parent and may be removed at any time with or without cause by
the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority
Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then such retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank organized, or authorized to conduct
a banking business, under the federal laws of Canada and having a combined
capital and surplus of at least U.S.$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article 7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                                    GUARANTY

         In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder, (i) each of
Parent and BRCL hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the
Obligations of Canadian Hunter, and (ii) each of Parent and Canadian Hunter
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the Obligations of BRCL. Each
Guarantor agrees that the

                                       92
<PAGE>
Guaranteed Parties may make a claim under its guarantee immediately upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, but (other than in
the case of an Event of Default in respect of either Borrower under Section
6.01(e) (except clause (i)(A) thereof)) following the making of a demand on the
applicable Borrower for payment or performance, as applicable, without any
obligation to first seek any other remedy or take any other action against such
Borrower. Each Guarantor further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the
Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to
or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its Guaranty
hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each
and every default in payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or
interest on any Obligation shall give rise to a separate cause of action
hereunder, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action
arises.

         Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and
protest to the applicable Borrower of any of the Obligations of such Borrower,
and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest
for nonpayment. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be
affected by (a) the failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower or Parent under
the provisions of this Agreement, any other Financing Document or otherwise; (b)
any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver,
amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement or any other Financing Document or agreement; (d) the failure or
delay of any Guaranteed Party to exercise any right or remedy against any other
guarantor of the Obligations; (e) the failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert
any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under any Financing Document, any
guaranty or any other agreement or instrument; (f) any default, failure or
delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (h) any
other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any
manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a
discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or
eliminate any right of any Guarantor to subrogation.

         Each Guarantor further agrees that its agreement

                                       93
<PAGE>
hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due (whether or not any
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of
any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of
collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any
Guaranteed Party to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of
any Guaranteed Party in favor of the applicable Borrower or any other Person.

         The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not
be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the
Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or
otherwise.

         Each Guarantor further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall
continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored by any Guaranteed Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the
applicable Borrower or otherwise.

         In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other
right which any Guaranteed Party may have at law or in equity against any
Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the applicable Borrower to pay
any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, Parent and (a) BRCL (in
the event such Obligation is due and payable by Canadian Hunter) or (b) Canadian
Hunter (in the event such Obligation is due and payable by BRCL), hereby, in
their respective capacity as Guarantor, promise to and will, upon receipt of
written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid,
to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Guaranteed Parties in cash
an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid principal amount of such
Obligations then due, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such
Obligations and (iii) all other monetary Obligations then due. Each Guarantor,
as applicable, further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall
be due in a currency other than Cdn. Dollars and/or at a place of payment other
than Toronto, Ontario and if, by reason of

                                       94
<PAGE>
any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or
civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Obligation in such currency
or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the judgment of any
Guaranteed Party, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests,
then, at the election of such Guaranteed Party, each Guarantor, as applicable,
shall make payment of such Obligation in Cdn. Dollars (based upon the applicable
Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in Toronto, Ontario, and
shall indemnify such Guaranteed Party against any losses or expenses that it
shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.

         Upon payment in full by a Guarantor of any Obligation of the applicable
Borrower, each Lender shall, in a reasonable manner, assign the amount of such
Obligation owed to it and so paid to such Guarantor, such assignment to be pro
tanto to the extent to which the Obligation in question was discharged by such
Guarantor, or make such disposition thereof as such Guarantor, as applicable,
shall direct (all without recourse to any Guaranteed Party and without any
representation or warranty by any Guaranteed Party).

         Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided above, all rights
of such Guarantor against the applicable Borrower arising as a result thereof by

         (b)      If any payment of principal of, or Continuation of, any

Lender on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance, as a result of a prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10 or a Continuation
pursuant to Section 2.08(f) or Section 2.09 or due to acceleration of the
maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or due to any other reason

reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or

         (c)      If any payment of principal of any B/A Advance is made by

ADVANCES BY EITHER BORROWER (EXCLUDING ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR
EXPENSES INCURRED BY REASON OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE
PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED OR ITS EMPLOYEES OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS, OR BY REASON
OF ANY USE OR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO ANY SUCH ACQUISITION OR USE
OR PROPOSED USE OF THE PROCEEDS BY THE PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED OR ITS EMPLOYEES

<PAGE>
         SECTION 9.05      RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon the declaration of the
Advances as due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each
Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of either Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and any Note held by
such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Borrower after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.05 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such
Lender may have.

         SECTION 9.06      BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become effective
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, Parent, the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger and each Lender and their respective
successors and assigns, except that none of Parent or the Borrowers shall have
the right to assign their rights and obligations hereunder or any interest
herein without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders; provided that
notwithstanding the foregoing either Borrower shall be permitted to transfer its
rights and obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (i) if
such Subsidiary is organized and existing under the laws of Canada or any
political subdivision thereof and (ii) the Borrowers guarantee the obligations
of any new Borrower on substantially the terms set forth in Article 8, at which
time BRCL and/or Canadian Hunter, as applicable, shall cease to be a Borrower
hereunder and shall cease to have any liability under this Agreement, the Notes,
if any, or any other Financing Document except under such guarantee and Article
8. Any merger, amalgamation or consolidation in compliance with Section 5.02(d)
of (i) either Borrower with Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
organized under the laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof, or

                                      100
<PAGE>
(ii) Parent shall not constitute an assignment for purposes of this Section
9.06.

         SECTION 9.07      ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

         (a)      Each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or
Notes held by it); provided, however, that each such assignment shall be to an
Eligible Assignee and the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment and, except in the case of an assignment to a Lender
Affiliate, a processing and recordation fee of Cdn.$3,500, and shall send to the
Borrowers an executed counterpart of such Assignment and Acceptance, and
provided further, however, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a
Lender Affiliate, each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a
varying, percentage of all such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being
assigned to the assignee pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) must be
equal to or greater than Cdn.$10,000,000, or if less, the entire amount of such
assigning Lender's "Commitment" (unless the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent shall otherwise consent, which consent may be withheld for any reason) and
must be an integral multiple of Cdn.$1,000,000, and (iii) except in the case of
an assignment by a Schedule II Lender to a Lender Affiliate thereof that is a
Schedule III Bank, any assignment to a Lender Affiliate will not relieve the
assigning Lender of its obligation to make Advances hereunder timely in
accordance with the terms hereof in the event such Lender Affiliate shall fail
to do so. Upon the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of each
Assignment and Acceptance by the parties thereto, from and after the effective
date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, subject to clause (iii) above, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
and (y) except in the circumstances contemplated in clause (iii) above, the

                                      101
<PAGE>
Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance
covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto,
provided, however, such assigning Lender shall retain any claim with respect to
any fee, interest, cost, expense or indemnity which accrues, or relates to an
event that occurs, prior to the date of such assignment pursuant to Section
2.03, 2.06, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16 or 9.04.

         (b)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrowers or Parent or the performance or observance by the Borrowers or Parent
of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning
Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms
that it is (subject to approval in writing by the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent to the extent required) an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably

                                      102
<PAGE>
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance, each New
Lender Agreement and each Commitment Increase Agreement delivered to and
accepted by it and a register (which register may be in electronic form) for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and
principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the
"REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by either Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the
Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed
and is in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) accept such Assignment
and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. Within five Business Days
after its receipt of such notice and its receipt of an executed counterpart of
such Assignment and Acceptance, the applicable Borrower, at its own expense,
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for any
surrendered Note or Notes new Notes evidencing Advances made to such Borrower to
the order of such Eligible Assignee and, if the assigning Lender has retained a
Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the assigning Lender. Any such
new Note or Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

         (e)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement

                                      103
<PAGE>
(including all or a portion of its Commitment, and the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including its Commitment to the Borrowers
hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v)
such Lender shall continue to be able to agree to any modification or amendment
of this Agreement or any waiver hereunder without the consent, approval or vote
of any such participant or group of participants, other than modifications,
amendments and waivers which (A) postpone any date fixed for any payment of, or
reduce any payment of, principal of or interest on such Lender's Advances or any
facility fees or utilization fees payable under this Agreement, or (B) increase
the amount of such Lender's Commitment in a manner which would have the effect
of increasing the amount of a participant's participation, or (C) reduce the
interest rate payable under this Agreement and such Lender's Advances, or (D)
consent to the assignment or the transfer by the Borrowers or Parent of their
respective rights and obligations under the Agreement, and (vi) except as
contemplated by the immediately preceding clause (v), no participant shall be
deemed to be or to have any of the rights or obligations of a "Lender"
hereunder.

         (f)      Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrowers; provided that, prior to any such disclosure,
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree in
writing for the benefit of the Borrowers to preserve the confidentiality of any
confidential information relating to the Borrowers received by it from such
Lender in a manner consistent with Section 9.08.

         (g)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
any Lender may at any time create a

                                      104
<PAGE>
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including the Advances owing to it) and the Notes, if any, issued to it
hereunder in favor of any United States Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the
United States (or any successor regulation) and the applicable operating
circular of such Federal Reserve Bank.

         SECTION 9.08      CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender and the Administrative
Agent (each, a "PARTY") agrees that it will use its best reasonable efforts not
to disclose, without the prior consent of the Borrowers (other than to its, or
its Affiliates, employees, auditors, accountants, counsel or other
representatives, whether existing at the Effective Date or any subsequent time),
any information with respect to the Borrowers or Parent which is furnished
pursuant to this Agreement, provided that any party may disclose any such
information (i) as has become generally available to the public, (ii) as may be
required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any
governmental authority having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such party,
(iii) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena
or in connection with any litigation or regulatory proceeding, (iv) in order to
comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such party, or
(v) to any prospective assignee or participant in connection with any
contemplated assignment of any rights or obligations hereunder or any sale of
any participation therein, by such party pursuant to Section 9.07, if such
prospective assignee or participant, as the case may be, executes an agreement
with the Borrowers containing provisions substantially similar to those
contained in this Section 9.08; provided, however, that the Borrowers and Parent
acknowledge that the Administrative Agent has disclosed and may continue to
disclose such information as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion
determines is appropriate to the Lenders from time to time.

         SECTION 9.09      CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

         (a)      Each Borrower and Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submit itself and its property to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of the Courts of the Province of Alberta in any action or proceeding by the

                                      105
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Lender or the holder of any Note in
respect of, but only in respect of, any claims or causes of action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Financing Documents
(such claims and causes of action, collectively, being "PERMITTED CLAIMS"), and
each Borrower and Parent hereby irrevocably agrees that all Permitted Claims may
be heard and determined in Alberta. Each Borrower and Parent hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any aforementioned court in respect of Permitted Claims. Service of the
statement of claim and any other process which may be served by the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Lender or the holder of any Note on the
Borrowers or Parent in any such action or proceeding in any aforementioned court
in respect of Permitted Claims may be made by delivering separate copies of such
process to each Borrower and Parent by courier and by registered mail (return
receipt requested), fees and postage prepaid at the address of each Borrower and
Parent specified pursuant to Section 9.02, to the attention of each of the
Treasurer and the Vice President and General Counsel of Parent, or each of the
General Counsel and Assistant Treasurer in the case of the Borrowers. Each
Borrower and Parent agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

         (b)      Nothing in this Section 9.09 (i) shall affect the right of the
Arranger, the Borrowers, Parent, any Lender, the holder of any Note or the
Administrative Agent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law
or affect any right otherwise existing of the Borrowers, any Lender, the
Arranger, the holder of any Note or the Administrative Agent to bring any action
or proceeding in the courts of other jurisdictions or (ii) shall be deemed to be
a general consent to jurisdiction in any particular court or a general waiver of
any defense or a consent to jurisdiction of the courts expressly referred to in
subsection (a) above in any action or proceeding in respect of any claim or
cause of action other than Permitted Claims.

         SECTION 9.10      GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of
Alberta and the federal

                                      106
<PAGE>
laws of Canada applicable therein.

         SECTION 9.11      EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery to the Administrative Agent of a counterpart executed by a
Lender shall constitute delivery of such counterpart to all of the Lenders.
Delivery of an executed counterpart by facsimile shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed original counterpart.

         SECTION 9.12      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH BORROWER, PARENT, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENT
OR OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         SECTION 9.13      ENTIRE AGREEMENT, ETC.. This Agreement, together with
any other documents executed in connection herewith, express the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated, except as provided in Section 9.01.

The applicable pricing level shall change on the date of any relevant change in
the rating by S&P or Moody's of any public long term senior unsecured debt
securities of the Parent. In the case of split ratings from S&P and Moody's, the
rating to be used to determine the applicable pricing level is the higher of the
two (e.g., A-/Baa1 results in Level II pricing), provided that in the event the
split is more than one full category, the average (or the higher of two
intermediate ratings) shall be used (e.g., A-/Baa2 results in Level III pricing,
as does A-/Baa3). For the avoidance of doubt, the amount to be paid with respect
to any Acceptance Fee shall be determined on the date of the acceptance of the
applicable B/A, and the Acceptance Fee paid on each date shall not be subject to
adjustment based on a subsequent change in the pricing level.
