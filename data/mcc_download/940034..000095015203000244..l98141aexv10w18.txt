                                   ARTICLE 3

                           THE CLOSING; PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1 PLACE AND DATE. The closing of the sale and purchase of the
Transferred Assets (the "CLOSING") and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, not later than (i) five business days
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions referred to in Articles
11 and 12 or (ii) seven business days after the Sale Order is entered, whichever
is later, at such place upon which the parties may agree. The day on which the
Closing actually occurs is sometimes referred to herein as the "Closing Date."
Notwithstanding the actual time of Closing on the CLOSING DATE, the Closing
shall be deemed to have occurred as of 12:01 a.m., local time, on the Closing
Date (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

         3.2 PURCHASE PRICE. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the purchase price shall be U.S. $6,625,000.00 (the
"CASH PORTION") plus the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities plus or minus, as
applicable, the Working Capital Adjustment (collectively the "PURCHASE PRICE").

         3.3 DEPOSIT. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the
Buyer shall deliver to Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, L.L.P. attorneys for Seller an
amount equal to U.S.$150,000.00 (the "DEPOSIT") as a deposit toward the Cash
Portion of the Purchase Price. The Deposit shall be held and invested in an
interest bearing account, the proceeds of which shall be included in the Deposit
for the benefit of either Buyer or Seller, as the case may be.

         3.4 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE.

            (a) The parties shall allocate the aggregate consideration received
by Seller with respect to the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Tax Code, as
mutually agreed to by the parties within seven (7) business days following the
parties'

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
agreement with respect to the Working Capital Adjustment pursuant to the
procedure described below. Subject to the requirements of any applicable Tax law
or election, all such mutually agreed to allocations shall be used by each party
in preparing any filings required pursuant to Section 1060 of the Tax Code or
any similar provisions of state or local law and all relevant Income Tax
Returns. Neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position before any taxing
authority or in any judicial proceeding with respect to Income Taxes that is
inconsistent with such mutually agreed to allocations without the prior written
consent of the other party, in the consenting party's commercially reasonable
discretion. The parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
support such mutually agreed to reported allocations in any audit proceedings
initiated by any taxing authority.

             (b) Within 30 days after the date the parties agree to the Working
Capital Adjustment, Buyer will provide to Seller copies of IRS Form 8594 and any
required exhibits thereto with Buyer's proposed allocation of the consideration
received by Seller with respect to the Transferred Assets for Seller's approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Seller fails to respond to Buyer
within 30 days of Seller receiving such IRS Form 8594, then Seller shall be
deemed to have approved Buyer's allocation.

         3.5 DELIVERIES. At the Closing: (a) Buyer shall deliver to, or as
directed by Seller, the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price, plus or minus the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, less the Deposit, and the agreements,
instruments of assumption, certificates and other documents required to be
delivered by Buyer pursuant to Article 12; and (b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer
the agreements, instruments of transfer, certificates and other documents
required to be delivered by Seller pursuant to Article 11.

         3.6 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

             (a) If as of the Effective Time, Current Assets of the Business
that are included as Transferred Assets minus Current Liabilities of the
Business that are included as Assumed Liabilities (the foregoing calculation
referred to as "WORKING CAPITAL") exceeds $3,731,159.00 ("TARGET WORKING
CAPITAL"), the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar for
dollar by the amount of such excess. If the Working Capital as of the Effective
Time is less than the Target Working Capital, the Cash Portion of the Purchase
Price shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of such deficiency. The
foregoing adjustment to the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall be referred
to as the "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT". A sample Working Capital calculation is
attached hereto as Exhibit B. The calculation of Working Capital and the Target
Working Capital shall be done in accordance with the past practices of Seller
and shall be applied on a consistent basis throughout all the periods identified
and consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

             (b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer three (3) business days prior to
the Closing Date, written notice of Seller's good faith estimate of the Working
Capital Adjustment ("ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT"). Seller shall make
available during normal business hours to Buyer all appropriate personnel to
answer any questions of Buyer relating to Seller's calculation of such
estimates.

             (c) The actual Working Capital Adjustment shall be determined and
paid as follows:

                          (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
             Closing Date, but in no event later than the twenty-first (21st)
             day following the Closing Date, Seller (with the cooperation of
             Buyer) shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule detailing the
             amount and computation



                                      -12-
<PAGE>

             of the Working Capital Adjustment and final Purchase Price
             ("CLOSING SCHEDULE"). Buyer will give Seller access to the Books
             and Records for the purpose of preparing the Closing Schedule and
             access to the appropriate personnel of Buyer for the purpose of
             calculating the amounts set forth in the Closing Schedule.

                          (ii) Unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing ("DISPUTE
             NOTICE") that Buyer disagrees with the amount of the Working
             Capital Adjustment contained in the Closing Schedule on the later
             of ten (10) days after receipt of the Closing Schedule, the Closing
             Schedule shall be conclusive and binding on Buyer and Seller and
             deemed final. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall pay within
             five (5) days thereafter to the other party the amounts in cash
             identified in the Closing Schedule.

                          (iii) If Buyer delivers a Dispute Notice to Seller,
             Buyer and Seller shall attempt to amicably resolve their
             differences with respect thereto in good faith. If Buyer and Seller
             are unable to resolve any disputed item within ten (10) days of
             delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the parties shall submit the
             issues in dispute to an accounting firm (the "RESOLVING
             ACCOUNTANTS") mutually acceptable to both parties or, in the
             absence of agreement, to an accounting firm of national reputation
             selected by lot after eliminating the parties' principal outside
             accountants and one additional firm designated as objectionable by
             each of Buyer and Seller. If the disputed issues are submitted to
             the Resolving Accountants, each party shall furnish to the
             Resolving Accountants such work papers and other documents and
             information relating to the disputed issues as the Resolving
             Accountants may request and are available to such party, and each
             will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Resolving
             Accountants any material relating to the determination and to
             discuss the determination with the Resolving Accountants. Each
             party shall be entitled to request and receive information from the
             other which the Resolving Accountants determine is or may be
             relevant to the resolution of the disputed issues. The Resolving
             Accountants shall be required to make a decision within thirty (30)
             days of the date of their acceptance of their appointment as the
             Resolving Accountants. The determination of the Resolving
             Accountants, as set forth in a written notice delivered to the
             parties by the Resolving Accountants (the "NOTICE OF
             DETERMINATION"), shall be binding and conclusive on the parties
             absent fraud or manifest error. Buyer or Seller, as the case may
             be, shall pay within twenty (20) days thereafter to the other party
             the amounts in cash as is identified in the Notice of
             Determination. The fees and expenses of the Resolving Accountants
             shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

         3.7 CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Consent from a Governmental Authority, instrument, contract
(including the Assumed Contracts), lease, or other agreement or arrangement or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, to the
extent that such assignment or transfer or an attempt to make such an assignment
or transfer cannot be made pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
without the consent or approval of a third party. In the event any such consent
or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, in
any lawful arrangement, provide Buyer with the benefits under any such Consent,
instrument, contract, lease or other agreement or arrangement, PROVIDED that
Buyer shall undertake to pay, perform, discharge or satisfy the corresponding
liabilities and obligations for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent
Buyer would have been responsible therefor if such consent or approval had been
obtained.

         Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer
contemporaneously herewith (the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), of which the Schedules
referred to below are a part, and in the documents and other materials

be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to all other sections of this
Agreement), and subject to the limitations contained in Section 14.1, as of the
date of this Agreement, Seller makes to Buyer the following representations and
warranties.

         4.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING, ETC. OF SELLER. AWS is a corporation duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction where it is
organized and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on the
Business as currently conducted and to own or lease and to operate the
properties of the Business. AWS is in good standing and is qualified to do
business in each state of the United States in which the Business is conducted
that requires such qualification and where the failure to so qualify would have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. For the purposes of the Transaction
Documents, a "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE Business" means any material
adverse change in, or material adverse effect on, the assets, liabilities,
business or operations of the Transferred Assets or the Business taken as a
whole. Seller is currently a debtor-in-possession in the Bankruptcy Case
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, and retains full authority and power to operate
its business and affairs pursuant to Sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy
Code, with no trustee, examiner, facilitator or other officer or agent with
similar authority or powers to a trustee, examiner or facilitator having been
appointed in such Bankruptcy Case.

         4.2 CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy
Court, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other

Bankruptcy Court, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer of Seller.

approvals or authorizations of, or registrations or declarations with, any
Governmental Authority are required to be obtained or made by Seller in
connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, other than (a) bankruptcy court approval, and
(b) other consents, licenses, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
declarations, where the failure to obtain such would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Business.

twelve month period ending December 31, 2001; b) 2002 monthly income statement

financial condition or prospects of the Business which result in the failure to
satisfy a closing condition of Buyer pursuant to Article 11 of this Agreement

         4.7 TITLE TO TRANSFERRED ASSETS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.7,
and except for real and personal property subject to leases, Seller has good,
transferable and marketable title to or other valid ownership rights in the
Transferred Assets. This Section 4.7 does not apply to the Transferred
Intellectual Property.

             (a) Seller owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses the right to

necessary for the conduct of the Business substantially as currently conducted.
Seller has all licenses, permits and other authorizations from Governmental

with the terms, provisions and conditions thereof, except where the failure to
be so in compliance could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material

orders or judicial or administrative actions, investigations or proceedings
adversely affecting any of said Permits, and (d) to Seller's Knowledge, no
condition exists and no event has occurred which (whether with or without
notice, lapse of time or the occurrence of any other event) would permit the
suspension or revocation of any material Permits other than by expiration of the
term set forth therein. Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect
to the transferability of the Permits to Buyer.

         4.11 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.11,
the conduct of the Business complies in all material respects with all
Environmental Laws, except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably

employee pension benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "PENSION

any Welfare Plan that provides benefits to employees after termination of
employment other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

         4.13 BROKERS. With the exception of fees and expenses payable to
Conway, Del Genio, Gries & Co., LLC, which shall be paid by AWS, all
negotiations relating to this Agreement, and the Contemplated Transactions, have
been carried on without the participation of any Person acting on behalf of
Seller or its Affiliates in such manner as to give rise to any valid claim
against Buyer for any brokerage or finder's commission, fee or similar
compensation upon consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

         4.14 TAXES. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.14, with respect to
Taxes:

             (a) Seller has properly completed and filed or caused to be filed

prescribed by law, including extensions, all Tax Returns with respect to the
Transferred Assets that are or were required to be filed under federal, state,

failure to file such Tax Returns would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business.

             (b) Seller has, within the time and in the manner prescribed by
law, paid or caused to be paid (and until the Closing will, within the time and
in the manner prescribed by law, pay or cause to be paid) all Taxes that are
shown to be due and payable on Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing. The
Business has paid or, in the case of Taxes not due or being contested in good
faith, has made adequate provisions for the payment of all Taxes for which the
Business is or may reasonably become liable for payment.

Data and the Tax Documentation must be retained pursuant to this Section 9.9,
then any such material may be destroyed. Seller shall give Buyer not less than
thirty (30) day's prior written notice before Tax Data or Tax Documentation, in
the possession or control of any member of the consolidated group of which AAPC
is the common parent, is destroyed and shall give Buyer an opportunity to copy

herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be under any restrictions with respect
to disclosures to the Committee, the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Case or
any prospective purchaser of the Business (and their respective agents and
representatives) (provided that any such prospective purchaser enters into a
confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to the Prior

Agreement with the Bankruptcy Court in furtherance of obtaining the Sale Order
or other appropriate relief from the Bankruptcy Court.

party will immediately return or destroy all such confidential information and
any and all copies thereof, however stored, and, if requested by the other
party, shall certify conformity with this Section 9.9(b) in writing.

             (c) The provisions of this Article 9.10 are in addition to, and not

Contemplated Transactions (a "QUALIFIED BIDDER") stating that (A) such Qualified
Bidder offers to purchase the Transferred Assets upon the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, together with all Schedules and Exhibits hereto
(the "DEFINITIVE SALE DOCUMENTATION"), marked to show those amendments and
modifications to the Definitive Sale Documentation, including, but not limited
to, price and the time of closing, that such Qualified Bidder proposes, (B) such
Qualified Bidder is prepared to enter into and consummate the Contemplated
Transactions within not more than eleven (11) days after approval by the
Bankruptcy Court of a sale order, subject to receipt of any Consents of
Governmental Authorities (which must be obtained within sixty (60) days of the
approval by the Bankruptcy Court of a sale order), and (C) such Qualified
Bidder's offer is irrevocable until the closing of a purchase of the Transferred
Assets.

             (b) QUALIFIED BID. Only Qualified Bids will qualify for
consideration at the Auction. For purposes of this Agreement, a "QUALIFIED BID"
is a Bid that:

                          (i) complies in all respects with Section 10.2(a);

                          (ii) has a cash component of at least an amount
             sufficient to pay a Break-Up Fee to Buyer in accordance with
             Section 10.2(d) and provides for payment, in full, of such Break-Up
             Fee directly to Buyer at closing;

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

                          (iii) is a proposal that Seller determines, in the
             good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of Seller after
             consultation with the independent financial advisor of Seller and
             the Committee, is under all circumstances, on balance, a higher and
             better Bid and has a value greater than or equal to the sum of (x)
             the value, as reasonably determined by the independent financial
             advisor of Seller, of Buyer's offer plus (y) the amount of the
             Break-Up Fee payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 10.2(d) plus (z)
             $200,000 over the preceding Qualified Bid;

                          (iv) is substantially on the same or better terms and
             conditions as those set forth in the Definitive Sale Documentation;

                          (v) is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
             committed financing or other ability to perform; and

                          (vi) is accompanied by a deposit (by means of a
             certified bank check from a U.S. bank or by wire transfer) equal to
             or greater than the Break-Up Fee payable to Buyer pursuant to
             Section 10.2(d). Such deposit shall either be returned to the
             Qualified Bidder in the event the Qualified Bidder's Bid is not
             determined to be the best Qualified Bid, or retained by Seller at
             the Closing and applied toward the Purchase Price.

             If Seller does not receive any Qualified Bids, no Auction will be
conducted, Seller will report the same to the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed
with a sale and assignment of the Transferred Assets to Buyer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. This Agreement executed by Buyer shall constitute a
Qualified Bid for all purposes.

             (c) AUCTION, BIDDING INCREMENTS, AND BIDS REMAINING OPEN.

                          (i) If Seller receives a Qualified Bid, Seller will
             conduct an auction (the "AUCTION") at the location designated by
             Seller at least 3 business days prior to the Auction, on the date
             that is one (1) business day prior to the date scheduled by the
             Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, beginning at 11:00 a.m.,
             prevailing Eastern time, or such later time or other place as
             Seller shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted
             Qualified Bids. Only Buyer, Seller, representatives of the
             Committee, and a representative from the U.S. Trustee's office (via
             telephone conference) and any Qualified Bidders who have timely
             submitted Qualified Bids and their respective counsel shall be
             entitled to attend the Auction, and only Buyer and Qualified
             Bidders will be entitled to make any subsequent Qualified Bids at
             the Auction. The opening bid, which does not need to be
             re-submitted at the Auction, is the highest Qualified Bid submitted
             before the Auction by a Qualified Bidder (the "OPENING BID"), which
             must include (A) the Break-up Fee and (B) an incremental increase
             in the Purchase Price of not less than $200,000 (the "OVERBID
             INCREMENT"). Bidding at the Auction will continue until such time
             as the highest and best Qualified Bid is determined. Seller may
             announce at or prior to the Auction additional procedural rules
             that are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., the amount of
             time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for conducting the
             Auction so long as such rules are not inconsistent with these
             Bidding Procedures.



                                      -27-
<PAGE>

                          (ii) After the Opening bid, all subsequent bids must
             exceed the previous bid by not less than the Overbid Increment. Any
             bid by Buyer over the Opening Bid must be in an amount not less
             than the last bid plus the Overbid Increment (giving Buyer non-cash
             credit for the Break-Up Fee). For the duration of the Auction, all
             bids by either a Qualified Bidder or Buyer include the Break-Up
             Fee. If Buyer is the successful bidder at the close of the Auction,
             Buyer's winning bid will be reduced by the Break-Up Fee.

                          (iii) At least one (1) business day prior to the
             Auction, Seller will give Buyer and all other Qualified Bidders a
             copy of the highest and best Qualified Bid received and copies of
             all other Qualified Bids. In addition, Seller will inform Buyer and
             each Qualified Bidder who has expressed its intention to
             participate in the Auction of the identity of all Qualified Bidders
             that may participate in the Auction.

             (d) BREAK-UP FEE.

                          (i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either
             Section 13.1(c)(i) because any condition in Section 11.1, 11.2,
             11.4, 11.7, 11.8 or 11.9 is not satisfied , or Section 13.1(d) then
             Seller shall be obligated to pay to Buyer, a break-up fee (a
             "BREAK-UP FEE") of $250,000, in order to reimburse Buyer for its
             reasonable out-of pocket expenses in connection with due diligence
             and the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement (including,
             but not limited to, the expense of accountants, consultants, and
             other experts, and the obtaining of related financing), and the
             value added by Buyer (A) in establishing a bid standard or minimum
             for other bidders, (B) in placing Seller's estate property in a
             sales configuration mode attracting other bidders to the Auction
             and (C) for serving, by its name and expressed interest, as a
             catalyst for other potential or actual bidders.

                          (ii) If a Break-Up Fee is owed pursuant to the
             provisions of this Section 10.2(d), it shall be allowed and paid as
             an administrative expense of Seller under Section 503(b)(1) of the
             Bankruptcy Code upon the termination of this Agreement.
