to the Development Management Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of August 14,
1998, by and between San Elijo Hills Development Company, LLC, a Delaware

have the meanings given to such terms in the Agreement.

                  WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, the Development Manager is
entitled to receive from Owner a Project Management Fee, a Field Overhead Fee, a

capital stock of CDS Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which is the
indirect parent of the Owner; and

                  WHEREAS, Owner and Development Manager (the "Parties") wish to
amend the Agreement to terminate the Success Fee as of the date of the

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and
the mutual promises and obligations contained herein, the Parties hereto hereby
agree as follows, to become effective as of October 21, 2002:

                 1.(a) The  definition  of "Project  Costs" in Article I of the
Agreement  is hereby  amended by deleting  the phrase "the Success Fee" from the
second sentence thereof.

                   (b) Article I of the Agreement is hereby  amended by deleting
the definition of "Success Fee" in its entirety.

                   (c) Article IV,  Section  4.2, is hereby  amended by deleting
the words "and the Success Fee" from the second sentence thereof.

                   (d) Article  VII,  Section  7.1,  is hereby  amended  in its
entirety to read as follows:

               7.1 Fees to Development Manager. In consideration of its services
hereunder,  Development  Manager  shall be entitled to payment from Owner of the
Project Management Fee, the Field Overhead Fee and the Marketing and Advertising

                  (e)  Article VII is hereby  amended by deleting Section 7.6 in
its entirety.

                  (f)  Article  IX,  Section  9.2.2,  is hereby  amended  in its
entirety to read as follows:

            9.2.2  The accrued  but  unpaid   portion  of  the   Development
Management  Fee. The accrued  Development  Management Fee shall only include the
fee for sales to Buyers that have  already  closed  escrow or that are in escrow
for sale on the  Termination  Date and  actually  close  pursuant to such escrow
within 120 days after the Termination  Date. Within one hundred fifty (150) days
after  the  Termination  Date,  Owner  shall  pay  to  Development  Manager  any
Development Management Fee payable to Development Manager or Development Manager
shall pay to Owner any  overpayment in the  Development  Management  Fee. To the
extent that any advances of the  Development  Management Fee paid to Development
Manager  pursuant to Section  7.5 exceed the amount of the  accrued  Development
Management  Fee  as of  the  Termination  Date  as  provided  in  this  Section,
Development  Manager will repay to Owner such excess amount of the advances upon
termination of this Agreement.

               2. All other terms and  conditions of the Agreement  shall remain
