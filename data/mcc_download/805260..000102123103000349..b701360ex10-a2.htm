<p align="center"></b></font><font size="2" face="serif"><b>BG Group to sell 50%
  of its North Caspian interest for <br>
  $615 million.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif"> BG Group ("BG") announced today that it has agreed to sell half of its interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) &#150; which includes the Kashagan oil development &#150; to CNOOC North Caspian Sea Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Ltd of China), for a cash consideration of $615 million, payable at completion. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Under the agreement, CNOOC Ltd will
  acquire a one twelfth (8.33%) interest in the PSA. Following the sale, BG will
  retain a one twelfth (8.33%) interest. Completion of the transaction is subject
  to a number of conditions, including approval from the Kazakhstan authorities
  and the existing PSA partners waiving pre-emption rights. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">The North Caspian Sea PSA includes the Kashagan oil field, the Kalamkas oil discovery and the Kairan, Aktote and Kashagan SW prospects, and is operated by ENI, which holds a 16.67% interest. The other partners are ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf, each with 16.67% interest, and ConocoPhillips and INPEX, each with 8.33%. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Speaking today, BG Chief Executive Frank Chapman said: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">"The agreement we have reached with CNOOC Ltd recognises the significant value that BG and its partners have created in the North Caspian. This disposal arises from BG's regular process of portfolio review, and the proceeds will be utilised to further our aims of growing the business and strengthening returns. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">"CNOOC will bring significant expertise to the North Caspian partnership, and we look forward to working with them in the future.  BG remains strongly committed to Kazakhstan &#150; one of the most important countries in our portfolio. In addition to our remaining interest in the North Caspian, we will continue to contribute through our  involvement in the giant gas condensate field at Karachaganak and in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium." </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2003, at which date the net asset value of the interest to be sold was GBP114 million. The sale is expected to complete during the course of 2003.  The North Caspian Sea PSA has yet to commence production, and therefore did not contribute to BG's 2001 or 2002 profits. </font></p>

  West-1 well, which was also successful. An appraisal programme comprising a
  3-D seismic survey over the whole of the Kashagan structure and five appraisal
  wells is well advanced. Two wells, KE-2 and KE-3, have been successfully completed,
