The Executive will be eligible to participate in the Company's 1998 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan ("the Share Option Scheme") in accordance with its rules from time to time ("the Rules"). Any participation will be
voluntary and will not constitute a contractual entitlement under this Agreement or give rise to any rights or remedies against the Company. By participating the Executive will be deemed irrevocably to have waived any such entitlement, rights or
remedies. In particular but without prejudice to the above, if the Executive's employment terminates for any reason and his options, rights or expectations (if any) under the Share Option Scheme lapse or are otherwise lost or altered pursuant to the
Rules, the Executive will not be entitled to damages for wrongful dismissal or breach of contract, compensation for unfair dismissal or otherwise to any sum or other benefits to compensate him in respect of any loss under the Share Option Scheme that
he may suffer as a result.</FONT></TD>
