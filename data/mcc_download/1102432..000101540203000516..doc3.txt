     Note  1:  An  individual in not a close personal friend solely because
     the  individual  is  a  member  of the same organization, associate or
     religious  group.

     A  casual  business  associate or a person introduced or solicited for
     the  purpose  of  purchasing  securities  is  not  a  close  business
     associate.

     An  individual  is  not  a  close  personal  friend  or close business
     associate  solely because the individual is a client or former client.

The relationship between the purchaser and the director, senior officer or
control person must be direct.  For example, a close personal friend of a close
personal friend does not qualify for this category. Nor does a close business
associate of a close business associate qualify for this category.
