(A)     Right  to Convert.  The Borrower may elect from time to time, subject to
        -----------------
the  provisions  of Section 2.3 and this Section 2.9, to convert all or any part
                    -----------          -----------
of  a  Loan of any Type into any other Type or Types of Loans; provided that any
                                                               --------
conversion  of  any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made on, and only on, the last
day  of  the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto.
(B)     Automatic  Conversion  and  Continuation.  Floating  Rate  Loans  shall
        ----------------------------------------
continue  as  Floating  Rate Loans unless and until such Floating Rate Loans are
repaid  or  converted  into  Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
continue  as Eurodollar Rate Loans until the end of the then applicable Interest
Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically
converted  into  Floating  Rate Loans unless the Borrower shall have repaid such
Loans  or  given  the  Administrative  Agent  a  Borrowing/Election  Notice  in
accordance  with  Section  2.9(D)  requesting  that, at the end of such Interest
                  ---------------
Period,  such  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  continue  as  a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan.
(C)     No  Conversion  Post-Default.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
        ----------------------------
contained  in Section 2.9(A) or Section 2.9(B), no Loan may be converted into or
              --------------    --------------
continued  as  a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan (except with the consent of the Required
Lenders)  when  any  Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing.
(D)     Borrowing/Election  Notice.  The  Borrower shall give the Administrative
        --------------------------
Agent  an irrevocable Borrowing/Election Notice of each conversion of a Floating
Rate  Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan or continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
not  later  than  11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) three (3) Business Days prior to the
date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:  (i) the requested
date  (which  shall  be a Business Day) of such conversion or continuation; (ii)
the  amount  and  Type  of  the Loan to be converted or continued; and (iii) the
amount  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan(s) into which such Loan is to be converted or
continued,  and  the  duration  of  the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto.
(E)     Interest  Periods.  The  Borrower shall select Interest Periods so that,
        -----------------
to  the best of the Borrower's knowledge, it will not be necessary to prepay all
or  any  portion  of  any  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  prior  to the last day of the
applicable  Interest  Period  in order to make mandatory prepayments as required
pursuant to the terms hereof.  Each Floating Rate Loan and all Obligations other
than  Loans and the Facility Fee shall bear interest from and including the date
of  the  making  of  such Loan, in the case of Floating Rate Loans, and the date
such  Obligation is due and owing in the case of such other Obligations, to (but
not  including)  the  date  of  repayment  thereof  at  the Alternate Base Rate,
changing  when  and as such Alternate Base Rate changes.  Changes in the rate of
interest  on  that  portion  of the Loans maintained as Floating Rate Loans will
take  effect  simultaneously  with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest from and including the first day of the
Interest  Period  applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Eurodollar
Rate  Loan,  changing  when  and  as  the  Applicable Margin changes or when the
Supplemental  Margin  is  in  effect.  Changes  in  the rate of interest on that
portion  of  the  Loans  maintained  as  Eurodollar  Rate Loans will take effect
simultaneously  with  each change in the Applicable Margin or the implementation
of  the  Supplemental  Margin.
2.10     Default  Rate.  After  the  occurrence  and during the continuance of a
         -------------
Default,  the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may, at their option,
by  notice  to the Borrower declare that, (a) the interest rate(s) applicable to
the Obligations (other than Eurodollar Rate Loans and the Facility Fee) shall be
     equal  to  the Alternate Base Rate, changing as and when the Alternate Base
Rate  changes,  or,  for  Eurodollar Rate Loans the then highest Eurodollar Rate
(utilizing  the  highest Applicable Margin in effect from time to time), in each
case,  plus  two  percent (2.00%) per annum for all Loans and other Obligations,
       ----
and  (b)  the  Facility  Fee  shall  be  calculated using the highest Applicable
Facility  Fee  Percentage;  provided,  that  after the occurrence and during the
                            --------
continuance  of  a  Default under Sections 8.1(F), (G) or (I), the interest rate
                                  ---------------- ---    ---
described in clause (a) above and the Facility Fee described in clause (b) above
             ----------                                         ----------
shall  be  applicable  without  any  election  or  action  on  the  part  of the
Administrative  Agent  or  any  other  Lender.
2.11     Method  of  Payment.  All  payments  of  principal,  interest, fees and
         -------------------
commissions  hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim,
in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's  address  specified  pursuant  to  Article  XIV, or at any other Lending
                                           ------------
Installation  of  the  Administrative  Agent  specified  in  writing  by  the
Administrative  Agent  to  the Borrower, by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date
when  due and shall be made ratably among the Lenders (unless such amount is not
to  be  shared  ratably  in  accordance  with  the  terms hereof).  Each payment
delivered  to  the  Administrative  Agent for the account of any Lender shall be
delivered  promptly  by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type
of  funds  which  the  Administrative  Agent  received  at its address specified
pursuant  to  Article  XIV  or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice
              ------------
received  by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.  The Borrower authorizes
the  Administrative  Agent to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with
Bank  One  for  each  payment of principal, interest, fees and commissions as it
becomes  due  hereunder.
2.12     Evidence  of  Debt.
         ------------------
(a)     Each  Lender  shall  maintain  in  accordance with its usual practice an
account  or  accounts  (a  "LOAN  ACCOUNT")  evidencing  the indebtedness of the
                            -------------
Borrower  to  such  Lender owing to such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts  of  principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time  hereunder.
(b)     The  Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
                                                                         -------
13.3(C)  shall  include  a  control  account,  and a subsidiary account for each
-------
Lender,  in  which  accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and
-----
the  amount  of  each  Loan  made  hereunder,  the Type thereof and the Interest
--
Period, if any, applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
--
due  and  payable  or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder,  (iii)  the  effective  date  and amount of each Assignment Agreement
delivered  to  and  accepted  by  it and the parties thereto pursuant to Section
                                                                         -------

without  limitation,  all  fees,  charges,  expenses  and  interest.
(c)     The  entries  made  in  the  Loan  Account,  the  Register and the other
accounts  maintained pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
                                 ---------------    ---
conclusive  and  binding  for  all  purposes,  absent manifest error, unless the
Borrower  objects to information contained in the Loan Accounts, the Register or
the  other  accounts  within  thirty (30) days of the Borrower's receipt of such
information; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent
             --------
to  maintain  such  accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect
the  obligation  of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms
of  this  Agreement.
(d)     Any  Lender  may  request  that  the  Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to  such  Lender  a  promissory note for such Loans payable to the order of such
Lender  and  in  a  form  approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable
discretion  and  consistent  with  the terms of this Agreement.  Thereafter, the
Loans  evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including  after  assignment pursuant to Section 13.3) be represented by one or
                                          ------------
more  promissory  notes  in  such  form  payable to the order of the payee named
therein.
2.13     Telephonic  Notices.  The  Borrower  authorizes  the  Lenders  and  the
         -------------------
Administrative  Agent  to  extend,  convert  or  continue  the  Advance,  effect
selections  of  Types of Loans and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices
made  by  any  person  or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good
faith  believes  to be acting on behalf of the Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to
deliver  promptly  to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, signed by
an  Authorized  Officer, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative
Agent  or  any  Lender,  of each telephonic notice.  If the written confirmation
differs  in  any  material  respect  from the action taken by the Administrative
Agent  and  the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
with  respect  to such telephonic notice shall govern absent manifest error.  In
case  of  disagreement  concerning such notices, if the Administrative Agent has
recorded  telephonic  Borrowing/Election  Notices,  such recordings will be made
available  to  the  Borrower  upon  the  Borrower's  request  therefor.

such  Interest  Period.  Interest  accrued on the principal balance of all other
Obligations  shall  be  payable  in arrears (i) on the last day of each calendar
quarter,  commencing  on  the  first  such  day following the incurrence of such
Obligation,  (ii)  upon  repayment  thereof in full or in part, and (iii) if not
theretofore  paid  in  full,  at  the time such other Obligation becomes due and
payable  (whether  by  acceleration  or  otherwise).

Alternate  Base  Rate.
2.16     Lending  Installations.  Each  Lender may book its Loans at any Lending

Installation.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of Section 4.6, each Lender may, by
                                                -----------
written  or  facsimile  notice  to  the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower,
designate  a Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by it and for
whose  account  Loan  payments  are  to  be  made.
2.17     Non-Receipt  of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Borrower
         -------------------------------------------------
or  a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the
date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i)
in  the  case  of  a  Lender,  the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower,  a  payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent
for  the  account  of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment,
the  Administrative  Agent  may  assume  that  such  payment has been made.  The
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment  available  to  the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.
If  such  Lender  or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment  to  the  Administrative  Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount
so  made  available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during
the  period  commencing  on  the  date  such amount was so made available by the
Administrative  Agent  until  the  date  the  Administrative Agent recovers such
amount  at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal  Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in the case of payment by the
Borrower,  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  the  relevant  Loan.
2.18     Termination  Date.  This  Agreement  shall  be  effective  until  the
         -----------------
Termination  Date.  Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, until all
of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have been
fully  and indefeasibly paid and satisfied in cash (to the full extent that such
Obligations  are  payable  in  cash)  and  all  financing arrangements among the
Borrower  and  the  Lenders  shall  have  been terminated, all of the rights and
remedies  under  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan Documents shall survive.

         ---------------------------------
LENDER")  shall  have:  (i)  failed  to  fund  its Pro Rata Share of the Advance
requested  by  the  Borrower,  which  such Lender is obligated to fund under the
terms  of  this  Agreement  and which failure has not been cured, (ii) requested
compensation  from the Borrower under Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.5 to recover Taxes,
                                      ------------  ---    ---
Other  Taxes  or  other  additional  costs incurred by such Lender which are not
being incurred generally by the other Lenders, (iii) delivered a notice pursuant
to  Section  4.3  claiming  that such Lender is unable to extend Eurodollar Rate
    ------------
Loans  to the Borrower for reasons not generally applicable to the other Lenders
or  (iv)  has  invoked Section 10.2, then, in any such case, the Borrower or the
                       ------------
Administrative  Agent  may  make  written demand on such Affected Lender (with a
copy  to  the Administrative Agent in the case of a demand by the Borrower and a
copy  to  the  Borrower in the case of a demand by the Administrative Agent) for
the  Affected  Lender to assign, and such Affected Lender shall use commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  assign pursuant to one or more duly executed Assignment
Agreements  five (5) Business Days after the date of such demand, to one or more
financial institutions that comply with the provisions of Section 13.3 which the
                                                          ------------
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall have engaged for
such  purpose  ("REPLACEMENT  LENDER"), all of such Affected Lender's rights and
obligations  under  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan Documents (including,
without  limitation,  its  Commitment  and  all Loans owing to it) in accordance
with Section 13.3.  The Administrative Agent agrees, upon the occurrence of such
     ------------
events  with  respect  to an Affected Lender and upon the written request of the
Borrower,  to  use  its reasonable efforts to obtain the commitments from one or
more  financial institutions to act as a Replacement Lender.  The Administrative
Agent  is  authorized  to  execute  one or more of such Assignment Agreements as
attorney-in-fact for any Affected Lender failing to execute and deliver the same
within  five  (5)  Business  Days  after the date of such demand.  Further, with
respect to such assignment the Affected Lender shall have concurrently received,
in cash, all amounts due and owing to the Affected Lender hereunder or under any
other  Loan  Document,  including, without limitation, the aggregate outstanding
principal  amount  of  the  Loans  owed  to  such  Lender, together with accrued
interest  thereon  through  the  date  of such assignment, amounts payable under
Sections  4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 with respect to such Affected Lender and compensation
    ---------  ---     ---
payable  under  Section  2.14(C) in the event of any replacement of any Affected
                ---------------
Lender  under  clause  (ii)  or clause (iii) of this Section 2.19; provided that
                                                     ------------
upon  such Affected Lender's replacement, such Affected Lender shall cease to be
a  party  hereto  but  shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
                                                                        --------
4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.5  and  10.7, as well as to any fees accrued for its account
      ---   ---   ---       ----
hereunder  and  not  yet  paid, and shall continue to be obligated under Section
                                                                         -------
11.8  with  respect  to  losses,  obligations,  liabilities, damages, penalties,
   -
actions, judgements, costs, expenses or disbursements for matters which occurred
   -
prior  to the date the Affected Lender is replaced.  Upon the replacement of any
Affected  Lender  pursuant  to  this Section 2.19, the provisions of Section 9.2
                                     ------------                    -----------
shall  continue  to  apply with respect to Loans which are then outstanding with
respect to which the Affected Lender failed to fund its Pro Rata Share and which
failure  has  not  been  cured.
ARTICLE  III:     [RESERVED]
                  ==========
ARTICLE  IV:     YIELD  PROTECTION;  TAXES
4.1     Yield  Protection.  If,  on  or  after  the  date of this Agreement, the
        -----------------
adoption  of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy,  guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change  in  the  interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
     interpretation  or  administration  thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable  Lending  Installation  with any request or directive (whether or not
having  the  force  of  law)  of  any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:
(i)     subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any Taxes,
     or  changes  the  basis of taxation of payments (other than with respect to
Excluded  Taxes)  to  any  Lender  in  respect  of  its  Loans,  or
(ii)     imposes  or  increases  or  deems  applicable  any reserve, assessment,
insurance  charge,  special  deposit  or  similar requirement against assets of,
deposits  with  or  for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
applicable  Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
account  in  determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans),
or
(iii)     imposes  any  other  condition  the result of which is to increase the
cost  to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or
maintaining  its  Loans  or  reduces  any amount receivable by any Lender or any
applicable  Lending  Installation  in connection with its Loans, or requires any
Lender  or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by
reference  to  the amount of Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount
deemed  material  by  such  Lender,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Loans or Commitment
or  to  reduce  the  return  received  by  such  Lender  or  applicable  Lending
Installation  in  connection with such Loans or Commitment, then, within fifteen
(15)  days  of  demand  by  such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional  amount  or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost  or  reduction  in  amount  received.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, if any Lender
                                                      -----------
fails  to  notify  the  Borrower of any event or circumstance which will entitle
such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.1 within ninety (90) days
                                             -----------
after  such  Lender  obtains  knowledge of such event or circumstance, then such
Lender  shall  not  be entitled to compensation from the Borrower for any amount
arising  prior  to  the  date which is ninety (90) days before the date on which
such  Lender  notifies  the  Borrower  of  such  event  or  circumstance.
4.2     Changes  in  Capital  Adequacy  Regulations.  If a Lender determines the
        -------------------------------------------
amount  of  capital  required  or  expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending  Installation  of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is  increased  as a result of a Change, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand
by  such  Lender,  the  Borrower  shall  pay such Lender the amount necessary to
compensate  for  any  shortfall  in  the  rate  of return on the portion of such
increased  capital  which  such  Lender reasonably determines is attributable to
this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment hereunder (after taking into account

(i)  any  change  after  the  date  of  this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines  or  (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental  rule,  regulation,  policy,  guideline,  interpretation,  or
directive  (whether  or  not  having  the  force  of law) after the date of this
Agreement  which  affects  the  amount  of  capital  required  or expected to be
maintained  by  any  Lender  or  any  Lending  Installation  or  any corporation
controlling  any  Lender.  "RISK-BASED  CAPITAL  GUIDELINES"  means  (i)  the

implementing  the  July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation
and  Supervisory  Practices  Entitled  "International  Convergence  of  Capital

amendments  to  such  regulations  adopted  prior to the date of this Agreement.
4.3     Availability  of  Types  of  Loans.  If  any  Lender  determines  that
        ----------------------------------
maintenance  of  its  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
        -
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having  the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits
of  a  type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Rate Loans are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans, then
the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Rate Loans
and  require  any  affected  Eurodollar  Rate Loans to be repaid or converted to
Floating  Rate  Loans,  subject  to  the  payment of any funding indemnification
amounts  required  by  Section  4.4.
                       ------------
4.4     Funding  Indemnification.  If  any  payment  of  a  Eurodollar Rate Loan
        ------------------------
occurs  on  a  date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether  because  of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Rate
Loan is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than
default  by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or
cost  incurred  by it resulting therefrom (excluding loss of margin), including,
without  limitation,  any  loss  or  cost  in  liquidating or employing deposits
acquired  to  fund  or  maintain  such  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan.
4.5     Taxes.
        -----
(i)     All  payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be
     made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes.  If the
Borrower  shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum  payable  hereunder  to  any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum
payable  shall  be  increased  as  necessary  so  that after making all required
deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to additional sums payable under
this  Section  4.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
      ------------
receives  an  amount  equal  to  the  sum  it  would  have  received had no such
deductions  been  made,  (b)  the  Borrower  shall make such deductions, (c) the
Borrower  shall  pay  the  full  amount  deducted  to  the relevant authority in
accordance  with  applicable  law  and  (d)  the  Borrower  shall furnish to the
Administrative  Agent  the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof
within  thirty  (30)  days  after  such  payment  is  made.  Such  Lender or the
Administrative  Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly reimburse the Borrower
for such payments to the extent such Lender or the Administrative Agent receives
actual  knowledge  that  it  has  received  any  tax  credit or other benefit in
connection with such tax payments and that such tax credit or benefit is clearly
attributable  to  this  Agreement.
(ii)     In  addition,  the  Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or future
stamp  or  documentary  taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar  levies  which  arise  from  any  payment  made  hereunder  or under any
promissory  note  issued  hereunder  or  from  the  execution or delivery of, or
otherwise  with  respect  to,  this  Agreement  or  any  promissory  note issued
hereunder  ("OTHER  TAXES").
(iii)     The  Borrower  hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each  Lender  for  the  full  amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation,  any  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes  imposed on amounts payable under this
Section  4.5)  paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any liability
     -------
(including  penalties,  interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto.  Payments  due  under  this indemnification shall be made within thirty
(30)  days  of  the  date  the  Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor  pursuant  to  Section  4.6.
                        ------------
(iv)     Each  Lender  that  is  not  incorporated  under the laws of the United
States  of  America or a state thereof (each a "NON-U.S. LENDER") agrees that it
will,  not  less  than  ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
deliver  to  each  of  the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a United States
Internal  Revenue  Form  W-8  or  W-9,  as  the  case may be, and deliver to the
Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Forms  W-8BEN  or  W-8ECI,  certifying  in either case that it is entitled to an
exemption  from  United  States  backup  withholding  tax.  Each Non-U.S. Lender
further  undertakes  to  deliver  to each of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent  (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on
or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered
by  it,  such  additional  forms  or  amendments  thereto  as  may be reasonably
requested  by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  All forms or amendments
described  in  the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United  States  federal  income  taxes,  unless  an  event  (including  without
limitation  any  change  in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date  on  which  any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such  forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing
and  delivering  any  such  form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender
advises  the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income  tax.
(v)     For  any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower  with  an  appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above (unless such
                                                 -----------
failure  is  due  to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  by  any  governmental  authority,
occurring  subsequent  to the date on which a form originally was required to be
provided),  such  Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this  Section  4.5  with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided
      ------------                                                      --------
that,  should  a  Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
reduced  rate  of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure
to  deliver  a  form  required under clause (iv), above, the Borrower shall take
                                     -----------
such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request (without cost to the
Borrower)  to  assist  such  Non-U.S.  Lender  to  recover  such  Taxes.
(vi)     Any  Lender  that  is  entitled  to  an  exemption from or reduction of
withholding  tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any promissory
note  issued  hereunder  pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any
treaty  shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
at  the  time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments
to  be  made  without  withholding  or  at  a  reduced  rate.
(vii)     If  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  or  any  other governmental
authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision
thereof  asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold
tax  from  amounts  paid  to  or  for  the  account  of  any Lender (because the
appropriate  form  was  not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender
failed  to  notify  the  Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which
rendered  its  exemption  from  withholding ineffective, or for any other reason
other  than  as  a  result  of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative  Agent),  such  Lender  shall  indemnify the Administrative Agent
fully  for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent
as  tax,  withholding  therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and  including  taxes  imposed  by  any  jurisdiction  on amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses
related  thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Administrative  Agent,  which  attorneys  may be employees of the Administrative
Agent).  The  obligations  of  the  Lenders  under  this  Section 4.5(vii) shall
                                                          ----------------
survive  the  payment  of  the  Obligations  and  termination of this Agreement.
4.6     Lender  Statements;  Survival  of  Indemnity.  To  the extent reasonably
        --------------------------------------------
possible,  each  Lender  shall  designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect  to its Eurodollar Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to
such  Lender  under  Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
                     ------------  ---     ---
Eurodollar  Rate Loans under Section 4.3, so long as such designation is not, in
                             -----------
the  reasonable  judgment  of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each
Lender  shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a
copy  to  the  Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section
                                                                         -------
4.1,  4.2,  4.4  or  4.5.  Such  written statement shall set forth in reasonable
  -   ---   ---      ---
detail  the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall
  -
be  final,  conclusive  and  binding  on the Borrower in the absence of manifest
error.  Determination  of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with
a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  shall  be calculated as though each Lender funded its
Eurodollar  Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity
corresponding  to  the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar
Rate  applicable  to  such  Loan,  whether  in fact that is the case or not, and
without  regard to loss of margin.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount
specified  in  the  written  statement  of any Lender shall be payable on demand
after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement.  The obligations of the
     Borrower  under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 shall survive payment of the
                     ------------  ---  ---     ---
Obligations  and  termination  of  this  Agreement.

Governmental  Authority  or  private  arbitrator  pending  or, to the Borrower's

            --------------
contingency  was  incurred.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is

restraining  order  or  order  of  any nature, decree, rule or regulation of any
court  or Governmental Authority which will have or could reasonably be expected

6.8     Subsidiaries.  Schedule 6.8 to this Agreement (i) contains a description
        ------------   ------------
of the corporate structure of the Borrower its Subsidiaries and any other Person
in  which  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries holds a material Equity
Interest  after  giving effect to the Designated Acquisition and (ii) accurately
sets forth (A) the correct legal name, the jurisdiction of incorporation and the
jurisdictions  in  which  each  of  the  Borrower  and  the  direct and indirect
Subsidiaries  of  the  Borrower  are qualified to transact business as a foreign
corporation,  (B) the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of each class of
Capital  Stock  of  the  Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries and the owners of
such  shares (both as of the consummation of the Designated Acquisition and on a
fully-diluted  basis), and (C) a summary of the direct and indirect partnership,
joint  venture,  or  other  Equity  Interests,  if any, of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary  of  the Borrower in any Person that is not a corporation.  After the
formation  or  acquisition of any New Subsidiary permitted under Section 7.3(F),
                                                                 --------------
if  requested  by  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Borrower  shall  provide  a
supplement to Schedule 6.8 to this Agreement reflecting the addition of such New
              ------------
Subsidiary.  Except  as  disclosed  on  Schedule  6.8,  none  of  the issued and
                                        -------------
outstanding  Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries
is subject to any vesting, redemption, or repurchase agreement, and there are no
warrants  or  options  outstanding  with  respect  to  such  Capital Stock.  The
outstanding  Capital  Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
authorized,  validly  issued,  fully paid and nonassessable and the stock of the
Borrower's  Subsidiaries  is  not  Margin  Stock.
6.9     ERISA.  No  Benefit  Plan  has incurred any material accumulated funding
        -----
deficiency  (as  defined  in Sections 302(a)(2) of ERISA and 412(a) of the Code)
whether  or  not  waived.  Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled
Group  has incurred any material liability to the PBGC which remains outstanding
other than the payment of premiums.  As of the last day of the most recent prior
plan  year,  the  market value of assets under each Benefit Plan, other than any
Multiemployer  Plan, was not by a material amount less than the present value of
benefit  liabilities  thereunder  (determined  in  accordance with the actuarial
valuation  assumptions  described therein).  Neither the Borrower nor any member
of  the  Controlled  Group  has  (i)  failed  to make a required contribution or
payment to a Multiemployer Plan of a material amount or (ii) incurred a material
complete  or partial withdrawal under Section 4203 or Section 4205 of ERISA from
a  Multiemployer  Plan.  Neither  the  Borrower nor any member of the Controlled
Group  has  failed  to  make  an  installment or any other payment of a material
amount required under Section 412 of the Code on or before the due date for such
installment  or  other  payment.  Each  Plan,  Foreign Employee Benefit Plan and
Non-ERISA  Commitment  complies  in  all material respects in form, and has been
administered  in  all  material  respects  in  accordance with its terms and, in
accordance  with  all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited
to  ERISA  and  the  Code.  There  have  been  no  and  there  is  no prohibited
transaction  described in Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code with respect
to  any  Plan  for  which a statutory or administrative exemption does not exist
which  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  subject  the  Borrower  or any of is
Subsidiaries  to material liability.  Neither the Borrower nor any member of the
Controlled  Group  has taken or failed to take any action which would constitute
or  result  in a Termination Event, which action or inaction could reasonably be
expected  to  subject  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries to material
liability.  Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  member  of the Controlled Group is
subject to any material liability under, or has any potential material liability
under, Section 4063, 4064, 4069, 4204 or 4212(c) of ERISA.  The present value of
the  aggregate  liabilities  to  provide  all  of the accrued benefits under any
Foreign  Pension  Plan do not exceed the current fair market value of the assets
held in trust or other funding vehicle for such plan by a material amount.  With
respect  to any Foreign Employee Benefit Plan other than a Foreign Pension Plan,
reasonable  reserves  have  been established in accordance with prudent business
practice  or where required by ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction
in  which such plan is maintained.  For purposes of this Section 6.9, "material"
                                                         -----------
means  any  amount,  noncompliance  or  other  basis  for  liability which could
reasonably  be  expected  to  subject the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to
liability,  individually or in the aggregate with each other basis for liability
under  this  Section  6.9,  in  excess  of  $25,000,000.

reasonably  be  expected  to  have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect.
6.13     Compliance  with  Laws.  The  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  are  in
         -----------------------
compliance  with all Requirements of Law applicable to them and their respective

regulation  which  limits  its  ability  to incur indebtedness or its ability to
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.
6.16     Insurance.  The  insurance policies and programs in effect with respect

they  were  Floating  Rate  Loans;
(iv)     regardless  of  whether or not a Default has occurred or is continuing,
and  notwithstanding  the  instructions  of  the  Borrower  as  to  its  desired
application,  all  repayments  of  principal which, in accordance with the other
terms of this Agreement, would be applied to the outstanding Floating Rate Loans
shall  be applied first, ratably to all Floating Rate Loans constituting Non Pro
                  -----
Rata Loans, second, ratably to Floating Rate Loans other than those constituting
            ------
Non  Pro  Rata  Loans  or  Cure Loans and, third, ratably to Floating Rate Loans
                                           -----
constituting  Cure  Loans;
(v)     for  so  long  as and until the earlier of any such Lender's cure of the
failure  to  fund  its  Pro Rata Share of the Advance and the termination of the
Commitments,  the  term  "Required Lenders" for purposes of this Agreement shall
mean  Lenders  (excluding all Lenders whose failure to fund their respective Pro
Rata  Share  of  the  Advance  have  not  been  so  cured) whose Pro Rata Shares
represent  greater  than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Pro Rata Shares of
such  Lenders;  and
(vi)     for so long as and until any such Lender's failure to fund its Pro Rata
Share  of  the  Advance is cured in accordance with Section 9.2(ii), such Lender
                                                    ---------------
shall not be entitled to any Facility Fees with respect to its Commitment, which
Facility  Fees  shall  accrue  in  favor  of the Lenders which have funded their
respective  Pro  Rata  Share  of  the  Advance,  shall  be  allocated among such
performing  Lenders  ratably based upon their relative Commitments or Loans, and
shall  be  calculated  based  upon  the  average  amount  by which the aggregate
Commitments  of such performing Lenders exceeds the outstanding principal amount
of  the  Loans  owing  to  such  performing  Lenders.
9.3     Amendments.  Subject  to the provisions of this Article IX, the Required
        ----------                                      ----------
Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
     Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for
the  purpose  of  adding  or  modifying  any provisions to the Loan Documents or
changing  in  any  manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or
waiving  any  Default  hereunder;  provided,  however, that no such supplemental
                                   --------   -------
agreement  shall,  without the consent of each Lender (which is not a defaulting
Lender  under  the  provisions  of  Section  9.2)  affected  thereby:
                                    ------------
(i)     Postpone  or extend the Termination Date or any other date fixed for any
payment  of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts
payable  to such Lender (other than any modifications of the provisions relating
to  amounts,  timing  or  application  of  prepayments  of  the  Loans and other
Obligations, which modifications shall require the approval only of the Required
     Lenders).
(ii)     Reduce  the principal amount of any Loans, or reduce the rate or extend
the  time of payment of interest or fees thereon (other than (a) a waiver of the
application  of the default rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof and
                                                         ------------
(b)  as  a  result of a change (x) in the definition of Leverage Ratio or any of
the  components thereof or the method of calculation thereof as set forth herein
or (y) in the definition of "Leverage Ratio" or any of the components thereof or
the  method  of  calculation  thereof as set forth in the Existing 5-Year Credit
Agreement).
(iii)     Reduce  the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders
or  any other percentage of Lenders specified to be the applicable percentage in
this Agreement to act on specified matters or amend the definitions of "Required
Lenders"  or  "Pro  Rata  Share".
(iv)     Increase  the  amount  of  the  Commitment  of such Lender hereunder or
increase  such  Lender's  Pro  Rata  Share.
(v)     Permit  the  Borrower  to  assign  its  rights  under  this  Agreement.
(vi)     other  than  pursuant  to  a transaction permitted by the terms of this
Agreement,  release  any  guarantor  from  its  obligations under the Subsidiary
Guaranty.
(vii)     Amend  this  Section  9.3.
                       ------------
No  amendment  of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative
Agent  shall  be  effective  without  the  written consent of the Administrative
Agent.  The  Administrative  Agent  may  waive payment of the fee required under
Section  13.3(B)  without  obtaining  the  consent  of  any  of  the  Lenders.
   -------------
9.4     Preservation  of  Rights.  No  delay  or  omission of the Lenders or the
        ------------------------
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
     such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein,  and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or
the  inability  of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan
shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise
of  any  such  right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise  of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the
terms,  conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid
unless  in  writing  signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 9.3, and
                                                                -----------
then  only  to  the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies
contained  in  the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall  be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until all of the
Obligations  (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have been fully
and indefeasibly paid and satisfied in cash and all financing arrangements among
the  Borrower  and  the  Lenders  shall  have  been  terminated.
ARTICLE  X:     GENERAL  PROVISIONS
                -------------------
10.1     Survival of Representations.  All representations and warranties of the
         ---------------------------
     Borrower  contained  in  this  Agreement  shall  survive  delivery  of this
Agreement  and  the  making  of  the  Loans  herein  contemplated.
10.2     Governmental  Regulation.  Anything  contained in this Agreement to the
         ------------------------
contrary  notwithstanding,  no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the
Borrower  in  violation  of  any  limitation  or  prohibition  provided  by  any
applicable  statute  or  regulation.
10.3     Performance  of  Obligations.  The  Borrower  agrees  that  after  the
         ----------------------------
occurrence  and  during  the  continuance of a Default, the Administrative Agent
may,  but  shall  have  no  obligation  to,  make any payment or perform any act
required  of  the  Borrower  under  any  Loan  Document  to  the  extent  the
Administrative Agent determines that such action shall be necessary or advisable
in  order  to  protect  or  preserve  the  rights of the Lenders hereunder.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall  use  its  reasonable  efforts to give the Borrower
notice  of  any action taken under this Section 10.3 prior to the taking of such
                                        ------------
action or promptly thereafter provided the failure to give such notice shall not
affect  the  Borrower's  obligations in respect thereof.  The Borrower agrees to
pay  the  Administrative  Agent,  upon demand, the principal amount of all funds
advanced  by  the  Administrative  Agent  under this Section 10.3, together with
                                                     ------------
interest thereon at the rate from time to time applicable to Floating Rate Loans
from the date of such advance until the outstanding principal balance thereof is
paid  in  full.  If  the  Borrower  fails to make payment in respect of any such
advance  under  this Section 10.3 within one (1) Business Day after the date the
                     ------------
Borrower  receives  written  demand  therefor from the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly notify each Lender and each Lender agrees
that  it  shall thereupon make available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars
in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of  such  advance.  If  such  funds are not made available to the Administrative
Agent  by  such  Lender  within  one  (1)  Business Day after the Administrative
Agent's  demand  therefor,  the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover
any  such  amount from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal
Funds  Effective  Rate  for each day during the period commencing on the date of
such  demand and ending on the date such amount is received.  The failure of any
Lender  to  make available to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
such  unreimbursed  advance  under  this  Section 10.3 shall neither relieve any
                                          ------------
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative
Agent  such  other  Lender's  Pro  Rata  Share  of such advance on the date such
payment  is  to  be made nor increase the obligation of any other Lender to make
such  payment  to  the  Administrative Agent.  All outstanding principal of, and
interest  on, advances made under this Section 10.3 shall constitute Obligations
                                       ------------
subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement until paid in full by the Borrower.
10.4     Headings.  Section  headings  in the Loan Documents are for convenience
         --------
of  reference  only,  and  shall  not  govern  the  interpretation of any of the
provisions  of  the  Loan  Documents.
10.5     Entire  Agreement.  The  Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
         -----------------
understanding  among  the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and
supersede  all  prior  agreements  and  understandings  among  the Borrower, the
Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders  relating to the subject matter thereof
except  as  specifically  set  forth  in  a side letter among the Administrative
Agent,  the  Syndication  Agent, the Arrangers and the Borrower, dated as of the
Closing  Date.
10.6     Several  Obligations;  Benefits  of  this  Agreement.  The  respective
         ----------------------------------------------------
obligations  of  the  Lenders  hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other Lender (except to the extent to which
the  Administrative  Agent  is  authorized  to act as such).  The failure of any
Lender  to  perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender  from  any  of  its  obligations  hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be
construed  so  as  to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the
parties  to  this  Agreement  and  their  respective  successors  and  assigns.
10.7     Expenses;  Indemnification.
         --------------------------
(A)     Expenses.  The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the
        --------
     Arrangers  for  any  reasonable  costs,  internal charges and out-of-pocket
expenses  (including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and time charges
of  attorneys  and  paralegals for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys and
paralegals may be employees of the Administrative Agent) paid or incurred by the
Administrative  Agent  or  the  Arrangers  in  connection  with the preparation,
negotiation,  execution,  delivery,  syndication, review, amendment modification
and,  after  the  occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of  a Default or an
Unmatured  Default,  administration  of  the  Loan Documents.  The Borrower also
agrees  to  reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers and the Lenders
for  any  reasonable  costs  and  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including reasonable
attorneys' and paralegals' fees and time charges of attorneys and paralegals for
the  Administrative Agent and the Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys and
paralegals  may be employees of the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers or the
Lenders)  paid  or  incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers or any
Lender  in  connection with the collection of the Obligations and enforcement of
the  Loan  Documents;  provided,  that  after  the  occurrence  and  during  the
                       --------
continuance  of  a  Default, the Borrower agrees to reimburse the Administrative
Agent,  the  Arrangers  and  the  Lenders  for  all such costs and out-of-pocket
expenses,  whether  or  not  reasonable.
(B)     Indemnity.  The  Borrower  further agrees to defend, protect, indemnify,
        ---------
and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent
and  each  and  all  of the Lenders and each of their respective Affiliates, and
each  of such Administrative Agent's, Syndication Agent's, Arranger's, Lender's,
or  Affiliate's  respective  officers, directors, trustees, investment advisors,
employees,  attorneys  and agents (including, without limitation, those retained
in  connection  with  the  satisfaction  or attempted satisfaction of any of the
conditions  set  forth  in Article V) (collectively, the "INDEMNITEES") from and
                           ---------
against  any  and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages, penalties,
actions,  judgments,  suits,  claims,  costs,  expenses  of  any  kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel
for  such  Indemnitees  in  connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a party
thereto),  imposed  on, incurred by, or asserted against such Indemnitees in any
manner  relating  to  or  arising  out  of:
(i)     this  Agreement,  the  other  Loan  Documents  or any of the Transaction
Documents,  or  any act, event or transaction related or attendant thereto or to
the  Transactions  and the making of the Loans hereunder, the management of such
Loans, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder, or any of
     the  other  transactions  contemplated  by  the  Transaction  Documents; or
(ii)     any  liabilities,  obligations,  responsibilities,  losses,  damages,
personal  injury,  death,  punitive  damages,  economic  damages,  consequential
damages, treble damages, intentional, willful or wanton injury, damage or threat
to  the  environment,  natural  resources or public health or welfare, costs and
expenses  (including,  without  limitation, attorney, expert and consulting fees
and  costs  of  investigation,  feasibility  or remedial action studies), fines,
penalties  and  monetary  sanctions,  interest,  direct  or  indirect,  known or
unknown,  absolute  or contingent, past, present or future relating to violation
of  any  Environmental,  Health or Safety Requirements of Law arising from or in
connection  with  the  past,  present  or future operations of the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries  or any of their respective predecessors in interest, or, the past,
present  or  future  environmental, health or safety condition of any respective
property  of  the  Borrower  or  its  Subsidiaries,  the  presence  of
asbestos-containing  materials at any respective property of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries  or  the  Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the
environment  (collectively,  the  "INDEMNIFIED  MATTERS");
provided,  however,  the  Borrower  shall  have  no  obligation to an Indemnitee
--------   -------
hereunder  with  respect  to Indemnified Matters caused by or resulting from the
------
willful  misconduct  or  gross negligence of such Indemnitee with respect to the
--
Loan  Documents,  as determined by the final non-appealed judgment of a court of
--
competent  jurisdiction.  If the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless
set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative
of  any  law or public policy, the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion
which  it  is  permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment
and  satisfaction  of  all  Indemnified  Matters  incurred  by  the Indemnitees.
     Each  Indemnitee, with respect to any action against it in respect of which
indemnity  may  be  sought  under this Section, shall give written notice of the
commencement  of such action to the Borrower within a reasonable time after such
Indemnitee  is  made a party to such action.  Upon receipt of any such notice by
the  Borrower, unless such Indemnitee shall be advised by its counsel that there
are  or  may  be  legal defenses available to such Indemnitee that are different
from,  in  addition  to,  or  in  conflict  with,  the defenses available to the
Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  the Borrower may participate with the
Indemnitee  in  the defense of such Indemnified Matter, including the employment
of  counsel  consented  to  by  such  Indemnitee  (which  consent  shall  not be
unreasonably withheld); provided, however, nothing provided herein shall entitle
                        --------  -------
(a)  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries to assume the defense of such
Indemnified  Matter or (b) any Indemnitee to effect any settlement in respect of
any  indemnified  matter  without the Borrower's consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably  withheld.
(C)     Waiver  of  Certain  Claims; Settlement of Claims.  The Borrower further
        -------------------------------------------------
agrees  to  assert  no  claim  against  any  of the Indemnitees on any theory of
liability  seeking  consequential,  special,  indirect,  exemplary  or  punitive
damages.  No  settlement  of any claim asserted against or likely to be asserted
against  an  Indemnitee  shall  be  entered  into  by the Borrower or any if its
Subsidiaries  with  respect  to  any  claim,  litigation,  arbitration  or other
proceeding  relating  to  or  arising  out of the transactions evidenced by this
Agreement,  the  other  Loan  Documents  or  in connection with the Transactions
(whether  or  not  the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Indemnitee is a
party  thereto) unless such settlement releases such Indemnitee from any and all
liability  with  respect  thereto.
(D)     Survival  of Agreements.  The obligations and agreements of the Borrower
        -----------------------
under  this  Section  10.7  shall  survive  the  termination  of this Agreement.
             -------------
10.8     Numbers  of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing documents, and
         ---------------------
requests  hereunder  shall  be  furnished  to  the  Administrative  Agent  with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each
     of  the  Lenders.
10.9     Accounting.  Except  as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting
         ----------
terms  used  herein  shall  be  interpreted  and  all  accounting determinations
hereunder  shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.  If
any  changes  in generally accepted accounting principles are hereafter required
or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with the
agreement  of  its  independent  certified  public  accountants and such changes
result  in  a  change  in  the  method  of  calculation  of any of the financial
covenants, tests, restrictions or standards herein or in the related definitions
or  terms  used therein ("ACCOUNTING CHANGES"), the parties hereto agree, at the
Borrower's request, to enter into negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend
such  provisions  in  a  credit  neutral  manner so as to reflect equitably such
changes  with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's
and  its  Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after such changes
as  if  such changes had not been made; provided, however, until such provisions
                                        --------  -------
are  amended in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
the  Required  Lenders,  no  Accounting  Change  shall  be  given effect in such
calculations  and  all financial statements and reports required to be delivered
hereunder  shall  be prepared in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles
without  taking  into  account  such  Accounting  Changes.  In  the  event  such
amendment  is  entered  into,  all  references  in  this  Agreement to Agreement
Accounting  Principles shall mean generally accepted accounting principles as of
the  date  of  such  amendment.
10.10     Severability  of  Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document that
          ----------------------------
is  held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as  to  that  jurisdiction,  be  inoperative,  unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting  the  remaining  provisions  in  that  jurisdiction  or the operation,
enforceability,  or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this  end  the  provisions  of  all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.
10.11     Nonliability  of  Lenders.  The  relationship between the Borrower and
          -------------------------
the  Lenders  and  the Administrative Agent shall be solely that of borrower and
lender.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor  any  Lender  shall  have  any
fiduciary  responsibilities  to  the Borrower.  Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform
the  Borrower  of  any  matter  in  connection  with any phase of the Borrower's
business  or  operations.

payments  in  the ordinary course with respect to such Intercompany Indebtedness
from each such Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent permitted by the terms of this
Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents.  Notwithstanding  any  right of the
Borrower  to  ask,  demand,  sue  for,  take  or  receive  any  payment from any
Subsidiary  Guarantor, all rights, liens and security interests of the Borrower,
whether  now  or  hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any
Subsidiary  Guarantor shall be and are subordinated to the rights of the holders
of  the  Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets.  The Borrower
shall  have  no  right  to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any
such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the
Obligations  (other  than  contingent  indemnity  obligations)  and  the Hedging
Obligations  under  Hedging  Agreements shall have been fully paid and satisfied
(in  cash)  and  all  financing  arrangements  pursuant  to any Loan Document or
Hedging  Agreement among the Borrower and the holders of the Obligations (or any
affiliate  thereof)  have  been terminated.  If all or any part of the assets of
any  Subsidiary  Guarantor,  or  the  proceeds  thereof,  are  subject  to  any
distribution,  division  or  application  to  the  creditors  of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by
reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the
benefit  of  creditors  or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of
any such Subsidiary Guarantor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets
of  any  such  Subsidiary  Guarantor are sold, then, and in any such event (such
events  being  herein  referred  to  as  an  "INSOLVENCY EVENT"), any payment or
distribution  of  any  kind  or  character,  either in cash, securities or other
property,  which  shall  be  payable  or deliverable upon or with respect to any
indebtedness  of  any  Subsidiary  Guarantor  to  the  Borrower  ("INTERCOMPANY
INDEBTEDNESS")  shall  be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent
for  application  on  any  of  the Obligations and Hedging Obligations under the
Hedging  Agreements,  due  or  to become due, until such Obligations and Hedging
Obligations  (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have first been
fully  paid and satisfied (in cash).  Should any payment, distribution, security
or  instrument  or  proceeds  thereof  be  received by the Borrower upon or with
respect  to the Intercompany Indebtedness after an Insolvency Event prior to the
satisfaction  of  all  of  the  Obligations  (other  than  contingent  indemnity
obligations)  and  Hedging  Obligations  under  Hedging  Agreements  and  the
termination  of  all  financing  arrangements  pursuant  to any Loan Document or
Hedging  Agreement  among the Borrower and the holders of Obligations (and their
affiliates),  the Borrower shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee,
for  the  benefit of the holders of the Obligations and such Hedging Obligations
and  shall  forthwith  deliver  the  same  to  the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit  of  such  Persons,  in  precisely  the  form  received  (except for the
endorsement  or  assignment of the Borrower where necessary), for application to
any  of the Obligations and such Hedging Obligations, due or not due, and, until
so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Borrower as the property of
the  holders  of  the Obligations and such Hedging Obligations.  If the Borrower
fails  to  make  any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent,
the  Administrative  Agent  or  any of its officers or employees are irrevocably
authorized  to  make  the  same.  The Borrower agrees that until the Obligations
(other  than  the contingent indemnity obligations) and such Hedging Obligations
have  been  paid  in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements
pursuant  to  any  Loan Document or Hedging Agreement among the Borrower and the
holders  of  the  Obligations  (and  their affiliates) have been terminated, the
Borrower  will  not  assign  or  transfer  to  any  Person  (other  than  the
Administrative  Agent)  any  claim  the  Borrower  has  or  may have against any
Subsidiary  Guarantor.
ARTICLE  XI:     THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT
                 --------------------------
11.1     Appointment;  Nature  of  Relationship.  Bank  One,  NA,  having  its
         ---------------------------------------
principal  office  in  Chicago,  Illinois  is  appointed  by  the Lenders as the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of
the  Lenders  irrevocably  authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent  to act as the
contractual  representative  of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly
set  forth  herein  and  in  the other Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent
agrees  to  act  as  such contractual representative upon the express conditions
contained  in  this  Article  XI.  Notwithstanding  the  use of the defined term
                     -----------
"Administrative  Agent,"  it  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  the
Administrative Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Holder
     of  Obligations  by  reason  of  this Agreement and that the Administrative
Agent  is  merely  acting  as  the representative of the Lenders with only those
duties  as  are  expressly  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  and  the other Loan
Documents.  In  its  capacity  as  the  Lenders' contractual representative, the
Administrative  Agent  (i)  does  not  assume any fiduciary duties to any of the
Holders of Obligations, (ii) is a "representative" of the Holders of Obligations
within  the  meaning  of  "secured party" as defined in Section 9-102 of Revised
Article  9  of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Illinois and (iii) is
acting  as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited
to  those  expressly  set  forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Each  of  the  Lenders, for itself and on behalf of its affiliates as Holders of
Obligations,  agrees  to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any
agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all
of  which  claims  each  Holder  of  Obligations  waives.
11.2     Powers.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  and may exercise such
         ------
powers  under  the  Loan  Documents  as  are  specifically  delegated  to  the
Administrative  Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as
are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall have no
implied  duties  or  fiduciary  duties  to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders  to  take  any action hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
except  any  action  specifically  provided by the Loan Documents required to be
taken  by  the  Administrative  Agent.
11.3     General  Immunity.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor any of its
         -----------------
directors,  officers,  agents  or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the
Lenders  or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
hereunder  or  under  any  other  Loan  Document  or  in  connection herewith or
therewith  except  to  the  extent  such  action or inaction is found in a final
judgment  by  a  court  of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely from the
gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of  such  Person.
11.4     No  Responsibility for Loans, Creditworthiness, Recitals, Etc.  Neither
         -------------------------------------------------------------
the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall  be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify
(i)  any  statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan
Document  or  any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any
of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document; (iii) the
satisfaction  of  any  condition specified in Article V, except receipt of items
                                              ---------
required  to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (iv) the existence
or  possible  existence  of  any  Default  or (v) the validity, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection  therewith.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender  for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or in
any  of the other Loan Documents, for the perfection or priority of the Liens on
collateral,  if any, or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
legality,  enforceability,  collectibility,  or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for
the  financial  condition of any guarantor of any or all of the Obligations, the
Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries.
11.5     Action  on  Instructions of Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall in
         -----------------------------------
all  cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder
and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed
by  the  Required  Lenders  (or  all of the Lenders in the event that and to the
extent  that  this Agreement expressly requires such), and such instructions and
any  action  taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of
the  Lenders  and on all owners of Loans and on all Holders of Obligations.  The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action  hereunder  and  under  any  other Loan Document unless it shall first be
indemnified  to  its  satisfaction  by  the Lenders pro rata against any and all
liability,  cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to  take  any  such  action.
11.6     Employment  of  Administrative  Agents and Counsel.  The Administrative
         --------------------------------------------------
Agent  may  execute  any of its duties as the Administrative Agent hereunder and
under  any  other  Loan  Document  by  or  through  employees,  agents,  and
attorney-in-fact  and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money
or  securities  received  by  it  or  its  authorized agents, for the default or
misconduct  of  any  such  agents  or  attorneys-in-fact  selected  by  it  with
reasonable  care.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to advice of
counsel  concerning the contractual arrangement between the Administrative Agent
and  the Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Administrative Agent's duties
hereunder  and  under  any  other  Loan  Document.
11.7     Reliance  on  Documents;  Counsel.  The  Administrative  Agent shall be
         ---------------------------------
entitled  to  rely  upon  any  notice,  consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram,  statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect
to  legal  matters,  upon  the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative
Agent,  which  counsel  may  be  employees  of  the  Administrative  Agent.
11.8     The  Administrative  Agent's  Reimbursement  and  Indemnification.  The
         -----------------------------------------------------------------
Lenders  agree  to  reimburse  and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in
proportion  to  their  respective  Pro  Rata  Shares  (i)  for  any  amounts not
reimbursed  by  the  Borrower  for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to
reimbursement  by  the  Borrower  under  the  Loan Documents, (ii) for any other
expenses  incurred  by  the  Administrative  Agent  on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection  with  the  preparation,  execution,  delivery,  administration  and
enforcement  of  the  Loan Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or
disbursements  of  any  kind  and  nature  whatsoever  which  may be imposed on,
incurred  by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or  arising  out  of  the  Loan  Documents  or  any  other document delivered in
connection  therewith  or  the  transactions  contemplated  thereby,  or  the
enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided
                                                                        --------
that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the
foregoing  is  found  in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction  to  have  arisen  solely  from  the  gross  negligence  or willful
misconduct  of  the  Administrative  Agent.
11.9     Rights  as  a Lender.  With respect to its Commitment and Loans made by
         --------------------
it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and
under  any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though
it  were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless  the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its
individual  capacity.  The  Administrative  Agent may accept deposits from, lend
money  to,  and  generally  engage  in  any kind of trust, debt, equity or other
transaction,  in  addition  to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Person
is  not  prohibited  hereby  from  engaging  with  any  other  Person.
11.10     Lender  Credit  Decision.  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  it  has,
          ------------------------
independently  and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers
or  any  other  Lender  and  based  on  the financial statements prepared by the

other Loan Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently
and  without  reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other

action  under  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents.
11.11     Successor  Administrative  Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign
          --------------------------------
at  any  time  by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint,
on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent.  If
no  successor  Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders  and  shall  have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the
retiring  Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring
Administrative  Agent  may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor  Administrative  Agent.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the
contrary,  so  long  as  no  Default  has  occurred and is continuing, each such
successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  be subject to approval by the Borrower,
which  approval  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld.  Such  successor
Administrative  Agent  shall  be  a  commercial bank having capital and retained
earnings  of  at  least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all  the  rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and  obligations  hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents.  After any
retiring  Administrative  Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the  provisions  of  this Article XI shall continue in effect for its benefit in
                          ----------
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents.
11.12          No  Duties  Imposed Upon Syndication Agent or Arrangers.  None of
               -------------------------------------------------------
the  Persons identified on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages
to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent" or
"Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty  under  this  Agreement  other  than  if  such  Person  is  a Lender, those
applicable  to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Persons  identified  on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages to
this  Agreement  or  otherwise  in  this  Agreement  as a "Syndication Agent" or
"Arranger"  shall  have  or be deemed to have any fiduciary duty to or fiduciary

                                                                         -------
11.10,  each  of  the  Lenders acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
-----
rely,  on  any  of  the  Persons  so  identified  in deciding to enter into this
---
Agreement  or  in  taking  or  not  taking  action  hereunder.

ARTICLE  XII:     SETOFF;  RATABLE  PAYMENTS
                  --------------------------
12.1     Setoff.  In  addition  to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
         ------
Lenders  under  applicable  law,  if  any  Default occurs and is continuing, any
indebtedness  from  any  Lender to the Borrower (including all account balances,
whether  provisional  or final and whether or not collected or available) may be
offset  and  applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender,
whether  or  not  the  Obligations,  or  any  part  hereof,  shall  then be due.
12.2     Ratable  Payments.  If  any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
         -----------------
payment  made  to  it  upon  its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Sections  4.1,  4.2  or  4.4)  in a greater proportion than that received by any
    ---------   ---      ---
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will
hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If any Lender, whether in connection with
setoff  or  amounts  which  might  be  subject  to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral  or  other protection for its Obligation or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in  proportion  to  the  obligations owing to them.  In case any such payment is
disturbed  by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall
be  made.
12.3     Application of Payments.  Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2, the
         -----------------------                                -----------
Administrative  Agent  shall, unless otherwise specified at the direction of the
Required  Lenders  which direction shall be consistent with the last sentence of
this  Section  12.3,  apply  all  payments  and  prepayments  in  respect of any
      -------------
Obligations  received  after  the  occurrence  and  during  the continuance of a
     ---
Default  or  Unmatured  Default  in  the  following  order:
     -
(A)     first, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of the Loans
     which  the  Administrative  Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender
for  which  the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender
or  the  Borrower;
(B)     second,  to pay interest on and then principal of any advance made under
Section  10.3  for  which the Administrative Agent has not then been paid by the
-------------
Borrower  or  reimbursed  by  the  Lenders;
--
(C)     third,  to  pay  Obligations  in  respect  of  any  fees,  expenses,
reimbursements  or  indemnities  then  due  to  the  Administrative  Agent;
(D)     fourth,  to  pay  Obligations  in  respect  of  any  fees,  expenses,
reimbursements  or  indemnities  then  due  to  the  Lenders;
(E)     fifth,  to  pay  interest  due  in  respect  of  Loans;
(F)     sixth,  to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal outstanding on
Loans  and  Hedging  Obligations  under  Hedging Agreements in such order as the
Administrative  Agent  may  determine  in  its  sole  discretion;  and
(G)     seventh,  to  the  ratable  payment  of  all  other  Obligations.
Unless otherwise designated (which designation shall only be applicable prior to
the  occurrence of a Default) by the Borrower, all principal payments in respect
of  Loans  shall be applied to the outstanding Loans first, to repay outstanding
Floating  Rate  Loans,  and then to repay outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans with
                            ----
those  Eurodollar  Rate Loans which have earlier expiring Interest Periods being
repaid  prior to those which have later expiring Interest Periods.  The order of
priority  set  forth  in  this  Section  12.3 and the related provisions of this
                                -------------
Agreement  are  set  forth  solely to determine the rights and priorities of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders as among themselves.  The order of priority
set  forth  in  clauses (D) through (G) of this Section 12.3 may at any time and
                -----------         ---         ------------
from time to time be changed by the Required Lenders without necessity of notice
to or consent of or approval by the Borrower, or any other Person.  The order of
priority  set  forth  in  clauses  (A)  through  (C) of this Section 12.3 may be
                          ------------           ---         ------------

         -------------------------

accordance  with  Section  12.1, the proceeds of which are applied in accordance
                  -------------
with  this  Agreement,  and  except as set forth in the following sentence, each
Lender  agrees  that  it  will not take any action, nor institute any actions or
proceedings, against the Borrower or any other obligor hereunder or with respect
     to  any  Loan  Document,  without the prior written consent of the Required
Lenders or, as may be provided in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, at
the  direction  of  the  Administrative  Agent.
(B)     The  Lenders  are  not  partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be
liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in
case  of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender.  The
Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders, at
the  direction  of  the  Required  Lenders,  to  enforce  on  the payment of the
principal  of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest
has  become  due  and  payable  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement.
12.5     Representations  and  Covenants  Among Lenders.  Each Lender represents
         ----------------------------------------------
and  covenants for the benefit of all other Lenders and the Administrative Agent
that  such Lender is not satisfying and shall not satisfy any of its obligations
pursuant  to this Agreement with any assets considered for any purposes of ERISA
or  Section  4975  of  the  Code  to  be assets of or on behalf of any "plan" as
defined  in  section  3(3)  of  ERISA or section 4975 of the Code, regardless of
whether  subject  to  ERISA  or  Section  4975  of  the  Code.

                   -----------------------------------------------------
13.1     Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents
         ----------------------
     shall  be  binding  upon  and  inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) without the
consent  of  all of the Lenders, the Borrower shall not have the right to assign
its  rights  or obligations under the Loan Documents, and any such assignment in
violation  of  this  Section  13.1(i)  shall  be  null  and  void,  and (ii) any
                     ----------------
assignment  by  any  Lender must be made in compliance with Section 13.3 hereof.
                                                            ------------
Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section 13.1 or Section 13.3, (i) any Lender
                -----------         ------------    ------------
may  at  any  time,  without  the  consent of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Federal
Reserve  Bank  and  (ii)  any  Lender  which  is a fund or commingled investment
vehicle  that invests in commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business
may  at  any  time,  without  the  consent of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent,  pledge or assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement to a
trustee  or  other  representative  of holders of obligations owed or securities
issued  by  such  Lender as collateral to secure such obligations or securities;
provided,  however,  that  no  such  assignment  or  pledge  shall  release  the
  ------   -------
transferor  Lender from its obligations hereunder.  The Administrative Agent may
  ------
treat  each  Lender  as the owner of the Loans made by such Lender hereunder for
all  purposes  hereof  unless  and  until such Lender complies with Section 13.3
                                                                    ------------
hereof  in  the  case  of  an  assignment  thereof  or, in the case of any other
transfer,  a  written  notice  of  the transfer is filed with the Administrative
Agent.  Any  assignee  or transferee of a Loan, Commitment or any other interest
of a lender under the Loan Documents agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by
all  the  terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or
consent  of  any  Person,  who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority  or  consent is the owner of any Loan, shall be conclusive and binding
on  any  subsequent  owner,  transferee  or  assignee  of  such  Loan.
13.2     Participations.

----
entities  ("PARTICIPANTS")  participating  interests  in  any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under
     the  Loan  Documents.  Notice of such participation to the Borrower and the
Administrative  Agent  shall  be  required  prior  to any participation becoming
effective  with  respect  to a Participant which is not a Lender or an Affiliate
thereof.  In  the  event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests
to  a  Participant,  such  Lender's  obligations  under the Loan Documents shall
remain  unchanged,  such  Lender  shall  remain  solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain
the owner of all Loans made by it for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all
amounts  payable  by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if
such  Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents
except  that,  for  purposes  of  Article  IV  hereof, the Participants shall be

business  and  in  accordance  with applicable law, at any time assign to one or

and  all  Loans  owing  to  it in accordance with the provisions of this Section
                                                                         -------
13.3.  Each  assignment  shall  be  of  a  constant,  and not a varying, ratable
percentage  of  all  of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.  Such  assignment  shall  be  substantially  in the form of Exhibit C
                                                                       ---------
hereto and shall not be permitted hereunder unless such assignment is either for
     all  of  such  Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents or,
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and (if no Default
or Unmatured Default has occurred or is continuing) the Borrower, involves loans
and  commitments  in  an  aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 (which minimum
amount  shall not apply to any assignment between Lenders, or to an affiliate of
any  Lender).  Other than with respect to any assignment to another Lender or an
affiliate  or successor entity of such Lender, the consent of the Administrative
Agent,  and,  prior  to the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Unmatured
Default,  the  Borrower  (which  consent,  in  each  such  case,  shall  not  be

effective.
(B)     Effect;  Effective  Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent
        ------------------------
of  a  notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Appendix I to

the  assignor  (as  agreed)  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for processing such
assignment  (provided  no  such  fee  shall  be  required  in connection with an
assignment by a Lender to an affiliate or successor entity of such Lender), such
assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice
of  Assignment.  The  Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the
Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase
of  the Commitment or Loans under the applicable Assignment Agreement constitute
for  any  purpose  of  ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code assets of any "plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and that the rights
and  interests  of  the  Purchaser  in  and  under  the  Loan Documents will not
constitute  such  "plan  assets".  On  and  after  the  effective  date  of such
assignment, such Purchaser, if not already a Lender, shall for all purposes be a
Lender  party  to  this  Agreement  and any other Loan Documents executed by the
Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents,  to  the  same  extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no
further  consent  or  action  by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative
Agent  shall  be  required  to release the transferor Lender with respect to the
percentage  of  the  Aggregate  Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser.

                                                                         -------
13.3(B),  the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall
-------
make  appropriate  arrangements so that, to the extent notes have been issued to
evidence  any  of  the  transferred  Loans, replacement notes are issued to such
transferor  Lender  and  new  notes  or,  as appropriate, replacement notes, are
issued  to  such  Purchaser,  in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
Commitment  (or  from  and  after  the  Funding  Date, the outstanding principal
balance  of  such  Lender's  Loans),  as  adjusted  pursuant to such assignment.
(C)     The  Register.  The  Administrative  Agent shall maintain at its address
        -------------
referred  to in Section 14.1 a copy of each assignment delivered to and accepted
                ------------

pursuant  to an assignment under this Section 13.3.  The entries in the Register
                                      ------------
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower  and each of its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders

hereunder  for  all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available
for  inspection  by  the  Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from
time  to  time  upon  reasonable  prior  notice.
13.4     Confidentiality.  Subject to Section 13.5, the Administrative Agent and
         ---------------              ------------

no  event  shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated or required
to  return  any  materials  furnished  by  the Borrower; provided, however, each

interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective  Transferee  any  and  all  information  in such Lender's possession
concerning  the  Borrower  and its Subsidiaries; provided that prior to any such
                                                 --------
disclosure,  such  prospective  Transferee shall agree to preserve in accordance
