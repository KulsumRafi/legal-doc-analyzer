(f) Payments.


<PAGE>



                  (i) If the parties are each required to make payments pursuant
                  to Section  2(a) on the same day in  respect of a  Transaction
                  but the payments are to be made in different  currencies,  the
                  party that  receives the payment due to it first shall hold an
                  amount  equal to the  payment it  received  in trust (with the
                  right to commingle that amount with its general funds) for the
                  benefit of the other party until that other party receives the
                  corresponding payment due to it.

                  (ii) If by reason of the time difference between the cities in
                  which  payments  are  to be  made,  it  is  not  possible  for
                  simultaneous  payments  to be made on any date on  which  both
                  parties are required to make payments hereunder,  either party
                  may at its option and in its sole discretion  notify the other
                  party that payments on that date are to be made in escrow.  In
                  this case deposit of the payment due earlier on that day shall
                  be made by 2:00 P.M.  (local time at the place for the earlier
                  payment)  on that date with an escrow  agent  selected  by the
                  party giving the notice,  accompanied by  irrevocable  payment
                  instructions  (A) to  release  the  deposited  payment  to the
                  intended  recipient  upon  receipt by the escrow  agent of the
                  required deposit of the  corresponding  payment from the other
                  party on the same  date  accompanied  by  irrevocable  payment
                  instructions to the same effect or (B) if the required deposit
                  of the corresponding payment is not made on that same date, to
                  return the  payment  deposited  to the party that paid it into
                  escrow.  The party that elects to have payments made in escrow
                  shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall cause
                  those  arrangements to provide that the intended  recipient of
                  the  payment  due to be  deposited  first shall be entitled to
                  interest on that deposited  payment for each day in the period
                  of its  deposit at the rate  offered  by the escrow  agent for
                  that day for  overnight  deposits in the relevant  currency in
                  the office where it holds the deposited payment (at 11:00 A.M.
                  local  time on that day) if that  payment is not  released  by
                  5:00  P.M.  local  time on the  date it is  deposited  for any
                  reason other than the intended recipient's failure to make the
                  escrow  deposit it is required to make  hereunder  in a timely
                  fashion.

(g)  Set-off.  Section 6 of this  Agreement  is  hereby  amended  by adding  the
following Subsection (f) at the end thereof:

                  "(f)  Set-Off.  (i) In  addition  to any  rights  of  set-off,
                  combination of accounts, lien or other similar rights to which
                  a party hereto is at any time otherwise  entitled  (whether by
                  operation of law, contract or otherwise),  upon the occurrence
                  of (a) an Event of Default (in which case the Defaulting Party
                  will be  referred to herein as "X"),  (b) a Credit  Event Upon
                  Merger or an Illegality (in which case the Affected Party will
                  be referred to herein as "X") or (c) an Additional Termination
                  Event  (in  which  case the party  with  respect  to which the
                  Additional  Termination Event has occurred,  or been deemed to
                  have  occurred,  will be referred to herein as "X"), the party
                  hereto that is not X (such  party being  referred to herein as
                  "Y") shall have the right  (but not the  obligation),  without
                  prior  notice  to  X or  any  other  person,  to  set-off  any
                  obligation of X owing to Y (and, if Y elects,  any  Affiliates
                  of Y) (whether or not arising under the Agreement,  whether or
                  not matured,  whether or not  contingent and regardless of the
                  currency,   place  of  payment   or  booking   office  of  the
                  obligation).  The  parties  agree  and  acknowledge  that  the
                  obligations  referred  to by this  provision  shall be  deemed
                  satisfied and discharged to the extent they are so set-off.  Y
                  will give notice to X of any set-off effected pursuant to this
                  Section 6(f) promptly after such set-off has been effected.

                  (ii) In order to set-off  obligations  that are denominated in
                  different currencies, Y may convert any obligation denominated
                  in one currency (the "Original  Currency") to another currency
                  (the "Set-off  Currency") at the market rate,  determined by Y
                  in  good  faith,  at  which  Y  would  be  able,  acting  in a
                  commercially   reasonable  manner,  to  purchase  the  Set-off
                  Currency for the relevant amount of the Original Currency.

<PAGE>


                  (iii) If an obligation is  unascertained,  Y may in good faith
                  estimate  that  obligation  and  set-off  in  respect  of such
                  estimate,  subject to the  relevant  party  accounting  to the
                  other when such obligation is ascertained.

                  (iv)  Nothing in this  Section 6(f) will be deemed to create a
                  charge or other security interest."

(h)      Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party  irrevocably  waives any and all right
         to  trial by jury in any  legal  proceeding  in  connection  with  this
         Agreement.


(i)      Multibranch Party.  Without limiting the generality of Section 10, each
         Multibranch  Party  represents  to the other  party and agrees that the
         obligations of such Multibranch Party are  unconditional,  irrespective
         of the validity or  enforceability of this Agreement against any of its
         Offices,  whether  or not such  Office  has  undergone  a change in its
         status, function, control or ownership.

(j)      Incorporation  of EMU  Protocol.  Party A and  Party B agree  that  the
         definitions and provisions contained in Annexes 1 to 5, inclusive,  and
         Section 6 of the EMU Protocol, as published by the ISDA on May 6, 1998,
         are incorporated into and apply to this Agreement.  References in those
         definitions and provisions to an "ISDA Master Agreement" will be deemed
         to be references to this Agreement.

                                                                       ---------

                                    GUARANTY
                                    --------

GUARANTY. dated as of December 16, 2OO2 by THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC., A
Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), in favor of PENN-ANIERICA GROUP INC., a
corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania (the "Beneficiary").

(a)  Guaranty.

     (i)  To induce the Beneficiary to enter into an ISDA Master Agreement as of
          even date  herewith and one or more  Transactions  as of various dates
          (together,  the  "Agreement";  terms  capitalized  but  not  otherwise
          defined herein being used herein as therein defined) with BEAR STEARNS
          BANK PLC ("Bear  Stearns"),  subject to the terms and  conditions  set
          forth herein, the Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
          to the Beneficiary,  its successors and permitted assigns,  the prompt
          payment by Bear  Stearns on demand,  of any amount due and  payable to
          the Beneficiary  under the Agreement,  subject to any applicable grace
          period thereunder (the "Obligations').

     (ii) The Guarantor  hereby waives  acceptance of this Guaranty,  diligence,
          promptness,  presentment,  demand on Bear Stearns for payment, protest
          of  nonpayment  and  all  notices  of  any  kind.  In  addition,   the
          Guarantor's  obligations  hereunder  shall  not  be  affected  by  the
          existence,  validity,  enforceability,  perfection,  or  extent of any
          collateral therefor. The Beneficiary shall not be obligated to proceed
          against Bear Stearns  before  claiming  under the Guaranty nor to file
          any claim  relating to the  Obligations in the event that Bear Stearns
          becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding,
          and the  failure  of the  Beneficiary  so to file shall not affect the
          Guarantor's  obligations  hereunder.  The  Guarantor  agrees  that its
          obligations  under this Guaranty  constitute a guaranty of payment and
          not of collection.

(b)  Consents,  Waivers and Renewals. The Guarantor agrees that the Beneficiary,
     may at any time and from time to time,  either before or after the maturity
     thereof, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor,  extend the
     time of payment of,  exchange or surrender any collateral for, or renew any
     of the  Obligations,  and may also make any agreement  with Bear Stearns or
     with any other  party to or person  liable  on any of the  Obligations,  or
     interested  therein,  for  the  extension,  renewal,  payment,  compromise,
     discharge or release thereof, in whole or in party, or for any modification
     of the terms thereof or of any agreement  between the  Beneficiary and Bear
     Stearns or any such other party or person,  without in any way impairing or
     affecting  this Guaranty.  The Guarantor  agrees that the  Beneficiary  may
     resort to the Guarantor for payment of any of the  Obligations,  whether or
     not the  Beneficiary  shall have resorted to any  collateral  security,  or
