requires possession to perfect its security interest in such Collateral,
properly endorsed or acknowledged. Furthermore, the Borrower shall take all
such actions as may be requested by the Lender to allow the Lender to exercise control
over any Collateral for the purpose of allowing the Lender to perfect its
security interest in Collateral, which Collateral may include Deposit Accounts,
Investment Property, Letter-of-Credit Rights and electronic Chattel Paper. At

grants the Lender the right to audit the books and records of the Borrower
relating to Collateral at any time and from time to time. The Borrower shall (i)&nbsp;promptly
furnish the Lender with any information with respect to Collateral requested by
the Lender; (ii)&nbsp;allow the Lender or its representatives to inspect the

to payment under specific Government Contracts, as contemplated under this
Section, shall not be deemed to limit the Lender&#146;s security interest to
Payments under those particular Government Contracts and the related Government
Accounts, but rather the Lender&#146;s security interest, as stated above, shall
extend to Payments under any and all Government Contracts and the related

Claim shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal
Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code) (the &#147;Act&#148;). The Act will apply even
though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the law of a specified
state.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6.0pt;text-indent:20.15pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Arbitration proceedings will be determined in

paragraph shall control.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6.0pt;text-indent:20.15pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and
conducted in any U.S. state where real or tangible personal property collateral
for this credit is located or if there is no such collateral, in Maryland. &#160;All Claims shall be determined by one
arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million and 00/100 Dollars
($5,000,000.00), upon the request of any party, the Claims shall be decided by
three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90)
days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90) days of
commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty
(30) days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a
showing of good cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional
sixty (60) days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of
reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court
having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6.0pt;text-indent:20.15pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide
whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to
dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the
statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules&nbsp;of
a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute
concerning this arbitration provision or whether a claim is arbitrable shall be
determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to
award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</font></p>
