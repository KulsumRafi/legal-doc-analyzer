<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between William Mackenzie (the "Employee") and Centillium Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), effective as of January 14, 2003 (the "Effective Date").</P>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon the Employee's termination of employment following a Change of Control. These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 6 below.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">AGREEMENT</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI VALUE=1>Term of Agreement</U>. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>At-Will Employment</U>. The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employee's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, except as may otherwise be specifically provided under the terms of any written formal employment agreement between the Company and the Employee (an "Employment Agreement"). If the Employee's employment terminates for any reason, including (without limitation) any termination prior to a Change of Control, the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Agreement or under his or her Employment Agreement.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Severance Benefits</U>.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Involuntary Termination Other than for Cause or Voluntary Termination for Good Reason Following a Change of Control</U>. If within eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control (i) the Employee terminates his or her employment with the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) for "Good Reason" (as defined herein) or (ii) the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) terminates the Employee's employment for other than "Cause" (as defined herein), and the Employee signs and does not revoke a standard release of claims with the Company in a form acceptable to the Company, then the Employee shall receive the following severance from the Company:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="i">

<U><LI>Severance Payment</U>. The Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum severance payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% of the Employee's annual base salary (as in effect immediately prior to (A) the Change of Control, or (B) the Employee's termination, whichever is greater).</LI></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Timing of Severance Payments</U>. The severance payment to which Employee is entitled shall be paid by the Company to Employee in cash and in full, not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the termination of Employee's employment as provided in Section 3(a). If the Employee should die before all amounts have been paid, such unpaid amounts shall be paid in a lump-sum payment (less any withholding taxes) to the Employee's designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the personal representative of the Employee's estate.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Voluntary Resignation; Termination for Cause</U>. If the Employee's employment with the Company terminates (i) voluntarily by the Employee other than for Good Reason, or (ii) for Cause by the Company, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those (if any) as may then be established under the Company's then existing severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other written agreements with the Company.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Termination Apart from Change of Control</U>. In the event the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason, either prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control or after the eighteen (18)-month period following a Change of Control, then the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance and any other benefits only as may then be established under the Company's existing written severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other written agreements with the Company.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Exclusive Remedy</U>. In the event of a termination of Employee's employment within eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control, the provisions of this Section 3 are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Employee or the Company may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, in equity, or under this Agreement. The Employee shall be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment following a Change in Control other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Section 3.</LI></P></OL>

<U><LI>Golden Parachute Excise Tax.</U> In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to the Employee (i)&nbsp;constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (ii)&nbsp;but for this Section, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Employee's severance benefits under this Agreement shall be payable either</LI><OL START=0>

<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>in full, or</LI>
<LI>as to such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance benefits being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by the Employee on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance benefits under this Agreement, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and the Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants (the "Accountants"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Employee and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section.</LI></OL>
