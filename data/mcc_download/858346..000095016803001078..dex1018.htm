applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements between Borrower and Lender with respect to the Loan are hereby expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to
be paid to Lender or charged by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed the maximum amount allowed by law. If the Loan would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of the
State of Georgia and the laws of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents: (a) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted for,
taken, reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law, and any excess shall be credited on the Note by the holder thereof (or, if the Note and any
other amount due under the Loan has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower); and (b) if maturity is accelerated by reason of an election by Lender, or in the event of any prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest may never
include more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. In such case, excess interest, if any, provided for in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
from the date of advance until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform through the term hereof. If such amortization, proration, allocation and spreading is not permitted under applicable law, then such excess interest shall
be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the Note (or, if the Note and any other amount due under the Loan has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and

the Security Instrument, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, as amended herein (including, but not limited to, the payment of taxes, insurance premiums and the like). The provisions of the Note and the other Loan Documents limiting the
