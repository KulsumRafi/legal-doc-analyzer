              BELDEN INC. LONG-TERM CASH PERFORMANCE PLAN (SUMMARY)

The Belden Inc. Long-Term Cash Performance Plan is part of the long-term
component of management's total compensation (the other long-term components
being stock options, restricted stock and other awards under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan). Awards are given annually and have four-year performance
cycles. At the end of the four years, the management participant's cash payment
will be determined by the achievement of Company-based financial objectives
during the four-year period. Such financial objectives are based on the
Company's EBITDA and ROIC during the measurement period relative to a benchmark
index. Depending on the Company's attainment of such performance goals, the
award will either result in no payment, a minimum payment, a target payment, a
maximum payment or a payment in between these amounts. The Compensation
Committee establishes the performance goals for each award.
