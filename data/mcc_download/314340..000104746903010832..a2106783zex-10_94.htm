to the terms and conditions of a certain Loan Agreement dated as of April&nbsp;5, 2002 by and among the Borrower, the Corporate Guarantors and the Lender (the

Security Agreement dated as of April&nbsp;5, 2002 (the "Borrower Security Agreement"); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

Borrower may elect from time to time to have portions of the principal indebtedness evidenced by the Substitute Term Note (each a "Eurodollar Rate Portion") bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin (as determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.3(d) of the Loan Agreement) (the "Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate") by providing a request
therefor to the Lender not less than two (2)&nbsp;Eurodollar Banking Days prior to the applicable Effective Date for each such Eurodollar Rate Portion, which request shall specify: (i)&nbsp;the
total amount of the Eurodollar Rate Portion; (ii)&nbsp;the effective date of the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate (the "Effective Date"), which shall be a Eurodollar Banking Day, and
(iii)&nbsp;the length of the applicable Interest Period. The Lender shall, not later than 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Columbus, Ohio time one Eurodollar Banking Days prior to the Effective Date for such
Eurodollar Rate Portion, give notice to the Borrower of the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate (including information as to the calculation thereof) applicable for the period requested by the
Borrower. The Borrower shall, not later than 3:00&nbsp;p.m., Columbus, Ohio time one (1)&nbsp;Eurodollar Banking Day prior to the Effective Date of each Eurodollar Rate Portion, give notice by
telephone to the Lender as to whether or not the Borrower wishes to elect to have such Eurodollar Rate Portion bear interest at the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate commencing as of the
applicable Effective Date. In the event the Borrower elects not to have such Eurodollar Rate Portion bear interest at the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate or fails to timely deliver such
notice of election, such Eurodollar Rate Portion shall continue to bear interest at the Variable Term Rate until the Borrower has otherwise elected in accordance with provisions of this paragraph.
Upon the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to each Eurodollar Rate Portion, such Eurodollar Rate Portion shall, unless the Borrower has otherwise elected in accordance with the provisions
of this paragraph, bear interest at the Variable Term Rate. Each Eurodollar Rate Portion shall be in the initial amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000. Each election to have a
Eurodollar Rate Portion bear interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate shall be recorded by the Lender; provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to make such recordation shall not limit
or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under the Substitute Term Note. Each Eurodollar Rate Portion shall bear interest during the Interest Period selected therefor at a rate per annum
equal to the Adjusted Eurodollar Term Rate. The
Borrower shall be obligated to pay with respect to each Eurodollar Rate Portion such additional amounts as shall be determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.4 of the Loan Agreement. </FONT></P>
