authorization of the members of the DVD Patent License Group (as defined in the

conditions of the DVD Patent License Agreement entered into by Licensee and
Licensor as of December 31, 2002 ("DVD Patent License Agreement").

     claims pursuant to the Conditions of Exhibit 3."

3. New Paragraph 2.2.A shall be added as follows:

          Products in the case of DVD Players;

of any taxes or other levies (except withholding taxes imposed by the governing
body of Licensee's domicile), which shall be borne by Licensee. With respect to
withholding taxes imposed by the governing body of Licensee's domicile, Licensee
shall pay such taxes and shall be entitled to deduct such taxes from royalties
payable, so long as Licensee provides Licensor with a tax certificate (or
equivalent document) evidencing such payment and/or obligation. Licensee
covenants to pay such taxes in a timely and lawful manner. "

     shall be deemed Licensee's "Confidential Information" and shall be sent
     only to employees of Licensor who are involved in licensing and accounting
     activities and who are not involved in the business of selling or
     developing DVD Products. Such Confidential Information shall be kept
     confidential by said employees and shall not be disclosed by Licensor or
     its employees to members of the DVD Patent Licensing Group or to third
     parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee agrees
     that members of the DVD Patent Licensing Group may have access to the
     information contained in such reports regarding the names of licensees,
     categories and model numbers of licensed products, total quantities of
     sales of such products and total royalties due under this Agreement. The
     information contained in the royalty statement shall be used for showing
     the compliance to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for no
     other purpose."

remain in full force and effect as provided therein. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Letter Agreement and the DVD Patent License
Agreement, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall take precedence.
