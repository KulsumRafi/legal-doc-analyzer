for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an office or
agency where Notes may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar
will keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The
Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying
agents. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar and the term "Paying
Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying
Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company will notify the
Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this
Indenture. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as
Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of

     Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.

     The Company will require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree
in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders
or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal,
premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on the Notes, and will notify
the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any
such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money
held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to
pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) will have no further
liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it
will segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders
all money held by it as Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization
proceedings relating to the Company, the Trustee will serve as Paying Agent for
the Notes.

     The Trustee will preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable
the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of all Holders
and shall otherwise comply with TIA ss. 312(a). If the Trustee is not the
Registrar, the Company will furnish to the Trustee at least seven Business Days
before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may
request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may
reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of Notes and the

                    Note in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be
                    transferred or exchanged; and

                         (ii) instructions given in accordance with the

amount of the applicable Global Note to be reduced accordingly pursuant to

               delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the
               Global Note, a certificate from such Holder in the form of
               Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in item (4)
               thereof;

          and, in each such case set forth in this subparagraph (D), if the
          Registrar so requests or if the Applicable Procedures so require, an
          Opinion of Counsel in form reasonably acceptable to the Registrar to
          the effect that such exchange or transfer is in compliance with the
          Securities Act and that the restrictions on transfer contained herein
          and in the Private Placement Legend are no longer required in order to
          maintain compliance with the Securities Act.

     Upon satisfaction of the conditions of any of the subparagraphs in this
Section 2.06(d)(1), the Trustee will cancel the Definitive Note and increase or
cause to be increased the aggregate principal amount of the Global Note.

          (2) Unrestricted Definitive Notes to Beneficial Interests in Global
     Notes. A Holder of an Unrestricted Definitive Note may exchange such Note
     for a beneficial interest in a Global Note or transfer such Definitive Note
     to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest
     in a Global Note at any time. Upon receipt of a request for such an
     exchange or transfer, the Trustee will cancel the applicable Unrestricted
     Definitive Note and increase or cause to be increased the aggregate
     principal amount of the Global Note.

     If any such exchange or transfer from a Definitive Note to a beneficial
interest in a Global Note is effected pursuant to subparagraph (1)(B), (1)(D) or
(2) above at a time when a Global Note has not yet been issued, the Company will
issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section
2.02 hereof, the Trustee will authenticate one or more Global Notes in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of Definitive Notes so
transferred.

     (e) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes for Definitive Notes. Upon
request by a Holder of Definitive Notes and such Holder's compliance with the
provisions of this Section 2.06(e), the Registrar will register the transfer or
exchange of Definitive Notes. Prior to such registration of transfer or
exchange, the requesting Holder must present or surrender to the Registrar the
Definitive Notes duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by such Holder or
by its attorney, duly authorized in writing. In addition, the requesting Holder
must provide any additional certifications, documents and information, as
applicable, required pursuant to the following provisions of this Section
2.06(e).

          (1) Restricted Definitive Notes to Restricted Definitive Notes. Any
     Restricted Definitive Note may be transferred to and registered in the name
     of Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a Restricted Definitive
     Note if the Registrar receives the following:

               (A) if the transfer will be made pursuant to Rule 144A under the
          Securities Act, then the transferor must deliver a certificate in the
          form of Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in item (1)
          thereof;

               (B) if the transfer will be made pursuant to Rule 903 or Rule

          Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in item (2) thereof;
          and

               (C) if the transfer will be made pursuant to any other exemption
          from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, then the
          transferor


<PAGE>
                                      -36-


          must deliver a certificate in the form of Exhibit B hereto, including
          the certifications, certificates and Opinion of Counsel required by
          item (3) thereof, if applicable.

          (2) Restricted Definitive Notes to Unrestricted Definitive Notes. Any
     Restricted Definitive Note may be exchanged by the Holder thereof for an
     Unrestricted Definitive Note or transferred to a Person or Persons who take
     delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Definitive Note if:

               (A) such exchange or transfer is effected pursuant to the
          Exchange Offer in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement
          and the Holder, in the case of an exchange, or the transferee, in the
          case of a transfer, certifies in the applicable Letter of Transmittal
          that it is not (i) a broker-dealer, (ii) a Person participating in the
          distribution of the Exchange Notes or (iii) a Person who is an
          affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of the Company;

               (B) any such transfer is effected pursuant to the Shelf
          Registration Statement in accordance with the Registration Rights
          Agreement;

               (C) any such transfer is effected by a Broker-Dealer pursuant to
          the Exchange Offer Registration Statement in accordance with the
          Registration Rights Agreement; or

               (D) the Registrar receives the following:

                         (i) if the Holder of such Restricted Definitive Note
                    proposes to exchange such Note for an Unrestricted
                    Definitive Note, a certificate from such Holder in the form
                    of Exhibit C hereto, including the certifications in item
                    (2) thereof; or

                         (ii) if the Holder of such Restricted Definitive Note
                    proposes to transfer such Note to a Person who shall take
                    delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Definitive
                    Note, a certificate from such Holder in the form of Exhibit
                    B hereto, including the certifications in item (4) thereof;

               and, in each such case set forth in this subparagraph (D), if the
               Registrar so requests, an Opinion of Counsel in form reasonably
               acceptable to the Company to the effect that such exchange or
               transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act and that the
               restrictions on transfer contained herein and in the Private
               Placement Legend are no longer required in order to maintain
               compliance with the Securities Act.

          (3) Unrestricted Definitive Notes to Unrestricted Definitive Notes. A
     Holder of Unrestricted Definitive Notes may transfer such Notes to a Person
     who takes


<PAGE>
                                      -37-


     delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Definitive Note. Upon
     receipt of a request to register such a transfer, the Registrar shall
     register the Unrestricted Definitive Notes pursuant to the instructions
     from the Holder thereof.

     (f) Exchange Offer. Upon the occurrence of the Exchange Offer in accordance
with the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will issue and, upon receipt
of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof, the Trustee
will authenticate:

          (1) one or more Global Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to
     the principal amount of the beneficial interests in the Restricted
     Definitive Notes tendered into the Exchange Offer by Persons that certify
     in the applicable Letters of Transmittal that (A) they are not
     Broker-Dealers, (B) they are not participating in a distribution of the
     Exchange Notes and (C) they are not affiliates (as defined in Rule 144) of
     the Company; and

          (2) Unrestricted Definitive Notes in an aggregate principal amount
     equal to the principal amount of the Restricted Definitive Notes tendered
     into the Exchange Offer by all other Persons.

     Concurrently with the issuance of such Notes, the Company will execute and
the Trustee will authenticate and deliver to the Persons designated by the
Holders of Definitive Notes so tendered Unrestricted Definitive Notes in the
appropriate principal amount.

     (g) Legends. The following legends will appear on the face of all Notes
issued under this Indenture unless specifically stated otherwise in the
applicable provisions of this Indenture.

          (1) Private Placement Legend.

          SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS NOTE
          FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO IN (A) ABOVE."

               (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Global Note or Definitive
          Note issued pursuant to subparagraph (b), (c), (d), (e)(2), (e)(3) or
          (f) of this Section 2.06 (and all Notes issued in exchange therefor or

               UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN
          DEFINITIVE FORM, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY
          THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE
          DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR
          BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A

     (h) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes. At such time as all
beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been exchanged for
Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or
canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note will be returned to or
retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof. At
any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note
is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in
the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive
Notes, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note will be
reduced accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such Global Note by the
Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such
reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred
to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest
in another Global Note, such other Global Note will be increased accordingly and
an endorsement will be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the
Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase.

     (i) General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.

          (1) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company
     will execute and the Trustee will authenticate Global Notes and Definitive
     Notes upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section
     2.02 or at the Registrar's request.


<PAGE>
                                      -40-


          (2) No service charge will be made to a Holder of a Global Note or to
     a Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or exchange,
     but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
     transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith
     (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable
     upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06, 3.09, 4.10, 4.14
     and 9.05 hereof). The Registrar will not be required to register the
     transfer of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in
     part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

          (3) All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any registration
     of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes will be the
     valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to
     the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive
     Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

          (4) The Company will not be required:

               (A) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any
          Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
          before the day of any selection of Notes for redemption under Section
          3.02 hereof and ending at the close of business on the day of
          selection;

               (B) to register the transfer of or to exchange any Note selected
          for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of
          any Note being redeemed in part; or

               (C) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a
          record date and the next succeeding interest payment date.

          (5) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any
     Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Company may deem and treat the Person
     in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for
     the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Notes
     and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the
     Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

          (6) The Trustee will authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof.

          (7) All certifications, certificates and Opinions of Counsel required
     to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06 to effect a
     registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile.

     Section 2.07 Replacement Notes.


<PAGE>
                                      -41-


     If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company and the
Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft
of any Note, the Company will issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, will authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's
requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity
bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the
Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any
authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is
replaced. The Company may charge for its expenses in replacing a Note.

     Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and will
be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately
with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

     Section 2.08 Outstanding Notes.

     The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the
Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation,
those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in
accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section as
not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not
cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds
the Note; however, Notes held by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
shall not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of Section 3.07(c) hereof.

     If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be
outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the
replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.

     If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01
hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.

     If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate
of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient
to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes will
be deemed to be no longer outstanding and will cease to accrue interest.

     Section 2.09 Treasury Notes.

     In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the
Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with the Company, will be considered as
though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the
Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent,
only Notes that the Trustee knows are so owned will be so disregarded.

     Section 2.10 Temporary Notes.


<PAGE>
                                      -42-


     Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Company
may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will
authenticate temporary notes. Temporary notes will be substantially in the form
of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers
appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company will prepare and the Trustee
will authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary notes.

     Holders of temporary notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this
Indenture.

     Section 2.11 Cancellation.

     The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation.
The Registrar and Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered
to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no
one else will cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer,
exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will dispose of canceled
Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act). The
Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or that have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

     Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest.

     If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it will pay
the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest
payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a
subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes
and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of
the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date
of the proposed payment. The Company will fix or cause to be fixed each such
special record date and payment date, provided that no such special record date
may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted
interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon
the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense
of the Company) will mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states
the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such
interest to be paid.

     Section 2.13 CUSIP Numbers.

     The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally
in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of
redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state
that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as
printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or
omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any
change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

                            REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT


     Section 3.01 Notices to Trustee.

     If the Company elects to redeem Notes pursuant to the optional redemption
provisions of Section 3.07 hereof, it must furnish to the Trustee, at least 45
days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, an Officers'
Certificate setting forth:

          (1) the clause of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption
     shall occur;

          (2) the redemption date;

          (3) the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed; and

          (4) the redemption price.

     Section 3.02 Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed or Purchased.

     If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an offer
to purchase at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption or
purchase as follows:

          (1) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in
     compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities
     exchange on which the Notes are listed; or

          (2) if the Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange,
     on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem
     fair and appropriate.

     In the event of partial redemption or purchase by lot, the particular Notes
to be redeemed or purchased will be selected, unless otherwise provided herein,
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption or purchase date
by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption
or purchase.

     The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes
selected for redemption or purchase and, in the case of any Note selected for
partial redemption or purchase, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed or
purchased. Notes and portions of Notes selected will be in amounts of $1,000 or
whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be
redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such
Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed or purchased. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply
to Notes called for redemption or purchase also apply to portions of Notes
called for redemption or purchase.

     Section 3.03 Notice of Redemption.

     Subject to the provisions of Section 3.09 hereof, at least 30 days but not
more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company will mail or cause to be
mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes
are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may
be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of
this Indenture pursuant to Article 8 or 12 of this Indenture.

     The notice will identify the Notes to be redeemed (including the CUSIP or
ISIN number) and will state:

          (1) the redemption date;

          (2) the redemption price;

          (3) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
     principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption
     date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount
     equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued upon cancellation of the
     original Note;

          (4) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

          (5) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying
     Agent to collect the redemption price;

          (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption
     payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and
     after the redemption date;

          (7) the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture
     pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and

          (8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy
     of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes.

     At the Company's request, the Trustee will give the notice of redemption in
the Company's name and at its expense; provided, however, that the Company has
delivered to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior to the redemption date, an
Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting
forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding
paragraph.

     Section 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption.


<PAGE>
                                      -45-


     Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof,
Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption
date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional.

     Section 3.05 Deposit of Redemption or Purchase Price.

     Prior to 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the redemption or purchase price
date, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the redemption or purchase price of and accrued interest and
Liquidated Damages, if any, on all Notes to be redeemed or purchased on that
date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent will promptly return to the Company any
money deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of
the amounts necessary to pay the redemption or purchase price of, and accrued
interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on, all Notes to be redeemed or
purchased.

     If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on
and after the redemption or purchase date, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase. If a Note is
redeemed or purchased on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the
related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be
paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of
business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption or purchase is
not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of
the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on
the unpaid principal, from the redemption or purchase date until such principal
is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid
principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01
hereof.

     Section 3.06 Notes Redeemed or Purchased in Part.

     Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed or purchased in part, the Company
will issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, the Trustee will
authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Company a new Note equal in
principal amount to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the Note
surrendered.

     Section 3.07 Optional Redemption.

     (a) The Notes will not be subject to any redemption at the option of the
Company except as set forth in the following paragraphs.

     (b) The Notes may be redeemed, in whole part or in part, at any time prior
to [the fifth anniversary of the 15th day of the month in which the Notes are
originally issued] at the option of the Company upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days' prior notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holder's
registered address, at a redemption price equal to, as determined by the
Reference Treasury Dealer, the sum of the present values of the Remaining

issued under this Indenture at a redemption price of 110% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any,

Offerings; provided that:

          (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued
     under this Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence
     of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries); and

          (2) the redemption must occur within 120 days of the date of the
     closing of such Equity Offering.

unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, thereon to the applicable
redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on [the
15th day of the month in which the Notes are originally issued] of the years
indicated below:

   Year                                                           Percentage

   [the fifth anniversary of the year in which the

     Section 3.09 Offer to Purchase by Application of Excess Proceeds.

     In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof, the Company is required
to commence an offer to all Holders to purchase Notes (an "Asset Sale Offer"),
it will follow the procedures specified below.

     The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders and all holders of other
Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to
those set forth in this Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem
with the proceeds of sales of assets. The Asset Sale Offer will remain open for
a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement and not more
than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by
applicable law (the "Offer Period"). No later than three Business Days after the
termination of the Offer Period (the "Purchase Date"), the Company will apply
all Excess Proceeds (the "Offer Amount") to the purchase of Notes and such other
pari passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis, if applicable) or, if less than
the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes and other Indebtedness tendered in
response to the Asset Sale Offer. Payment for any Notes so purchased will be
made in the same manner as interest payments are made.

     If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest, and
Liquidated Damages, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional
interest will be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale
Offer.

     Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company will send, by
first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of the Holders, with a copy
to the Trustee. The notice will contain all instructions and materials necessary
to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. The
notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

          (1) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section
     3.09 and Section 4.10 hereof and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer
     will remain open;

          (2) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

          (3) that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue
     to accrue interest;

          (4) that, unless the Company defaults in making such payment, any Note
     accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue
     interest after the Purchase Date;

          (5) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to an
     Asset Sale Offer may elect to have Notes purchased in integral multiples of
     $1,000 only;


<PAGE>
                                      -48-


          (6) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any
     Asset Sale Offer will be required to surrender the Note, with the form
     entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note
     completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Company, a
     Depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address
     specified in the notice at least three days before the Purchase Date;

          (7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
     Company, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives,
     not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a telegram, telex,
     facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the
     principal amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a
     statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note
     purchased;

          (8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari
     passu Indebtedness surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the
     Company will select the Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness to be
     purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Notes and
     such other pari passu Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as
     may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in
     denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be purchased);
     and

          (9) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part will be
     issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of
     the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer).

     On or before the Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful,
accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer
Amount of Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer,
or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered, and will
deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Section 3.09. The Company, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five days after
the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to
the purchase price of the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the
Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note, and the
Trustee, upon written request from the Company will authenticate and mail or
deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Note not so accepted shall be
promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company
will publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date.

     Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.09, any purchase
pursuant to this Section 3.09 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof.

     Section 4.01 Payment of Notes.

     The Company shall pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes on the dates and
in the manner provided in the Notes. Principal, premium, if any, and interest
and Liquidated Damages, if any will be considered paid on the date due if the
Paying Agent, if other than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, holds as of
10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the due date money deposited by the Company in
immediately available funds and designated for and sufficient to pay all
principal, premium, if any, and interest then due. The Company shall pay all
Liquidated Damages, if any, in the same manner on the dates and in the amounts
set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

     The Company shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at the rate equal to
1% per annum in excess of the then applicable interest rate on the Notes to the
extent lawful; it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest and
Liquidated Damages (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same
rate to the extent lawful.

     Section 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency.

     The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York, an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee or an affiliate
of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where Notes may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company
fails to maintain any such required office or agency or fails to furnish the
Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and
demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such
purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however,
that no such designation or rescission will in any manner relieve the Company of
its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the
City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice
to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency.

          (1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be
     required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if

     financial statements by the Company's certified independent accountants;
     and

          (2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the

Company shall file a copy of all of the information and reports referred to in
clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations (unless the SEC will not
accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities analysts
and prospective investors upon request. In addition, the Company and the
Guarantors have agreed that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, they
shall furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and prospective
investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. The Company will at all times
comply with TIA ss. 314(a).

     Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for
informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

     Section 4.04 Compliance Certificate.

     (a) The Company and each Guarantor (to the extent that such Guarantor is so
required under the TIA) shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officers' Certificate, one of the signers of which
is the chief executive, chief principal or chief accounting officer, stating
that a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the signing
Officers with a view to determining whether the Company has kept, observed,
performed and


<PAGE>

fulfilled its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating, as to each
such Officer signing such certificate, that to the best of his or her knowledge
the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant
contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (or,
if a Default or Event of Default has occurred, describing all such Defaults or
Events of Default of which he or she may have knowledge and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto) and that to the best

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the year-end financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 4.03(a) above shall be accompanied by a
written statement of the Company's independent public accountants (who shall be
a firm of established national reputation) that in making the examination
necessary for certification of such financial statements, nothing has come to
their attention that would lead them to believe that the Company has violated
any provisions of Article 4 or Article 5 hereof or, if any such violation has
occurred, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof, it being
understood that such accountants shall not be liable directly or indirectly to
any Person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation.

     (c) So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Company shall deliver
to the Trustee, forthwith upon any Officer becoming aware of any Default or
Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default or Event of
Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

     Section 4.05 Taxes.

     The Company shall pay, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay,

to the Holders of the Notes.

     Section 4.06 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws.

     The Company and each of the Guarantors covenants (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company and
each of the Guarantors (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it
will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of
any power herein granted to


<PAGE>
                                      -52-


the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as

     without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or
     consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
     or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company's Equity Interests in

          stock ownership plan financed by loans from the Company or a
          Subsidiary of the Company shall be included only to the extent such
          loans have been repaid with cash on or prior to the date of
          determination and (2) any net proceeds received in a form other than
          cash (other than on conversion or in exchange for a security issued

          Restricted Subsidiary into Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Stock)
          of the Company (less the amount of any cash or other property (other
          than such Capital Stock) distributed by the Company or any Restricted

thereby (except as to clauses (1) through (4), (6), (9), (10), (11) and (12)
below), the provisions of Section 4.07(a) will not prohibit:

          (1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of
     declaration of the dividend, if at the date of declaration the dividend
     payment would have complied with the provisions of this Indenture;

          (2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other
     acquisition of any subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or any
     Guarantor or of any Equity Interests of the Company in exchange for, or out
     of the net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than
     to a Restricted Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests (other than Disqualified
     Stock) of the Company or a substantially concurrent capital contribution to
     the Company; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that
     are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or
     other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (3)(B) of the preceding
     paragraph;

          (3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
     subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor in exchange for,
     or with the net cash proceeds from, an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing
     Indebtedness or other Indebtedness incurred under Section 4.09(a) hereof;

          (4) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
     subordinated Indebtedness from Net Proceeds to the extent not prohibited
     under Section 4.10 hereof, provided that such purchase or redemption shall
     be excluded from the calculation of the amount available for Restricted
     Payments pursuant to the preceding paragraph;

          (5) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
     subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or any
     Guarantor following a Change of Control after the Company shall have
     complied with the provisions under Section 4.14 hereof, including payment
     of the applicable Change of Control Payment;

          (6) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for
     value of any Equity Interests of the Company held by any member of the
     Company's (or any of its Subsidiaries') management pursuant to any
     management equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement or other
     equity incentive agreement or plan or held by any former owners of a
     business acquired by the Company or former employees of

                                      -55-


     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, in either case, acquired in
     connection with a sale of a business to the Company; provided that the
     aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or
     retired Equity Interests may not exceed $7.5 million in any twelve-month
     period plus any unutilized portion of such amount in any prior fiscal year;

          (7) any Investment made by the exchange for, or out of the proceeds
     of, a capital contribution in respect of or the substantially concurrent
     sale of, Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company to
     the extent the net cash proceeds thereof are received by the Company,
     provided that the amount of such capital contribution or proceeds used to
     make such Investment shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount
     available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding paragraph;

          (8) other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed
     $30.0 million;

          (9) payments required or contemplated by the terms of the
     Recapitalization Agreement and related documentation as in effect on the
     date of issuance of the Notes, including in respect of restricted stock
     awards of the Company;

          (10) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement of
     Existing Preferred Stock; provided that the aggregate amount of such
     payments under this clause (10) shall not exceed $15.0 million since the
     date of this Indenture;

          (11) Restricted Investments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the
     net cash proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
     (calculated on an after-tax basis) from the sale of common stock of TriMas
     owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the date of this
     Indenture (after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement); and

          (12) the payment of the Saturn Proceeds (as defined in the
     Recapitalization Agreement) under the Recapitalization Agreement.

     The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair
market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities
proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any assets or securities that are required to be valued by this
Section 4.07 will be determined by the Board of Directors acting in good faith
whose resolution with respect thereto shall be conclusive. Any payments
hereunder shall be calculated net of amounts for which the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary is reimbursed under the Stock Purchase Agreement.

     Section 4.08 Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting

     (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted

     modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
     replacements or refinancings of those agreements, provided that the
     amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
     refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as

          (2) this Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;

          (3) applicable law;

     described in clause (3) of Section 4.08(a);

     Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary
     pending its sale or other disposition;

          (7) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions
     contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing
     Indebtedness are


<PAGE>
                                      -57-


     no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the
     agreements governing the Indebtedness being Refinanced;

          (8) Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred
     under the provisions of Section 4.12 hereof that limit the right of the
     debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

          (9) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of
     assets or property in joint venture agreements, assets sale agreements,
     stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into in the
     ordinary course of business;

          (10) any agreement relating to any Indebtedness or Liens incurred by a
     Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company that is a Subsidiary of the
     Company on the date of this Indenture or any Subsidiary carrying on any of
     the businesses of any such Subsidiary) prior to the date on which such
     Person became a Subsidiary of the Company and outstanding on such date and
     not incurred in anticipation of becoming a Subsidiary and not incurred to
     provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate such
     acquisition, which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any
     Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person so
     acquired;

          (11) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Foreign
     Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement relating to Indebtedness which is
     permitted under Section 4.09 hereof or Liens incurred by such Foreign
     Subsidiary;

          (12) Indebtedness or other contractual requirements of a Receivables
     Subsidiary in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction, provided
     that such restrictions apply only to such Receivables Subsidiary; and

          (13) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
     customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.

     Section 4.09 Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.

     (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee
or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to issue any shares of
preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness or Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors may issue preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued
would


<PAGE>
                                      -58-


have been at least 2.25 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred or the preferred stock or Disqualified Stock had
been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

     (b) The provisions of Section 4.09(a) will not prohibit the incurrence of
any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):

          (1) (a) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of
     Indebtedness and letters of credit under the revolving facility component
     of the Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
     outstanding under this clause (1)(a) (with letters of credit being deemed
     to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed $250.0 million; and

          (b) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of
     Indebtedness under the term loan components of the Credit Facilities in an
     aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause
     (1)(b) not to exceed the amount outstanding on the date of issuance of the
     Notes, after giving effect to the actual use of proceeds from the issuance
     of the Notes, less the aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales
     applied by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to repay the
     principal of any term Indebtedness under a Credit Facility since the date
     of this Indenture; and

          (c) the incurrence of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted
     Subsidiary under one or more receivables financing facilities pursuant to
     which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pledges or otherwise borrows
     against its Receivables in an aggregate principal amount which, when taken
     together with all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (c)
     and then outstanding, does not exceed 85% of the consolidated book value of
     the Receivables of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (to the
     extent such Receivables or any other Receivables of the Company or such
     Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, are not then being financed
     pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Transaction or as a basis for
     Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (10) of this Section 4.09(b));

          (2) the incurrence by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries of
     the Existing Indebtedness;

          (3) the incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness
     represented by the Notes and the related Note Guarantees to be issued on
     the date of this Indenture and the Exchange Notes and the related Note
     Guarantees to be issued pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement;


<PAGE>
                                      -59-


          (4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
     Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings
     or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of
     financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or
     improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the
     Company or such Restricted Subsidiary ("Capital Spending") and incurred no
     later than 270 days after the date of such acquisition or the date of
     completion of such construction or improvement, provided that the principal
     amount of any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4) (other than
     Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness) at any time during a single fiscal year
     shall not exceed 30% of the total Capital Spending of the Company and the
     Restricted Subsidiaries made during the period of the most recently
     completed four consecutive fiscal quarters prior to the date of such
     incurrence;

          (5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
     Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the
     net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness
     (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by this Indenture
     to be incurred under Section 4.09(a) or clause (2), (3), (4), (5), (8), (9)
     or (15) of this Section 4.09(b);

          (6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
     Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and
     any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

               (a) if the Company or any Guarantor is the obligor on such
          Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be (i) unsecured and (ii) if the
          obligee is neither the Company nor a Guarantor, expressly subordinated
          to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect
          to the Notes (in the case of the Company) (or the Note Guarantee, in
          the case of a Guarantor); and

               (b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests
          that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other
          than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (ii)
          any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that
          is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
          will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
          Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
          may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

          (7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
     Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of
     hedging (i) interest rate risk or the impact of interest rate fluctuations
     on the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) in the case
     of currency or commodity protection agreements, against currency exchange
     rate or commodity price fluctuations in the ordinary course of the Company
     and the Restricted Subsidiaries' respective businesses and, in the case of
     both (i) and (ii), not for purposes of speculation;


<PAGE>
                                      -60-


          (8) the guarantee by the Company or any of the Guarantors of
     Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that was permitted
     to be incurred by another provision of this Section 4.09;

          (9) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original
     issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of
     additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends
     on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of similar
     Disqualified Stock shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness
     or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 4.09;
     provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in Fixed
     Charges of the Company as accrued;

          (10) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries incurred for working capital
     purposes if, at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness, and after
     giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness
     of the Foreign Subsidiaries incurred pursuant to this clause (10) and then
     outstanding does not exceed the amount equal to the sum of (x) 80% the
     consolidated book value of the accounts receivable of the Foreign
     Subsidiaries and (y) 60% the consolidated book value of the inventories of
     the Foreign Subsidiaries;

          (11) Indebtedness incurred in respect of (a) workers' compensation
     claims, self-insurance obligations, bankers' acceptances, performance,
     surety and similar bonds and completion guarantees provided by the Company
     or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, (b) in
     respect of performance bonds or similar obligations of the Company or any
     of the Restricted Subsidiaries for or in connection with pledges, deposits
     or payments made or given in the ordinary course of business and not for
     money borrowed in connection with or to secure statutory, regulatory or
     similar obligations, including obligations under health, safety or
     environmental obligations, and (c) arising from guarantees to suppliers,
     lessors, licensees, contractors, franchises or customers of obligations
     incurred in the ordinary course of business and not for money borrowed;

          (12) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a
     Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase
     price or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in
     connection with the disposition of any business, assets or Capital Stock of
     a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that the maximum aggregate liability in
     respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds
     actually received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in
     connection with such disposition;

          (13) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other
     financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument (except in
     the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the
     ordinary course of business, provided,


<PAGE>
                                      -61-


     however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days
     of incurrence;

          (14) the incurrence by a Receivables Subsidiary of Indebtedness in a
     Qualified Receivables Transaction that is without recourse to the Company
     or to any other Subsidiary of the Company or their assets (other than such
     Receivables Subsidiary and its assets and, as to the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company, other than pursuant to representations,
     warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for such transactions) and
     is not guaranteed by any such Person;

          (15) the issuance and sale of preferred stock (a) by a Foreign
     Subsidiary in lieu of the issuance of non-voting common stock if (i) the
     laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Subsidiary precludes the
     issuance of non-voting common stock and (ii) the preferential rights
     afforded to the holders of such preferred stock are limited to those
     customarily provided for in such jurisdiction in respect of the issuance of
     non-voting stock, (b) by a Restricted Subsidiary which is a joint venture
     with a third party which is not an Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted
     Subsidiary, and (c) by a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to obligations with
     respect to the issuance or sale of Preferred Stock which exist at the time
     such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and which were not created in
     connection with or in contemplation of such Person becoming a Restricted
     Subsidiary; and

          (16) the incurrence by the Company or any of the Restricted
     Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount
     (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all
     Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, incurred to refund, refinance or
     replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (16), not to
     exceed $35.0 million.

     For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the event
that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (16) above, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a), the Company will be
permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence,
or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner
that complies with this Section 4.09. Indebtedness under Credit Facilities
outstanding on the date on which Notes are first issued and authenticated under
this Indenture will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on
the exception provided by clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of "Permitted
Debt".

     For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent
principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first
committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such
Indebtedness is incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency,


<PAGE>
                                      -62-


and such Refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being Refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company may incur pursuant
to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
Refinancing.

     Section 4.10 Asset Sales.

     The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

          (1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be)
     receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the
     fair market value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or
     otherwise disposed of;

          (2) the fair market value is determined by the Company's Board of
     Directors and evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth
     in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee; and

          (3) either (a) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset
     Sale by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or
     (b) the aggregate non-cash consideration for all Asset Sales not meeting
     the criteria set forth in the preceding clause (a) does not exceed a fair
     market value in excess of $20.0 million. For purposes of this provision,
     each of the following shall be deemed to be cash:

               (A) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's or such Restricted
          Subsidiary's most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or
          any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and
          liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any
          Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets
          pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Company
          or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability; and

               (B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the
          Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee to the
          extent within 60 days, subject to ordinary settlement periods, they
          are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash.


<PAGE>
                                      -63-


     Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale,
the Company may apply such Net Proceeds at its option:

          (1) to permanently repay Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is
     by its terms subordinated to, or pari passu with, the Notes or any Note
     Guarantee) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any
     Obligations under a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is
     revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with
     respect thereto or to reduce receivables advances and reduce commitments in
     respect of a Receivables Facility;

          (2) to acquire assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, any
     person owning assets used or usable in a business of the Company and the
     Restricted Subsidiary; or

          (3) to make a capital expenditure.

     Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Company may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest or use the
Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

     Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as
provided in the preceding paragraph (other than Net Proceeds from the sale of
the common stock of TriMas after the date of this Indenture) will constitute
"Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0
million, within five days thereof, the Company will make an Asset Sale Offer to
all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu
with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this
Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of
sales of assets in accordance with Section 3.09 hereof to purchase the maximum
principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer
will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Liquidated Damages, if any, to the date of purchase, and will be payable in
cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer,
the Company may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and
other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other
pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of
each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each
repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of
Sections 3.09 or 4.10 of this Indenture, the Company shall comply with the

<PAGE>
                                      -64-


applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under those provisions of this Indenture by virtue of
such conflict.

     Section 4.11 Transactions with Affiliates.

     (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

          (1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less
     favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or the relevant Restricted
     Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained at the time in a
     comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
     unaffiliated Person; and

          (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

               (A) except when the opinion referred to in the following clause
          (b) is delivered, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series
          of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in
          excess of $5.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors set
          forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate
          Transaction complies with Section 4.11(a) and that such Affiliate
          Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested
          members of the Board of Directors; and

               (B) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
          related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in
          excess of $25.0 million, an opinion as to the fairness to the Company
          of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by
          an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
          standing.

     (b) The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions
and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 4.11(a):

          (1) loans or advances to employees, indemnification agreements with
     and the payment of fees and indemnities to directors, officers and
     full-time employees of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries and
     employment, non-competition or confidentiality agreements entered into with
     any such person in the ordinary course of business;

          (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in
     cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment,
     compensation or indemnification arrangements, stock options and stock
     ownership plans in the ordinary


<PAGE>
                                      -65-


     course of business to or with officers, directors or employees of the
     Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, or approved by the Board of
     Directors;

          (3) transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted
     Subsidiaries;

          (4) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Company
     solely because the Company owns an Equity Interest in, or controls, such
     Person;

          (5) transactions pursuant to agreements existing on the date of this
     Indenture, including, without limitation, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
     Shareholders Agreement, the TriMas Shareholders Agreement and the TriMas
     Corporate Services Agreement, and, in each case, any amendment or
     supplement thereto that, taken in its entirety, is no less favorable to the
     Company than such agreement as in effect on the date of this Indenture;

          (6) sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the
     Company to Affiliates of the Company or the receipt of capital
     contributions by the Company;

          (7) payment of certain fees under the Advisory Agreement;

          (8) transactions (in connection with a Qualified Receivables
     Transaction) between or among the Company and/or its Restricted
     Subsidiaries or transactions between a Receivables Subsidiary and any
     Person in which the Receivables Subsidiary has an Investment;

          (9) any management, service, purchase, lease, supply or similar
     agreement entered into in the ordinary course of the Company's business
     between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
     Subsidiary or any Affiliate, so long as the Company determines in good
     faith (which determination shall be conclusive) that any such agreement is
     on terms no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
     than those that could be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction
     with an entity that is not an Affiliate; and

          (10) Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments that are permitted
     by Section 4.07 hereof.

     Section 4.12 Liens.

     The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of their property or assets,
now owned or hereafter acquired to secure any Indebtedness without making, or
causing such Subsidiary to make, effective provision for securing the Notes or,
in


<PAGE>
                                      -66-


respect of Liens on any Guarantor's property or assets, any Guarantee of such
Guarantor, (x) equally and ratably with such Indebtedness as to such property or
assets for so long as such Indebtedness will be so secured or (y) in the event
such Indebtedness is subordinated Indebtedness, prior to such Indebtedness as to
such property or assets for so long as such Indebtedness will be so secured.

     Section 4.13 Corporate Existence.

     Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect:

          (1) its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other
     existence of each of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective
     organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of
     the Company or any such Subsidiary; and

          (2) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not
     be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the
     corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Subsidiaries, if
     the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
     longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in
     any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.

     Section 4.14 Offer to Repurchase upon Change of Control.

     (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall make an
offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part
(equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000) of each Holder's Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages on the Notes repurchased, if
any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 15 days
following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control
and stating:

          (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this
     Section 4.14 and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;

          (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no later
     than 30 Business Days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of
     Control Payment Date");

          (3) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;


<PAGE>
                                      -67-


          (4) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of
     Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
     Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control
     Payment Date;

          (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a
     Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Notes, with the
     form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the
     Notes completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice
     prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the
     Change of Control Payment Date;

          (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
     Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second
     Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram,
     telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the
     Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a
     statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes
     purchased; and

          (7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be
     issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of
     the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $1,000 in
     principal amount or an integral multiple thereof.

     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of Section 3.09 or this Section 4.14, the Company will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under Section 3.09 or this Section 4.14 by virtue of
such conflict.

     (b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent
lawful:

          (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered
     pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

          (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of
     Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly
     tendered; and

          (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so
     accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate
     principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the
     Company.

     The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly
tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will
promptly authenticate and


<PAGE>
                                      -68-


mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal
in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an
integral multiple thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control
Payment Date.

     Prior to complying with any of the provisions of this Section 4.14, but in
any event within 90 days following a Change of Control, the Company will either
repay all outstanding Senior Debt or obtain the requisite consents, if any,
under all agreements governing outstanding Senior Debt to permit the repurchase
of notes required by this Section 4.14.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.14, the
Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this
Section 4.14 and Section 3.09 hereof and purchases all Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. Alternatively, the Company
may assign all or part of its obligations to purchase all Notes validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn under a Change of Control Offer to a third party. In
the event of such an assignment, the Company shall be released from its
obligations to purchase the Notes as to which the assignment relates subject to
the third party purchasing such Notes. A Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making
of the Change of Control Offer. Notes repurchased by the Company pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding
or will be retired and canceled, at the option of the Company. Notes purchased
by a third party upon assignment will have the status of Note issued and
outstanding.

     Section 4.15 Anti-Layering.

     The Company shall not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become liable for any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of
payment to any Senior Debt of the Company and senior in any respect in right of
payment to the Notes. No Guarantor shall incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee
or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in
right of payment to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor and senior in any respect
in right of payment to such Guarantor's Note Guarantee. The foregoing shall not
affect the Company's 4.5% subordinated debentures due 2003 or 11% senior
subordinated notes due 2012, in each case, outstanding on the date of this
Indenture.

     Section 4.16 Additional Notes Guarantees.

     After the date of original issuance of the Notes, the Company shall cause
each Restricted Subsidiary, other than a Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary
Guarantor, that becomes a guarantor or other obligor with respect to the
obligations of the Company or a Domestic Restricted Subsidiary under the Credit
Agreement to execute and deliver to the trustee a Guar-


<PAGE>
                                      -69-


antee pursuant to which such Guarantor shall unconditionally Guarantee, on a
joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on a senior subordinated basis.

     Section 4.17 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

     The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated will be deemed to
be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the
amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of Section
4.07 hereof or Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That
designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that
time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a
Default.


                                   ARTICLE 5.

                                   SUCCESSORS


     Section 5.01 Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets.

     The Company shall not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge
with or into another Person (whether or not the Company is the surviving
corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions,
to another Person; unless:

          (1) either:

               (A) the Company is the surviving corporation; or

               (B) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
          merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment,
          transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is a
          corporation organized or existing under the laws of the United States,
          any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

          (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
     (if other than the Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment,
     transfer, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes all
     the obligations of the


<PAGE>
                                      -70-


     Company under the Notes, this Indenture and the Registration Rights
     Agreement pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

          (3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
     exists; and

          (4) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such
     consolidation or merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale,
     assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made will,
     on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and
     any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the
     beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at
     least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
     Coverage Ratio test set forth in Section 4.09(a) hereof.

     In addition, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, lease all or
substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related
transactions, to any other Person. This Section 5.01 will not apply to a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among
the Company and any of the Guarantors.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture, a Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate with, merge into or convey, lease, sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary; and the Company may merge with an Affiliate
incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another
jurisdiction in the United States to realize tax or other benefits.

     Section 5.02 Successor Corporation Substituted.

     Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company in a transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the
provisions of, Section 5.01 hereof, the successor corporation formed by such
consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall
succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such
consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the
provisions of this Indenture referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to
the successor corporation and not to the Company), and may exercise every right
and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Company herein; provided, however, that
the predecessor Company shall not be relieved from the obligation to pay the
principal of and interest on the Notes except in the case of a sale of all of
the Company's assets in a transaction that is subject to, and that complies with
the provisions of, Section 5.01 hereof.

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES


     Section 6.01 Events of Default.

     Each of the following is an "Event of Default":

          (1) the Company defaults for 30 days in the payment when due of

          (5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which
     there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
     Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is
     created after the date of this Indenture, if that default:

               (A) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness

     any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its
     obligations under its Note Guarantee;

          (8) the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any group of
     Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant

          Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole,

          all of the property of the Company or any of its Significant
          Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole,
          would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or

at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all
the Notes to be due and payable immediately by giving notice in writing to the
Company and the Trustee specifying the respective Event of Default (the

of an acceleration under the Credit Agreement or five Business Days after
receipt by the Company and the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement
of such Acceleration Notice (but only if such Event of Default is then
continuing).

     Upon any such declaration, the Notes shall become due and payable
immediately. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of the
Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default
(except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely
because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.

     In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event
of Default described in Section 6.01(5) has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (5) shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (a) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (b) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

     Section 6.03 Other Remedies.

     If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any
available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium and Liquidated
Damages, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any
provision of the Notes or this Indenture.

     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of
the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission
by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy
accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

     Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults.


<PAGE>
                                      -74-


     Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of
all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest
on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase); provided,
however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences,
including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration. Upon
any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default
arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

     Section 6.05 Control by Majority.

     Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising
any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred
on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial
to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in
personal liability.

     Section 6.06 Limitation on Suits.

     A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or
the Notes only if:

          (1) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a
     continuing Event of Default;

          (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
     outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the
     remedy;

          (3) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if requested,
     provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
     loss, liability or expense;

          (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after
     receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of
     indemnity satisfactory to it; and

          (5) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal
     amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction
     inconsistent with the request.


<PAGE>
                                      -75-


     A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of
another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another
Holder of a Note.

     Section 6.07 Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any
Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Liquidated
Damages, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to
bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective
dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

     Section 6.08 Collection Suit by Trustee.

     If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as
trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of
principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest remaining
unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful,
interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

     Section 6.09 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

     The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall
be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such
judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to
the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of
such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to
it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in
any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall
be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions,
dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be
entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan
of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of


<PAGE>
                                      -76-


any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
Holder in any such proceeding.

     Section 6.10 Priorities.

     If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay
out the money in the following order:

          First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under
     Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expense and
     liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs
     and expenses of collection;

          Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes
     for principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest,
     ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the
     amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium and Liquidated
     Damages, if any and interest, respectively; and

          Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent
     jurisdiction shall direct.

     The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.

     Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs.

     In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture
or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a
Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant
in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its
discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11
does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant
to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes.

the same degree of care


<PAGE>
                                      -77-

circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

     (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

          (1) the duties of the Trustee will be determined solely by the express
     provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee need perform only those duties
     that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no
     implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against
     the Trustee; and

          (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
     conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
     the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to
     the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However,
     the Trustee will examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether
     or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

     (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent
action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except

     or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by

Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of this Section 7.01.

     (e) No provision of this Indenture will require the Trustee to expend or
risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture at the
request of any Holders, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee security
and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

     (f) The Trustee will not be liable for interest on any money received by it
except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust

     Section 7.02 Rights of Trustee.

be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The
Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

     (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an
Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee will not be
liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on

responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due

the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security
or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred
by it in compliance with such request or direction.

     (g) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event
of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge
thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is
received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such
notice references the Notes and this Indenture.

     (h) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to
the Trustee, including without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are

     Section 7.03 Individual Rights of Trustee.

     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in
the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate
such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as
trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The
Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.

     Section 7.04 Trustee's Disclaimer.

     The Trustee will not be responsible for and makes no representation as to
the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be
accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money
paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision of this
Indenture, it will not be responsible for the use or application of any money
received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it will not be
responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or
any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this
Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.

     Section 7.05 Notice of Defaults.

     If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
known to the Trustee, the Trustee will mail to Holders of Notes a notice of the
Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case
of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium or
Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good
faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders
of the Notes.

     Section 7.06 Reports by Trustee to Holders of the Notes.

     (a) Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following
the date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the
Trustee will mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of such
reporting date that complies with TIA ss. 313(a) (but if no event described in
TIA ss. 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting
date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also will comply with TIA ss.
313(b)(2). The Trustee will also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA
ss. 313(c).

     (b) A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of
Notes will be mailed by the Trustee to the Company and filed by the Trustee with
the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with
TIA ss. 313(d). The Company will promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are
listed on or delisted from any stock exchange.

     Section 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity.


<PAGE>
                                      -80-


     (a) The Company will pay to the Trustee as shall be agreed in writing
between the Trustee and the Company from time to time reasonable compensation
for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder. The Trustee's
compensation will not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an
express trust. The Company will reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for
all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in
addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses will include the
reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and
counsel.

     (b) The Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the Trustee and any
predecessor Trustee against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or
determined by the income of the Trustee), incurred by it arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against
the Company and the Guarantors (including this Section 7.07) and defending
itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, the Guarantors or any
Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any
such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its negligence or bad
faith. The Trustee will notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it
may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company will not
relieve the Company or any of the Guarantors of their obligations hereunder. The
Company or such Guarantor will defend the claim and the Trustee will cooperate
in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company will pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. Neither the Company nor any
Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.

     (c) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section
7.07 will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the
resignation or removal of the Trustee.

     (d) To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the
Trustee will have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or
collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and
interest on particular Notes. Such Lien will survive the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture.

     (e) When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or (9) hereof occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and
counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law.

     (f) The Trustee will comply with the provisions of TIA ss. 313(b)(2) to the
extent applicable.

     Section 7.08 Replacement of Trustee.


<PAGE>
                                      -81-


     (a) A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee will become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of
appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.

     (b) The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from
the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so
notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the
Trustee if:

          (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

          (2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for
     relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;

          (3) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its
     property; or

          (4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

     (c) If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the
office of Trustee for any reason, the Company will promptly appoint a successor
Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

     (d) If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or
the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company,
in the case of the Trustee, for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

     (e) If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a
Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

     (f) A successor Trustee will deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective, and the
successor Trustee will have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee
under this Indenture. The successor Trustee will mail a notice of its succession
to Holders. The retiring Trustee will promptly transfer all property held by it
as Trustee to the successor Trustee, provided all sums owing to the Trustee
hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07
hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section
7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof will continue for the
benefit of the retiring Trustee.

     Section 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

     If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the
successor corporation without any further act will be the successor Trustee.

     Section 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification.

     There will at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate

authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million
as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.

     This Indenture will always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of
TIA ss. 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is subject to TIA ss. 310(b).

     Section 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

     The Trustee is subject to TIA ss. 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA ss. 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA ss. 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

                    LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE


     Section 8.01 Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

     The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a
resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have
either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon
compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.

     Section 8.02 Legal Defeasance and Discharge.

     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company and each of the Guarantors will,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof,
be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all
outstanding Notes (including the Note Guarantees) on the date the conditions set
forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose,
Legal Defeasance means that the Company and the Guarantors will be deemed to
have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding
Notes (including


<PAGE>
                                      -83-


the Note Guarantees), which will thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only
for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture
referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all their other
obligations under such Notes, the Note Guarantees and this Indenture (and the
Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper
instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which
will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:

          (1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in
     respect of the principal of, or interest or premium and Liquidated Damages,
     if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to
     in Section 8.04 hereof;

          (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article
     2 and Section 4.02 hereof;

          (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee
     hereunder and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection
     therewith; and

          (4) this Article 8.

     Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Company may exercise its
option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option
under Section 8.03 hereof.

     Section 8.03 Covenant Defeasance.

     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company and the Guarantors will, subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released
from each of their obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.07,
4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17 hereof and clause
(4) of Section 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after
the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied
(hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes will thereafter be deemed
not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or
declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in
connection with such covenants, but will continue to be deemed "outstanding" for
all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes will not be
deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant
Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Note
Guarantees, the Company and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and will have
no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any
such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference
elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such
covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such
omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under
Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this
Indenture and such Notes and Note Guarantees will be unaffected thereby. In
addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the

                                      -84-


option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(3) through
6.01(5) hereof will not constitute Events of Default.

     Section 8.04 Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.

     In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under
either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof:

          (1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust,
     for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in United States dollars,
     non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such
     amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
     firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium
     and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on
     the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date,
     as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes are
     being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

          (2) in the case of an election under Section 8.02 hereof, the Company
     has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States
     reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that:

               (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published
          by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or

               (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in
          the applicable federal income tax law,

          in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of
          Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will
          not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as
          a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal
          income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
          times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
          occurred;

          (3) in the case of an election under Section 8.03 hereof, the Company
     must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States
     reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the
     outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
     income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be
     subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
     at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
     had not occurred;


<PAGE>
                                      -85-


          (4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of
     Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
     deposit);

          (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a
     breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material
     agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries is bound;

          (6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
     stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
     preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company
     with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other
     creditors of the Company or others; and

          (7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
     and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent
     provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance
     have been complied with.

     In the event that the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or
covenant defeasance option, each of the Guarantors will be released from all of
its obligations with respect to its guarantee. The Company may exercise its
legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of the covenant
defeasance option.

     Section 8.05 Deposited Money and Government Securities to Be Held in Trust;
                  Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

     Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government
Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other
qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes
will be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the
provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to
become due thereon in respect of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if
any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except
to the extent required by law.

     The Company will pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government
Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and
interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other
charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, the Trustee
will deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the
Company any money or non-


<PAGE>
                                      -86-


callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof
which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the
Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(1) hereof), are
in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to
effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

     Section 8.06 Repayment to Company.

     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium or Liquidated
Damages, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest has
become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then
held by the Company) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such
Note will thereafter be permitted to look only to the Company for payment
thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to
such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent,
before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the
Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that,
after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 days from the
date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money
then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

     Section 8.07 Reinstatement.

     If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars
or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03
hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under this
Indenture and the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be revived and reinstated
as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until
such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in
accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided,
however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium or
Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement
of its obligations, the Company will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders
of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or
Paying Agent.

                                   ARTICLE 9.

                        AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER


     Section 9.01 Without Consent of Holders of Notes.

     Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company, the Guarantors
and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Note Guarantees or
the Notes without the consent of any Holder of a Note:

          (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

          (2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
     certificated Notes or to alter the provisions of Article 2 hereof
     (including the related definitions) in a manner that does not materially
     adversely affect any Holder;

          (3) to provide for the assumption of the Company's or a Guarantor's
     obligations to the Holders of the Notes by a successor to the Company
     pursuant to Article 5 hereof; (4) to make any change that would provide any
     additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not
     adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any Holder of the Note;

          (5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or
     maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;

          (6) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or
     a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes; or

          (7) to conform to any future amendment or supplement to the 2002
     Indenture, the 2012 Notes or the related guarantees, unless such conforming
     amendment or supplement to this Indenture would otherwise require the
     consent of each Holder affected under Section 9.02 hereof.

     Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of
Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section
7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Company and the Guarantors in the
execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by
the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and
stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee will not be
obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

                                      -88-


     Section 9.02 With Consent of Holders of Notes.

     Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee
may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Section
3.09, 4.10 and 4.14 hereof), the Note Guarantees and the Notes with the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase
of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing
Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest
on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has
been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Note
Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single
class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Section 2.08 hereof shall determine which
Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.

     Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of
Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the
Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by
the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will
join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture
unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own
rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case
the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such
amended or supplemental Indenture.

     It is not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this
Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver,
but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

     After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes
effective, the Company will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a
notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of
the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in
any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a
single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with
any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. However, without the consent of
each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not
(with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

          (1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to
     an amendment, supplement or waiver;


<PAGE>
                                      -89-


          (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note
     or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of
     the Notes except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and
     4.14 hereof;

          (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest,
     including default interest, on any Note;

          (4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of
     or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on the Notes (except
     a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
     majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a
     waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

          (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the
     Notes;

          (6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to
     waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive
     payments of principal of, or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if
     any, on the Notes;

          (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 hereof or in the foregoing
     amendment and waiver provisions;

          (8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note
     Guarantee or this Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of this
     Indenture; or

          (9) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a
     payment required by Sections 4.10 and 4.14).

     In addition, any amendment to, or waiver of, the provisions of this
Indenture relating to subordination that adversely affects the rights of the
Holders of the Notes will require the consent of the Holders of at least 75% in
aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

     Section 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.

     Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes will be set
forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then
in effect.

     Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents.

     Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it
by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every
subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as
the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any
Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may
revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives


<PAGE>
                                      -90-


written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment
becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in
accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

     Section 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes.

     The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment,
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment,
supplement or waiver.

     Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

     Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendment, etc.

     The Trustee will sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company
may not sign an amended or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors
approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental Indenture, the Trustee
will be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully
protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section
12.04 hereof, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that
the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or
permitted by this Indenture.


                                   ARTICLE 10.

                                  SUBORDINATION


     Section 10.01 Agreement to Subordinate.

     The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the
Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the
extent and in the manner provided in this Article 10, to the prior payment in
full of all Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter
created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the
benefit of the holders of Senior Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, the 2012
Notes are parri passu in right of payment to the Indebtedness evidenced by the
Notes.

     Section 10.02 Certain Definitions.

     "Designated Senior Debt" means:


<PAGE>
                                      -91-


          (1) any Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facilities and all
     Hedging Obligations with respect thereto; and

          (2) after payment in full of all Obligations under the Credit
     Facilities, any other Senior Debt permitted under this Indenture the
     principal amount of which is $25.0 million or more and that has been
     designated by the Company as "Designated Senior Debt."

     "Permitted Junior Securities" means:

          (1) Equity Interests in the Company or any Guarantor; or

          (2) debt securities that are subordinated to all Senior Debt and any
     debt securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt to substantially the
     same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Notes and the Note
     Guarantees are subordinated to Senior Debt under this Indenture.

     "Representative" means the indenture trustee or other trustee, agent or
representative for any Senior Debt.

     "Senior Debt" means:

          (1) all Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor outstanding under
     Credit Facilities and all Hedging Obligations with respect thereto;

          (2) any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor permitted
     to be incurred under the terms of this Indenture, unless the instrument
     under which such Indebtedness is incurred expressly provides that it is on
     a parity with or subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Note
     Guarantee; and

          (3) all Obligations with respect to the items listed in the preceding
     clauses (1) and (2).

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Senior Debt will
not include:

          (1) any liability for federal, state, local or other taxes owed or
     owing by the Company;

          (2) any intercompany Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to the Company or any of its Affiliates;

          (3) any trade payables; or


<PAGE>
                                      -92-


          (4) the portion of any Indebtedness that is incurred in violation of
     this Indenture; provided that such Indebtedness shall be deemed not to have
     been incurred in violation of this Indenture for purposes of this clause
     (4) if such Indebtedness consists of Indebtedness under any Credit Facility
     and holders of such Indebtedness or their Representative (i) had no actual
     knowledge at the time of the incurrence that the incurrence of such
     Indebtedness violated this Indenture and (ii) shall have received an
     Officers' Certificate to the effect that the incurrence of such
     Indebtedness does not violate the provisions of this Indenture.

     Section 10.03 Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy.

     Upon any distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or
dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, in
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company's
assets and liabilities:

          (1) holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full
     of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest
     after the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding at the rate specified
     in the applicable Senior Debt) before the Holders of Notes will be entitled
     to receive any payment with respect to the Notes (except that Holders of
     Notes may receive and retain Permitted Junior Securities and payments made
     from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof); and

          (2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in
     clause (1) above) are paid in full, any distribution to which Holders would
     be entitled but for this Article 10 will be made to holders of Senior Debt
     (except that Holders of Notes may receive and retain Permitted Junior
     Securities and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to
     Section 8.01 hereof), as their interests may appear.

     Section 10.04 Default on Designated Senior Debt.

     (a) The Company may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or
any Holder in respect of Obligations with respect to the Notes and may not
acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property (other
than Permitted Junior Securities and payments made from any defeasance trust
created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof) until all principal and other
Obligations with respect to the Senior Debt have been paid in full if:

          (1) payment default on Designated Senior Debt occurs and is continuing
     beyond any applicable grace period in the agreement, indenture or other
     document governing such Designated Senior Debt; or

          (2) any other default occurs and is continuing on any series of
     Designated Senior Debt that permits holders of that series of Designated
     Senior Debt to accelerate


<PAGE>
                                      -93-


     its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a "Payment
     Blockage Notice") from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior
     Debt. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no
     subsequent Payment Blockage Notice will be effective for purposes of this
     Section unless and until (A) at least 360 days have elapsed since the
     effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice and (B) all
     scheduled payments of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any,
     and interest on the Notes that have come due have been paid in full in
     cash.

     No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of
delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee may be, or may be made,
the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default has have
been waived for a period of not less than 90 days.

     (b) The Company may and will resume payments on and distributions in
respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon the earlier of:

          (1) in the case of a payment default, upon the date upon which such
     default is cured or waived, or

          (2) in the case of a nonpayment default, upon the earlier of the date
     on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived or 179 days after the
     date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, unless
     the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated,

if this Article 10 otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at
the time of such payment or acquisition.

     Section 10.05 Acceleration of Notes.

     If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the
Company will promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration.

     Section 10.06 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.

     In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment of any
Obligations with respect to the Notes (other than Permitted Junior Securities
and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01
hereof) at a time when the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has actual
knowledge that such payment is prohibited by Section 10.04 hereof, such payment
will be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and
will be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to, the holders
of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the
agreement, indenture or other document (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt
may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application
to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid
to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accor-


<PAGE>
                                      -94-


dance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.

     With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to
perform only those obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically
set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with
respect to the holders of Senior Debt will be read into this Indenture against
the Trustee. The Trustee will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Debt, and will not be liable to any such holders if the
Trustee pays over or distributes to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or
any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt are then
entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a
result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.

     Section 10.07 Notice by Company.

     The Company will promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any
facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with
respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice
will not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt as provided in
this Article 10.

     Section 10.08 Subrogation.

     After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full,
Holders of Notes will be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other
Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt
to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that
distributions otherwise payable to the Holders of Notes have been applied to the
payment of Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Article 10 to holders of
Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of Notes is not, as
between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on the Notes.

     Section 10.09 Relative Rights.

     This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and holders
of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture will:

          (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders of Notes, the
     obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay
     principal of, premium and interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on the
     Notes in accordance with their terms;

          (2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and creditors of
     the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt;
     or

          (3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its
     available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the
     rights of holders and own-

                                      -95-


     ers of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable
     to Holders of Notes.

     If the Company fails because of this Article 10 to pay principal of,
premium or interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, on a Note on the due date,
the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.

     Section 10.10 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company.

     No right of any holder of Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the
Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes may be impaired by any act or failure to act
by the Company or any Holder or by the failure of the Company or any Holder to
comply with this Indenture.

     Section 10.11 Distribution or Notice to Representative.

     Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of
Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their
Representative.

     Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in
this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes will be entitled to rely
upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any
certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or
other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes
for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the
Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.

     Section 10.12 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.

     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of
this Indenture, the Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of the existence
of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by
the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments
on the Notes, unless the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at
least five Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of
facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes
to violate this Article 10. Only the Company or a Representative may give the
notice. Nothing in this Article 10 will impair the claims of, or payments to,
the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.

     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt
with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the
same with like rights.

     Section 10.13 Authorization to Effect Subordination.

     Each Holder of Notes, by the Holder's acceptance thereof, authorizes and
directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this
Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holder's attorney-in-fact
for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of
claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in
Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file
such claim, the Representatives are hereby authorized to file an appropriate
claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.

     Section 10.14 Amendments.

     The provisions of this Article 10 may not be amended or modified without
the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt.


                                   ARTICLE 11.

                                 NOTE GUARANTEE


     Section 11.01 Guarantees.

     (a) Subject to this Article 11, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns,
irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or
the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:

          (1) the principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and
     interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at
     maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the
     overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all
     other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or
     thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance
     with the terms hereof and thereof; and

          (2) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any
     Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in
     full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or
     renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.

     Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so
guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally
obligated to pay the


<PAGE>
                                      -97-


same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and
not a guarantee of collection.

     (b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are
unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions
hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action
to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever
and covenant that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete
performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.

     (c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or
other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the
Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note
Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full
force and effect.

     (d) Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed
hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each
Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and
the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the
obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof
for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of
such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or
not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for
the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors will have the right to seek
contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right
does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.

     Section 11.02 Subordination of Note Guarantee.

     The Obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee pursuant to this
Article 11 will be junior and subordinated to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor
on the same basis as the Notes are junior and subordinated to Senior Debt of the
Company. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Trustee and the Holders
will have the right to receive and/or retain payments by any of the Guarantors
only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the
Notes pursuant to this Indenture, including Section 10.01 hereof.

     Section 11.03 Limitation on Guarantor Liability.


<PAGE>
                                      -98-


     Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby
confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of
such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes
of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any
Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders
and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such
Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect
to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such
Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any
collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on
behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other
Guarantor under this Article 11, result in the obligations of such Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

     Section 11.04 Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantee.

     To evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each Guarantor
hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit E hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on
each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture
will be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.

     Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section
11.01 will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to
endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.

     If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note Guarantee
no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on
which a Note Guarantee is endorsed, the Note Guarantee will be valid
nevertheless.

     The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof
hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this
Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.

     In the event that the Company creates or acquires any Domestic Subsidiary
after the date of this Indenture that are guarantors or borrowers in respect of
the Credit Agreement, if required by Section 4.16 hereof, the Company will cause
such Domestic Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Section 4.16 hereof
and this Article 11, to the extent applicable.

     Section 11.05 Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.

     Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.06, no Guarantor may sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate
with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
Person) another Person, other than the Company or another Guarantor, unless:


<PAGE>
                                      -99-


          (1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or
     Event of Default exists; and

          (2) either:

               (a) subject to Section 11.06 hereof, the Person acquiring the
          property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or
          surviving any such consolidation or merger unconditionally assumes all
          the obligations of that Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental
          indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
          Trustee, under the Notes, this Indenture and the Note Guarantee on the
          terms set forth herein or therein; and

               (b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are
          applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
          Indenture, including without limitation, Section 4.10 hereof.

     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the
assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note
Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of
the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor,
such successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with
the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor
Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be
endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not
have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note
Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note
Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

     Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses
(a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes
will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company
or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of
a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or
another Guarantor.

     Section 11.06 Releases Following Sale of Assets.

     In the event of any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or
a sale or other disposition of all to the Capital Stock of any Guarantor, in
each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transactions) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such Guarantor (in
the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Guarantor) or the corporation
acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Guar-

                                     -100-


antor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note
Guarantee; provided that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are
applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture,
including without limitation Section 4.10 hereof. Upon delivery by the Company
to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance
with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10
hereof, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably required in order to
evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note
Guarantee.

     Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee
will remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes
and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under this Indenture as provided
in this Article 11.


                                   ARTICLE 12.

                           SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE


     Section 12.01 Satisfaction and Discharge.

     This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as
to all Notes issued hereunder, when:

          (1) either:

               (a) all Notes that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen
          or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose
          payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter
          repaid to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for
          cancellation; or

               (b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for
          cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a
          notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable
          within one year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably
          deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in
          trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars,
          non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such
          amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any
          reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
          on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for
          principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and accrued
          interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

          (2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on
     the date of such deposit or will occur as a result of such deposit and such
     deposit will not


<PAGE>
                                     -101-


     result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
     other instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by
     which the Company or any Guarantor is bound;

          (3) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all
     sums payable by it under this Indenture; and

          (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee
     under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the
     Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and
discharge have been satisfied.

     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money
has been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of
this Section, the provisions of Section 12.02 and Section 8.06 will survive. In
addition, nothing in this Section 12.01 will be deemed to discharge those
provisions of Section 7.07 hereof, that, by their terms, survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

     Section 12.02 Application of Trust Money.

     Subject to the provisions of Section 8.06, all money deposited with the
Trustee pursuant to Section 12.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in
accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment,
either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its
own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto,
of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money
has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from
other funds except to the extent required by law.

     If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government
Securities in accordance with Section 12.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or
by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's
and any Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be
revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section
12.01; provided that if the Company has made any payment of principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its
obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of
such Notes to receive such payment from the money or Government Securities held
by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

[Insert the Global Note Legend, if applicable pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture]

of the Indenture]

     Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

          (1) INTEREST. Metaldyne Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
     "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note
     at 10% per annum from ________________, 200__ until maturity and shall pay
     the Liquidated Damages, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2(d) of the
     Registration Rights Agreement referred to below. The Company will pay
     interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, semi-annually in arrears on [the
     15th day of the month in which the Notes are originally issued] and [the
     six-month anniversary of the 15th day of the month in which the Notes are
     originally issued] of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day,
     on the next succeeding Business Day (each, an "Interest Payment Date").
     Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which
     interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
     issuance; provided that if there is no existing Default in the payment of
     interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred
     to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date,
     interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date;
     provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be
     _______________, 200__. The Company will pay interest (including
     post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
     overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at a
     rate that is 1% per annum in excess of the rate then in effect; it will pay
     interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
     Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest and Liquidated Damages,
     if any, (without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time
     on demand at the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed
     on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

          (2) METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Company will pay interest on the Notes
     (except defaulted interest) and Liquidated Damages, if any, to the Persons
     who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the [the
     1st day of the month in which the Notes are originally issued] and [the
     six-month anniversary of the 1st day of the month in which the Notes are
     originally issued] next preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such
     Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest
     Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.12 of the Indenture with
     respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will be payable as to principal,
     premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest at the office or
     agency of the Company


                                      A-2
<PAGE>


     maintained for such purpose within or without the City and State of New
     York, or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest and Liquidated
     Damages, if any, may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their
     addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that payment by
     wire transfer of immediately available funds will be required with respect
     to principal of and interest, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, on,
     all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which will have
     provided wire transfer instructions to the Company or the Paying Agent.
     Such payment will be in such coin or currency of the United States of
     America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
     private debts.

          (3) PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, [ ], the Trustee under the
     Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change
     any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity.

          (4) INDENTURE. The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated
     as of ___________, 200__ (the "Indenture") among the Company, the
     Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in
     the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the
     Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S. Code ss.ss. 77aaa-77bbbb).
     The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the
     Indenture and such Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any
     provision of this Note conflicts with the express provisions of the
     Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling.
     The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $31,746,000
     in aggregate principal amount, plus amounts, if any, issued to pay
     Liquidated Damages on outstanding Notes as set forth in Paragraph 2 hereof.

          (5) OPTIONAL REDEMPTION.

          (a) Except as set forth in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 5, the
     Company will not have the option to redeem the Notes prior to [the fifth
     anniversary of the 15th day of the month in which the Notes are originally
     issued]. Thereafter, the Company will have the option to redeem the Notes,
     in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice,
     at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set
     forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if
     any, thereon to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the
     twelve-month period beginning on [the 15th day of the month in which the
     Notes are originally issued] of the years indicated below:


                                      A-3
<PAGE>


        Year                                                         Percentage

        [the fifth anniversary of the year in which the Notes are
        originally issued] .......................................     105.000%
        [the sixth anniversary of the year in which the Notes are
        originally issued] .......................................     103.333%
        [the seventh anniversary of the year in which the Notes are
        originally issued] .......................................     101.667%
        [the eighth anniversary of the year in which the Notes are
        originally issued] .......................................     100.000%

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this
     Paragraph 5, at any time prior to [the fifth anniversary of the 15th day of
     the month in which the Notes are originally issued], the Company may on one
     or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of
     Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 110% of the
     aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated
     Damages, if any to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one
     or more Equity Offerings; provided that (1) at least 65% in aggregate
     principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture remains
     outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and that
     such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries);
     and (2) the redemption occurs within 120 days of the date of the closing of
     such Equity Offering.

          (6) MANDATORY REDEMPTION. The Company will not be required to make
     mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

          (7) REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

          (a) If there is a Change of Control, the Company will be required to
     make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part
     (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of each Holder's Notes at
     a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof
     plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages thereon, if any, to
     the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 15 days
     following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each
     Holder setting forth the procedures governing the Change of Control Offer
     as required by the Indenture.

          (b) If the Company or a Subsidiary consummates any Asset Sales, within
     five days of each date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
     exceeds $25.0 million, the Company will commence an offer to all Holders of
     Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the
     Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture
     with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of
     assets (an "Asset Sale Offer") pursuant to Section 3.09 of the Indenture to
     purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and other pari passu
     Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer
     price


                                      A-4
<PAGE>


     in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
     accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages thereon, if any, to the
     date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of
     Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale
     Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company (or such Subsidiary)
     may use such deficiency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
     Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu
     Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess
     Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and other pari passu
     Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that are
     the subject of an offer to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from
     the Company prior to any related purchase date and may elect to have such
     Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect
     Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes.

          (8) NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least
     30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder
     whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in
     denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole
     multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be
     redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on
     Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

          (9) DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes are in registered
     form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of
     $1,000. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged
     as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a
     Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
     transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes
     and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company need
     not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note
     selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note
     being redeemed in part. Also, the Company need not exchange or register the
     transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes
     to be redeemed or during the period between a record date and the
     corresponding Interest Payment Date.

          (10) PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder of a Note may be
     treated as its owner for all purposes.

          (11) AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to certain exceptions,
     the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or
     supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
     principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, voting as a single class,
     and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture,
     the Note Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the
     Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes,
     voting as a single class. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the
     Indenture, the Note Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supple-


                                      A-5
<PAGE>


     mented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for
     uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to
     provide for the assumption of the Company's or any Guarantor's obligations
     to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation, to make any
     change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders
     of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the
     Indenture of any such Holder, to comply with the requirements of the SEC in
     order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the
     Trust Indenture Act or to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental
     indenture to the Indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the
     Notes.

          (12) DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Events of Default and Remedies include
     those as set forth in Article 6 of the Indenture.

          (13) SUBORDINATION. Payment of principal, interest and premium and
     Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes is subordinated to the prior
     payment of Senior Debt on the terms provided in the Indenture.

          (14) TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY. The Trustee, in its individual or
     any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
     services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the
     Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

          (15) NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
     incorporator or stockholder, of the Company or any of the Guarantors, as
     such, will not have any liability for any obligations of the Company or
     such Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for
     any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
     their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all
     such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
     the issuance of the Notes.

          (16) AUTHENTICATION. This Note will not be valid until authenticated
     by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

          (17) ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of
     a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
     tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of
     survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A
     (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

          (18) ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF RESTRICTED DEFINITIVE NOTES. In
     addition to the rights provided to Holders of Notes under the Indenture,
     Holders of Restricted Definitive Notes will have all the rights set forth
     in the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of ___________, 200__, among
     the Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Holder[s] (the "Registration
     Rights Agreement").

          (19) CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
     Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has
     caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use
     CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
     representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed
     on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may
     be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

          (20) GOVERNING LAW. The internal law of the State of New York will
     govern and be used to construe the Notes without giving effect to
     applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the
     application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

     The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without
charge a copy of the Indenture and/or the Registration Rights Agreement.

          jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.

          (b) The obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of

     Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the
     recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the

     equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.

     to return to the Company, the Guarantors, or any custodian, trustee,
     liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the
     Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such
     Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
     reinstated in full force and effect.

          (f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right of
     subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations
     guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed
     hereby.

          (g) As between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and
     the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations
     guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the
     Indenture for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any
     stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in
     respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any
     declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of
     the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
     forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this
     Note Guarantee.

          (h) The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any
     non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair
     the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.

          (i) Pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to
     any maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities that are
     relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy or fraudulent conveyance laws, and

     such that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Note Guarantee will
     not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

     3. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY. Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that the
Note Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any
failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.

          (a) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not sell or otherwise dispose of
     all substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with
     or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another
     Person, other than the Company or another Guarantor unless:

               (i) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no
          Default or Event of Default exists; and

               (ii) either (A) subject to Sections 11.05 and 11.06 of the
          Indenture, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or
          disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such
          consolidation or merger unconditionally assumes all the obligations of
          that Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and
          substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under the Notes, the
          Indenture and the Note Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or
          therein; or (B) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are
          applied in

<PAGE>


          accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including
          without limitation, Section 4.10 thereof.

          (b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and
     upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture,
     executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the
     Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and
     punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the
     Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person shall
     succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if
     it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon
     may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed
     upon all of the Notes issuable under the Indenture which theretofore shall
     not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the
     Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank
     and benefit under the Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and
     thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though
     all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution
     hereof.

          (c) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 11.06 of the
     Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained
     in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or
     merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or
     shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an
     entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another
     Guarantor.

     5. RELEASES.

          (a) In the event of any sale or other disposition of all or
     substantially all of the assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger,
     consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the
     capital stock of any Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not
     (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted
     Subsidiary of the Company, then such Guarantor (in the event of a sale or
     other disposition, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of
     the capital stock of such Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the
     property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or
     substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) will be released and
     relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee; provided that the Net
     Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with
     the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including without limitation
     Section 4.10 of the Indenture. Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee
     of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
     such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with
     the provisions of the Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10
     of the Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably
     required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its
     obligations under its Note Guarantee.


                                      F-4
<PAGE>


          (b) Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note
     Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and
     interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under
     the Indenture as provided in Article 11 of the Indenture.

     6. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing
Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Note Guarantees, the
Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the
Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may
not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it
is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

     7. NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL
GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

     8. COUNTERPARTS. The parties may sign any number of copies of this
Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them
together represent the same agreement.

     9. EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Section headings herein are for convenience only
and shall not affect the construction hereof.

     10. THE TRUSTEE. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner
whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental
Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which
recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.



                                      F-5

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Supplemental
Indenture to be duly executed and attested, all as of the date first above
written.
