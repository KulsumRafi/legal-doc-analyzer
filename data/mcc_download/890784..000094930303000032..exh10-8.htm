     4.   This  Agreement  shall not be in any way  construed as an admission by

               (ii) The  Company  Releasors  shall not  bring  any legal  action

                    and waiver contained in this Agreement is deemed to be valid
                    by a court of competent jurisdiction and is thereby a bar to

                    pertaining to the  investigation  and defense of such action
