                  1.       By inserting the following new definitions in
         alphabetical order:

                          "Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiaries": together, the

                  Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiary.


<PAGE>

                           "Western Plains Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiary": the
                  proposed Subsidiary of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be named
                  'Western Plains Surgery Center, L.P.' which shall own or lease
                  and operate an ambulatory surgery center in Dodge City, Kansas
                  (and related facilities), adjacent to Western Plains Regional
                  Hospital and such Loan Party's related Investment therein
                  (satisfactory to the Required Lenders) for a 100% interest in
                  such Subsidiary.

                           "Western Plains Buyout": as defined in Section
                  7.8(f).

                  2.       By amending the definitions of "Cumberland Ambulatory
         Surgery Subsidiary" and "Subsidiary Guarantor" to read as follows:

                           "Cumberland Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiary": the
                  proposed Subsidiary of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be named
                  'Cumberland Surgery Center, L.P.' which shall own or lease and
                  operate an ambulatory surgery center in Somerset, KY (and
                  related facilities) adjacent to Lake Cumberland Hospital in
                  accordance with the description thereof set forth in Schedule
                  7.8(e).

                           "Subsidiary Guarantor": each direct and indirect
                  Subsidiary of Borrower, excluding the Ambulatory Surgery
                  Subsidiaries, unless, in either case, such Subsidiary shall
                  become wholly owned by Borrower or any of its wholly owned
                  Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood
                  and agreed that the Western Plains Ambulatory Surgery
                  Subsidiary is being formed as a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
                  Existing Joint Venture, in anticipation of the issuance of
                  Equity Interests in such Subsidiary to physicians practicing
                  at Western Plains Regional Hospital and shall therefore not
                  initially be deemed a Subsidiary Guarantor. However, if such
                  Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiary shall remain wholly owned as of
                  September 30, 2003 it shall thereafter be deemed to be a
                  Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes hereof, including
                  without limitation Section 6.11.

         B.       NEW SUBSIDIARIES.Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement is
amended by deleting clause (iii) thereof (preceding subclause (A)), and
substituting therefor: "(iii) cause such new Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary
Guarantor".

         C.       DISPOSITION OF EQUITY INTERESTS. Section 7.5(e) of the Credit
Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "(e) provided that no Event of Default exists at the time or
         would result therefrom, the Disposition of up to 49% of the Equity
         Interests in either or both of the Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiaries
         (calculated on a fully diluted basis), provided the Borrower, directly
         or indirectly, still holds no less than 51% of the Equity Interests in
         each such Subsidiary;"

         D.       PERMITTED INVESTMENTS. Section 7.8 of the Credit Agreement is
amended as follows:


                                      -2-

                  1.       By deleting paragraphs (f) and (h) thereof and
         substituting the following:

                           "(f)     the repurchase of the Equity Interests in
                  the Existing Joint Venture held by Dodge City Outpatient
                  Surgical Facility, Inc. (representing the limited partner's
                  entire 30% interest therein), for an aggregate purchase price
                  not exceeding $27,000,000 (the "Western Plains Buyout") and,
                  as to Borrower and its other Subsidiaries, additional
                  Investments after June 19, 2001 in joint ventures which are
                  Subsidiaries but not Subsidiary Guarantors in an aggregate
                  amount not exceeding $10,000,000;"

                           "(h)     Investments by Borrower or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in Borrower or any Person that, prior to such
                  Investment, is a Subsidiary Guarantor;"

                  2. By deleting the word "and" where it appears after paragraph
         (r) thereof, by adding the following new paragraph (s) and by
         relettering the existing paragraph (s) as paragraph (t):

                           "(s) the proposed Investment in the Western Plains
                  Ambulatory Surgery Subsidiary (which will be formed as a
                  wholly owned Subsidiary of the Existing Joint Venture but will
                  be deemed a Subsidiary Guarantor only under the circumstances
                  described in the definition of such term set forth in Section
                  1.1); and"

         E.       EXISTING JOINT VENTURE TO BE WHOLLY OWNED. The Credit
Agreement is further amended to reflect the Dodge City Buyout, after which the
Existing Joint Venture will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Borrower, as
follows:

                  1. By deleting from Section 5.14 the phrase "with the
         exception of the Existing Joint Venture (in which Borrower indirectly
         holds the majority interests set forth in Schedule 5.14(b)),".

                  2.       By deleting the last phrase of Section 5.15
         referencing the Existing Joint Venture.

                  3.       By deleting the words "the Existing Joint Venture or
         any other " from Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(i) (wherever such words
         appear) and substituting therefor the word "any".

                  4.       By the deleting the words "the Existing Joint Venture
         or to any other " from Sections 7.4 and 7.6 (wherever such words
         appear) and substituting therefor the word "any".
