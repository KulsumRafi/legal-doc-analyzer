invoice containing a reference to the services performed and the personnel used.
All such invoices will be payable under the terms described in Section 5.

         3.3 Except as set forth in Section 8.2, due to the unpredictable nature

the performance of the Services (including, without limitation, the dates for
production and delivery of Product) set out in Appendix D are estimates only.

         3.4 The parties acknowledge that ICOS will ship each batch of cGMP
Product as soon as possible upon ICOS' completing the manufacture (including,
without limitation, the completion of all QA/QC tests) of such batch. Risk of

         3.7 Joint Communication on Manufacturing: ICOS and SGI shall
communicate and cooperate on a regular basis during the provision of Services

active committee, such body shall be established and meet regularly to discuss
and communicate the progress of the Services.

         3.8 ICOS shall provide SGI, at SGI's expense, with all documents SGI
reasonably requests regarding ICOS' performance of the Services and conducting
the Process of manufacturing the Product; provided, however, in the event that
SGI requests any documentation beyond that which ICOS is expressly required to
maintain pursuant to this Agreement, or which is otherwise already prepared by
ICOS and related to the Products or the Process, SGI shall be responsible to
ICOS for the payment of fees for Additional Services as set forth in Section
3.2.

         3.9 Once during this Agreement upon at least [***] ([***]) [***] prior
notice to ICOS, SGI shall have the right to have SGI representatives visit ICOS'
manufacturing facilities during normal business hours to conduct an Audit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing notice period, for purposes of confidentiality,
safety and to avoid the possibility of contamination, if a third party's product
is being produced during the time that SGI intends to conduct an Audit, such
Audit may be reasonably delayed upon prior written notice to SGI. The form,
participants and procedures of the Audit shall be subject to ICOS' reasonable
approval. When conducting an Audit, each of SGI's representatives will (a) be
subject to a nondisclosure obligation comparable in scope to Section 7, (b)
follow such security and facility access procedures as are reasonably designated
by ICOS, (c) be accompanied by an ICOS representative, (d) not enter areas of
any ICOS facility at times when any third party's products are being
manufactured to assure protection of ICOS' or third party confidential
information, and (e) use good faith efforts to avoid disrupting ICOS'
operations. In addition to an Audit, ICOS agrees to reasonably cooperate with
all regulatory authorities and shall submit to reasonable Product-specific
inspections by such authorities ("Regulatory Inspection"). Any Audits by SGI or
Regulatory Inspections in excess of one during this Agreement shall be [***]
([***]) [***] prior written notice. SGI shall pay to ICOS fees for all Audits by
SGI and Regulatory Inspections as Additional Services pursuant to Section 3.2.

4.       SGI Tests and Return Procedures

         4.1 Except where SGI has accepted ICOS Product tests and provided
written notice to ICOS of such acceptance, promptly following delivery of
Product or a sample of Product (if such sample is requested by SGI), SGI shall
carry out SGI Tests. If SGI Tests show that the Product fails to meet Product
Specifications due to ICOS failing to meet its obligations hereunder, SGI shall
give ICOS written notice thereof as soon as practicable but in no case later
than [***] ([***]) [***] from the date SGI takes delivery of the Product (or
sample of the Product, if applicable) and shall return such Product (or sample)
to ICOS's premises for further testing. In the absence of such written notice
Product shall be deemed to have been accepted by SGI as meeting Product
Specifications. If ICOS agrees that Product is Nonconforming Product, it shall
at SGI's discretion replace such Product at its own cost and expense, subject to
Section 4.3. "Nonconforming Product" means any Product that has been delivered
to SGI but fails to meet Product Specifications, and such failure is not due (in
whole or in part) to (a) acts or omissions of SGI, (b) [***], or (c) any third
party after delivery of such Product to SGI.

BY THE PARTIES HERETO ICOS SHALL BE OBLIGED ONLY TO USE ITS REASONABLE
ENDEAVOURS TO PRODUCE PRODUCT THAT MEETS DRAFT PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS.

         4.2 If there is any dispute concerning whether Product is Nonconforming
Product (as defined in Section 4.1), such dispute shall be referred for decision
to an independent expert (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) to be
appointed by agreement between ICOS and SGI.

         The costs of such independent expert shall be borne by the parties
equally; provided that the party that is determined to be incorrect in the
dispute shall be responsible for all such costs and shall indemnify the correct
party for its share of the costs incurred. The decision of such independent
expert shall be in writing and shall be binding on both ICOS and SGI.

         4.3 In the event Product is determined to be Nonconforming Product
(whether by agreement of ICOS pursuant to Section 4.1 or by an independent
expert pursuant to Section 4.2), ICOS shall replace such Product at its own cost
and expense and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such
Product [***], provided that ICOS shall (a) [***] of such [***] within [***]
from the date the [***] and (b) [***] within [***] from the date ICOS [***] of
the [***]. If ICOS is [***] with the [***], then SGI shall [***] to a [***] of
the [***] of such [***].

         4.4 In the event that the parties hereto agree that a shipment or batch
of Product fails to meet Product Specifications as a result of ICOS failing to
meet its obligations hereunder, the entire shipment or batch of Product that
failed to meet Product Specifications shall either be returned to ICOS or
destroyed, at ICOS's option.

         4.5 The provisions of this Clause 4 shall be the sole remedies
available to SGI in respect of Product that fails to meet Product
Specifications.

5.       Price and Terms of Payment

         5.1    SGI shall pay the Price in accordance with the Terms of Payment

any government or public authority, which shall be paid by SGI (other than taxes
on ICOS's income). All invoices are strictly net and payment must be made within
[***] ([***]) [***] of date of invoice. Payment shall be made without deduction,
deferment, set-off, lien or counterclaim of any nature.

               7.4.3 is subsequently disclosed to the recipient party without

have a prior obligation of confidence to SGI or ICOS, as the case may be; or

               7.4.4 which may be required to be disclosed under any statutory,
regulatory or similar legislative requirement, subject to the imposition of
obligations of confidentiality to the extent allowed and provided further that
each party shall, unless prohibited by law, use reasonable efforts to notify the
other party of such compelled disclosure prior to such disclosure in order to
seek injunctive or any other relief provided in law or equity; or

               7.5.1 ICOS Know-How and ICOS Patent Rights are vested in
ICOS; and

               7.5.2 Except as expressly provided herein, SGI shall not at any
time have any right, title, license or interest in or to ICOS Know-How, ICOS
Patent Rights or any other intellectual property rights relating to the Process
