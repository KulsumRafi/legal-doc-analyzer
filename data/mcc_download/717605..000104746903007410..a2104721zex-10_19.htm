<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
The aggregate number of Option Shares and the Purchase Price shall be appropriately adjusted by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board for any increase or decrease
in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital adjustment, or the payment of a stock dividend or other increase or decrease in

including changes in the classes of securities available, to the extent reasonably necessary or desirable to preserve the intended benefits under this Option Agreement in the event of any other
reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or other distribution or similar transaction involving the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Any adjustment under this Section&nbsp;5 in the number of Option Shares and the Purchase Price shall apply to only the unexercised portion of the Option. If fractions of a share

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
The Option shall be exercised by the delivery by the Optionee to the Corporation at its principal office (or at such other address as may be established by the Committee) of written
notice of the number of Option Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, accompanied by payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for such Option Shares. Payment for such Option
Shares shall be made (i)&nbsp;in U.S. dollars by personal check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation, or by money transfers or direct account debits to an account
designated by the Corporation; (ii)&nbsp;through the delivery of shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to the total payment due from the Optionee; (iii)&nbsp;pursuant to a
"cashless exercise" program if such a program is established by the Corporation; or (iv)&nbsp;by any combination of the methods described in (i)&nbsp;through (iii)&nbsp;above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Option shall be subject to the payment by the Optionee of applicable federal, state and local
withholding tax, if any. The Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee any federal, state or local taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. </FONT></P>

benefit of such family members, and partnerships whose only partners are such family members; provided, however, that no consideration can be paid for the transfer of the Option and the transferee of
the Option shall be subject to all conditions applicable to the Option prior to its transfer. </FONT></P>
