            SECTION 1.2 Accounting  Terms. All accounting terms not specifically
defined  herein shall be construed in  accordance  with GAAP,  and all financial
data required to be delivered  hereunder  shall be prepared in  accordance  with

                                   ARTICLE 2.
                                CREDIT FACILITY.

            SECTION  2.1  Revolving  Credit  Loans.  Subject  to the  terms  and
conditions  of this  Agreement,  each Bank  severally  agrees to make  revolving
credit loans in Dollars (the "Revolving Credit Loans"), and all Revolving Credit
Loans shall be made by the Banks,  on a pro-rata basis in accordance  with their
respective Commitment  Proportions,  to the Borrower from time to time, from and
including  the date hereof to but excluding  the  Revolving  Credit  Termination
Date,  up to but not  exceeding  at any one time  outstanding  the amount of its
Commitment;  provided,  that no  Revolving  Credit  Loan  shall be made if after
giving effect to such Revolving  Credit Loan the Aggregate  Outstandings  at the
time of such  Revolving  Credit  Loan  would  exceed the lesser of (i) the Total
Commitments or (ii) the Borrowing Base in effect on such date,  provided further
that  Revolving  Credit Loans made to the Company based upon the Cash  Borrowing
Base shall only be made to the extent that Revolving Credit Loans based upon the
Real Estate  Borrowing  Base and the Non-Real  Estate  Borrowing  Base have been
fully utilized,  and,  provided  further that Revolving Credit Loans made to the
Company  based upon cash and cash  equivalents  shall only be made to the extent
that Revolving Credit Loans based upon Eligible Marketable  Securities have been
fully utilized. The Revolving Credit Loans may be outstanding as Base Rate Loans
or LIBOR Loans; provided, however, that during the occurrence and continuance of
an Event of  Default,  the  Borrower  may not elect and the Banks  shall have no
obligation to make LIBOR Loans.  Subject to the foregoing  limits,  the Borrower
may  borrow,  repay and  reborrow,  on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Revolving Credit  Termination Date, all or a portion of the Total Commitments as
Revolving  Credit Loans  hereunder.  Any amount of any Revolving Credit Loan not
paid when due (at maturity,  on acceleration  or otherwise)  shall bear interest
thereafter until paid at the rate set forth in Section 3.3(c) hereof.

            SECTION 2.2 The Revolving  Credit Notes.  The Revolving Credit Loans
of each Bank shall be  evidenced  by a single  promissory  note in favor of such
Bank substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate  insertions,
duly executed and completed by the Borrower.  Each Bank is hereby  authorized to
record the date,  type and amount of each  Revolving  Credit Loan,  the date and
amount of each payment of principal  thereof,  and the principal  amount subject
thereto and interest rate thereto in such Bank's records and/or on the schedules
annexed to and  constituting a part of its Revolving  Credit Note,  and,  absent

                                       14

<PAGE>



manifest error, any such recordation shall constitute conclusive evidence of the
information so recorded;  provided that the failure to make any such recordation
shall  not in any way  affect  the  obligation  of the  Borrower  to  repay  the
Revolving  Credit Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement  (without
giving  effect  to any such  error  made in the  Revolving  Credit  Note).  Each
Revolving  Credit  Note (a)  shall be dated  the date  hereof,  (b) be stated to
mature on the Revolving Credit  Termination Date, and (c) shall bear interest on
the unpaid  principal  amount thereof from time to time  outstanding as provided
herein.

            SECTION 2.3 Use of Proceeds.

            (a) The  Borrower  shall use the  proceeds of the  Revolving  Credit
Loans on the date of this  Agreement to repay in full Existing Bank Debt and may
also  use  the  proceeds  of the  Revolving  Credit  Loans  on the  date of this
Agreement  and  from  time to time  thereafter  prior  to the  Revolving  Credit
Termination Date (i) for general corporate and working capital purposes; (ii) to
finance the  acquisition  of Real  Estate  Assets or to make  mortgage  loans or
similar loans that constitute Real Estate Assets;  (iii) to repurchase  stock of
the Borrower in an amount not to exceed $3,500,000 in any fiscal year commencing
after the date hereof or $7,500,000 during the term of this Agreement;  and (iv)
to make advances to the Operating Companies in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$10,000,000 at any time. No part of the proceeds of any of the Revolving  Credit
Loans  will be used  (i)  for any  purpose  which  violates  the  provisions  of
Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as
in effect on the date of making such  Revolving  Credit  Loans or (ii) to permit
the Borrower or any  Guarantor to acquire  equity  securities in any third party
except as permitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.7 hereof.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Banks and their  respective
directors, officers, employees,  affiliates, agents or other representatives and
hold the Banks and their respective directors, officers, employees,  affiliates,
agents  or  other  representatives,  harmless  from  and  against  any  and  all
liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind (including, without
limitation,  the reasonable  fees and expenses of counsel for any such Person in
connection with any investigative,  administrative, judicial proceeding, whether
or not such Person shall be designated a party thereto) which may be incurred by
any such Person,  relating to or arising out of this Agreement  (other than as a
result of willful  misconduct  or a breach of this  Agreement by such Person) or
any  actual or  proposed  use of any  proceeds  of the  Revolving  Credit  Loans
hereunder.

            SECTION 2.4 Borrowing Procedure for Revolving Credit Loans; Rate and
Interest Period Selection: Conversions.

            (a) The  Borrower  may  request a  borrowing  under the  Commitments
hereunder  as  provided  in Section  3.1.  Each Bank will make its share of such
borrowing  available  to the Agent at the  Agent's  office  located  at 350 Park
Avenue,  New York, New York 10022 not later than 2:00 p.m. New York City time on
the date of such borrowing in immediately available funds. Unless any applicable
condition  specified  in Article 5 has not been  satisfied,  not later than 3:00
p.m. New York City time on the date of such borrowing,  the Agent shall, through
its Lending  Office and subject to the  conditions of this  Agreement,  make the
amount of the  Revolving  Credit Loan to be made on such date  available  to the

                                       15

<PAGE>



Borrower,  in  immediately  available  funds,  by  crediting  an  account of the
Borrower designated by the Borrower and maintained with the Agent.

            (b) In the case of each Revolving Credit Loan which is a LIBOR Loan,
the Borrower shall select an Interest  Period of any duration in accordance with
the  definition of Interest  Period in Section 1.1,  subject to the  limitations
that no  Interest  Period for a LIBOR  Loan shall have a duration  less than one
month, and if any such proposed Interest Period would otherwise be for a shorter
period, such Interest Period shall not be available.

            (c) Upon the  expiration  of an  Interest  Period for any  Revolving
Credit  Loan,  or any portion  thereof,  such  Revolving  Credit Loan or portion
thereof  shall be  automatically  continued  as a Base Rate  Loan  except to the
extent that such Revolving  Credit Loan shall be repaid  hereunder or unless the
Borrower  shall have notified the Banks,  as provided in Section 3.1 hereof,  of
its  intention to select a different  interest  rate option with respect to such
Revolving  Credit  Loan  or  any  portion  thereof.  Subject  to  the  following
conditions and to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower shall
have the right to convert  any  Revolving  Credit  Loan or portion  thereof to a
different type of Revolving Credit Loan (i.e.,  from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR
Loan or vice versa):

                        (i) if less than all Revolving  Credit Loans at the time
            outstanding shall be converted,  the notice given by the Borrower to
            the Banks shall  specify the  aggregate  amount of Revolving  Credit
            Loans in each case to be converted and such conversion shall be made
            ratably  among  the  Banks  in  accordance  with  their   respective
            Commitment Proportions;

                        (ii)  in the  case of a  conversion  of  less  than  all
            outstanding  Revolving Credit Loans, the aggregate  principal amount
            of Revolving Credit Loans to be converted shall not be less than (1)
            $200,000  (and if greater in integral  multiples of $100,000) in the
            case of  conversions  to or into LIBOR Loans or (2) $200,000 (and if
            greater in integral multiples of $50,000) in the case of conversions
            to or into Base Rate Loans;

                        (iii) no  Revolving  Credit Loan may be  converted  to a
            LIBOR  Loan  less  than  one  month  before  the  Revolving   Credit
            Termination Date;

                        (iv) a LIBOR Loan may be converted  to a different  type
            of Revolving Credit Loan only on the last day of the then applicable
            Interest Period with respect thereto; and

                        (v) no Revolving  Credit Loan or portion  thereof may be
            converted to a LIBOR Loan during the occurrence  and  continuance of
            an Event of Default.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, after giving effect
to any  Revolving  Credit Loan,  there shall not be more than six (6)  different
Interest  Periods  in effect in  respect  of all  Revolving  Credit  Loans  then
outstanding.

            SECTION 2.5.  Minimum Amounts of Revolving  Credit Loan.  Except for
borrowings which involve or utilize the full remaining amount of the Commitments
and  payments  which  result  in the  prepayment  of all Base Rate  Loans,  each

                                       16

<PAGE>



borrowing  and  payment of a Base Rate Loan shall be in an amount at least equal
to $200,000 and, if greater,  integral  multiples of $50,000 in excess  thereof.
Each  borrowing and payment of a LIBOR Loan shall be in an amount at least equal
to  $200,000  and,  if  greater,  in  integral  multiples  of $100,000 in excess
thereof.

            SECTION 2.5 Reduction of Commitments.

            (a) The  Borrower  shall have the right to reduce or  terminate  the
amount of the  unused  Commitments  at any time and from  time to time  provided
that:  (i) the Borrower  shall give notice of each such reduction or termination
to the Banks as provided in Section 3. 1, and (ii) each partial  reduction shall
be allocated pro rata between the  Commitments  of each Bank in accordance  with
their respective  Commitment  Proportions and shall be in an aggregate amount at
least equal to $3,000,000 or, if greater, in integral multiples of $1,000,000.

            (b)  The  Commitments,   once  reduced  or  terminated  may  not  be
reinstated.

                                   ARTICLE 3.
                  GENERAL CREDIT PROVISIONS; FEES AND PAYMENTS.

            SECTION 3.1 Certain  Notices.  Except as otherwise  provided in this
Agreement,  notices by the Borrower to the Banks of each  borrowing  pursuant to
Sections  2.4,  each  prepayment  pursuant to Section  3.2,  each  reduction  or
termination of the  Commitments  pursuant to Section 2.6 and each  conversion of
Revolving  Credit Loans pursuant to Sections 2.4 shall be irrevocable  and shall
be  effective  on the date of receipt only if received by the Banks by not later
than 11:00  a.m.,  New York City  time,  and (a) in the case of  borrowings  and
prepayments  of (i) Base Rate  Loans,  if given the date  thereof and (ii) LIBOR
Loans,  if given  three  (3)  Banking  Days  prior  thereto;  (b) in the case of
reductions or terminations of the Commitments, given five (5) Banking Days prior
thereto;  and (c) in the  case  of  conversions  or  continuations  pursuant  to
Sections  2.4,  if given  three (3)  Banking  Days prior  thereto in the case of
conversions to or  continuations of LIBOR Loans and if given on the date thereof
in the case of  conversions  to Base Rate Loans.  Each such  notification  which
relates to a borrowing,  continuation or conversion shall specify the amount and
the type of Revolving Credit Loan (i.e., Base Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan), the date
of the proposed  borrowing,  whether such  Revolving  Credit Loan  represents an
additional borrowing, a continuation or a conversion, and in the case of a LIBOR
Loan, the Interest Period to be used in the computation of interest with respect
thereto.  Each  such  notice  relating  to a  reduction  or  termination  of the
Commitments  shall  specify  the  amount of the  Commitments  to be  reduced  or
terminated.

            SECTION 3.2 Prepayments.

            (a) The  Borrower  shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay  any Base Rate  Loan,  in whole or in part on one  Banking  Day's
notice to the Agent;  provided,  however, that each such partial prepayment of a
Base Rate Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate  principal amount of $200,000 or,
if  greater  in amounts  which are  integral  multiples  of  $50,000.  Except as
required by paragraph (b) or (c) below or on the last day of an Interest  Period
with respect thereto, the Borrower shall not be permitted to prepay LIBOR Loans.

                                       17

<PAGE>



            (b) In the event that the Aggregate  Outstandings  exceed the lesser
of the then  applicable  Borrowing  Base, or the Total  Commitments  at any time
prior to the Revolving Credit  Termination Date, the Borrower shall promptly pay
or  prepay  so much of the  Revolving  Credit  Loans  outstanding  as  shall  be
necessary in order that the Aggregate Outstandings will not exceed the lesser of
the Borrowing  Base or the Total  Commitments  then in effect.  All  prepayments
under this subparagraph shall be subject to Section 4.1.

            (c) Unless  otherwise  agreed by the Banks in writing,  the Borrower
shall be required to pay or prepay Revolving  Credit Loans  outstanding with (i)
80% of the  proceeds  of  the  issuance  by the  Borrower  or any  Guarantor  of
additional  equity,  other than  proceeds  received  upon the  exercise of stock
options or the issuance of additional equity by any Guarantor to the Borrower or
any other  Guarantor;  (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of the sale by the Borrower
or any  Guarantor  of any Real  Estate  Assets;  (iii) 100% of the net  proceeds
resulting from the repayment of mortgages  constituting Real Estate Assets; (iv)
100% of the net  proceeds  of a financing  of any  Eligible  Property;  (v) such
proceeds as may be paid as a result of a casualty or  condemnation,  if required
under Sections 7.11 or 7.12 of this Agreement,  or (vi) 100% of the net proceeds
of a sale of any Operating  Company  permitted in  accordance  with the terms of
Section  8.4  hereof;  provided,  however,  that  the  Borrower  shall  have  no
obligation  under clause (i) above until the  aggregate  net proceeds of any and
all additional equity issuances during the term of this Agreement shall equal or
exceed  $2,000,000.00.  All prepayments under this paragraph shall be subject to
Section 4. 1. To the extent any prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) would
result in the Borrower  being  obligated to pay amounts to the Banks pursuant to
Section 4.1,  then provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, at the Borrower's election the proceeds from any of the foregoing
events shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account owned by the Bank to be
applied to reduce the outstanding  Revolving Credit Loans upon expiration of the
relevant Interest Periods.  The interest earned on such amounts shall be for the
Borrower's  account and, in the absence of a Default or Event of Default,  shall
be credited by the Agent to the Borrower's account.

            (d) All payments  required by  paragraphs  (b) or (c) above shall be
made to the  Agent  for the  benefit  of the  Banks  in  accordance  with  their
respective  Commitment  Proportions  and shall be applied as follows:  first, to
outstanding  Base Rate  Loans up to the full  amount  thereof,  and  second,  to
outstanding LIBOR Loans up to the full amount thereof.

            (e) All  prepayments  made  pursuant  to this  Section  3.2 shall be
accompanied by the payment of all accrued  interest on the amount so prepaid and
by all  amounts  required  to be paid  pursuant  to  Section  4.1 in  connection
therewith.

            SECTION 3.3 Interest on Revolving Credit Loans.

            (a)  Base  Rate  Loans.  The  Borrower  shall  pay  interest  on the
outstanding and unpaid  principal  amount of each Base Rate Loan made under this
Agreement  at a  fluctuating  rate per annum equal to the Base Rate from time to
time  in  effect.   Each  change  in  the   interest   rate  shall  take  effect
simultaneously  with the  corresponding  change in the Prime Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate, as the case may be. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the
actual  number of days elapsed  divided by a year of three  hundred  sixty (360)

                                       18

<PAGE>



days and shall be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks  quarterly,  in
arrears, on the last Banking Day of March, June,  September and December in each
year, commencing December 31, 2002, and on the Termination Date.

            (b) LIBOR Loans.  The Borrower shall pay interest on the outstanding
and unpaid  principal  amount of each LIBOR Loan made under this  Agreement  for
each Interest Period  applicable to such LIBOR Loan at a rate per annum equal to
the  Reserve  Adjusted  LIBOR  Rate in effect  with  respect  thereto,  plus the
Applicable  Margin.  Interest  shall be  calculated  on the basis of the  actual
number of days elapsed  divided by a year of three  hundred sixty (360) days and
shall be paid to the Banks,  monthly in arrears on the last day of each month in
each year and on the Termination Date.

            (c)  Post-Default.  If any Default or Event of Default has  occurred
and is continuing hereunder,  all Revolving Credit Loans, and all interest, fees
or other amounts due hereunder, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall
bear  interest  (payable  on  demand,  and in any  event on the last day of each
month,  and  computed  daily on the  basis of a  360-day  year for  actual  days
elapsed) (i) in all cases other than LIBOR Loans, at the Default Rate until paid
and (ii) in the case of LIBOR Loans, at a rate which shall be the greater of (x)
the Default  Rate or (y) 2% per annum in excess of the rate  applicable  to such
LIBOR Loan,  until the  expiration  of the Interest  Period  applicable  to such
Revolving   Credit  Loan,  at  which  time  the   Revolving   Credit  Loan  will
automatically  be converted  into a Base Rate Loan,  and until paid,  shall bear
interest at the Default  Rate.  In no event,  however,  shall  interest  payable
hereunder  be in  excess  of  the  maximum  rate  of  interest  permitted  under
applicable  law.  The  obligation  to so pay  interest  upon  any  reimbursement
obligation  of the  Borrower to the Banks shall not be  construed so as to waive
the requirement for  reimbursement  on the same date that payment is made by the
Banks as set forth in this Agreement.

            SECTION 3.4 Commitment  Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
the  ratable  benefit  of the Banks a  commitment  fee for the  period  from and
including the date hereof to and excluding the Termination  Date equal to 3/8 of
1% of the  average  daily  unused  portion of the Total  Commitments  during the
applicable period. The commitment fee shall be calculated on the basis of a year
of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.  The  commitment fee shall be
due and payable  quarterly in arrears on the last day of each  calendar  quarter
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

            SECTION 3.5 Administrative  Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent
for its own account an annual fee of $25,000.  The  administrative  fee shall be
due and  payable  annual in  advance  on or before  the date  hereof and on each
anniversary of the date hereof.

            SECTION 3.6 Closing Fee. The  Borrower  shall pay to the Agent,  for
the ratable  benefit of the Banks, a closing fee equal to 1/2 of 1% of the Total
Commitments. This fee shall be due and payable on the Closing Date.

                                       19

            SECTION 3.7 Payments Generally.

            (a) All payments under this Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes
shall  be made in  Dollars  in  immediately  available  funds to the  Agent,  in
accordance with the respective  obligations of the Borrower then due and payable
to each of them not  later  than 1:00  p.m.  New York City time on the  relevant
dates  specified  above (each such payment made after such time on such due date
is to be deemed to have been made on the next  succeeding  Banking  Day), to the
Agent's  Lending  Office.  The  Borrower  will  notify the Agent of any  payment
pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Section at the same time it makes any such
payment.  The Bank may (but shall not be  obligated  to) debit the amount of any
such payment to any  ordinary  deposit  account of the Borrower  with such Bank;
provided,  however,  that the Agent  shall not be  permitted  to debit any funds
which are not available to the Borrower  other than on an overdraft  basis.  The
Borrower  shall,  at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or the
Revolving  Credit  Notes,  specify to the Agent the  principal  or other  amount
payable by the Borrower  under this  Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes to
which such  payment be applied;  provided,  however,  that in the event that the
Borrower  fails to so  specify,  or if an Event of Default has  occurred  and is
continuing,  the Banks shall apply such  payment as they may elect in their sole
discretion. If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or the Revolving
Credit Notes would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Banking Day, such date
shall be  extended to the next  succeeding  Banking  Day and  interest  shall be
payable for any principal so extended for the period of such  extension.  Except
to the extent otherwise provided herein, it is the intention of the parties that
all payments hereunder be applied to the Banks pro rata in accordance with their
respective Commitment Proportions.

            (b) All payments  made by the  Borrower  under this  Agreement,  the
Revolving  Credit Notes or the other Facility  Documents  shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present
or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,  duties, charges, fees,
deductions  or  withholdings,  now  or  hereafter  imposed,  levied,  collected,
withheld  or  assessed  by  any   governmental   or  taxing   authority  of  any
jurisdiction,  excluding,  (x) in the  case  of  each  Bank,  income  taxes  and
franchise  taxes  (imposed  in lieu of income  taxes)  imposed on such Bank as a
result of a  present  or  former  connection  between  the  jurisdiction  of the
government or the taxing authority  imposing such tax and such Bank (excluding a
connection  arising  solely  from  such  Bank  having  executed,  delivered,  or
performed  its  obligations  or  received a payment  under,  or  enforced,  this
Agreement,  the Revolving  Credit Notes or the other Facility  Documents) or any
political  subdivision  or taxing  authority  thereof or therein,  and (y) taxes
(including  withholding  taxes) imposed by reason of the failure of the Agent or
any Bank, in either case that is organized  outside the United States, to comply
with Section 3.7(c) hereof (or the  inaccuracy at any time of the  certificates,
documents and other evidence delivered thereunder) (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies,  imposts,  duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions and  withholdings  being
hereinafter called "Taxes").  If any Taxes are withheld from any amounts payable
to any Bank hereunder or under the Facility Documents, the amounts, paid to such
Bank shall be increased to the extent  necessary to yield to such Bank (after so
payment of all Taxes)  interest or any such other amounts  payable  hereunder at
the rates or in the amounts  specified in this Agreement,  the Revolving  Credit
Notes and the other  Facility  Documents.  Whenever any Taxes are payable by the
Borrower,  the Borrower shall send to such Bank within 30 days after the date of

                                       20

<PAGE>



any payment,  a certified copy of an original  official  receipt received by the
Borrower  showing payment  thereof.  If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when
due to the  appropriate  taxing  authority  or fails to remit to the  Banks  the
required  receipts or other required  documentary  evidence,  the Borrower shall
indemnify the Banks for any  incremental  taxes,  interest or penalties that may
become payable by any Bank as a result of any such failure. This indemnification
shall be made  within  30 days from the date such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be ) makes written demand therefor. If any Bank receives a refund in respect
of any  Taxes  for  which  such  Bank has  received  payment  from the  Borrower
hereunder,  such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such refund and such
Bank shall,  within 30 days of receipt of a request by the  Borrower  repay such
refund to the Borrower,  provided  that the  Borrower,  upon the request of such
Bank,  agrees to return  such  refund  (plus any  penalties,  interest  or other
charges) to such Bank in the event such Bank is  required to repay such  refund.
The  agreements  in  this  subsection  shall  survive  the  termination  of this
Agreement and the Facility  Documents  and the payment of the  Revolving  Credit
Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder or thereunder.

            (c) Each Bank that is organized  outside of the United  States shall
deliver to the Borrower on the date hereof (or, in the case of an  assignee,  on
the date of the  assignment) and from time to time as required for renewal under
applicable law duly completed  copies of United States Internal  Revenue Service
Form  1001 or 4224 (or any  successor  or  additional  forms),  as  appropriate,
indicating  in each case that such Bank is  entitled to receive  payments  under
this Agreement without any deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income  taxes.  Each Bank that is  organized  outside  the United  States  shall
promptly  notify the  Borrower  and each other Bank of any change in its Lending
Office and upon written  request of the Borrower  such Bank shall,  prior to the
immediately  following  due date of any payment by the Borrower or any Guarantor
hereunder or under any other Facility Document,  deliver to the Borrower or such
Guarantor,  as  the  case  may  be  (with  copies  to  each  other  Bank),  such
certificates,  documents or other evidence,  as required by the Code or Treasury
Regulations  issued pursuant  thereto,  including  without  limitation  Internal
Revenue Service Form 4224,  Form 1001 and any other  certificate or statement of
exemption  required  by  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.1441-4(a)  or  Section
1.1441-6(c)  or any  subsequent  version  thereof,  properly  completed and duly
executed  by such Bank  establishing  that such  payment  is (i) not  subject to
withholding  under the Code because such payment is  effectively  connected with
the  conduct by such Bank of a trade or  business  in the United  States or (ii)
totally  exempt from United  States tax under a provision of an  applicable  tax
treaty. The Borrower shall be entitled to rely on such forms in their possession
until receipt of any revised or successor form pursuant to this Section  3.7(c).
If the  Agent or a Bank  fails  to  provide  a  certificate,  document  or other
evidence required pursuant to this Section 3.7(c),  then, unless it is no longer
entitled to such  exemption  due to a change in law, upon notice by the Borrower
to the Agent  and such  Bank (i) the  Borrower  shall be  entitled  to deduct or
withhold on payments to the Agent or such Bank as a result of such  failure,  as
required by law, and (ii) the Borrower shall not be required to make payments of
additional amounts with respect to such withheld Taxes pursuant to clause (x) of
Section 3.7(c) to the extent such  withholding  is required  solely by reason of
the  failure of the Agent or such Bank to  provide  the  necessary  certificate,
document or other evidence.

            SECTION 3.8 Interim Adjustments to Borrowing Base.

            (a) The Borrowing Base shall be adjusted periodically as follows:

                (i) The Borrowing Base shall be increased to include:

                    (A) Real  Estate  Assets that are  acquired by the  Borrower
and/or the Guarantors  and that satisfy the definition of "Eligible  Properties"
hereunder; and

                    (B) Real  Estate  Assets  that do not  qualify as  "Eligible
Properties" but subsequently satisfy the requirements of "Eligible Properties";

                    (C)  Real  Estate  Assets  that  originally   satisfied  the
definition of "Eligible  Properties"  hereunder,  where the provisions of clause
(ii) (B) below were  applied but the  condition  has been cured  through a lease
extension, re-leasing of such property or otherwise

provided,  however,  that in either case with respect to any such property,  the
Agent, on behalf of the Banks,  shall be permitted to conduct such due diligence
investigations as the Banks deem appropriate prior to including such property as
an "Eligible  Property" and the Banks shall be satisfied that the property meets
the  criteria  for  "Eligible  Properties".  So long as no Event of Default  has
occurred and is then continuing,  such due diligence  investigations shall be at
the  Banks'  expense.  In the event the Agent  does not  inform the owner of the
subject Real Estate Asset that the Banks have  rejected the Real Estate Asset as
an Eligible  Property  within 30 Banking Days,  such property in question  shall
automatically be deemed an Eligible Property.

                (ii)  Conversely,  the  Borrowing  Base  shall be  decreased  to
exclude:

                      (A) Real Estate  Assets  that are sold by the  Borrower or
any Guarantor or that become subject to liens securing Indebtedness which exceed
30% of the annualized and normalized  actual  year-to-date  Net Operating Income
for such property capitalized at 12.0%; and

                      (B) Any Real Estate Asset that  originally  satisfied  the
definition of "Eligible  Property," (i) if the tenant for a substantial  portion
of such property has delivered a termination notice, or (ii) six months prior to
the  termination  of the lease  with  respect to a  substantial  portion of such
property  or (iii) if the tenant  otherwise  indicates  its  intention  to cease
paying rent with respect to a substantial portion of such property.

            (b) Upon the  happening of any of the events  described  above,  the
Borrower  shall  deliver to the Banks a notice  thereof as required  pursuant to
Section 7.8 hereof.  In addition,  the Borrower shall deliver to the banks a new
Borrowing Base  Certificate  within five (5) Banking Days after the happening of
any such event;  provided , however, that in the case of clause 3.8(a)(i) above,
the Borrower  shall not deliver a new Borrowing Base  Certificate  including any
such  property   until  the  Agent  shall  have   completed  its  due  diligence
investigation  and the Banks shall have been satisfied with the results thereof.
The  Agent  agrees  to use all  reasonable  efforts  to  complete  any  such due
diligence  investigation  within 30 Banking  Days of  receiving  notice from the
Borrower thereof.

                                   ARTICLE 4.
                             YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.

            SECTION 4.1 Certain Compensation.

            (a) The Borrower  hereby  agrees to indemnify  the Banks against any
loss or  expense  which the Banks or any one of them may  sustain  or incur as a
consequence of any of the following:

                (i) the  receipt or  recovery  by a Bank,  whether by  voluntary
            prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, of all or any part of a LIBOR
            Loan prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto;

                (ii) the  conversion,  prior  to the  last day of an  applicable
            Interest Period, of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan;

                (iii) the  failure by the  Borrower  to borrow  any LIBOR  Loan,
            convert  any Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR  Loan or  continue  any LIBOR
            Loan on the date of borrowing,  conversion or continuation set forth
            in the notice  delivered by the Borrower  pursuant to the provisions
            hereof,  unless  such  failure  to borrow  results  from the  Banks'
            failure to fund such  borrowing when the Banks are required to do so
            under the terms of this Agreement; or

                (iv) the failure by the Borrower to pay,  punctually  on the due
            date thereof,  any amount payable by the Borrower with respect to or
            on account of any LIBOR Loan.

            In any such event,  without  limiting  the effect of the  foregoing,
Borrower shall pay to any Bank a "yield  maintenance  fee" in an amount computed
as follows:  The current rate for United States Treasury  securities (bills on a
discounted  basis shall be converted to a bond  equivalent) with a maturity date
closest to the term  chosen  pursuant  to the Fixed Rate  Election  (as  defined
below) with respect to the principal amount so received, recovered, converted or
not borrowed,  shall be subtracted from the rate of interest  applicable to such
LIBOR Loan (or the rate  agreed to in the case of a failure to  borrow).  If the
result is zero or a negative number, there shall be no yield maintenance fee. If
the  result  is a  positive  number  then  the  resulting  percentage  shall  be
multiplied by the amount of the principal  balance  being  received,  recovered,
converted  or not  borrowed.  The  resulting  amount shall be divided by 360 and
multiplied  by the number of days  remaining in the term chosen  pursuant to the
Fixed Rate  Election as to which the  prepayment  is made.  Said amount shall be
reduced to present value calculated by using the above referenced  United States
Treasury  securities  rate and the number of days  remaining  in the term chosen
pursuant to the relevant Fixed Rate Election.  The resulting amount shall be the
yield  maintenance  fee due to such Bank.  Each  reference in this  paragraph to
"Fixed  Rate  Election"  shall mean the  election  by  Borrower  of the  Reserve
Adjusted  LIBOR Rate.  If by reason of an Event of  Default,  the Banks elect to
declare the Revolving  Credit Notes to be immediately due and payable,  then any
yield  maintenance  fee with  respect  to all LIBOR  Loan  shall  become due and
payable in the same manner as though the Borrower prepaid such LIBOR loans.

                                       23

<PAGE>



            (b) Any Bank requesting indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1
shall  deliver to Agent and to the Borrower a certificate  as to any  additional
amounts payable  pursuant to this Section 4.1 setting forth the basis and method
of determining  such amounts,  which  certificate  shall be  conclusive,  absent
manifest error, as to the  determination  by each Bank set forth therein if made
reasonably and in good faith. The Borrower shall pay to each Bank any amounts so
certified  by such Bank within 10 days of receipt of any such  certificate.  For
purposes of this Section 4.1,  all  references  to the "Bank" shall be deemed to
include any participant in this Agreement and/or the Revolving Credit Loans.

            SECTION 4.2 Additional Costs.

            (a) The  Borrower  shall pay to each  Bank,  from  time to time,  on
demand of any such Bank,  such amounts as such Bank may reasonably  determine in
good faith to be necessary to compensate it for any costs which Bank  reasonably
determines are  attributable to its obligation to make any Revolving Credit Loan
hereunder,  or any reduction in any amount  receivable by such Bank hereunder in
respect of any such Revolving Credit Loans or such obligation (such increases in
costs and  reductions  in amounts  receivable  being herein  called  "Additional
Costs"),  resulting from any Regulatory  Change after the date of this Agreement
which:  (i) changes  the basis of  taxation of any amounts  payable to such Bank
under  this  Agreement  or its  Revolving  Credit  Note in  respect  of any such
obligations (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Bank for
any of such obligations by the jurisdiction in which such Bank has its Principal
Office or Lending Office or franchise taxes imposed in lieu of income taxes); or
(ii) imposes or modifies  any reserve,  special  deposit,  deposit  insurance or
assessment,  minimum capital,  capital ratio or similar requirements relating to
any  extensions  of credit for similar  types of loans as the  Revolving  Credit
Loans or other assets of, or any  deposits  with or other  liabilities  of, such
Bank (including any of such Revolving  Credit Loans or any deposits  referred to
in the  definitions  of "LIBOR  Loans");  or (iii)  imposes any other  condition
affecting  this  Agreement,  or its  Revolving  Credit  Note  (or  any  of  such
extensions of credit or liabilities)  and such Bank's  obligations  with respect
thereto. Each Bank will notify the Agent and the Borrower of any event occurring
after the date of this  Agreement  which will entitle such Bank to  compensation
pursuant to this  Section  4.2(a) as promptly  as  practicable  after it obtains
knowledge thereof and determines to request such  compensation.  Notwithstanding
anything  herein to the contrary,  no provision of this Section  4.2(a) shall be
deemed to require  the  Borrower to make any payment of any amount to the extent
that such payment would  duplicate any payment made by the Borrower  pursuant to
Section 3.7 hereof.

            (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 4.2, in the event that,  by reason of any  Regulatory  Change,  any Bank
either (i) incurs  Additional  Costs based on or measured by the excess  above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other  liabilities of
such Bank which  includes  deposits by reference  to which the interest  rate on
LIBOR  Loans is  determined  as  provided  in this  Agreement  or a category  of
extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which  includes LIBOR Loans or
(ii)  becomes  subject  to  restrictions  on the  amount of such a  category  of
liabilities or assets which it and similar banks may hold, then, if such Bank so
elects by notice to the  Borrower,  the  obligation  of such Bank to make  LIBOR
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the date such Regulatory  Change ceases
to be in  effect  (in  which  case  the  provisions  of  Section  4.5  shall  be
applicable).

                                       24

<PAGE>



            (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 4.2 (but without duplication),  the Borrower shall pay to each Bank from
time to time on request such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine to be
necessary  to  fairly  compensate  such  Bank  for any  actual  costs  which  it
reasonably determines in good faith are attributable to the maintenance by it or
any of its Affiliates  pursuant to any law or regulation of any  jurisdiction or
any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law
and whether in effect on the date of this  Agreement or thereafter) of any court
or  governmental or monetary  authority,  of capital in respect of its Revolving
Credit  Loans or other  obligations  hereunder  (such  compensation  to include,
without  limitation,  an amount  equal to any  reduction  in return on assets or
equity of such Bank to a level below that which it could have  achieved  but for
such law,  regulation,  interpretation,  directive or  request).  Each Bank will
notify the Agent and the Borrower if it is entitled to compensation  pursuant to
this Section  4.2(c) as promptly as  practicable  after it determines to request
such compensation.

            (d) A statement  of any Bank  setting  forth such amount or amounts,
supported  by  calculations  in  reasonable  detail,  as shall be  necessary  to
compensate  such Bank as specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The
Borrower  shall pay each such Bank the amount shown as due on any such statement
within ten (10) days after its receipt of the same.

            (e) Any Bank claiming any  additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to
this Section 4.2 agrees to use  reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with legal and
regulatory  restrictions) to designate a different  Lending Office if the making
of such a  designation  would  avoid the need for,  or reduce the amount of, any
such additional amounts and would not, in the reasonable  judgment of such Bank,
be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

            SECTION 4.3 Limitation on Types of Revolving Credit Loans.  Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if:

            (a) any Bank determines  (which  determination  shall be conclusive)
that quotations of interest rates for the relevant  deposits  referred to in the
definition  of  "LIBOR  Loans " in  Section  1.1 are not being  provided  in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant  maturities for purposes of determining the
rate of interest for any LIBOR Loans as provided in this Agreement; or

            (b) any Bank determines  (which  determination  shall be conclusive)
and  notifies the Agent and the  Borrower  that the  relevant  rates of interest
referred to in the  definition of "LIBOR Loans" in Section 1.1 upon the basis of
which the rate of interest  for any type of LIBOR Loans is to be  determined  do
not  adequately  cover  the cost to such  Bank of  making  or  maintaining  such
Revolving Credit Loans, then, such Bank shall as soon as practicable  thereafter
give written notice (or facsimile notice promptly  confirmed in writing) of such
determination to the Agent and the Borrower, and any request by the Borrower for
the making of a LIBOR Loan or conversion or continuation of any Revolving Credit
Loan into a LIBOR Loan, in each case,  pursuant to the provisions  hereof shall,
until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to
be a request for a Base Rate Loan. Each  determination  by a Bank made hereunder
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                                       25

<PAGE>



            SECTION 4.4 Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement,  in the event that it becomes  unlawful  for any Bank or its  Lending
Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans  hereunder,  then
such Bank shall  promptly  notify the Agent and the  Borrower  thereof  and such
Bank's  obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans  hereunder shall be suspended
until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain such affected Revolving
Credit Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5 shall be applicable).

            SECTION 4.5 Certain LIBOR Loans  Pursuant To Sections  4.2., 4.3 and
4.4.  If an event  referred  to in Section  4.2,  4.3 or 4.4 has  occurred,  the
affected Bank shall be required to make Base Rate Loans in accordance  with this
Agreement,  and  all  LIBOR  Loans  of  such  Bank  then  outstanding  shall  be
automatically  converted into Base Rate Loans on the date specified by such Bank
in such  notice  (which  shall  be,  for each  LIBOR  Loan,  the last day of the
Interest  Period  applicable  thereto  unless  such Bank  determines  that it is
required by law to convert such LIBOR Loan on an earlier date in which case such
earlier  date shall be the date of  conversion),  and,  to the extent that LIBOR
Loans are so made as (or  converted  into)  Base Rate  Loans,  all  payments  of
principal  which would  otherwise be applied to such Bank's LIBOR Loans shall be
applied  instead to its Base Rate Loans.  In the event of any  conversion of any
LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan  pursuant  to Section  4.5 prior to the  maturity
date with  respect to such LIBOR Loan,  the  Borrower  shall pay to the relevant
Bank all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof.

            SECTION 4.6 Survival.  The  indemnities  and other  obligations  set
forth in this Article 4 shall survive  payment in full of all  Revolving  Credit
Loans  or  extensions  of  credit  made  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  and  the
Termination Date.

            SECTION  4.7  Replacement  of Banks.  If any Bank is affected by the
events or  circumstances  described  in  Sections  4.3(b)  and 4.4 and  requests
additional  compensation  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Agreement,  then the
Borrower  may, at its sole expense and effort,  upon notice to such Bank and the
Agent,  (a) require such Bank to assign and delegate,  without  recourse (and in
accordance  with the  restrictions  set forth in Section 12.6  hereof),  all its
interests,  rights,  and  obligations  under this  Agreement to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations  (which assignee may be another Bank, if such Bank
accepts such  assignment)  or (b) reduce the  Commitment of such Bank which such
events or  circumstances  described  in Section  4.3(b) and  Section  4.4 are in
existence; provided, that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written
consent  of the Agent,  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld  or
delayed,  (ii) such Bank shall have  received  payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding  principal  amount of its Revolving  Credit Loans,  accrued interest
thereon,  accrued  fees and  other  amounts  payable  to it  hereunder  from the
assignee (to the extent of the  outstanding  principal and accrued  interest and
fees) or the Borrower  (in the case of all other  amounts) and (iii) in the case
of any such  assignment  resulting  from a claim for  compensation  pursuant  to
4.3(b)  or 4.4  hereof,  such  assignment  will  result in a  reduction  of such
compensation  or  payments.  A Bank  shall  not be  required  to make  any  such
assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank
or  otherwise,   the  circumstances  entitling  the  Borrower  to  require  such
assignment and delegations cease to apply.

            SECTION 7.5 Maintenance of Insurance.

            (a) With  respect  to each  Operating  Company,  maintain  insurance
covering its assets and its business with, to its knowledge,  financially  sound
and  reputable  insurance  companies  or  associations  properly  licensed to do
business in the  jurisdictions  where  inventory  is located in such amounts and
covering such risks (including,  without limitation,  products liability) as are
usually  carried  by  companies  engaged in the same or a similar  business  and
similarly situated and as are required by the Facility  Documents.  The Borrower
shall  provide the Banks  notice that such  policies  have been paid in full and
shall deliver  certified  copies of the policy or policies of such  insurance or
certificates of insurance to the Banks if the Banks so request.

            (b) With  respect to the  Borrower or any  Guarantor  that is not an
Operating  Company,  provide  copies of  evidence of  insurance  provided by any
tenant of a Real Estate Asset as required by the lease relating to such property
and, if any tenant is in default of its  obligation to maintain  insurance or if
any Real Estate Asset becomes vacant, the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case
may be, shall maintain such insurance as is required by Section 7.11 hereof.

            SECTION 7.6  Compliance  with Laws.  Comply and cause each tenant of
the Eligible Properties to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable
laws,  rules,  regulations  and orders,  and maintain  all permits  necessary to

            (a)  Subject to the terms of any lease  relating  to any Real Estate
Asset,  at any reasonable  time upon  reasonable  notice during normal  business
hours  from  time to  time,  permit  any  Agent or any  agent or  representative
thereof,  to make physical  inspections of each Real Estate Asset and to examine
and make  copies and  abstracts  from the  records  and books of account of, and
visit the  properties  of, such Person and to discuss the affairs,  finances and
accounts of such Person with any of its officers and directors and such entity's
independent  accountants.  In  addition,  if  during  the  course  of  any  such
examination hereunder,  anything comes to the Agent's attention which causes the
Agent to be concerned that there may be an  environmental  condition at any Real
Estate Asset that is an Eligible Property, the Agent may require the Borrower to
permit the Agent to conduct such  environmental  inspections  as the Agent shall
reasonably  deem  necessary  with  respect to such  property  at the  Borrower's
expense; provided,  however, that the Borrower may, within 10 days of receipt of
notice from the Agent of its  intention  to so inspect such  Eligible  Property,
elect not to permit the Agent to conduct  such  examination  in which event such
Real  Estate  Asset  shall no longer be  considered  an  Eligible  Property  for
purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base;

            (b) In addition to the  inspection  rights of the Agent  pursuant to
subparagraph (a) of this Section, the Agent shall be permitted to conduct annual
due  diligence  investigations  (which  may  include  site  inspections)  of the
Eligible Properties. The scope of such investigations shall be determined by the
Agent and the  costs of such  investigations  up to  $15,000  per  year,  in the
aggregate, shall be borne by the Borrower and, so long as no Default or Event of
Default  has  occurred  and  is  then  continuing,  shall  be  paid  out  of the
Administrative Fee.

            SECTION 7.8 Reporting Requirements.  Furnish directly to each of the

            (a) Keep or enforce  the  obligation  of  tenants to keep,  the Real
Estate Assets insured  against  damage by fire and other hazards  coveted by the

this Section shall be fully paid for,  nonassessable and contain such provisions
and  expiration  dates  and be in such  form  and  amounts  and  issued  by such
insurance companies satisfactory to the Banks. In addition, after the occurrence
of an Event of Default  hereunder,  the Banks may require the  Borrower  and the
Guarantors to carry or to require their  respective  tenants to carry such other
insurance on the Real Estate  Assets  including oil storage tank  insurance,  in
such  amounts as may from time to time be  required  by  institutional  lenders,
against  insurable  casualties which at the time are commonly insured against in
the case of premises similarly situated.

            (b) Subject to the terms of the applicable  leases,  if any Eligible
Property or any part thereof, is located in an area which has been identified by

            (c) The Borrower  shall give the Agent prompt  notice of any loss to
any Real Estate Asset  covered by insurance if such loss (i) would  decrease the

material  adverse  affect on the  Borrowing  Base or upon the  Borrower  and its
Subsidiaries  on a  consolidated  basis.  For so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, (x) the Borrower shall have the sole right to adjust
losses covered by insurance,  (y) the proceeds from any adjusted insurance claim
shall be paid to the Borrower,  which proceeds shall be used by the Borrower for
the  restoration,  rebuilding,  renovation  and/or  repair  of the  property  so
requiring  same.  If, at the time of any loss,  an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, (A) the Borrower shall not adjust said loss without the prior
written  consent of the Banks;  and (B) any and all insurance  proceeds shall be
paid to the Agent and the Agent,  with the consent of the Required Banks, in its
sole discretion, may use such proceeds to either (I) repay all or any portion of
the Revolving Credit Loans or (II) restore,  rebuild, renovate and/or repair the
damaged property.  In the event the Agent makes the insurance proceeds available
to the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  agrees to  promptly  commence  and  diligently
continue to perform the repairs,  restoration,  renovation  or rebuilding of the
damaged  property so as to restore such property to be in full  compliance  with
all laws  (except  those  laws  which  the  failure  to  comply  with  could not
reasonably  be  expected  to  have  material  adverse  effect  on the  business,
properties,  prospects,  financial  or other  condition  of the  Borrower or the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole) and so that such property shall
be at least  equal in value  and  general  utility  as prior to such  damage  or
destruction.  All  provisions of this Section  7.11(c) and the Banks' rights and
remedies  hereunder  are subject to the insurance  provisions of the  applicable
leases on the Real Estate Assets and proceeds for rebuilding  which shall exceed
$500,000  shall  be  disbursed  by the  Agent  in  conformity  with  its  normal
construction lending procedures.

            SECTION 7.12 Condemnation.  The Borrower, immediately upon obtaining
of the knowledge of the institution of any  proceedings for the  condemnation of
any of the Real  Estate  Assets or any part of any Real  Estate  Assets that may
materially  effect  the  value  of the  Borrowing  Base or that  may  materially
adversely  effect the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,  on a consolidated  basis,

provisions of the applicable leases, after the occurrence of an Event of Default
hereunder,  the Agent may  participate in any such  proceeding and the Borrower,
from time to time, will deliver to the Agent all instruments  requested by it to
permit such  participation.  In the event of such condemnation  proceeding after
the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  hereunder,  the award or  compensation
payable is hereby assigned to and shall be paid to the Agent. The Agent shall be
under no obligation to question the amount of any such award or compensation. In
any such  condemnation  proceedings  after the occurrence of an Event of Default
hereunder,  the Agent may be represented by counsel  selected by the Agent.  The
Borrower, upon request by the Agent, shall make, execute and deliver any and all
instruments  requested for the purpose of  confirming  of the  assignment of the
aforesaid  awards  and  compensation  to the Agent  free and clear of any liens,
charges or encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever. All provisions of this
Section  7.12 and the Banks'  rights and remedies  hereunder  are subject to the
condemnation provisions of the applicable leases on the Real Estate Assets.

            SECTION 7.13 Subsidiaries.  Simultaneously with their creation, give

                                       50

of this  Agreement be a trustee for any Bank. The Agent shall not be responsible
to the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
the Borrower,  or any officer or official of the  Borrower,  or any other Person
contained  in  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Facility  Document,  or  in  any
certificate or other  document or instrument  referred to or provided for in, or
received by any of them under this Agreement or any other Facility Document,  or
for the value, legality, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency  of this  Agreement  or any  other  Facility  Document  or any other
document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein, or for the
failure  by  the  Borrower  to  perform  any  of its  obligations  hereunder  or
thereunder.  The Agent may employ agents and  attorneys-in-fact and shall not be
responsible,  except as to money or securities  received by it or its authorized
agents, for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers,  employees  or agents  shall be liable or  responsible  for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Facility
Document or in  connection  herewith or  therewith,  except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower shall pay any fee agreed to
by the Borrower and the Agent with respect to the Agent's services hereunder.

            SECTION 10.2 Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any certification,  notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone,  telefax,  telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper  Person or
Persons,   and  upon  advice  and  statements  of  legal  counsel,   independent
accountants  and other  experts  selected  by the Agent.  The Agent may deem and
treat each Bank as the holder of the  Revolving  Credit Loans made by it for all
purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the assignment or transfer  thereof
satisfactory  to the Agent signed by such Bank shall have been  furnished to the
Agent,  but the Agent  shall not be  required  to deal with any  Person  who has
acquired a  participation  in any  Revolving  Credit Loan from a Bank. As to any
matters not  expressly  provided  for by this  Agreement  or any other  Facility
Document,  the Agent  shall in all cases be fully  protected  in  acting,  or in
refraining from acting,  hereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the
Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant  thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks and any
other holder of all or any portion any Revolving Credit Loan.

            SECTION  10.3  Defaults.  The  Agent  shall  not be  deemed  to have
knowledge  of the  occurrence  of a Default or Event of Default  (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest or fees on the Revolving Credit Loans to
the extent the same is  required  to be paid to the Agent for the account of the
Banks)  unless  the  Agent  has  received  notice  from a Bank  or the  Borrower
specifying  such  Default  or Event of  Default.  In the  event  that the  Agent
receives such a notice of the  occurrence of a Default or Event of Default,  the
Agent  shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the Banks (and shall give each Bank
prompt  notice of each such  non-payment).  The Agent shall  (subject to Section
11.8) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default which is
continuing as shall be directed by the Required Banks; provided that, unless and
until the Agent shall have  received  such  directions,  the Agent may take such
action,  or refrain  from taking such  action,  with  respect to such Default or
Event of Default as it shall deem  advisable in the best  interest of the Banks;
and  provided  further  that the Agent  shall not be  required  to take any such
action which it determines to be contrary to law.

            SECTION  10.4  Rights  of  Agent  as a  Bank.  With  respect  to its
Commitment and the Revolving  Credit Loans made by it, the Agent in its capacity
as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Bank and may  exercise  the same as though it were not acting as the Agent,  and
the term  "Bank" or "Banks"  shall,  unless  the  context  otherwise  indicates,
include  the Agent in its  capacity  as a Bank.  The Agent or any Bank and their
respective Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any other Bank)
accept  deposits  from,  lend  money  to (on a  secured  or  unsecured  basis as
otherwise  permitted  hereunder),  and generally  engage in any kind of banking,
trust or other business with, the Borrower or any of the Guarantors  (and any of
their  Affiliates).  In the  case of the  Agent,  it may do so as if it were not
acting as the Agent, and the Agent may accept fees and other  consideration from
the  Borrower or any of the  Guarantors  for  services in  connection  with this
Agreement  or  otherwise  without  having to account  for the same to the Banks.
Although the Agent or a Bank or their respective Affiliates may in the course of
such  relationships  and  relationships  with other Persons acquire  information
about  the  Borrower  or any of the  Guarantors  or  Affiliates  and such  other
Persons,  neither the Agent nor such Bank shall have any duty to  disclose  such
information to the other Banks except as otherwise required pursuant to Facility
Documents.

            SECTION 10.5  Indemnification of Agent. The Banks agree to indemnify
the  Agent  (to the  extent  not  reimbursed  under  Section  12.3 or under  the
applicable  provisions of any other Facility Document,  but without limiting the
obligations of the Borrower under Section 12.3 or such  provisions),  ratably in
accordance with the respective  Obligations of the Borrower then due and payable
to each of them (or, if no Revolving  Credit Loans are at the time  outstanding,
ratably  in  accordance  with  their  respective  Commitments),  for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted  against the Agent in any way relating to or
arising  out of  this  Agreement,  any  other  Facility  Document  or any  other
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including,  without limitation,  the costs and expenses which
the  Borrower is obligated  to pay under  Section  12.3 or under the  applicable
provisions of any other  Facility  Document but  excluding,  unless a Default or
Event  of  Default  has  occurred,  normal  administrative  costs  and  expenses
incidental to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement
of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such  documents or  instruments;
provided  that no Bank  shall be liable for any of the  foregoing  to the extent
they arise from the gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct of the party to be
indemnified.

            SECTION  10.6  Documents.  The  Agent  will  forward  to each  Bank,
promptly after the Agent's  receipt  thereof,  a copy of each report,  notice or
other document  required by this Agreement or any other Facility  Document to be
delivered to the Agent for such Bank.

            SECTION 10.7 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank agrees
that it has,  independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank,
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made
its own credit analysis of the Borrower and the Guarantors and decision to enter
into this Agreement and that it will,  independently  and without  reliance upon
the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such  documents and  information as it
shall  deem  appropriate  at the time,  continue  to make its own  analysis  and

                                       52

<PAGE>



decisions  in taking or not  taking  action  under this  Agreement  or any other
Facility Document. The Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to
the  performance  or observance  by the Borrower of this  Agreement or any other
Facility  Document or any other  document  referred to or provided for herein or
therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
except as provided herein.  Except for notices,  reports and other documents and
information  expressly  required  to be  furnished  to the  Banks  by the  Agent
hereunder,  the Agent shall not have any duty or  responsibility  to provide any
Bank with any credit or other  information  concerning  the  affairs,  financial
condition  or  business  of the  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary  (or any of  their
Affiliates)  which  may  come  into  the  possession  of  the  Agent  or of  its
Affiliates.  The Agent shall not be required to file this  Agreement,  any other
Facility  Document or any document or instrument  referred to herein or therein,
for record or give notice of this Agreement,  any other Facility Document or any
document  or  instrument  referred to herein or  therein,  to anyone.  The Banks
acknowledge  that,  from time to time,  the  Borrower or its  Subsidiaries  have
obtained or  participated  in mortgages or  contractual  arrangements  involving
certain of the Banks and nothing  herein shall  prohibit or limit the ability of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to obtain or participate in mortgages or
enter into the contractual arrangements with any Bank in the future.

            SECTION  10.8 Failure of Agent to Act.  Except for action  expressly
required of the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified
in failing or refusing to act hereunder  unless it shall have  received  further
assurances   (which  may  include  cash   collateral)  of  the   indemnification
obligations  of the Banks under Section 11.5 in respect of any and all liability
and expense  which may be incurred  by it by reason of taking or  continuing  to
take any such action.

            SECTION  10.9  Resignation  or  Removal  of  Agent.  Subject  to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may
resign at any time by giving  written  notice  thereof at least 30 Banking  Days
prior  thereto  to the Banks and the  Borrower,  the Agent may be removed at any
time with cause by the  Required  Banks and the Agent may be removed at any time
without  cause by the Required  Banks if with the prior  written  consent of the
Borrower;  provided  that the  Borrower  and the other  Banks  shall be promptly
notified thereof. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall
have the right to appoint a successor  Agent.  If no successor  Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Required Banks' removal of the retiring  Agent,  then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks,  appoint a  successor  Agent,  which  shall be a Bank.  The
Required  Banks  or the  retiring  Agent,  as the case  may be,  shall  upon the
appointment  of a Successor  Agent promptly so notify the Borrower and the other
Banks.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor
Agent,  such successor Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become vested with
all the rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring  Agent,  and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  hereunder.
The retiring  Agent shall execute all documents or  instruments of assignment as
shall be  necessary  to vest in the  successor  Agent all rights of the retiring
Agent hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Agent,  the  provisions  of this  Article  11 shall  continue  in effect for its
benefit in respect  of any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as the Agent.

            SECTION 10.10 Amendments Concerning Agency Function. The Agent shall
not be  bound by any  waiver,  amendment,  supplement  or  modification  of this
Agreement or any other Facility  Document which affects its duties  hereunder or
thereunder unless it shall have given its prior consent thereto.

            SECTION  10.11  Liability  of Agent.  The  Agent  shall not have any
liabilities or responsibilities to the Borrower on account of the failure of any
Bank to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  or to any Bank on  account of the
failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations  hereunder or under any other
Facility Document.

            SECTION 10.12  Transfer of Agency  Function.  Without the consent of
the  Borrower  or any  Bank,  the  Agent  may at any  time or from  time to time
transfer  its  functions  as  Agent  hereunder  to any of its  offices  wherever
located,  provided  that the Agent shall  promptly  notify the  Borrower and the
Banks thereof.

            SECTION 10.13  Non-Receipt  of Funds by the Agent.  Unless the Agent
shall have been  notified by a Bank or the Borrower  (either one as  appropriate
being  the  "Payor")  prior to the date on which  such  Bank is to make  payment
hereunder  to the  Agent  of the  proceeds  of a  Revolving  Credit  Loan or the
Borrower  is to make  Payment  to the  Agent,  as the case may be  (either  such
payment  being a "Required  Payment"),  which  notice  shall be  effective  upon
receipt,  that the Payor  does not  intend to make the  Required  Payment to the
Agent,  the Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in
reliance  upon such  assumption  (but shall not be required to), make the amount
thereof  available to the intended  recipient on such date and, if the Payor has
not in fact made the  Required  Payment  to the  Agent,  the  recipient  of such
payment  shall,  on demand,  repay to the Agent the amount made  available to it
together with interest thereon for the period commencing on the date such amount
was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount
at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day (when the Agent
recovers such amount from a Bank) or equal to the rate of interest applicable to
such  Revolving  Credit  Loan  (when the Agent  recovers  such  amount  from the
Borrower) and, if such recipient shall fail to make such payment  promptly,  the
Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand,  from the Payor, with
interest as aforesaid.

            SECTION 10.14  Withholding  Taxes.  Each Bank  represents that it is
entitled  to  receive  any  payments  to be made  to it  hereunder  without  the
withholding of any tax and will furnish to the Agent such forms, certifications,
statements  and other  documents  as the Agent may request  from time to time to
evidence such Bank's  exemption  from the  withholding of any tax imposed by any
jurisdiction  or to  enable  the  Agent to comply  with any  applicable  laws or
regulations relating thereto.  Without limiting the effect of the foregoing,  if
any Bank is not  created or  organized  under the laws of the  United  States of
America or any state  thereof,  in the event that the payment of interest by the
Borrower is treated for U.S.  income tax purposes as derived in whole or in part
from sources from within the U.S.,  such Bank will furnish to the Agent, no less
frequently  than  annually,  Form  4224 or Form  1001  of the  Internal  Revenue
Service,  or such other forms,  certifications,  statements or  documents,  duly
executed and  completed by such Bank as evidence of such Bank's  exemption  from
the  withholding  of U.S.  tax with  respect  thereto.  The  Agent  shall not be
obligated  to make  any  payments  hereunder  to such  Bank  in  respect  of any
Revolving  Credit  Loan or such  Bank's  Commitment  until  such Bank shall have
furnished to the Agent the requested form, certification, statement or document.

                                       54

            SECTION 10.15 Several  Obligations and Rights of Banks.  The failure
of any  Bank to make  any  Revolving  Credit  Loan to be made by it on the  date
specified  therefor  shall not relieve any other Bank of its  obligation to make
its Revolving Credit Loan on such date, but no Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other  Bank to make a  Revolving  Credit  Loan to be made by such
other Bank.  The amounts  payable at any time  hereunder to each Bank shall be a
separate and  independent  debt,  and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and
enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement,  and it shall not be necessary
for any other Bank to be joined as an  additional  party in any  proceeding  for
such purposes.

            SECTION 10.16 Pro Rata  Treatment of Revolving  Credit  Loans,  Etc.
Except to the extent  otherwise  provided:  (a) each  borrowing  under Article 2
shall be made from the Banks, each reduction or termination of the amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitments under Section 2.8 shall be applied to the Revolving
Credit  Commitments  of the Banks,  and each payment of the fees  referenced  in
Article 3, shall be made by and held for the  account of the Banks,  pro rata in
accordance with their respective Commitment Proportions; (b) each prepayment and
payment of principal  of or interest on  Revolving  Credit Loans of a particular
type and a particular Interest Period shall be made to the Agent for the account
of the Bank's holding  Revolving  Credit Loans of such type and Interest  Period
pro rata in accordance  with the  respective  unpaid  principal  amounts of such
Revolving Credit Loans of such Interest Period held by such Banks.

            SECTION  10.17  Sharing of  Payments  Among  Banks.  If a Bank shall
obtain payment of any principal of or interest on any Revolving Credit Loan made
by it through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien,  counterclaim,
or by any  other  means,  it shall  promptly  purchase  from the  other  Banks a
participation  in the  Revolving  Credit  Loans made by the other  Banks in such
amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable
to the end that all the Banks shall share the  benefit of such  payment  (net of
any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving  such
benefit) pro rata in  accordance  with the unpaid  principal and interest on the
Revolving  Credit  Loans held by each of them.  To such end the Banks shall make
appropriate   adjustments   among   themselves   (by  the  resale  of  any  such
participation  sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation in
the  Revolving  Credit  Loans  made by other  Banks may  exercise  all rights of
setoff,  banker's  lien,  counterclaim  or similar  rights with  respect to such
participation.  Nothing  contained herein shall require any Bank to exercise any
such  right or shall  affect the right of any Bank to  exercise,  and retain the
benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness of
the Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE 11.
                                 MISCELLANEOUS.

            SECTION 11.1 Amendments and Waivers.  Except as otherwise  expressly
provided in this  Agreement,  any provision of this  Agreement may be amended or
modified  only by an  instrument  in  writing  signed  by the  Borrower  and the
Required  Banks,  and any  provision  of this  Agreement  may be  waived  by the
Borrower and by an instrument  signed by the Required  Banks (if such  provision
requires performance by the Borrower),  including, but not limited to, any Event

                                       55

<PAGE>



of Default; provided that no amendment,  modification or waiver shall, unless by
an  instrument  signed by all of the Banks:  (a) subject to the last sentence of
this Section 12.1,  increase or extend the term, or extend the time or waive any
requirement  for  the  reduction  or  termination  of or  otherwise  change  the
Commitment,  (b)  extend  the date  fixed for the  payment  of  principal  of or
interest on any Revolving  Credit Loan,  (c) reduce the amount of any payment of
principal  thereof or the rate at which  interest is payable  thereon or any fee
payable hereunder, (d) alter the terms of this Section 12.1, (e) change the fees
payable to any Bank except as expressly  otherwise  provided herein,  (f) permit
the  Borrower,  or any of the  Guarantors,  to  transfer  or  assign  any of its
obligations hereunder or under the Facility Documents,  (g) release the security
interest  in and Lien on or the right to a security  interest  in and Lien,  any
collateral  securing the Borrower's  obligations  thereunder,  or (h) change the
definition of the term  "Required  Banks." No failure on the part of any Bank to
exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any right  hereunder  shall operate as a
waiver thereof or preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any  other  right.  The  remedies  herein  provided  are  cumulative  and not
exclusive  of any  remedies  provided  by law.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary herein,  the Agent and the Borrower may increase the Total  Commitments
to an amount up to $100,000,000, without the prior written consent of the Banks,
provided  that any new Bank agrees to be subject to the terms and  conditions of
this Agreement and the other Facility  Documents and no Bank's  Commitment shall
be increased or decreased without their prior written consent. In addition, each
Bank  agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent any  documents  and  agreements
that may be  reasonably  necessary in order to  effectuate  such increase in the
Total Commitment.

            SECTION 11.2 Usury. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the  Obligations  shall be subject to the  limitation  that payments of interest
shall not be required to the extent that  receipt  thereof  would be contrary to
provisions of law  applicable to a Bank limiting  rates of interest which may be
charged or collected by such Bank.  If any of the  above-referenced  payments of
interest,  together  with any other  charges  or fees  deemed  in the  nature of
interest,  exceed the maximum legal rate, then the Banks shall have the right to
make such  adjustments  as are necessary to reduce any such  aggregate  interest
rate (based on the foregoing aggregate amount) to the maximum legal rate, and if
any Bank ever receives,  collects or applies any such excess, it shall be deemed
a partial  repayment of principal and treated as such;  and if principal is paid
in full,  any remaining  excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.  The Borrower
waives any right to prior notice of such  adjustment and further agrees that any
such  adjustment may be made by the Banks  subsequent to  notification  from the
Borrower that such aggregate interest charged exceeds the maximum legal rate.

            SECTION  11.3  Expenses  and  Indemnification.  The  Borrower  shall
reimburse  the Agent on demand for all  reasonable  costs,  expenses and charges
incurred by the Agent in connection with the  preparation,  review and execution
of, and any amendment,  supplement,  waiver or modification  to, this Agreement,
the  Revolving  Credit  Notes or any  other  Facility  Documents,  and any other
documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,  and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,  including without limitation,
the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of Farrell Fritz,  P.C.,  counsel to the
Agent  provided,  that legal fees of the  Agent's  counsel  with  respect to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for the period on or
prior to the Closing Date,  shall be limited to $45,000,  plus  disbursements of
such counsel up to a cap of $20,000).  Without  limiting the  generality  of the

                                       56

<PAGE>



foregoing,  the Borrower  shall pay all recording fees and charges and recording
taxes  incurred by any of the Banks  hereunder  or in  connection  herewith.  In
addition, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank for all of its reasonable costs
and expenses  incurred  from and after the  occurrence of an Event of Default in
connection with the perfection,  protection,  enforcement or preservation of any
rights under this  Agreement,  the Revolving  Credit Notes or the other Facility
Documents.  The  Borrower  agrees to  indemnify  each Bank and their  respective
directors,  officers, employees,  representatives and agents from, and hold each
of them harmless against, any and all losses,  liabilities,  claims,  damages or
expenses of any kind  (including,  without  limitation,  the reasonable fees and
expenses  of  counsel  for such  Person in  connection  with any  investigative,
administrative  or  judicial  proceeding,  whether or not such  Person  shall be
designated a party thereto)  incurred by any of them arising out of or by reason
of  any  investigation  or  litigation  or  other  proceedings   (including  any
threatened  investigation  or  litigation or other  proceedings)  relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the
proceeds of the  Revolving  Credit  Loans,  or to the failure of the Borrower to
perform or observe any of the terms,  covenants or  conditions on its part to be
performed  or  observed  under  this  Agreement  or  under  any of the  Facility
Documents.  The indemnity  provided in this Section shall not extend to any such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Person to be indemnified.

            SECTION 11.4 Special Provisions Regarding Collateral. Simultaneously
with  the  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement,  the  Borrower  and the
Guarantors  have  deposited  with the Agent for the  benefit of the  Banks,  the
Assignments  duly  executed  and in  proper  form for  recording  in each of the
jurisdictions where Eligible Properties are located. In addition,  the Operating
Companies  have  deposited  with the  Agent  for the  benefit  of the  Banks the
Security  Agreements,  together  with  UCC-I  financing  statements,  each  duly
executed and in proper form for recording in each of the  jurisdictions in which
the Operating Companies maintain assets. The Agent agrees to hold such documents
and not to file or record such  documents  unless and until any Event of Default
shall occur  hereunder.  The Agent further  agrees that upon the happening of an
Event of  Default  hereunder,  other  than an Event of  Default  referred  to in
Section 10.1 (e) hereof (in which case no notice shall be  required),  the Agent
shall  give the  Borrower  fourteen  (14)  days'  prior  written  notice  before
recording any of such  documents.  The costs incurred after the occurrence of an
Event of Default in connection  with  recording any such document shall be borne
by the Borrower  whether or not any such  document is recorded by the Agent.  If
any of the Assignments or financing  statements require amendment,  re-execution
or any  revision  prior to being in a form  acceptable  to be recorded or if any
other  documents or  agreements  are  required to be executed  and  delivered in
connection therewith (including, without limitation,  non-disturbance agreements
with respect to the properties involved),  the Borrower shall be responsible for
all costs  incurred  from and after the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  in
connection  with such  amendment,  re-execution  or  revision or  execution  and
delivery of additional documents required by the Agent and the Borrower shall do
all  things  necessary  at the  request  of the  Agent in order to  permit  such
documents to be prepared,  executed,  filed or recorded  whether or not any such
documents are filed or recorded. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default and the  expiration of such fourteen (14) day period (except in the case
of an Event of Default under Section 10.1(e) hereof in which case no such notice

                                       57

<PAGE>



shall be required),  and upon request of the Agent, the Borrower shall cause the
Operating  Companies  to do all things  necessary  or  required  to perfect  the
Agent's  liens upon any  inventory or other  collateral  located  outside of the
United States. To the extent that the Agent or any Bank incurs any of such costs
in  connection  with the  foregoing  directly,  such costs be  reimbursed by the
Borrower on demand. The failure of the Agent to file any of the foregoing or the
improper  filing  thereof shall not relieve the Borrower or any Guarantor of any
Obligations.

            SECTION 11.5 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Section
2.3(b),  Article 4 and Section 12.3 shall survive the repayment of the Revolving
Credit Loans and the Termination Date for a period  corresponding to the maximum
applicable  statute of  limitations in effect in the State of New York from time
to time.

            SECTION 11.6  Assignments;  Participation.  This Agreement  shall be
binding  upon,  and shall inure to the benefit of Borrower,  the Banks and their
respective  successors  and assigns,  except that the Borrower may not assign or
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder.  Each Bank may sell participations
in or,  with the prior  written  consent  of the  Borrower,  which  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld and which shall not be required during the occurrence and
continuance  of an Event of  Default,  assign  all or any part of any  Revolving
Credit Loan to another bank or other  entity,  in which event (a) in the case of
an  assignment,  upon notice  thereof by the Bank to the Borrower,  the assignee
shall  have,  to the  extent  of  such  assignment  (unless  otherwise  provided
therein),  the  same  rights,  benefits  and  obligations  (including,   without
limitation,  a  ratable  assumption  of  the  assigning  Bank's  Commitment  and
Commitment  Proportion  hereunder) as it would have if it were a Bank hereunder;
and (b) in the case of a  participation,  the  participant  shall have no rights
under the  Facility  Documents  and all amounts  payable by the  Borrower  under
Articles  2 and 3  shall  be  determined  as if such  Bank  had  not  sold  such
participation.  Such Bank may furnish any information concerning the Borrower in
the  possession  of such Bank from time to time to  assignees  and  participants
(including  prospective  assignees  and  participants);  provided that such Bank
shall require any such prospective assignee or such participant  (prospective or
otherwise)  to  agree  in  writing  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  such
information.   There  shall  be  no  limit  on  the  number  of  assignments  or
participants that may be granted by any Bank except that assignments shall be in
minimum amounts of $5,000,000 and in integral  multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof.  Notwithstanding any such assignment, any rights and remedies available
to the  Borrower  for any  breaches  by an  assigning  Bank  of its  obligations
hereunder  while a Bank shall be preserved  after such  assignment and such Bank
shall not be relieved of any liability to the Borrower due to such breach.  Each
Bank may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights  under the Facility
Documents  including  any portion of the  Revolving  Credit Notes to any Federal
Reserve  Bank  organized  under  Section 4 of the Federal  Reserve  Act. No such
pledge or enforcement  thereof shall release any Bank from its obligations under
any of the Facility Documents.

            SECTION  11.7  Notices.  Unless the party to be  notified  otherwise
notifies the other party in writing as provided in this  Section,  and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement,  notices shall be given to the Borrower by
certified or registered  mail or by recognized  overnight  delivery  services to
such party at its address on the signature page of this Agreement.  In addition,
notices of borrowing  pursuant to Section 2.4 may be  delivered  by  telecopier,
provided that such telecopied notices shall be confirmed by sending the original
signed copy of such notice to the Banks by  certified or  registered  mail or by
recognized overnight delivery services.  Initially, notice shall be delivered to
each party  hereto at the  addresses  set forth on the  signature  page  hereof.

                                       58

<PAGE>



Notices  shall be effective:  (a) if given by  registered or certified  mail, 72
hours after deposit in the mails with postage  prepaid,  addressed as aforesaid;
or (b) if given by recognized  overnight  delivery  service,  on the Banking Day
following deposit with such service  addressed as aforesaid;  or (c) if given by
telecopy,  when the telecopy is transmitted to the telecopy  number as aforesaid
and confirmed with a confirmation receipt.

            SECTION 11.8 Setoff.  The Borrower  agrees that, in addition to (and
without limitation of) any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim a Bank
may otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option without any prior
notice to Borrower  (any such notice being  expressly  waived by the Borrower to
the extent permitted by applicable law), to offset balances (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) held by it for the account of the Borrower
at any offices of such Bank or any of its Affiliates, in Dollars or in any other
currency,  against  any amount  payable by the  Borrower to such Bank under this
Agreement  or such  Bank's  Revolving  Credit  Note  which is not paid  when due
(regardless  of whether such  balances are then due to the  Borrower),  in which
case it shall promptly  notify the Borrower  thereof;  provided that such Bank's
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity  thereof.  ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO REQUIRE A BANK TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES  WITH RESPECT TO ANY
OTHER COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER  HEREUNDER,  PRIOR
TO  EXERCISING  ITS  RIGHTS OF SETOFF  ARE  HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY  AND
IRREVOCABLY  WAIVED BY THE BORROWER.  Payments by the Borrower thereof hereunder
shall be made without setoff or counterclaim.

            SECTION 11.9 Jurisdiction; Immunities.

            (a) THE BORROWER HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF
ANY NEW YORK STATE OR UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK, NASSAU OR
SUFFOLK  COUNTIES  OVER ANY ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES, AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL
CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  MAY BE HEARD AND  DETERMINED IN
SUCH NEW YORK STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE BORROWER  IRREVOCABLY  CONSENTS TO THE
SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  BY THE MAILING
(BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED  MAIL) COPIES OF SUCH PROCESS TO THE BORROWER AT THE
ADDRESS  SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.7.  THE BORROWER  AGREES THAT A FINAL  JUDGMENT
(INCLUDING  ANY  APPLICABLE  APPEALS) IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING  SHALL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR
IN ANY OTHER MANNER  PROVIDED BY LAW. THE BORROWER  FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION
TO VENUE IN SUCH  STATE AND ANY  OBJECTION  TO AN ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  IN SUCH
STATE ON THE BASIS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS. THE BORROWER FURTHER AGREES THAT ANY
ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  BROUGHT  AGAINST ANY BANK SHALL BE BROUGHT ON ONLY IN NEW
YORK STATE OR UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY.

                                       59

            (b)  EACH  OF  THE  BANKS  AND  THE  BORROWER  MUTUALLY,  KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY  WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO JURY  TRIAL  WITH  RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FACILITY  DOCUMENTS.  THIS WAIVER CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT  FOR THE BANKS TO ENTER INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  AND MAKE THE  REVOLVING
CREDIT LOANS HEREUNDER.

            (c) NOTHING IN THIS  SECTION 12.9 SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY BANK
TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER  PERMITTED BY LAW OR AFFECT THE RIGHT
OF ANY BANK TO BRING ANY  ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  AGAINST  THE  BORROWER,  OR ITS
PROPERTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

            (d) TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY
IMMUNITY FROM  JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER FROM
SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION,
EXECUTION  OR  OTHERWISE)  WITH  RESPECT  TO ITSELF OR ITS  PROPERTY,  IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES  SUCH  IMMUNITY  IN  RESPECT OF ITS  OBLIGATIONS  UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES.

            SECTION 11.10 Table of Contents; Headings. Any table of contents and
the headings  and  captions  hereunder  are for  convenience  only and shall not
affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

            SECTION 11.11  Severability.  The  provisions of this  Agreement are
intended to be  severable.  If for any reason any  provision  of this  Agreement
shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any  jurisdiction,
such provision shall, as to such  jurisdiction,  be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity
or enforceability  thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions
hereof in any jurisdiction.

            SECTION 11.12  Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument,  and any party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any
such counterpart.

            SECTION  11.13  Integration.  The Facility  Documents  set forth the
entire   agreement  among  the  parties  hereto  relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated  thereby  and  supersede  any prior oral or written  statements  or
agreements with respect to such transactions.

            SECTION 11.14  Governing Law. This  Agreement  shall be governed by,
and  interpreted  and construed in accordance  with, the law of the State of New
York without giving effect to principles of conflict or choice of laws.

            SECTION 11.15 Relief from Bankruptcy Stay. The Borrower agrees that,
in the event that such Borrower,  any Guarantor or any of the persons or parties
constituting  the  Borrower  or a Guarantor  shall (i) file with any  bankruptcy
court of competent jurisdiction or be the subject of any petition under Title 11
of the U.S.  Code, as amended  ("Bankruptcy  Code"),  (ii) be the subject of any
order for relief issued under the Bankruptcy  Code, (iii) file or be the subject
of  any  petition   seeking  any   reorganization,   arrangement,   composition,

future federal or state act or law relating to bankruptcy,  insolvency, or other
relief for  debtors,  (iv) have  sought or  consented  to or  acquiesced  in the
appointment of any trustee, receiver,  conservator, or liquidator, or (v) be the
subject  of  any  judgment,   or  decree  entered  by  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction approving a petition filed against such readjustment,  liquidation,
dissolution,  or similar relief under any present or future federal or state act
or law relating to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  or relief for  debtors,  the Banks
shall thereupon be entitled and the Borrower  irrevocably  consents to immediate
and  unconditional  relief from  automatic stay by Section 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code,  or  otherwise  available  to the Banks as  provided  for  herein,  in the
Revolving  Credit  Notes,  other  Facility  Documents  delivered  in  connection
herewith and as otherwise  provided by law, and the Borrower hereby  irrevocably
waives any right to object to such relief and will not contest any motion by the
Banks seeking  relief from the automatic  stay -and the Borrower will  cooperate
with the Banks, in any manner requested by the Banks, in their efforts to obtain
relief from any such stay or other prohibition.
