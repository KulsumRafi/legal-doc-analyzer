<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (a)  <u>Retirement</u>.  Beginning March 10 (or such other date as determined by SBC) of the first (1st) calendar year following
the calendar year of the Retirement of a Participant and on March 10 (or such other date as determined by SBC) of each of the
successive 14 calendar years, SBC shall distribute to the Participant that portion of the Participant's Pre-Tax Account that is equal
to the total dollar amount of the Participant's Pre-Tax Account (and/or number of deferred shares then held in the Participant's
Pre-Tax Account) divided by the number of remaining installments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant Retires prior to
2001, then any undistributed portion of the Participant's Pre-Tax Account will be distributed in a lump sum on March 10 of the
fifteenth (15th) calendar year following the calendar year of the Retirement of the Participant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (b) <u>Non-Retirement Termination of Employment</u>.  Beginning March 10 (or such other date as determined by SBC) of the calendar
year following the calendar year of Termination of Employment which is not a Retirement and on March 10 (or such other date as
determined by SBC) of each of the successive 2 calendar years, SBC shall distribute that portion of the Participant's Pre-Tax Account
that is equal to the total dollar amount of the Participant's Pre-Tax Account (and/or number of deferred shares held in the
Participant's Pre-Tax Account) divided by the number of remaining installments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (c) <u>Death</u>.  Notwithstanding (a) or (b) above to the contrary, in the event of the death of a Participant, any amounts
remaining in the Participant's Pre-Tax Account (and/or number of deferred shares then held in the Participant's Pre-Tax Account)
shall be promptly distributed to the Participant's beneficiary designated in accordance with the SBC Rules for Employee Beneficiary
Designations, as the same may be amended from time to time ("Rules").   If no designation has been made or if all designated
beneficiaries predecease the Participant, the Participant's Pre-Tax Account shall be distributed according to the Rules.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan, if a surviving beneficiary of a Plan
participant disclaims in whole or in part, that beneficiary&#146;s interest or
share in the distribution of the Plan participant&#146;s Plan proceeds, and such
disclaimer satisfies the requirements of Section 2518(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code (or any successor provision) and any applicable state law, such disclaimer
shall not constitute an assignment, transfer or alienation by any method of such
interest or share or proceeds and the portion of such proceeds subject to such
disclaimer shall be distributed as if that beneficiary had predeceased the Plan
participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (d) <u>Discharge for Cause/Non Competition</u>.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, all amounts
(including deferred shares) then credited to the Participant's Pre-Tax Account shall be paid immediately in a single payment if a
Participant is discharged for cause by his or her Employer, or if a Participant otherwise ceases to be employed by his or her
Employer and engages in competition with SBC or any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof or with any business with which a
Subsidiary of SBC or an affiliated company has a substantial interest (collectively referred to herein as an "Employer Business"), or
becomes employed by a governmental agency having jurisdiction over the activities of SBC or any of its Subsidiaries.  For purposes
hereof, engaging in competition with any Employer business shall mean engaging by the Participant in any business or activity in the
same geographical market where the same or substantially similar business or activity is being carried on as an Employer business.
Such term shall not include owning a nonsubstantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business that competes with an
Employer business.  However, engaging in competition with an Employer business shall include representing or providing consulting
services to, or being an employee of, any person or entity that is engaged in competition with any Employer business or that takes a
position adverse to any Employer business in a judicial, regulatory, legislative or administrative proceeding.  Further, engaging in
competition with an Employer business would result if the Participant either engages directly in competitive activity or in any
capacity in any location becomes employed by, associated with, or renders service to any company, or parent or affiliate thereof, or
any subsidiary of any of them, if any of them is engaged in competition with an Employer business, regardless of the position or
duties the Participant takes and regardless of whether or not the employing company, or the company that the Participant becomes
associated with or renders service to, is itself engaged in direct competition with an Employer business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

year, plus the additional amounts credited on such deferred amounts pursuant to Section 4.2(b) or 4.2(d), as applicable, shall be
borne by SBC or the applicable Employer which otherwise would have paid the related award currently.  However, the obligation to make
distributions with respect to deferred amounts which are related to amounts credited to a Participant's Pre-Tax Account as of the
effective date of the Plan pursuant to Section 4.2(c), and with respect to which no SBC company would otherwise have paid the related
award currently, shall be borne by the Employer which employed the Participant on the effective date of the Plan.</FONT></P>

the immediately following calendar year. This distribution shall be in addition to the portion of the Pre-Tax Account to be
distributed at the same time under Section 5.1, which distribution shall be calculated without regard to an election under this
section.   No distribution under this Section 5.2(a) shall be made of amounts contributed to or earned under this Plan in the same

following such determination, that portion of Participant&#146;s Pre-Tax Account
determined by SBC in its sole discretion to meet the emergency (the
&#147;Emergency Distribution. For purposes of this Plan, an unforeseeable
financial emergency is an unexpected need for cash arising from an illness,
casualty loss, sudden financial reversal, or other such unforeseeable
occurrence. Cash needs arising from foreseeable events such as the purchase of a
house or education expenses for children shall not be considered to be the
result of an unforeseeable financial emergency. Upon such distribution, any
election to make Employee Contributions by such Participant shall be immediately
cancelled, and the Participant shall not be permitted to make a new election

amounts then credited to a Participant&#146;s Pre-Tax Account. Any such consent
may be in a writing, telecopy, or e-mail or in another electronic format. An
election to make Employee Contributions and the failure to terminate an election
to make Employee Contributions when able to do so shall each be conclusively
deemed to be the consent of the Participant to any and all amendments to the

consent shall be a condition to making any election with respect to Employee

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants
and their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or
equitable rights, interest, or claims in any property or assets of any Employer.
No assets of any Employer shall be held under any trust for the benefit of
Participants, their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, or assigns, or held in any
way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of any Employer
under this Plan. Any and all of each Employer&#146;s assets shall be, and
remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of such Employer. The only
obligation of an Employer under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and
unsecured promise of SBC to make distributions under, and in accordance with the
terms of, the Plan. </FONT></P>

a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell,
assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer,
hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt, any amounts (or shares)
distributable under the Plan, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to
which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part
of the amount (or shares) distributable shall, prior to actual distribution, be
subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments,
alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor
be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant&#146;s or any
other person&#146;s bankruptcy or insolvency. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not withstanding the
foregoing, in the event a Participant becomes employed by Cingular Wireless LLC
(&#147;Cingular&#148;) or an entity directly or indirectly owned by Cingular and
elects or has elected to have his or her interest in this Plan transferred to
the Cingular Wireless Cash Deferral Plan, the Participant shall have no further
interest in the transferred amounts under this Plan and shall look solely to
Cingular for any rights previously held under this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing
contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a
contract of employment or as giving any employee any right to be retained in the
employ of an Employer or to serve as a director. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.8 Errors.</FONT></H2>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.9      Captions.</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Law.</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all awards and agreements
hereunder, and any and all disputes in connection therewith, shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Texas,
without regard to conflict or choice of law principles which might otherwise
refer the construction, interpretation or enforceability of this Plan to the
substantive law of another jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
awards under the Plan are granted in Texas, records relating to the Plan and
awards thereunder are located in Texas, and the Plan and awards thereunder are
administered in Texas, the Company and the Participant to whom an award under
this Plan is granted, for themselves and their successors and assigns,
irrevocably submit to the exclusive and sole jurisdiction and venue of the state
or federal courts of Texas with respect to any and all disputes arising out of
or relating to this Plan, the subject matter of this Plan or any awards under
this Plan, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or relating
to the interpretation and enforceability of any awards or the terms and
conditions of this Plan. To achieve certainty regarding the appropriate forum in
which to prosecute and defend actions arising out of or relating to this Plan,
and to ensure consistency in application and interpretation of the Governing Law
to the Plan, the parties agree that (a) sole and exclusive appropriate venue for
any such action shall be an appropriate federal or state court in Bexar County,
Texas, and no other, (b) all claims with respect to any such action shall be
heard and determined exclusively in such Texas court, and no other, (c) such
Texas court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of any dispute relating hereto and (d) that
the parties waive any and all objections and defenses to bringing any such
action before such Texas court, including but not limited to those relating to
lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or <I>forum non conveniens</I>. </FONT></P>

the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable,
the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other
provision of this Plan. </FONT></P>
