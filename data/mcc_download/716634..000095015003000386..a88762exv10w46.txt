                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                      AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FEE OPTION

      The Agreement originally made on the 28th day of July, 2000, by and
between Sutton Hill Capital, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company,
having an office at 120 North Robertson Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90048
("Option Holder"), and Citadel Realty, Inc., a Nevada corporation, having an
office at 550 South Hope Street, Suite 1825, Los Angeles, CA 90071 ("Optionee")
(as amended, modified and supplemented from time to time, the "Agreement") is
hereby amended and restated as of this 29th day of January, 2002.

                                    WHEREAS:

      (A) Option Holder has entered into a certain Lease Agreement ("Lease
Agreement"), dated as of July 28, 2000, with Citadel Cinemas, Inc., as tenant
(the "Tenant"), pursuant to which the Tenant has leased from the Option Holder
certain Theatre Properties, including the Sutton Theatre and Murray Hill Theatre
as amended and restated as of January 29, 2002;

      (B) Option Holder holds an option ("Fee Option") to purchase the land
described on Exhibit "A", being the land underlying the Sutton Theatre (the
"Underlying Fee");

      (C) Pursuant to the provisions of the Lease Agreement, the Tenant has a
Purchase Option to acquire the Purchased Assets;

      (D) Option Holder has agreed that, if the Tenant exercises the Purchase
Option pursuant to the Lease Agreement and closes thereunder in accordance with
the terms thereof and if Optionee complies with the terms hereof, Optionee shall
have an option to purchase the Underlying Fee in connection with and at the time
of the closing of the Purchase Option pursuant to the Lease Agreement; and

      (E) Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 8 hereof.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

      1. Purchase Option; Fee Price. Subject to the satisfaction of the
Conditions Precedent (as defined in Section 4 hereof), Optionee shall have the
option ("Optionee Fee Option") to acquire the Underlying Fee by funding the
Purchase Price of the Fee Option.


                                       1

      2. Procedure for Exercise of Purchase Option. (a) To exercise the Optionee
Fee Option, Optionee shall give written notice ("Notice") to Option Holder by
January 5, 2010 but no earlier than the date on which the Tenant gives notice to
the Option Holder pursuant to the Lease Agreement of the exercise by Tenant of
the Purchase Option thereunder.

      (b) Upon the receipt by Option Holder of the Notice, Option Holder shall
provide notice to the owner of the Underlying Fee of the exercise by Option
Holder of the Fee Option.

      3. Closing. (a) The closing of the acquisition of the Underlying Fee shall
occur simultaneously with the closing on the Purchased Assets pursuant to the
Purchase Option (the "Closing"). At the Closing, Option Holder shall direct the
transferor of the Underlying Fee to deliver title thereto directly to Optionee;
provided, however, at the election of Optionee, exercised by written notice to
Option Holder given not less than 5 days prior to the anticipated date of the
Closing, Option Holder shall direct the transferor of the Underlying Fee to
deliver title to the Underlying Fee as the Optionee shall direct in such notice.

      (b) At the Closing, title to the Underlying Fee will be transferred in
accordance with the Fee Option. The transfer of the Underlying Fee shall be on
an as-is, non-installment sale basis, without warranty by, or recourse to, the
Option Holder, except that such title shall be free of any Liens resulting from
the Option Holder's act or omission; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall obligate the Option Holder to cause any such Lien to be removed or cured
if arising from a Tenant Event.

      (c) The Optionee shall pay the Purchase Price of the Fee Option at the
Closing by wire transfer or certified funds, as the Option Holder shall
determine in its sole discretion by notice to Optionee no less than two days
prior to the anticipated date of the Closing.

      4. Conditions Precedents to Optionee's Rights. (A) OPTIONEE RECOGNIZES,
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, SUBJECT TO PARAGRAPH 4(B), IF THE FOLLOWING TWO
CONDITIONS ARE NOT STRICTLY ADHERED TO TIMELY (THE "CONDITIONS PRECEDENT"),
OPTIONEE SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE UNDERLYING FEE IF THE TENANT UNDER
THE LEASE AGREEMENT: (1) DOES NOT EXERCISE ITS PURCHASE OPTION THEREUNDER OR
DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE THE PURCHASE OPTION BY REASON OF THE
OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT UNDER SECTION 18(F) OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT OR (2)
EXERCISES ITS PURCHASE OPTION, AND IS NOT IN DEFAULT UNDER SECTION 18(F) OF THE
LEASE AGREEMENT BUT FAILS TO SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS TO CLOSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT.

      (b) If, at any time during the Term of the Lease Agreement an Affiliate of
the Optionee shall succeed to the interest of the Option Holder under the Lease
Agreement, then the Conditions Precedent shall be deemed of no further force and
effect.


                                       2

      5. Relationship of Optionee to Tenant. Optionee recognizes and
acknowledges that, while it is now an Affiliate of the Tenant, there is no
assurance or requirement that it will in fact be an Affiliate of the Tenant at
the time the Optionee Fee Option is exercised and, even if it is then not an
Affiliate of the Tenant, Optionee does not have an independent right to exercise
the Optionee Fee Option unless and until, as described in paragraph 4(a) hereof
(but subject to paragraph 4(b) hereof), the Tenant (whether or not then an
Affiliate of Optionee) duly and properly exercises the Purchase Option and, as
aforesaid, consummates the transaction and closes.

      6. SS 1031 "Like-Kind" Exchange. Option Holder hereby notifies Optionee
that, if Optionee exercises the Optionee Fee Option in accordance with this
Agreement, the Underlying Fee may be sold pursuant to the like kind exchange
provisions of the Code. Optionee agrees to execute at the Closing all reasonable
and customary documents necessary to accomplish the sale under the like kind
exchange rules as prepared by Option Holder's attorney, provided, however, that
Optionee shall not be required to execute any document that would or might
require Optionee to incur any cost or expense; require Optionee to take title to
any property other than the Underlying Fee (except for the Purchased Assets); or
require Optionee to incur any liability, whether current, accrued or contingent.
Option Holder shall be responsible for all costs of such documentation and
guarantees that no terms or conditions in this Agreement shall change due to the
execution of the like kind exchange documents, nor shall Closing be delayed
thereby. As aforesaid, Optionee will not be required to purchase any property
(other than the Underlying Fee and Purchased Assets), but may be required to pay
the Purchase Price (or some portion thereof, as the Option Holder may direct
prior to the Closing) into an escrow fund established for the purpose of the
like kind exchange. Option Holder shall defend, indemnify and save Optionee
harmless from any loss, expense, claims or damages in connection with Optionee
executing any such documents. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive
Closing.

      7. Notice. Any notices, consents, or other communications between Option
Holder and Optionee may be oral or in writing, so long as the Option Holder
remains Sutton Hill Capital, L.L.C. or an Affiliate thereof and the Optionee
remains an Affiliate or a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Reading
International, Inc.; provided, however, that, if this Agreement specifically
provides that a notice, consent or communication must be in writing, then such
provision controls. Subject to the preceding sentence, all notices, offers,
acceptances, approvals, waivers, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder or under any other instrument, certificate or other document delivered
in connection with the transactions described herein shall be in writing, shall
be addressed as provided below and shall be considered as properly given (a) if
delivered in person, (b) if sent by express courier service (including, without
limitation, Federal Express, Emery, DHL, Airborne Express, and other similar
express delivery services), (c) in the event overnight delivery services are not
readily available, if mailed by United States Postal Service, postage prepaid,
registered or certified with return receipt requested, or (d) if sent by
telecopy and confirmed; provided, that in the case of a notice by telecopy, the
sender shall in addition confirm such notice by writing sent in the manner
specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7. All notices shall be
effective upon receipt by the addressee; provided, however, that if any notice
is tendered to an addressee and the delivery thereof is refused by such
addressee, such notice shall be effective upon such tender. For the purposes of

TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS COMPLAINT
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING AND/OR HEARING BROUGHT BY EITHER THE OPTION HOLDER
AGAINST THE OPTIONEE OR THE OPTIONEE AGAINST THE OPTION HOLDER ON ANY MATTER
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE OPTION HOLDER AND THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY CLAIM OF INJURY OR

HAVE BEEN BARGAINED FOR AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL IN
CONNECTION THEREWITH.

      (g) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

      (h) One or more waivers of any covenant or condition by the Option Holder
shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same covenant
or condition. The giving by the Option Holder of any consent or approval

for the same or a dissimilar event. Each and every covenant contained herein
shall be deemed separate and independent and not dependent upon other provisions
of this Lease.

      (i) This Agreement has been prepared by the Option Holder and its
professional advisors and reviewed by the Optionee and its professional
advisors. The Option Holder, the Optionee and their separate advisors believe
that this Agreement is the product of all of their efforts, that it expresses
their agreement, and that it should not be interpreted in favor of either the
Option Holder or the Optionee or against the Option Holder or the Optionee
merely because of their efforts in preparing it.

      (j) This Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns but the foregoing shall not affect, alter or
limit the provisions of Section 5 hereof.

      (k) This Agreement shall expire and become unenforceable against Option
Holder if the Optionee Fee Option is not exercised on or before the earlier to
occur of (i) February 1, 2010 (subject to extension if the Optionee is precluded
from exercising by reason of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding affecting
Option Holder and in such event is extended until the time when such exercise is
not longer so precluded and for five days thereafter) or (ii) the termination of
the Lease Agreement.

      (l) Except to the extent of and under the circumstances specifically
provided for in Section 5 of the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnity Guarantee,
no recourse hereunder or any other amount due under this Agreement, or for any
claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof or hereof, shall be had
against any direct or indirect partner or owner of the Option Holder or any
incorporator, partner, shareholder, officer, member, Affiliate or director, as
such, past, present or future, of any such direct or indirect partner. Nothing
contained in this paragraph (l) shall be construed to limit the exercise or
enforcement, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other
documents referred to herein, of rights and remedies against the assets of the
limited liability company, or any other Person expressly undertaking in writing
obligations in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
