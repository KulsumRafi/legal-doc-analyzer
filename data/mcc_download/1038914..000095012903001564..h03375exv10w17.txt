      before the due date for payment. All payments shall be made without any

8     PROTECTION OF LESSEE'S INTERESTS

8.1   RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LESSOR. It is agreed that as between the Lessor and
      the Lessee, the Lessor:

(a)   has been solely responsible for selecting the Rig, relying on its own
      skill and judgment; and

(b)   will be solely responsible for maintaining and insuring the Rig.

      The Lessor acknowledges that the Lessee was not involved in the selection,
      installation or specification of the Rig and will not be involved in the
      operation or any future installation of the Rig.

8.2   TITLE TO THE RIG. The Lessor covenants that it will continue (subject to
      Permitted Encumbrances and subject to any transfer in compliance with
      Clause 16.2 (Assignment by Lessor)) throughout the Lease Period to have
      such title, rights and interests in and to the Rig as would entitle it to
      sell or otherwise dispose of the Rig with full title guarantee.

8.3   NO AUTHORITY TO CREATE ENCUMBRANCES. The Lessor will not and will procure
      that each of the Charterer and any other Operator will not:

(a)   pledge the credit of the Lessee or any member of the Lessee Group for the
      repair of the Rig or otherwise;

(b)   create, purport to create or, subject to Clause 8.4 (Arrest and

      to the Rig (other than Permitted Encumbrances);

(c)   sell, attempt to sell or, otherwise dispose of, the Rig or any interest
      therein, or purport so to do without the previous written consent of the
      Lessee or unless the requirements of Clause 16.2 (Assignment by Lessor)
      are satisfied; or

(d)   part with possession of the Rig other than in accordance with the
      Sub-Lease or any other sub-lease or sub-charter permitted by the Sub-Lease
      and except as may be required for repair and maintenance.

8.4   ARREST AND DETENTION.  If the Rig is at any time during the Lease Period:

(a)   arrested, seized, taken into custody or otherwise detained by any person
      or by any court or other tribunal or by any Governmental Entity (other
      than by a Compulsory Acquisition or any requisition for hire or by reason
      of a Lessee's Encumbrance); or

(b)   subjected to distress or other legal proceedings by reason of any process,
      claim, the exercise of any rights conferred by an Encumbrance or by any
      other action whatsoever (other than by reason of a Lessee's Encumbrance),

      the Lessor shall procure the release of the Rig from such arrest, seizure
      or detention within twenty-one (21) days of receiving notice thereof by
      providing bail or otherwise as the circumstances may require. The Lessor
      acknowledges and accepts that the Lessee shall, unless and until a
      Termination Event shall have occurred which is continuing, have the sole
      right to contest any litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings
      in respect


                                       14
<PAGE>

      of the foregoing subject to and in accordance with clause 14.4 (Defence of
      claims) of the Sub-Lease, mutatis mutandis.

8.5   EXCLUDED REPRESENTATIONS. It is agreed that no term, condition, warranty
      or representation of any kind whatsoever (express or implied) is or has
      been given by or on behalf of the Lessee in respect of the Rig (or any
      part thereof). All terms, conditions, warranties and representations
      (express or implied and whether statutory, collateral hereto or otherwise)
      relating to the Rig, its specification, age, quality, description,
      seaworthiness, satisfactory quality or as to its fitness for any purpose
      are hereby expressly excluded.

8.6   LESSEE'S ENCUMBRANCES. The Lessee will not create, purport to create or,
      subject to Clause 8.7 (Arrest following a Lessee's Encumbrance), permit to
      subsist any Lessee's Encumbrance on, or over or with respect, to the Rig.

8.7   ARREST FOLLOWING A LESSEE'S ENCUMBRANCE. If the Rig is at any time during
      the Lease Period:

(a)   arrested, seized, taken into custody or otherwise detained by any person
      or by any court or other tribunal or by any Governmental Entity by reason
      of a Lessee's Encumbrance; or

(b)   subjected to distress or other legal proceedings by reason of any process,
      claim or the exercise of any rights conferred by a Lessee's Encumbrance,

      the Lessee shall procure the release of the Rig from such arrest, seizure
      or detention within twenty-one (21) days of receiving notice thereof by
      providing bail or otherwise as the circumstances may require.

9     LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

9.1   NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS. The Lessee shall not be liable (in contract, tort
      or otherwise) for any claim, damage, liability or loss (including
      consequential loss) or expense of any kind arising directly or indirectly
      in connection with the Rig (or any part thereof) or from any defect or
      deficiency in, or inadequacy or unsuitability of, the Rig (or any part
      thereof) or its use, performance, operation, maintenance, overhaul or
      repair provided that nothing contained herein shall exclude any liability
      of the Lessee except:

(a)   in respect of any claim, damage, liability or loss arising solely as a
      result of the wilful misconduct or negligence of the Lessee; or

(b)   for death or personal injury caused by the Lessee's negligence to the
      extent that such exclusion is prohibited by statute.

9.2   LIMITATION ON OPERATIONAL LIABILITY. The Lessor acknowledges that the
      Lessee shall itself have no liability to the Lessor whatsoever under this
      Lease in respect of:

(a)   the operation, maintenance and insurance of, or any other matter or thing
      in relation to, the Rig;

(b)   any failure by the Sub-Lessee to comply with the requirements of the
      Sub-Lease as regards operation, maintenance and insurance of the Rig or
      otherwise;

9.3   NO OBLIGATION TO REPLACE. The Lessee shall have no obligation to supply to
      the Lessor any replacement for the Rig if the Rig is, either on delivery
      or thereafter, defective, lost, damaged, unusable or unavailable for any
      reason.

9.4   DUE CONSIDERATION. The Lessor acknowledges that Clauses 9.1 (No liability
      for loss), 9.2 (Limitation on operational liability) and 9.3 (No
      obligation to replace) (the "IDENTIFIED CLAUSES") have been the subject of
      full and free discussion and negotiation between the


                                       15
<PAGE>

      parties, the Lessor fully understands the provisions of the Identified
      Clauses and the implications thereof and the Premium and Rental and other
      amounts payable under this Lease have been calculated in the light of such
      discussion and negotiation and taking in to full account the terms of the
      Identified Clauses. The Lessor further acknowledges and accepts that the
      provisions of the Identified Clauses are fair and reasonable to be
      included in this Lease having regard to the terms and conditions of this
      Lease generally, the transactions contemplated by the Lease Documents as a
      whole and the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been
      in the contemplation of the Lessee and the Lessor at the time this Lease
      was entered into.

10    TERMINATION

10.1  TERMINATION. Where the Sub-Lease Period is to terminate in accordance with
      the provision of the Sub-Lease on the Leasing Termination Date by reason
      of the service of a Termination Notice or a Voluntary Termination Notice
      the Lessor and the Lessee agree that they shall each offer for sale their
      respective interests in the Rig in accordance with Clause 13 (Sale of the
      Rig).

10.2  NO LESSEE PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION. Save only and to the extent that the
      Lessee is obliged to account to the Lessor or the Sub-Lessee for any
      amounts out of Net Sales Proceeds on the applications of such sum in
      accordance with the provisions of the Lease Documents, no payment shall be
      required to be made by the Lessee to the Lessor on any termination of the
      Lease Period. The leasing of the Rig and the Lease Period shall each
      continue until the Leasing Termination Date, whereupon they shall
      terminate.

11    EVENT OF LOSS

      The Lease period shall terminate automatically following the occurrence of
      a Total Loss in respect of the Rig, such termination to occur at the same
      time as termination of the Sub-Lease Period in accordance with the terms
      of the Sub-Lease.

12    RETURN OF THE RIG

      On expiry or termination of the Lease Period (other than by reason of a
      Total Loss) the Lessee shall be deemed to have redelivered the Rig to the
      Lessor and the Lessor shall be deemed to have accepted such redelivery
      without further action on the part of either party by virtue of redelivery
      of the Rig by the Sub-Lessee to the Lessor at the direction of the Lessee
      in accordance with Clause 12.1 of the Sub-Lease. Such deemed redelivery
      will be in "as is, where is" condition and the Lessee shall have no
      obligation to take any step or incur any expense without being indemnified
      by the Lessor to its satisfaction in advance of taking such steps or
      incurring such expense.

13    SALE OF THE RIG

13.1  SALE.  In circumstances referred to in Clause 10.1 (Termination):

(a)   the Lessor and the Lessee shall each offer for sale their respective
      interests in the Rig with the intent that such sale shall be completed by
      the Lessor and the Lessee as soon as reasonably practicable after such
      termination; and

(b)   the Lessor shall be entitled to act as agent for sale of the Lessee for
      the purposes of disposing of the Lessee's Interest on the following basis
      (unless otherwise agreed by the Lessee):

      (i)   either the Lessee has received all amounts then due and payable
            under the Sub-Lease or the Lessee is satisfied that following the
            sale of the Rig it will receive such amounts;


                                       16
<PAGE>

      (ii)  that the interest of the Lessor and the Lessee's Interest in the Rig
            shall be sold to the same person;

      (iii) that the price at which the Lessee's Interest in the Rig is sold
            shall be subject to the approval of the Lessee, such approval not to
            be unreasonably withheld or delayed and not to be withheld if such
            price is supported by a valuation of the Rig obtained from an
            independent valuer selected by the Lessor;

      (iv)  that the Lessee shall not be required to give any warranty to any
            purchaser of the Lessee's Interest save that such interest is free
            of Lessee's Encumbrances;

      (v)   the Lessor shall be entitled, subject to the foregoing, to select
            the means, timing and terms of the disposal of the Rig and the
            Lessee's Interest and in particular whether to sell by public
            auction or tender or by private treaty;

      (vi)  all Net Sale Proceeds shall be paid to the Lessor for application by
            it in accordance with this Lease and the other Lease Documents.

13.2  LESSEE'S INTEREST. The sale of the Rig shall take place subject to this
      Lease and the Lessee's Interest but on the basis that the leasing of the
      Rig under this Lease shall terminate in accordance with Clause 10.2
      (Termination) on the Leasing Termination Date. The Lessee's entitlement to
      a portion of the Net Sale Proceeds in accordance with Clause 14.2
      (Application of Net Sale Proceeds) is to compensate the Lessee for
      agreeing to the sale of the Rig and the termination of its right to take
      the Rig on lease under this Lease on the Leasing Termination Date.

14    NET SALE PROCEEDS

14.1  CURRENCY OF SALE OF RIG. If the Rig is sold in a currency other than
      Dollars the Sales Proceeds shall be the amount of Dollars which the Lessor
      is able to purchase with the foreign currency which it receives in respect
      of such foreign currency when it receives it or as soon thereafter as
      foreign exchange transactions are able to be made in the City of London.

14.2  APPLICATION OF "NET SALE PROCEEDS". The Lessor and the Lessee agree that
      any Net Sale Proceeds will be applied as follows:

(a)   first an amount equal to the aggregate of the Termination Sum payable
      under the Sub-Lease and any other amounts due and payable to the Lessee
      under clause 13.6 (Payments on Termination) of the Sub-Lease shall be paid
      to the Lessee and applied in or towards settlement of such amount (the
      "TOTAL TERMINATION SUM");

(b)   secondly, where there is any balance of Net Sale Proceeds after the
      application referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above, an amount equal to:

      (i)   the Net Sale Proceeds less the Total Termination Sum; multiplied by:

      (ii)  the fraction a/b,

            where "a" is the length of the unexpired residue of the Lease Period
            at the time of the termination of the leasing of the Rig under the
            Sub-Lease (expressed in days); and "b" is the Lease Period
            (expressed in days),

            shall be paid to the Lessee and applied by the Lessee in accordance
            with clause 12.3 (Sub-Lessor's Disposal Proceeds) of the Sub-Lease;
            and

(c)   thirdly, the balance (if any) shall be paid to the Lessor.
