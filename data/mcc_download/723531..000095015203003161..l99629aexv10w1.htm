<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>INDEMNITY AGREEMENT</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Indemnification Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is made as of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, by and between PAYCHEX, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;Company&#148;), and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#147;Indemnitee&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="center"><FONT size="2">RECITALS
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as directors or in other capacities unless they are
provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification
against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of
their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense,
liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries
from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States based corporations and
other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market
conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors,
officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises
are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation
relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been
brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself. The Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company requires indemnification of the officers and
directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#147;DGCL&#148;). The Certificate of
Incorporation and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification
provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that
contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the board of
directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to
indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in
attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company&#146;s stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the
future.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnity, and to advance expenses on
behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so
that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern
that they will not be so indemnified.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and any resolutions adopted
pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefore, nor to
diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the
Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation and insurance as adequate in the present
circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director
without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in
such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take
on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he
be so indemnified;

contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term &#147;Independent Counsel&#148; shall not include

is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding,
other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment

against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with such
Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good
faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to

indemnification.

extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful,
on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue
or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is
successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all
claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or
matter. If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding, the
Company also shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with a claim, issue or matter related to any claim,
issue, or matter on which the Indemnitee was successful. For purposes of this
Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter

Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its
favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
Proceeding. No indemnity shall be made under this Section&nbsp;7(a) on account of
Indemnitee&#146;s conduct which constitutes a breach of Indemnitee&#146;s duty of loyalty
to the Company or its stockholders or is an act or omission not in good faith
or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding)
initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or
any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its
directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i)&nbsp;the Board of
Directors of the Company authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii)&nbsp;the Company provides the
indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
Company under applicable law.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Advances of Expenses</B>. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 20&nbsp;days after the receipt
by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time
to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding.
Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without
regard to Indemnitee&#146;s ability to repay the expenses and without regard to
Indemnitee&#146;s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions
of this Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses
incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including
Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support
the advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances solely upon the
execution and delivery to the Company of an undertaking providing that the

under Section&nbsp;9 hereof to pay the expenses of any Proceeding against
Indemnitee, the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written
notice of its election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of
such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company,
the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Indemnitee shall, as a condition precedent to his right to be
indemnified under this Agreement, give the Company notice in writing as soon as
practicable of any claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will
or could be sought under this Agreement, provided however, that a delay in
giving such notice shall not deprive Indemnitee of any right to be indemnified
under this Agreement unless, and then only to the extent that, such delay is
materially prejudicial to the defense of such claim. The omission to notify the
Company will not relieve the Company from any liability for indemnification
which it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The
Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for
indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested
indemnification.

the first sentence of Section&nbsp;11(a), a determination, if required by applicable
law, with respect to Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement thereto shall be made in the
specific case: (i)&nbsp;if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent
Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall
be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii)&nbsp;if a Change in Control shall not have
occurred, (A)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though

Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be
delivered to Indemnitee or (D)&nbsp;if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders
of the Company, and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10)&nbsp;days after
such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or
entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to
indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon
reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not
privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably
available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any
costs or expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements) incurred by
Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such
determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination
as to Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby
indemnifies and agrees to hold lndemnitee harmless therefrom.

to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section&nbsp;12(a) hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section&nbsp;12(b). If a
Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the Board of Directors, and the Company shall give written notice
to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so
selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel
shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such
selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the preceding
sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company
advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either
event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10&nbsp;days after
such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company
or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection;
<I>provided, however</I>, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that
the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of
&#147;Independent Counsel&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;2 of this Agreement, and the
objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such
assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall
act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and
substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent
Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined
that such objection is without merit. If, within 20&nbsp;days after submission by
Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;11(a)
hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to,
either the Company or lndemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction
for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or
Indemnitee to the other&#146;s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the
appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such
other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom
all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as
Independent Counsel under Section&nbsp;12(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of

in accordance with Section&nbsp;11(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have
the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making
by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that
presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is
proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard
of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its
directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been
made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i)&nbsp;a
misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material
fact necessary to make Indemnitee&#146;s statement not materially misleading, in
connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii)&nbsp;a prohibition of such
indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day
period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional
thirty (30)&nbsp;days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination
with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such
additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or
information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing
provisions of this Section&nbsp;13(b) shall not apply (i)&nbsp;if the determination of
