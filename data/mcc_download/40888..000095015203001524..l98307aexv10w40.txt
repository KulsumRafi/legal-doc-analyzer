Item No. 4 - Fees

     Consultant's Fees shall be paid as follows:

     In recognition of Consultant's commitment to be available and to perform
     services under this Agreement, Consultant shall be paid minimum Fees of
     $177,000 to be disbursed in the following manner:

     Term Period One: Consultant shall be paid a retainer of $105,000 for Term
     Period One. The full Term Period One Retainer Fee of $105,000 shall be
     paid on September 30, 2002 (based on a rate of $35,000 per month), to
     ensure availability of Consultant to render Services as directed on an
     exclusive, full-time basis on GenCorp business days for the full duration
     of Term Period One. The Term Period One Retainer Fee shall be
     non-refundable regardless of the number of days actually worked by
     Consultant during Term Period One or in the event of the death or
     disability of Consultant during Term Period One. A proportionate share of
     the Period One Retainer Fee shall be refunded by Consultant if this
     Agreement is cancelled by GenCorp pursuant to paragraph 7.B. of this
     Agreement for breach by Consultant.

     Term Period Two:  Consultant shall be paid a Term Period Two Monthly
     Retainer Fee of $6,000 per month for twelve months (aggregate of $72,000)
     to ensure Consultant's non-exclusive availability to render Services as
     directed for up to twenty-four full days (in full or one-half day
     increments) during Term Period Two at a rate of $3,000 per full day of
     Services (all time worked in a single day in which four or more hours are
     worked) and a rate of $1500 per half day of Services (time worked up to
     four hours in a single day). The Term Period Two Monthly Retainer Fee shall
     be paid to Consultant at the rate of two days Fees ($6,000) on the first
     day of each calendar month beginning on January 1, 2003 and ending with the
     payment made on December 1, 2003. The payment of each Term Period Two
     Monthly Retainer Fee shall cover up to two full days of Consulting Services
     during the month in which it is paid. In the event Consultant performs more
     than two days of Services in any month, those Services in excess of two
     days shall be promptly invoiced by Consultant to GenCorp, in accordance
     with paragraph 4.C. of this Agreement, as Additional Fees in full day and
     half day increments at the rates specified in this paragraph. All
     Additional Fees paid by GenCorp shall reduce GenCorp's obligation for
     payment of the Term Period Two Monthly Retainer Fee on a one for one basis
     beginning with the payment due on December 1, 2003 and working backward.
     (For example, if four days of Services are performed in January 2003,
     Consultant will be paid for the four days using the January Term Period Two
     Monthly Retainer Fee (two days) and two days of Additional Fees. Use of the
     two days of Additional Fees will cancel GenCorp's obligation to make the
     Term Period Two Monthly Retainer Fee payment that would have otherwise been
     due on December 1, 2003. Had five days of Services been performed in
     January 2003, Consultant would have been paid three days of Additional Fees
     and GenCorp would be obligated to pay a Term Period Two Monthly Retainer
     Fee of only $3,000 for November 2003 and no Fee for December 2003, etc.)
     The Term Period Two Monthly Retainer Fee payments shall be non-refundable
     regardless of the actual number of days worked by Consultant or in the
     event of the death or disability of Consultant during Term Period Two. In
     the event this Agreement is cancelled by GenCorp pursuant to paragraph 7.B.
     of this Agreement for breach by Consultant, no further payments of the
     remaining Term Period Two Monthly Retainer Fees shall be due hereunder.

Item No. 4 - Fees

Consultant's Fees shall be paid as follows:

In recognition of Consultant's commitment to be available and to perform
services under this Agreement, Consultant shall be paid minimum Fees of $259,000
to be disbursed in the following manner:

Term Period One: Retainer Fee of $105,000 has been paid for consulting services
finally accepted by GenCorp.

Term Period Two A: Consultant shall be paid a retainer of $100,000 for Term
Period Two A. The full Term Period Two A Retainer Fee of $100,000 shall be paid
on or before January 10, 2003 (based on a rate of $40,000 per month), to ensure
availability of Consultant to render Services as directed on an exclusive,
full-time basis on GenCorp business days for the full duration of Term Period
Two A. The Term Period Two A Retainer Fee shall be non-refundable regardless of
the number of days actually worked by Consultant during Term Period Two A or in
the event of the death or disability of Consultant during Term Period Two A. A
proportionate share of the Term Period Two A Retainer Fee shall be refunded by
Consultant if this Agreement is cancelled by GenCorp pursuant to paragraph 7.B.
of this Agreement for breach by Consultant.

Term Period Two B: Consultant shall be paid a Term Period Two B Monthly Retainer
Fee of $6,000 per month for nine months (aggregate of $54,000) to ensure
Consultant's non-exclusive availability to render Services as directed for up to
eighteen full days (in full or one-half day increments) during Term Period Two B
at a rate of $3,000 per full day of Services (all time worked in a single day in
which four or more hours are worked) and a rate of $1500 per half day of
Services ( time worked up to four hours in a single day). The Period Two B
Monthly Retainer Fee shall be paid to Consultant at the rate of two days Fees
($6,000) on the first day of each calendar month beginning on April 1, 2003 and
ending with the payment made on December 1, 2003. The payment of each Term Two B
Monthly Retainer Fee shall cover up to two full days of Consulting Services
during the month in which it is paid. In the event Consultant performs more than
two days of Services in any month, those Services in excess of two days shall be
promptly invoiced by Consultant to GenCorp, in accordance with paragraph 4.C. of
this Agreement, as Additional Fees in full day and half day increments at the
rates specified in this paragraph. All Additional Fees paid by GenCorp shall
reduce Consultant's obligation to work during Term Period Two B and GenCorp's
obligation for payment of the Term Period Two B Monthly Retainer Fee on a one
for one basis beginning with the payment due on December l, 2003 and working
backward. (For example, if four days of Services are performed in April 2003,
Consultant will be paid for the four days using the April Term Period Two B
Monthly Retainer Fee [two days] and two days of Additional Fees. Use of the two
days of Additional Fees will cancel GenCorp's obligation to make the Term Period
Two B Monthly Retainer Fee payment that would have otherwise been due on
December 1, 2003, and Consultant's obligation to work two days during December
2003 will likewise be cancelled. Had five days of Services been performed in
April 2003, Consultant would have been paid three days of Additional Fees and
GenCorp would be obligated to pay a Term Period Two B Monthly Retainer Fee of
only $3,000 for November 2003 and no Fee for December 2003, etc. Consultant
would be obligated to work only one day in November 2003 and none in December
2003, etc.) The Term Period Two B Monthly Retainer Fee payments shall be
non-refundable regardless of the actual number of days worked by Consultant or
in the event of the death or disability of Consultant during Term Period Two B.
In the event this Agreement is cancelled by GenCorp pursuant to paragraph 7.B.
of this Agreement for breach by Consultant, no further payments of the remaining
Term Period Two B Monthly Retainer Fee shall be due hereunder.
