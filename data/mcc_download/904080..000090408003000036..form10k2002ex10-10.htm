</ol>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->

shall be vested in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Compensation Committee, and

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On an annual basis, the Compensation
Committee shall determine those employees of the Company who will participate in the Plan
for a particular Plan Year. Participants who terminate due to death, disability or
retirement on or after attaining age 65 may have their Award for the Plan Year determined
on a pro-rata basis by the Compensation Committee after considering Management&#146;s
recommendations. All other participants who terminate (either voluntarily or
involuntarily) during the applicable Plan Year shall not be entitled to an Award for that
Plan Year. Participants who terminate after the end of the Plan Year but before Award
payments are determined or paid may be entitled to an Award if the Compensation Committee,
after considering Management&#146;s recommendations, determines that they or any of them
are entitled to an Award in its sole and absolute discretion. </FONT></P>

shall review and modify, if necessary, companies to include in the group of companies used
to calculate the index group shareholder return percentage to which the Company&#146;s
Shareholder Return Percentage will be compared. It is the intention of the Board that
companies included in this group should be similar to the Company and compete with the
Company for capital. Companies may be excluded at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee based on unusual/nonrecurring events that occur during the Plan Year that could
materially distort the index group shareholder return percentage (e.g., takeover,
bankruptcy, etc.). The initial index group shall be the Company&#146;s peer group as
determined by the Board. </FONT></P>

the maximum aggregate amount awarded to the employees of the Company in any Plan Year, not
to exceed the aggregate base salaries of the employees of the Company in a particular Plan
Year. The amount actually awarded in a Plan Year (the Actual Awarded Amount) can be less
than the Annual Incentive Pool for that Plan Year. No incentive awards will be paid
pursuant to this Plan if, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, the
financial health of the Company does not warrant such awards regardless whether the
formulas used to determine performance are positive. Allocated amounts that are not
awarded shall not be awarded at any other time under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Compensation Committee shall set
and approve the individual awards under the Plan for the Chairman, the CEO and the CFO by
separate resolution. The Compensation Committee may rely on the recommendations of the CEO
and the CFO in setting and approving awards under the Plan for all other employees of the
Company in any Plan Year. No employee of the Company is automatically entitled to any
award under the Plan. The Compensation Committee, the CEO and the CFO may establish
objective criteria for setting individual awards or may use their subjective judgment in
setting awards in their sole discretion. </FONT></P>
