                                         <H2 align=center>STOCK PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT</H2>


         <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This STOCK PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this <b>"Agreement"</b>) is dated as of December 16, 2002 by and among
James A. Cummings, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), Perini Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation
(<b>"Buyer"</b>), and James A. Cummings, William R. Derrer and Michael F. Lanciault (each, a <b>"Stockholder"</b> and
collectively, the <b>"Stockholders"</b>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Stockholders own beneficially and of record all the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company, as set forth on <U>Exhibit A</U> attached hereto
(collectively, the &#147;<B>Company Shares&#148;</B>); and </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
each Stockholder desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
each Stockholder, all of the issued and outstanding Company Shares owned by such
Stockholder on the terms and conditions set forth herein. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows: </P>

<H3 align=center><u>Article I - PURCHASE AND SALE OF COMPANY SHARES; CLOSING</u></H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 1.1.</B>
<B><I><U>Purchase and Sale of Company Shares</U></I></B><U><I></I></U>. Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, at the
Closing (as defined in Section 1.4), each Stockholder severally agrees to sell
to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from each such Stockholder, all of the
Company Shares owned by such Stockholder as set forth opposite such
Stockholder&#146;s name on <U>Exhibit A</U> hereto for the purchase price set
forth in Section 1.2. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 1.2.</B>
<B><I><U>Purchase Price and Payment</U></I></B>. The purchase
price for the Company Shares shall be an amount equal to Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000) (the &#147;<B>Purchase Price</B>&#148;), subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.3, together with the Additional Payment (as defined in
Section 1.8). In consideration of the sale by the Stockholders to the Buyer of
the Company Shares and in reliance upon the representations, warranties
covenants and agreements of the Company and the Stockholders herein contained,
the Buyer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, agrees to
cause the Purchase Price to be delivered as follows: </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Within two (2) business days of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to
         Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, as escrow agent (the <b>"Deposit Escrow Agent"</b>) the sum of Five
         Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) (the <b>"Deposit"</b>) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
         The Deposit Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Escrow
         Agreement (as defined in Section 1.7), including that all interest accrued on the
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
<p>
Deposit will be paid
         to Buyer, except that if the Deposit shall be retained by the Stockholders as liquidated damages under
         Section 9.3, then such interest shall be paid to the Stockholders (pro rata based upon each
         Stockholder's respective share amounts as set forth opposite such Stockholder's name in column 3 of
         <u>Exhibit A</u> attached hereto).</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to each Stockholder by wire transfer of immediately available funds
         the amount equal to such Stockholder's pro rata share (as set forth opposite such Stockholder's name in
         column 3 of <u>Exhibit A</u> attached hereto) of an amount equal to the Purchase Price (i) less the Deposit,
         which shall be applied in the manner set forth in Section 1.2(c) below, and (ii) plus or minus any
         adjustment required under Section 1.3(a).  Five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
         Stockholders' Representative (as defined in Section 1.6) shall update <u>Exhibit A</u> to reflect any
         adjustments pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and shall deliver such updated <u>Exhibit A</u> to Buyer with wire
         transfer instructions for each Stockholder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Upon the completion of Closing, all accrued interest on the Deposit shall be paid by the Deposit Escrow
         Agent to the Buyer, the Deposit shall be converted to and shall become known as the <b>"Indemnification
         Escrow Amount"</b> and the Deposit Escrow Agent shall be converted to and shall become known as the
         <b>"Indemnification Escrow Agent." </b> The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnification Escrow
         Amount in an account in accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement to be entered
         into by and among the Buyer, the Stockholders, the Stockholders' Representative and the Indemnification
         Escrow Agent at Closing substantially in the form of <u>Exhibit B</u> attached hereto (the <b>"Indemnification
         Escrow Agreement"</b>).  Interest accrued on the Indemnification Escrow Amount will be paid to the party or
         parties receiving the Indemnification Escrow Amount in proportion to the amount received.  The Deposit
         Escrow Agreement shall terminate as of the completion of Closing.  The Indemnification Escrow Agreement
         shall provide that any remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be paid to the Stockholders (pro
         rata based upon each Stockholder's respective share amounts as set forth opposite such Stockholder's
         name in column 3 of <u>Exhibit A</u> attached hereto) on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, provided
         that, if the Indemnification Escrow Agent receives notice from the Buyer that any portion of the
         Indemnification Escrow Amount is subject to a claim or claims for indemnification under this Agreement,
         then the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall only pay to the Stockholders that portion of the
         Indemnification Escrow Amount that is not subject to such claim or claims and shall retain the portion
         of the Indemnification Escrow Amount related to such claim or claims until such claim or claims have
         been resolved.</P>

<P><b>Section 1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <i><u>Adjustment to Purchase Price.</u></i></b></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Not later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall in good faith prepare
         an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2002 (the <b>"Closing Balance Sheet"</b>).  The
         Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, reflecting the
         Company as an S corporation and otherwise consistent with the methodology used to prepare the </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>2</P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P>Company's
         Base Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 2.6(a)); provided that a deferred liability shall be reflected
         on the Closing Balance Sheet with respect to any deferred taxes, and a prepaid asset shall be reflected
         on the Closing Balance Sheet with respect to any prepaid taxes, as a result of timing differences
         between book income and taxable income as would generally be reflected on Schedule M-1 of the U.S.
         federal income tax return (Form 1120S) of the Company.  Not later than five (5) business days prior to
         the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet, together with worksheets
         and data that support the Closing Balance Sheet and any other information that Buyer may reasonably
         request in order to verify the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet.  The Purchase Price to be
         paid at the Closing shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar, up or down, as appropriate, to the extent that
         the Net Worth set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (the <b>"Estimated Closing Net Worth"</b>) exceeds or is
         less than $7,000,000.00 (the <b>"Base Net Worth"</b>), as applicable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall cause Madsen, Sapp, Mena,
         Rodriquez &amp; Co., P.A. (<b>"Accountant"</b>) to audit the Closing Balance Sheet and make any adjustments
         necessary thereto (the <b>"Audited Balance Sheet"</b>) consistent with the provisions of this Section 1.3.  The
         fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne by the Company.  The Stockholders shall cause the
         Accountant, within thirty (30) days of the Closing, to deliver the Audited Balance Sheet to the Buyer,
         together with worksheets which detail any adjustments and the basis thereof.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The Audited Balance Sheet, and the Net Worth as of December 31, 2002 reflected thereon, shall be binding
                  upon the parties upon the written approval of such Audited Balance Sheet by the Buyer or the
                  failure to object in writing within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Audited Balance
                  Sheet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     If the Buyer does not agree with the Audited Balance Sheet and the calculation of Net Worth stated

         December 31, 2001 (the <b>"Base Balance Sheet"</b>), December 31, 2000, December 31, 1999, December 31, 1998
         and December 31, 1997 and the related audited statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for

         a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the financial results, results of operations and/or cash
         flows reported in such unaudited financial statements.  Nothing has come to the attention of the Company
         or the Stockholders since such respective dates that would indicate that such financial statements are
         not true and correct in all material respects as of the date thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Except for the Stockholders' guaranties expressly set forth in Sections 5.2(b) and (c) below, neither

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Schedule 2.19</u> sets forth a list of every Employee Program (as defined below) that has been maintained by
         the Company or an ERISA Affiliate at any time during the six-year period ending on the Closing Date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      No Employee Program which has ever been maintained by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate, which has been
         intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code and which has requested a
         determination or approval letter from the Internal Revenue Service (<b>"IRS"</b>) regarding its qualification
         under such section has been denied a favorable determination or approval letter and each such Employee
         Program has, in fact, qualified under the applicable section of the Code from the effective date of such
         Employee Program through and including the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date that all of such
         Employee Program's assets were distributed).  No event or omission has occurred which would cause any
         Employee Program to lose its qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the relevant requirements to
         provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable Code Section (including without limitation Code
         Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and 501(c)(9)).  Each asset held under any such Employee Program may </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>25</P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P>be
         liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge or comparable
         liability.  No partial termination (within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) has occurred
         with respect to any Employee Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any Knowledge of any failure of any party to comply with
         any laws applicable with respect to the Employee Programs that have ever been maintained by the Company
         or any ERISA Affiliate.  With respect to any Employee Program ever maintained by the Company or any
         ERISA Affiliate, there has been no (i) "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of the
         Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (<b>"ERISA"</b>) or Code Section 4975, (ii) failure
         to comply with any provision of ERISA, other applicable law, or any agreement, or (iii) non-deductible
         contribution, which, in the case of any of (i), (ii), or (iii), could subject the Company or any ERISA
         Affiliate to liability either directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, through any
         obligation of indemnification or contribution) for any damages, penalties, or taxes, or any other loss
         or expense.  No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding (or investigation) or other
         proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or threatened with
         respect to any such Employee Program.  All payments and/or contributions required to have been made
         (under the provisions of any agreements or other governing documents or applicable law) with respect to
         all Employee Programs ever maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, for all periods prior to
         the Closing Date, either have been made or have been accrued (and all such unpaid but accrued amounts
         are described on <u>Schedule 2.19</u>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under title IV of ERISA which has
         not been paid in full prior to the Closing.  There has been no "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether
         or not waived) with respect to any Employee Program ever maintained by the Company or any ERISA
         Affiliate and subject to Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302.  With respect to any Employee Program
         maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and subject to Title IV of ERISA, there has been no
         (nor will there be any as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (i) "reportable
         event," within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043 or the regulations thereunder, for which the notice
         requirement is not waived by the regulations thereunder, and (ii) event or condition which presents a
         material risk of a plan termination or any other event that may cause the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
         to incur liability or have a lien imposed on its assets under Title IV of ERISA.  Except as described in
         <u>Schedule 2.19</u>, no Employee Program maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and subject to Title
         IV of ERISA (other than a Multiemployer Plan) has any "unfunded benefit liabilities" within the meaning
         of ERISA Section 4001(a)(18), as of the Closing Date.  With respect to each Multiemployer Plan
         maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, <u>Schedule 2.19</u> states the amount of withdrawal
         liability or other termination liability that would be incurred by the Company or ERISA Affiliate if
         there were a cessation of operations or of the obligation to contribute to such plan as of the Closing
         Date.  None of the Employee Programs ever maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has ever
         provided health care or any </P>

<P>other non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment is

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      With respect to each Employee Program maintained by the Company within the six years preceding the
         Closing Date, complete and correct copies of the following documents (if applicable to such Employee
         Program) have previously been delivered to Buyer:  (i) all documents embodying or governing such
         Employee Program, and any funding medium for the Employee Program (including, without limitation, trust
         agreements) as they may have been amended to the date hereof; (ii) the most recent IRS determination or
         approval letter with respect to such Employee Program under Code Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9), and any
         applications for determination or approval subsequently filed with the IRS; (iii) the six most recently
         filed IRS Forms 5500, with all applicable schedules and accountants' opinions attached thereto; (iv) the
         six most recent actuarial valuation reports completed with respect to such Employee Program; (v) the
         summary plan description for such Employee Program (or other descriptions of such Employee Program
         provided to employees) and all modifications thereto; (vi) any insurance policy (including any fiduciary
         liability insurance policy or fidelity bond) related to such Employee Program; (vii) any registration
         statement or other filing made pursuant to any federal or state securities law and (viii) all material
         correspondence between the Company and any state or federal agency within the last six years with
         respect to such Employee Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Each Employee Program required to be listed on <u>Schedule 2.19</u>  may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
          modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, including the elimination of
         any and all future benefit accruals under any Employee Program and no provision of any Employee Program
         document has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company or the ERISA Affiliate to so amend,
         terminate or otherwise modify such Employee Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Each Employee Program ever maintained by the Company (including each non-qualified deferred compensation
         arrangement) has been maintained in compliance with all applicable requirements of federal and state
         securities laws including (without limitation, if applicable) the requirements that the offering of
         interests in such Employee Program be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and/or state "Blue
         Sky" laws.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Each Employee Program ever maintained by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate has complied with the

         proprietary data or information obtained from Buyer with respect to its business or financial condition
         except for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and completing the transaction contemplated hereby.
         Information generally known in Buyer's industry or which has been disclosed to the Company by third

         required by law to disclose such information, the Company or such Stockholder will provide the Buyer
         with prompt notice of such requirement so the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order and failing

         public company and that the federal securities laws prohibit trading in its securities on the basis of
         material inside information; accordingly, each Stockholder undertakes to refrain from any such trading
         and to take reasonable steps to prevent any officers, directors, agents and representatives of the
         Company from doing so.</P>

suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the indemnified party with
all documents and information that the indemnified party shall reasonably
request and shall consult with the indemnified party prior to acting on major

stated, the indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully
participate in such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel;

the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel for the indemnified party
shall be paid by the indemnifying party. </P>

defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the indemnifying party, the

right to compromise or settle, such claim, liability or expense. If such claim,
liability or expense is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely by the
indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall make available all
information and assistance that the indemnifying party may reasonably request
and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.7.</B>
<B><I><U>Entire Agreement; Severability</U></I></B>. This
Agreement (including the Schedules, exhibits, documents and instruments referred
to herein) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. If any term, condition or other provision of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.8.</B>
<B><I><U>Third Party Beneficiaries</U></I></B><U><I></I></U>. Except as

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.9.</B>
<B><I><U>Governing Law</U></I></B>. This Agreement will be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.10.</B>
<B><I><U>Assignment</U></I></B>. This Agreement shall be
assignable by the Buyer to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer although no such

Stockholders or the Company without the prior written consent of the Buyer in
its sole discretion. This Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder
(including specifically but without limitation the indemnification obligations
of the Company and each of the Stockholders set forth in Article VIII) shall be
binding upon and enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective successors, executors, administrators, estates,
heirs and permitted assigns, and no others. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.11.</B>
<B><I><U>Consent to Jurisdiction</U></I></B>. Each of the parties
hereby consents to personal jurisdiction, service of process and venue in the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.12.</B>
<B><I><U>Dispute Resolution</U></I></B>. All disputes, claims, or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the negotiation,
validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved
solely and exclusively by binding arbitration to be conducted before
J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. or </p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>65</P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


<p>its successor. The arbitration shall be held in
Miami, Florida before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules and regulations promulgated by J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. unless
specifically modified herein. </P>

<P>The parties covenant and
agree that the arbitration shall commence within ninety (90) days of the date on
which any party files a written demand for arbitration hereto. In connection
with the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order
the production of documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In
addition, each party may take up to three dispositions as of right, and the
arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good
cause shown by the moving party. In connection with any arbitration, each party
shall provide to the other, no later than seven (7) business days before the
date of the arbitration, the identity of all persons that may testify at the
arbitration and a copy of all documents that may be introduced at the
arbitration or considered or used by a party&#146;s witness or expert. The
arbitrator&#146;s decision and award shall be made and delivered within six (6)
months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator&#146;s decision shall
set forth a reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The
arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages in excess of actual
compensatory damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award punitive
damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under this
Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good
faith and that they will, (i)&#160;bear their own attorneys&#146; fees, costs
and expenses in connection with the arbitration, and (ii)&#160;share equally in
the fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrator. Any party unsuccessfully
refusing to comply with an order of the Arbitrators shall be liable for costs
and expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees, incurred by the other party in
enforcing the award. This Section&#160;10.12 applies equally to requests for
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case
of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court
without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable
harm or to enforce its rights under any non-competition covenants. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders (a)&#160;hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida, for the purpose of enforcing the award or
decision in any such proceeding and (b)&#160;hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert in any civil action to enforce the award, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the civil action
is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the civil action is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced
in or by such court, and (c)&#160;hereby waives and agrees not to seek any
review by any court of any other jurisdiction which may be called upon to grant
an enforcement of the judgment of any such court. Final judgment against Buyer,
the Company or the Stockholders in any such action, suit or proceeding may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit, action or proceeding on the judgment,
or in any other manner provided by or pursuant to the laws of such other
jurisdiction; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that to enforce such final
judgment any party may at its option bring suit, or institute other judicial
proceedings, in any state or federal </P>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<p>court of the United States or of any
country or place where the other parties or their assets, may be found. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.13.</B>
<B><I><U>Mutual Drafting</U></I></B>. The parties hereto are
sophisticated and have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions
contemplated hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a
consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules
relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section 10.14.</B>
<B><I><U>Remedies</U></I></B>. It is specifically understood and
agreed that any breach of the provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement by any party hereto
will result in irreparable injury to the other parties hereto, that the remedy
at law alone will be an inadequate remedy for such breach, and that, in addition
to any other remedies which they may have, such other parties may enforce their
respective rights by actions for specific performance (to the extent permitted
by law and this Agreement). </P>
