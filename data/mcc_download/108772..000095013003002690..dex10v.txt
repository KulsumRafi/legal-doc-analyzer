          AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
October 21, 2002, between XEROX LEASE FUNDING LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Borrower"), and GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation, as lender ("Lender").

                               RECITALS

          These Recitals shall be construed as part of this Agreement.

          A. Borrower and Lender are parties to a Loan Agreement dated as of
November 20, 2001 (as amended to the date hereof, the "Existing Loan
Agreement").

          B. Pursuant to the terms of the Existing Loan Agreement, Lender has
made the Existing Term Loans (as defined below) to Borrower.

          C. Pursuant to the Framework Agreement (as defined below), Borrower
has agreed to provide Lender the first opportunity to make loans against certain
Financing Contracts (as defined below) on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Program Agreement (as defined below) and Lender has agreed, on the terms and
conditions set forth herein, to make such loans.

          D. Borrower has requested that Lender amend and restate the Existing
Loan Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein (i) to amend the
terms and conditions of the Existing Term Loans and (ii) in order to effect the
agreements referred to in Recital C above, to make Additional Incremental Term
Loans (as defined below) to Borrower, in an aggregate principal amount not
exceeding for all such Additional Incremental Term Loans at any time
outstanding, the Maximum Amount (as defined below).

          E. Borrower and Lender do not intend that this Agreement constitute a
novation of the Existing Term Loans or any of the Obligations (as defined below)
under the Existing Loan Agreement or evidence any repayment of such Existing
Term Loans or Obligations, but that this Agreement only amend and restate in its
entirety the Existing Loan Agreement and provide for Additional Incremental
Terms Loans as set forth herein.

          F. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in Annex A, and, for purposes of this Agreement, the rules of
construction set forth in Annex A shall govern. All Appendices hereto, or
expressly identified to this Agreement, are incorporated herein by reference,
and taken together with this Agreement, shall constitute but a single agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants hereinafter contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                           AMOUNT AND TERMS OF CREDIT

     1.1. Credit Facilities.

           (a) Existing Term Loan Facility. Schedule 1.1(a)(i) sets forth the
original principal amount of the Term Loans heretofore made by Lender to
Borrower under the Existing Loan Agreement (each, an "Existing Term Loan" and


                                       1

<PAGE>

collectively the "Existing Term Loans"), each of which is evidenced by the
corresponding promissory note in the form of Exhibit 1.1(a)(ii) or 1.1(a)(iii)
of the Existing Loan Agreement (each an "Existing Term Note" and collectively,
the "Existing Term Notes"). From and after the Effective Date, the Existing Term
Loans shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.

           (b) Additional Incremental Term Loan Facility. Lender agrees, on the
terms and conditions set forth herein, to make loans (each an "Additional
Incremental Term Loan") to Borrower, on each Incremental Closing Date during the
period from the Effective Date until a Termination Event shall have occurred, in
a principal amount equal to the Funding Amount for such Additional Incremental
Term Loan; provided, in no event shall Lender be obligated to make any
Additional Incremental Term Loan hereunder if the then aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Additional Incremental Term Loans, together with the
principal amount of the proposed Additional Incremental Term Loan, would exceed
the Maximum Amount. All Additional Incremental Term Loans shall be evidenced by
one promissory note in the form of Exhibit 1.1(b) (the "Additional Term Note"
and collectively with the Existing Term Notes, the "Notes").

           (c) Borrowing Procedures for Additional Incremental Term Loans.

                (i) Additional Incremental Term Loans shall be made only on an
Incremental Closing Date unless otherwise agreed by Lender.

               (ii) Not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day of each calendar
month, Borrower shall deliver (or cause Portfolio Servicer to deliver) to Lender
a Data Certification for a proposed Additional Incremental Term Loan.

              (iii) Upon Lender's receipt of a Data Certification, Lender shall
have five (5) Business Days in which to review such Data Certification and
deliver to Borrower an Exception Notice or Acceptance Notice. If Lender
determines that (a) any of the components or calculations contained in or
delivered in connection with such Data Certification are erroneous, inaccurate
or incomplete or (b) in Lender's reasonable judgment any of the components or
calculations contained in or delivered in connection with such Data
Certification would cause any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section
2.4 and 2.5 not to be satisfied, then in either such case Lender shall give the
Borrower and the Portfolio Servicer notice thereof (which may, at Lender's
option, be telephonic or written, an "Exception Notice"), specifying in
reasonable detail, to the extent known to Lender and practicable, the nature of
such errors, inaccuracies, omissions and/or other matters with a view to
assisting Borrower in identifying the actions, if any, required to cure the
same. If Lender does not have a basis to deliver an Exception Notice, then
Lender shall deliver to Borrower written notice of its acceptance thereof (an
"Acceptance Notice"); provided that if Lender has not completed its
determination as to whether it has a basis to deliver an Exception Notice, then
prior to issuing an Acceptance Notice Lender shall be entitled to request
(either telephonically or in writing) a five (5) Business Day extension of the
time frame in which Lender must deliver either an Exception Notice or Acceptance
Notice, and Borrower agrees not to unreasonably withhold its consent (which may
be oral or written) to any such extension requested by Lender. If Lender fails
to deliver either an Exception Notice or Acceptance Notice on or prior to the
fifth Business Day (or if such time period is extended pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, tenth Business Day) after Lender's receipt of a Data Certification,
then such Data


                                       2

<PAGE>

Certification shall be deemed rejected by Lender. Nothing in this Section
1.1(c)(iii) shall limit Borrower's right to submit a subsequent Data
Certification with respect to Financing Contracts covered by a Data
Certification deemed rejected pursuant to the preceding sentence. Except as
required to be disclosed in an Exception Notice, Lender's failure to identify
any (or each and every) error, inaccuracy or omission in an Exception Notice, or
in connection with Lender's acceptance of a Data Certification, shall not
constitute a waiver of Lender's rights or remedies under this Agreement or any
other Related Transaction Document.

               (iv) If Lender gives Borrower an Exception Notice, Borrower shall
(or shall cause Portfolio Servicer to) correct the previously delivered Data
Certification with respect to the matters identified in such Exception Notice
and submit a modified Data Certification to Lender as soon as practicable, but
in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after Borrower's receipt of
such Exception Notice, whereupon the process set forth in subsections (ii) and
(iii) and this subsection (iv) shall be repeated until Lender accepts the Data
Certification pursuant to an Acceptance Notice. Such corrections shall include,
without limitation, (x) deleting Financing Contracts from such Data
Certification, but only if any matters identified with respect to such Financing
Contracts cannot be cured after Borrower's (or Xerox's) use of commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such matters without deleting such Financing
Contracts and (y) in the case of correcting any potential failure to satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth in clauses (d), (e) or (v) of Section 2.4, as
applicable, deleting Financing Contracts from such Data Certification such that
after giving effect to such deletions the conditions precedent set forth in
clauses (d), (e) or (v) of Section 2.4, as applicable, will be satisfied. In
connection with the correction of any Data Certification, Borrower shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the principal amount of the proposed
Additional Incremental Term Loan to which such Data Certification relates.

                (v) Within two (2) Business Days after Lender has accepted a
particular Data Certification Borrower shall, subject to Section 1.1(d), deliver
to Lender a Borrowing Request (each such date of delivery, a "Borrowing Request
Delivery Date"), based on such accepted Data Certification specifying an
Incremental Closing Date which is three (3) Business Days after the date of
delivery of such Borrowing Request.

               (vi) If Borrower determines that any condition precedent set
forth in (A) Section 2.4 will not be satisfied as of the relevant Borrowing
Request Delivery Date or (B) Section 2.5 will not be satisfied as of the
relevant Incremental Closing Date, then, in either case, concurrently with
Borrower's delivery of a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 1.1(c)(v),
Borrower shall deliver to Lender a written request for a waiver of such
condition(s) precedent specifying in reasonable detail the event(s) or
circumstance(s) giving rise to the non-satisfaction of such condition(s)
precedent (a "Waiver Request").

              (vii) If Borrower delivers a Waiver Request to Lender in
accordance with the terms set forth above, then Borrower shall not be liable for
any charges and assessments referred to in Section 1.1(c)(ix) in respect of the
related Borrowing Request. If Lender grants the relief set forth in the Waiver
Request (or such other relief as may be agreed to in writing by Borrower and
Lender) then (A) the Incremental Closing Date specified in such Borrowing
Request shall be automatically extended to the third Business Day after Lender
grants such relief; (B) the Borrowing Request Delivery Date


                                       3

<PAGE>

(including, without limitation, for purposes of Section 2.4) shall be deemed to
be the date Lender grants such relief; and (C) all representations, warranties
and certifications in the related Borrowing Request shall be deemed made as of
such new Borrowing Request Delivery Date. If Lender does not grant the waivers
set forth in the Waiver Request (or other relief as may be agreed to in writing
by Borrower and Lender) on or prior to the proposed Incremental Closing Date set
forth in the related Borrowing Request, then such Borrowing Request shall be
deemed terminated as of such proposed Incremental Closing Date; provided that,
except as otherwise expressly provided in the Program Agreement, (x) Lender
shall not be deemed to forfeit its rights under the Program Agreement with
respect to the Candidate Financing Contracts covered by such Borrowing Request,
(y) Lender shall not be released of its obligations to make Term Loans relating
to such Candidate Financing Contracts if included in subsequent Data
Certifications in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including Sections 2.4 and 2.5) and (z) Borrower shall be entitled and
obligated to include such Candidate Financing Contracts in any subsequent
Incremental Data Certification and related Borrowing Request submitted by
Borrower under this Section 1.1.

             (viii) Upon satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth above
and in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, as applicable, Lender shall make the Additional
Incremental Term Loan specified in such Borrowing Request in a principal amount
equal to the Funding Amount for such Additional Incremental Term Loan.

               (ix) Except as set forth in Section 1.1(c)(vii), once executed
and delivered a Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable by Borrower. In addition
to all amounts required to be paid by Borrower pursuant to Section 1.4, Borrower
shall compensate Lender for any and all charges or assessments imposed by Lender
on its Vendor Financial Services operating business as a result of the failure
of a proposed Term Loan to be funded on the date specified therefor in an
irrevocable Borrowing Request related thereto for any reason (other than as a
result of a wrongful refusal by Lender, in violation of the terms of this
Agreement, to make the Term Loan in accordance with the terms hereof); provided
that Borrower's liability for such charges or assessments shall not exceed the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such
proposed Additional Incremental Term Loan specified in the Borrowing Request
relating thereto (with such interest to be calculated at the proposed Discount
Rate specified in the Borrowing Request relating to such proposed Additional
Incremental Term Loan) during the period from and including the date of the
proposed Incremental Closing Date for such proposed Additional Incremental Term
Loan as specified in the related Borrowing Request to but excluding the next
Business Day occurring after such proposed Incremental Closing Date.
Furthermore, Borrower shall not be liable for any such charges or assessments
unless Lender makes a demand therefor within ten (10) Business Days after the
proposed Incremental Closing Date that describes the calculation and amount of
such assessments.

           (d) Minimum Funding Amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) Borrower shall not be obligated to submit any
Borrowing Request with respect to any Incremental Data Certification unless the
principal amount of the proposed Additional Incremental Term Loan is at least
$10,000,000; and (ii) Lender shall not be obligated to make any Additional
Incremental Term Loan unless the principal amount thereof is at least
$2,500,000. If Borrower or Lender exercise their


                                       4

<PAGE>

rights under this Section 1.1(d), Borrower shall not be excused from its
obligation to deliver the related Data Certification as provided in Section
1.1(c)(ii) and all Financing Contracts covered by such Data Certification must
be included in the next Data Certification required to be submitted by Borrower
pursuant to Section 1.1(c)(ii).

           (e) Excluded Financing Contracts. If Lender waives one or more
elements of the definition of Excluded Financing Contract with respect to any
Candidate Financing Contract, Lender shall be deemed to have also waived any
breach of the representations, warranties and covenants as to such Candidate
Financing Contract made in any Related Transaction Document, to the extent (and
solely to the extent) such breach is based on the existence of the element so
waived. A waiver of any such element, representation, warranty or covenant as to
any particular Candidate Financing Contract shall not be deemed a waiver of any
other element or a waiver with respect to any other Candidate Financing
Contract.

           (f) Reliance on Certifications and Requests. Lender shall be entitled
to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any Borrowing
Request or Data Certification purporting to be executed by an Authorized Officer
of Borrower and believed by Lender to be genuine. Lender may assume that each
Person purporting to be an Authorized Officer of Borrower executing and
delivering such a request was duly authorized, unless the responsible individual
acting thereon for Lender has actual knowledge to the contrary.

     1.2. Use of Proceeds.

           (a) Borrower shall utilize the proceeds of the Existing Term Loans
(net of the proceeds otherwise required to be applied pursuant to Sections
1.3(b) and 1.4(b)) solely to finance the payments required to be made by
Borrower to Xerox pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Sale and Contribution
Agreement in respect of the Tier I Transfers made on the applicable Closing
Date.

           (b) Borrower shall use the proceeds of each Additional Incremental
Term Loan solely to make the payments required to be made by Borrower to Xerox
pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Sale and Contribution Agreement in respect of
the Tier I Transfers made on the Closing Date of such Additional Incremental
Term Loan.

     1.3.  Cash Management System

           (a) Establishment and Maintenance of Accounts.

                (i) Payment Account and Related Accounts. On or before the
Initial Closing Date, each of the Lockboxes, Lockbox Deposit Accounts, Lockbox
Concentration Account and the Payment Account shall have been established in
accordance with the terms of the Lockbox Account Agreement (as in effect on the
Initial Closing Date) and Payment Account Agreement (as in effect on the Initial
Closing Date), as applicable, and the Collateral Agent shall have legal title to
each of the Lockboxes, Lockbox Deposit Accounts, Lockbox Concentration Account
and the Payment Account for the benefit of the Beneficial Owners (as of the
Initial Closing Date), and each such agreement shall be in full force and
effect.


                                       5

<PAGE>

               (ii) GE Capital Control Account. On or before the Initial Closing
Date, Borrower shall have established an account with Citibank, N.A. in the name
of Borrower (the "GE Capital Control Account") under account number 795253 and
with respect to which Lender has sole dominion and control and a perfected,
first priority security interest therein and the funds on deposit therein
pursuant to the Deposit Account Control Agreement (as in effect on the Initial
Closing Date).

              (iii) Other Monetization Accounts. On or before the Initial
Closing Date, each of the Monetization Accounts and the Controlled Accounts
(other than the GE Capital Control Account) shall have been established in
accordance with the terms of the Allocation Agreement.

           (b) Funding of the Holdback Account. (1) On the Initial Closing Date,
pursuant to the letter of direction delivered by Borrower pursuant to Section
2.1(l) of the Existing Loan Agreement, Lender caused $75 million of the proceeds
of the Initial Term Loan to be deposited in the Holdback Account.

              (ii) On the first Incremental Closing Date, pursuant to the letter
of direction delivered by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3(i) of the Existing
Loan Agreement, Lender caused $40 million of the proceeds of such Incremental
Term Loan to be deposited in the Holdback Account.

             (iii) On the second Incremental Closing Date, pursuant to the
letter of direction delivered by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3(i) of the
Existing Loan Agreement, Lender caused $35 million of the proceeds of such
Incremental Term Loan to be deposited in the Holdback Account.

           (c) Return of Funds in the Controlled Accounts. On the Termination
Date, Lender shall cause all funds then on deposit in the Controlled Accounts
(other than any funds necessary to pay third party service and supply providers
through the Termination Date, or, if later, through the earlier to occur of (X)
the date at which Lender may terminate the contract(s) with such third party
service or supply providers without penalty and (Y) the date which is one (1)
year following the Termination Date) to be transferred to the MPE 1 Account.

     1.4.  Interest, Fees and Principal

           (a) Interest Rate. Interest shall accrue on each outstanding Term
Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Discount Rate specified in the Initial
Borrowing Request or Incremental Borrowing Request, as applicable, related
thereto.

           (b) Fees. (i) Borrower has paid to Lender on the Initial Closing Date
a non-refundable origination fee equal to 0.65% of the amount of the Initial
Term Loan made by Lender.

               (ii) Borrower has paid to Lender on each Incremental Closing Date
occurring prior to the Effective Date, a non-refundable origination fee equal to
(a) 0.65% of the amount of the Term Loan made by Lender on such Closing Date
minus (b) the sum of the Fee Credit Amounts (calculated as of the Tagging Date
relating to the relevant Replacement Financing Contracts) for all Replacement
Financing Contracts listed on the Statement of Cash Flows for such Incremental
Closing Date and which were acquired by Borrower from Xerox on such Incremental
Closing Date.


                                       6

<PAGE>

           (c) Application of Monthly Aggregate Payment Amount. With respect to
each outstanding Term Loan, on each Actual Application Date, Lender shall cause
the Monthly Aggregate Payment Amount to be applied or distributed from the GE
Capital Control Account as follows:

                (i) if, as of such Actual Application Date, no Turbo Event shall
have occurred and be continuing:

                first, to all accrued and unpaid interest on such Term Loan for
     the Applicable Interest Period (and any prior Applicable Interest
     Period(s));

                second, to the outstanding principal balance of such Term Loan
     to the extent necessary to reduce the outstanding principal balance thereof
     to the corresponding Targeted Principal Balance for such Term Loan as of
     the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to any
     adjustment to such Targeted Principal Balance based on the information
     contained in the related Settlement Report);

                third, to all accrued and unpaid interest on each other Term
     Loan;

                fourth, to the outstanding principal balance of each other Term
     Loan to the extent necessary to reduce the outstanding principal balance
     thereof to the corresponding Targeted Principal Balance for such Term Loan
     as of the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to
     any adjustment to such Targeted Principal Balance based on the information
     contained in the related Settlement Report); and

                fifth, to the MPE 1 Account;

provided, however, if sufficient funds are not available to fund all payments to
be made in respect of any category of Obligation described in the third or
fourth clauses above, the available funds being applied to such Obligations
shall be allocated to the payment of such Obligations on a Term Loan-by-Term
Loan basis, beginning with the oldest outstanding Term Loan and continuing
thereafter in chronological order of the outstanding Term Loans, based on the
date on which each Term Loan was advanced.

               (ii) if, as of such Actual Application Date, a Turbo Event shall
have occurred and be continuing, then first as set forth in clauses first
through fourth of subclause (i) above, and thereafter:

               first, to the remaining outstanding principal balance of all
     outstanding Term Loans until each such Term Loan has been paid in full;

               second, to any other Obligations then due and owing; and

               third, to the MPE 1 Account;

provided, however, if sufficient funds are not available to fund all payments to
be made in respect of any category of Obligation described in the first clause
above, the available funds being applied to any such Obligations shall be
allocated to the payment of such Obligations on a Term Loan-by-Term Loan basis,
beginning with the oldest outstanding Term Loan and continuing thereafter in
chronological order of the outstanding Term Loans, based on the


                                       7

<PAGE>

date on which each Term Loan was advanced; and provided further if Lender
affirmatively waives in writing the failure of Borrower to have satisfied any
condition precedent set forth in Sections 2.4 or 2.5 which failure also
constitutes a Turbo Event, such Turbo Event shall be deemed, for purposes of
this Section 1.4(c), to cease to be continuing.

           (d) Computation of Interest. All computations of interest shall be
made by Lender on the basis of a 365/366-day year, as applicable, in each case
for the actual number of days occurring in the Applicable Interest Period for
which such interest is payable. For purposes of computing interest on the
Obligations as of any date, no deposits to the GE Capital Control Account shall
be deemed received by Lender until applied in accordance with Section 1.4(c).

           (e) Acceptance of Settlement Report. The acceptance by Lender of the
Settlement Report after the Settlement Date to which it relates shall not be
deemed to be a waiver by Lender of any failure by Borrower to perform any
provision of this Agreement or any Default or Event of Default arising from such
failure or otherwise related to the delivery of such Settlement Report.

           (f) Maximum Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 1.4, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a
final order that the rate of interest payable hereunder exceeds the highest rate
of interest permissible under law (the "maximum lawful rate"), then so long as
the maximum lawful rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest payable
hereunder shall be equal to the maximum lawful rate; provided, however, that if
at any time thereafter the rate of interest payable hereunder is less than the
maximum lawful rate, Borrower shall continue to pay interest hereunder at the
maximum lawful rate until such time as the total interest received by Lender is
equal to the total interest that would have been received had the interest rate
payable hereunder been (but for the operation of this paragraph) the interest
rate payable since the applicable Closing Date as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. Thereafter, interest hereunder shall be paid at the rate(s) of
interest and in the manner provided in Sections 1.4(a) through (e), unless and
until the rate of interest again exceeds the maximum lawful rate, and at that
time this paragraph shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest
received by Lender pursuant to the terms hereof exceed the amount that Lender
could lawfully have received had the interest due hereunder been calculated for
the full term hereof at the maximum lawful rate. If the maximum lawful rate is
calculated pursuant to this paragraph, such interest shall be calculated at a
daily rate equal to the maximum lawful rate divided by the number of days in the
year in which such calculation is made. If, notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 1.4(f), a court of competent jurisdiction shall finally determine
that Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the maximum lawful
rate, Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, promptly apply
such excess in the order specified in Section 1.4(c) and thereafter shall refund
any excess to Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise
order.

     1.5. Loan Account and Accounting.

           Lender shall maintain a loan account (the "loan account") on its
books to record the borrowing of the Initial Term Loan and any borrowing of an
Incremental Term Loan, all payments made by or on behalf of Borrower and all
other debits and credits as provided in this Agreement with respect to the Term
Loans or any other Obligations. All entries in the loan account


                                       8

<PAGE>

shall be made in accordance with Lender's customary accounting practices as in
effect from time to time. The balance in the loan account, as recorded on
Lender's most recent printout or other written statement, shall, absent manifest
error and subject to each of Borrower's and Lender's rights under the Allocation
Agreement to receive Misapplied Proceeds and/or Misdirected Contract Payments
which may affect the balance reflected in the loan account, be presumptive
evidence of the amounts due and owing by Borrower under this Agreement;
provided, that any failure to so record or any error in so recording shall not
limit or otherwise affect Borrower's duty to pay the Obligations.

     1.6. Indemnity.

           (a) Borrower's Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any and all Damages which may
be suffered or incurred by any such Indemnified Person resulting from, arising
out of, based on or relating to (i) credit having been extended, suspended or
terminated under this Agreement (including by reason of Borrower's failure to
satisfy any condition to lending set forth in Article II hereof) and the other
Loan Documents, the administration of such credit and/or the enforcement of
Lender's rights and remedies under the Related Transaction Documents (except
that Borrower shall not be liable for any indemnification to an Indemnified
Person to the extent that any indemnified liabilities result from that
Indemnified Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law)
and (ii) any representations, warranties, covenants and/or obligations set forth
in any Related Transaction Document (other than those made by Lender) which have
been breached or are otherwise unfulfilled, incorrect, untrue, misleading or
inaccurate (as applicable).

           (b) Lender's Indemnification. Lender shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any and all Damages which may
be suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Person resulting from, arising out
of, based on or relating to, any breach of Lender's warranties set forth in
Section 3A.1 or Lender's breach of contract arising from (i) any failure by
Lender to perform its contractual obligations hereunder (except that Lender
shall not be liable for any indemnification to any Indemnified Person to the
extent that any indemnified liabilities result from that Indemnified Person's
gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law) and (ii) any
representations, warranties, covenants and/or obligations set forth in any
Related Transaction Document (other than those made by any Transaction Party)
which have been breached or are otherwise unfulfilled, incorrect, untrue
misleading or inaccurate (as applicable).

           (c) GENERAL LIMITATION. NO INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR
LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, ANY SUCCESSOR, ASSIGNEE OR THIRD
PARTY BENEFICIARY OF SUCH PERSON OR ANY OTHER PERSON ASSERTING CLAIMS
DERIVATIVELY THROUGH SUCH PARTY, FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

     1.7  Taxes.

          (a) Tax Forms. Lender shall provide Borrower with a completed IRS Form
W-9 (or other applicable IRS forms) and all required renewals thereof (or any
successor forms).

          (b) Gross-Up. Any and all payments made or deemed made by


                                       9

<PAGE>

Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with this
Section 1.7, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future Taxes. If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under the Notes, (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as much as shall be necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 1.7) Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such
deductions, and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (c) Other Taxes. Borrower shall be obligated to pay any stamp or
documentary Taxes or any other excise Taxes arising from any payment made
hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or enforcement of,
or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Term Loans or Borrower's
obligations hereunder.

           (d) Borrower Indemnity. Borrower shall indemnify and, within ten (10)
days of demand therefor, pay Lender for the full amount of Taxes paid by Lender
on or with respect to this Agreement or the Notes, or with respect to any
payment hereunder or under the Notes, and any liability (excluding penalties and
additions to Taxes imposed solely as a result of Lender's willful misconduct,
negligence or violation of law) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. If Lender receives
a refund of all or any part of indemnified Taxes paid by Borrower, Lender shall
promptly pay Borrower the amount of such refund.

           (e) Withholding Tax Liability. In the event that Lender assigns all
or any portion of the Term Loans or grants a participation therein, Lender shall
be the paying agent and "withholding agent" (within the meaning of section
1.1441-7 of the Treasury regulations) with respect to any such assignment or
participation (and, in addition, shall be responsible for any related federal
information reporting). Lender shall indemnify and, within ten (10) days of
demand therefor, pay Borrower for the full amount of any and all federal
withholding taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to taxes) for
which Borrower is liable as the "withholding agent" (within the meaning of
section 1.1441-7 of the Treasury regulations) with respect to payments made on
(i) any participation in the Term Loans granted by Lender or (ii) Term Loans
that have been assigned by Lender.

           (f) Tax Receipts. As soon as reasonably practicable after the payment
of any indemnified Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting
such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably available to Borrower
and satisfactory to Lender.

           (g) After-Tax Basis. All payments under Section 1.7(d) or (e) shall
be made on an "after-tax" basis, by increasing the amount of any payment as
necessary so that after payment of all Taxes imposed on such payment the
recipient receives an amount equal to the same it would have received had no
Taxes been payable thereon.

           (h) Assignees and Participants. The provisions and indemnity of this
Section 1.7 do not apply to any Taxes, or any liability with respect


                                       10

<PAGE>

thereto, which may be incurred by any successor, assignee (including without
limitation any foreign branch, division or Affiliate of Lender) or participant
of Lender to the extent the indemnity payable hereunder is greater than the
amount that would have resulted if such successor, assignee or participant were
GE Capital, a U.S. corporation.

           (i) Notice/Contest. If Lender receives notice of a claim for Taxes
the liability for which is imposed on Borrower pursuant to this Section 1.7,
Lender shall provide prompt notice of such claim and shall contest, upon the
request of and at the sole expense of Borrower, such claim for Taxes (but only
if such contest may be made in good faith). Lender will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless and to the extent Lender waives its
right to payment of the amount owing by Borrower under this Section 1.7.

           (j) Tax Treatment. Borrower and Lender agree, for federal and state
income tax purposes, to treat the Term Loans as debt of Borrower and not to
treat Lender as the owner of any Collateral or Equipment which is subject to a
lease agreement (and not as entitled to any depreciation thereon). Neither
Borrower nor Lender shall take any position for federal or state income tax
purposes contrary to the foregoing (whether on its tax returns or otherwise)
unless required to do so by a taxing authority.

     1.8. Single Loan.

           All Term Loans to Borrower and all of the other Obligations of
Borrower arising under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall
constitute one general obligation of Borrower secured, until the Termination
Date, by all of the Collateral.

     1.9. Earnings on Funds in Controlled Accounts.

           The funds on deposit in each Controlled Account shall be invested in
one or more Specified Investments; provided, that Lender shall not be liable for
any loss of principal or income on such funds due to the choice of Specified
Investments or any conversion of invested funds into cash when such funds are
required to be released or applied to any obligation under a Related Transaction
Document. No interest or other amounts earned on funds on deposit shall
constitute Collateral. All interest or other amounts earned on funds in the
Controlled Accounts shall be payable to Borrower and reported as such for income
tax purposes. On each Actual Application Date, prior to the application of funds
in the GE Capital Control Account in accordance with Section 1.4(c), Lender
shall cause all interest income (net of losses) actually earned on the funds on
deposit in each Controlled Account (as determined by Portfolio Servicer and
specified on the related Settlement Report) to be distributed to the MPE 1
Account.

     1.10. Service Provider Preparation of Certain Documents.

            Borrower hereby agrees that notwithstanding the fact that after the
JV Operational Date, the JV will initially prepare the Incremental Data File and
Statement of Cash Flows for Term Loans made after such date, Borrower is and
continues to be responsible for the accuracy of each Incremental Data File,
Statement of Cash Flows and the Incremental Data Certification and calculations,
analyses, any notices or certifications related to any and all Term Loans (and
each other component thereof) and any


                                       11

<PAGE>

representation or warranty contained herein or in any other Loan Document
relating thereto. Borrower hereby waives as a defense to any inaccuracy of any
portion of any such Incremental Data File, Statement of Cash Flows, the
Incremental Data Certification related thereto and calculations, analyses, any
notices or certifications, or any representation or warranty contained herein or
any other Loan Document with respect thereto, that such information was
initially prepared by the JV. Nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of Borrower's rights or remedies against the JV under or
pursuant to any Related Transaction Document.

                                   ARTICLE II

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     2.1. Conditions to the Initial Term Loan.

           Lender shall not be obligated to make the Initial Term Loan on the
Initial Closing Date, or to take, fulfill, or perform any other action or
obligation hereunder, until the conditions set forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of
the Existing Loan Agreement have been satisfied or provided for in a manner
satisfactory to Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, or waived in writing by
Lender.

     2.2. Conditions to the Existing Incremental Term Loans.

           Lender shall not be obligated to make any Existing Incremental Term

Agreement have been satisfied or provided for in a manner satisfactory to
Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, or waived in writing by Lender.

     2.3. Conditions to Effective Date.

           This Agreement shall not be effective, and Lender shall not be
obligated to take, fulfill or perform any action or obligation hereunder, until

such condition precedent would, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
remediation, have been satisfied.

thereof and repayment thereof and the consummation of the Related Transactions
do not violate any provision of any such statute or any rule, regulation or
order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     3.8. Margin Regulations.

           Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing"
or "carrying" any "margin stock" as such terms are defined in Regulation U of
the Federal Reserve Board as now and from time to time hereafter in effect (such
securities being referred to herein as "Margin Stock"). Borrower does not own
any Margin Stock, and none of the proceeds of the Term Loans or other extensions
of credit under this Agreement have been used, directly or indirectly, for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock, for the purpose of reducing
or retiring any Indebtedness that was originally incurred to purchase or carry
any Margin Stock or for any other purpose that might cause any of the Term Loans
or other extensions of credit under this Agreement to be considered a "purpose
credit" within the meaning of Regulations T, U or X of the Federal Reserve
Board.


                                       21

     3.9. Charges.

           All tax returns, reports and statements, including information
returns, required by any Governmental Authority to be filed by Borrower have
been filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority and all Charges have been
paid prior to the date on which any fine, penalty, interest or late charge may
be added thereto for nonpayment thereof (or any such fine, penalty, interest,
late charge or loss has been paid), excluding Charges or other amounts being
contested in accordance with Section 5.2(b). If any Tax return filed by Borrower
has been or is currently being audited by any applicable Governmental Authority,
there are no material assessments currently outstanding or threatened material
assessments in connection with such audited Tax returns. Borrower has not
executed or filed with any Governmental Authority any agreement or other
document extending, or having the effect of extending, the period for assessment
or collection of any Charges. Borrower is not liable for any Charges: (a) under
any agreement (including any tax sharing agreements) or (b) to its knowledge, as
a transferee.

     3.10. ERISA.

            (a) Borrower does not sponsor or contribute to any "employee benefit
plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA. To Borrower's knowledge,
neither Xerox nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make any contribution or pay
any amount due as required by either Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 of
ERISA or the terms of any Title IV Plan except to the extent the failure to make
such contribution or pay such amount would not (i) subject Xerox or any ERISA
Affiliate (other than Borrower) to any liability, in excess of $1,000,000,
singly or in the aggregate or (ii) subject Borrower to a lien described in
Section 412(n) of the IRC. To Borrower's knowledge, neither Xerox nor any ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the IRC, in connection with any Plan of such ERISA
Affiliate, that could subject Borrower or such ERISA Affiliate to a material tax
on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the IRC.

             (b) Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule (3.10) or where the
failure of any of the following to be true would not give rise to (A) a funding
obligation required by Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA that Xerox
or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than Borrower) fails to timely pay, or a
termination liability under Title IV of ERISA that Xerox or any of its ERISA
Affiliates (other than Borrower) fails to timely pay, in either case, in excess
of $1,000,000, singly or in the aggregate, or (B) a lien described in Section
412(n) of the IRC against Borrower's assets: (i) no Title IV Plan has any
Unfunded Pension Liability; (ii) no ERISA Event or event described in Section
4062(e) of ERISA with respect to any Title IV Plan has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur; (iii) neither Xerox nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur any liability as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan maintained by Xerox or any ERISA Affiliate;
(iv) within the last five (5) years no Title IV Plan of Xerox or any ERISA
Affiliate has been terminated, whether or not in a "standard termination" as
that term is used in Section 4041(b)(1) of ERISA, nor has any Title IV Plan of
Xerox or any ERISA Affiliate (determined at any time within the last five (5)
years) with Unfunded Pension Liabilities been transferred outside of the
"controlled group" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) of Xerox
or any


                                       22

<PAGE>

ERISA Affiliate (determined at such time); and (v) except in the case of any
ESOP, Stock of Xerox and all ERISA Affiliates makes up, in the aggregate, no
more than ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the assets of any Title
IV Plan maintained by Xerox or any ERISA Affiliate measured on the basis of fair
market value as of the latest valuation date of any such Plan.

     3.11. No Litigation; Agent for Service of Process.

            No Litigation is now pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower,
threatened against any Transaction Party (a) that challenges any Transaction
Party's right or power to enter into or perform any of its obligations under the
Related Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or the validity or
enforceability of any Related Transaction Document or any action taken
thereunder, (b) that seeks to prevent the consummation of the Related
Transactions on an Incremental Closing Date or (c) that relates to or affects
any of the Candidate Financing Contracts or related Transferred Assets. As of
the Initial Closing Date there was, and as of the Effective Date there is, no
Litigation pending or, to Borrower's knowledge, threatened against Borrower. CSC
Corporation is Borrower's agent for service of process in the State of New York.

     3.12. Brokers.

            Except for Merrill Lynch, which was retained by Xerox in connection
with transactions relating to Related Transactions occurring prior to the
Effective Date only, no broker or finder brought about the obtaining, making or
closing of the Related Transactions, and neither Borrower nor any Affiliate
thereof (other than Xerox) has any obligation to any Person, including Merrill
Lynch, in respect of any finder's or brokerage fees in connection therewith.

     3.13. Full Disclosure.

            To the knowledge of an Authorized Officer of Borrower, after due
inquiry, no material information contained in this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents, or any of the other Related Transaction Documents, or any
collateral reports or other written reports from time to time delivered
hereunder or any written statement furnished by or on behalf of Borrower to
Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement contains or will contain any
material misstatement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in any material respect in light of the circumstances under which
they were made.

     3.14. Solvency.

            Both before and after giving effect to (a) the Term Loans to be made
on the Initial Closing Date and each Incremental Closing Date, (b) the
disbursement of the proceeds of such Term Loans pursuant to the instructions of
Borrower, (c) the consummation of the other Related Transactions, (d) the
payment by Borrower of any dividends as permitted herein and (e) the payment and
accrual of all transaction costs in connection with the foregoing, Borrower is
and will be Solvent.

     3.15. Liabilities.

            Other than (a) the liabilities, commitments or obligations





                                       23

<PAGE>

(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) arising under or in respect
of the Related Transaction Documents, (b) immaterial amounts due and payable in
the ordinary course of business of a special-purpose company, (c) liabilities
owing by Borrower to any Obligor for which Borrower is entitled to
indemnification from the Portfolio Servicer and (d) liabilities not exceeding in
the aggregate $7.5 million for which Borrower is entitled to indemnification
from Xerox, Borrower does not have any liabilities, commitments or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), whether due or to become
due.

     3.16. Controlled Accounts.

            Each of the Controlled Accounts is free and clear of any Lien (other
than the Lien in favor of Lender).

     3.17. Bulk Sales.

            The execution, delivery and performance of the Related Transaction
Documents do not require compliance with any "bulk sales" law by Borrower or any
other Transaction Party.

     3.18. Business.

            Since its formation, Borrower has conducted no business other than
(i) the acquisition of Transferred Assets from Xerox under the Sale and
Contribution Agreement, (ii) the contribution of the Equipment, Sales Tax
Payments and Uplift Payments to MPE 2 under the Contribution Agreement, (iii)
the execution and delivery of the Related Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (including
the borrowing of the Term Loans) and (iv) such other activities as are
incidental to each of the foregoing.

     3.19. Consideration for Transferred Assets.

            (a) Borrower shall have given reasonably equivalent value to Xerox
in consideration for each Tier I Transfer and no such transfer shall have been
made for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by Borrower to Xerox. The
purchases by and contributions to Borrower constitute valid and true sales and
transfers for consideration (and not merely a pledge of the Transferred Assets
for security purposes), and shall be effective protection against any claim by a
creditor of Xerox to the Transferred Assets and no such Transferred Assets shall
constitute property of Xerox.

            (b) MPE 2 shall have given reasonably equivalent value to Borrower
in consideration for the transfers made to it pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement and no such transfer shall have been for or on account of an
antecedent debt owed by MPE 2 to Borrower. The contributions to MPE 2 constitute
valid and true sales and transfers for consideration (and not merely a pledge of
the assets subject to each Equipment and Tax Payment Transfer for security
purposes), and shall be effective protection against any claim by a creditor of
Borrower to such assets and no such assets shall constitute property of
Borrower.

      3.20. Separate Existence.

             Borrower is operated as an entity with assets and liabilities
distinct from those of Xerox and MPE 2, and Borrower acknowledges that Lender


                                       24

<PAGE>

is entering into the Loan Documents in reliance upon Borrower's identity as a
separate legal entity from each of Xerox and MPE 2. From and after the date of
its formation, Borrower has been and will be operated in such a manner as to
comply with (a) the provisions of its constituent documents and (b) the
Separateness Agreement.

     3.21. Tier I Transfer.

            The Sale and Contribution Agreement is the only agreement pursuant
to which Borrower purchases or acquires Transferred Assets or any other assets.
Borrower has furnished to Lender true, correct and complete copies of each
Related Transaction Document to which Borrower is a party, each of which is in
full force and effect. Neither Borrower nor any other Transaction Party is in
default of any of its obligations under the Related Transaction Documents. Upon
the purchase by or contribution to Borrower of each Financing Contract under the
Sale and Contribution Agreement and prior to giving effect to any Equipment and
Tax Payment Transfer, Borrower shall be the lawful owner of, and have good title
to, the Transferred Assets, free and clear of any Liens (except for Permitted
Encumbrances). All Transferred Assets are purchased without recourse to Xerox
except as described in the Sale and Contribution Agreement.

     3.22. Equipment and Tax Payment Transfer.

            The Contribution Agreement is the only agreement pursuant to which
Borrower transfers the Equipment, Sales Tax Payments and Uplift Payments or any
other assets to MPE 2. Upon the contribution to MPE 2 of the Equipment, Sales
Tax Payments and Uplift Payments under the Contribution Agreement, MPE 2 shall
be the lawful owner of, and have good title to, the Equipment, Sales Tax
Payments and Uplift Payments, free and clear of any Liens (except for Permitted
Encumbrances). All Equipment, Sales Tax Payments and Uplift Payments are
transferred without recourse to Borrower except as described in the Contribution
Agreement.

     3.23. Borrower's Tax Election.

Borrower has not made any election to be treated as a corporation and,
consequently, it will be treated as a disregarded entity for United States
federal income tax purposes.

     3.24. No Violation of Law.

            (a) Borrower owns and operates, and at all times since its
acquisition thereof has owned and operated, each of the Transferred Assets
(other than the Equipment, Sales Tax Payments and Uplift Payments transferred to
MPE 2) in compliance with all Requirements of Law applicable to it, including
but not limited to laws pertaining to usury, installment or conditional sales
and sales financing, (b) neither the billing and collection nor enforcement of
any Financing Contract or Credit Enhancement in accordance with the terms
thereof has resulted or will result in the violation of any Requirement of Law
applicable to it, (c) Borrower has not received any written notice of violation
of any Requirement of Law from any Governmental Authority relating to the
acquisition, collection, administration or enforcement of any Financing Contract
or Credit Enhancement and (d) Borrower is not subject to any judgment, writ,
decree, injunction or order of any Governmental Authority relating to the
foreclosure, acquisition or disposition of any Transferred Asset or, in each
case, any transactions or


                                       25

<PAGE>

activities incidental thereto.

     3.25. Data Files; Statement of Cash Flows; Borrowing Request.

            (a) The Data File delivered as a part of any Initial Data
Certification or Incremental Data Certification, as applicable, is and on the
relevant Closing Date will be, true, complete and correct in all respects as of
the Tagging Date for the Financing Contracts included in such Data File.

            (b) The Statement of Cash Flows delivered as a part of any Initial
Data Certification or Incremental Data Certification, as applicable, is and on

Cash Flows.

            (c) The calculations contained in any Data Certification and
Borrowing Request delivered in connection with any Term Loan have been
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     3.26. Lien Priority.

            The Liens granted to Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Collateral Documents are and will at all times be fully perfected first priority
Liens in and to the Collateral described herein and therein.

                                  ARTICLE III-A

Documents to which Lender is a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Lender and each such Related Transaction Document constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Lender enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms.

Servicer to maintain and implement, administrative and operating procedures

an Obligor has been given an option to remit its Contract Payment by means of
(a) electronic funds transfer to either the EFT Lockbox Account or the EBPP
Lockbox Account or (b) credit card to the Credit Card Lockbox Account shall not
cause Borrower to be in violation of this Section 5.12 (except to the extent
otherwise provided in the Program Agreement or the Sale and Contribution
Agreement).

     5.13. Deficiency Payments.

            If Xerox shall not have deposited into the Payment Account the
amount required to be paid by it pursuant to any of Section 2.17(b), Article V

respect of any Financing Contract, then Borrower shall, within one (1) Business
Day after such payment was required to be paid into the Payment Account pursuant

failure by Borrower to satisfy, as of any Incremental Closing Date, any of the
conditions precedent set forth in subsections (a) through (v) of Section 2.4,
notwithstanding that, for purposes of Section 2.4, satisfaction of such
conditions precedent are measured as of the Borrowing Request Delivery Date. The
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 5.14 shall not be modified,
affected or impaired in any way by, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives as an
excuse for performance of such obligations and as a defense to the
indemnification provided herein, any knowledge (whether actual or constructive)
of Lender that any such condition has not been satisfied as of any such
Incremental Closing Date or the relevant Borrowing Request Delivery Date ,
unless affirmatively waived in writing by an authorized representative of Lender
as of such date.

     5.15. Separateness Opinion.

            Upon the breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Agreement that is the basis of a condition precedent set forth in Section 2.4
which is qualified by "Separateness/True Sale Concern," Borrower shall, if
requested by Lender, engage Nixon Peabody LLP (or another law firm reasonably
acceptable to Borrower and Lender) to review the relevant events, actions,
circumstances, omissions or other items and to issue (or conclude that it
cannot, consistent with its professional standards, issue) an opinion on which
Lender may rely, in substantially the form of Exhibit 3.27 hereto. The issuance
or failure to issue such an opinion shall not be conclusive as to whether a
"Separateness/True Sale Concern" exists, but shall serve only to assist Lender
in determining whether the relevant condition precedent has been satisfied.

     5.16. Payment of Liabilities.

            Borrower shall, within sixty (60) days after a liability becomes (a)
a nondisputed liquidated sum or (b) a liquidated sum reduced to a judgment which
is not then stayed, pay all liabilities described in clause (c) of Section 3.15.

option to remit its Contract Payment by means of (a) electronic funds transfer

     7.1. Events of Default.

           The occurrence of any one or more of the following events (regardless
of the reason therefor) shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder:

           (a) A Termination Event.


                                       35

<PAGE>

           (b) A case or proceeding is commenced against Borrower seeking a
decree or order in respect of Borrower (i) under the Bankruptcy Code, as now
constituted or hereafter amended or any other applicable federal, state or
foreign bankruptcy or other similar law, (ii) appointing a custodian, receiver,
liquidator, assignee, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) for Borrower
or for any substantial part of any Borrower's assets, or (iii) ordering the
winding-up or liquidation of the affairs of Borrower, and such case or
proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for sixty (60) days or more or a
decree or order granting the relief sought in such case or proceeding is entered
by a court of competent jurisdiction.

           (c) Borrower (i) files a petition seeking relief under the Bankruptcy
Code, or any other applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy or other
similar law, (ii) consents to or fails to contest in a timely and appropriate
manner the institution of proceedings thereunder or the filing of any such
petition or the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver,
liquidator, assignee, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) for Borrower
or for any substantial part of its assets, (iii) makes an assignment for the
benefit of creditors, (iv) takes any action in furtherance of any of the
foregoing, or (v) admits in writing its inability to, or is generally unable to,
pay its debts as such debts become due.

           (d) Borrower shall become an "investment company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     7.2. Remedies.

           (a) If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender
may, without notice, take any or all of the following actions: (i) declare all
or any portion of the Obligations, including all or any portion of any Term Loan
to be forthwith due and payable, all without presentment, demand, protest or
further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower;
provided that Lender may not take any such action in respect of an Event of
Default described in clause (a) of Section 7.1; (ii) terminate its commitment to
make Additional Incremental Term Loans; or (iii) exercise any rights and
remedies provided to Lender under the Loan Documents or at law or equity,
including all remedies provided under the Code; provided, however, that upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.1(b) or (c), all of
the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable without declaration,
notice or demand by any Person.

          (b) Subject to clause (c) below, the rights and remedies of Borrower
and Lender under this Agreement shall be cumulative and nonexclusive of any

law or otherwise. Without impairing any Lien granted to Lender, in the event of
Borrower's failure to pay when due any principal of, or accrued and unpaid
interest on, any Term Loan, Lender's recourse for such failure shall be solely
against the Collateral and Lender shall not seek any personal money judgment
(including for any deficiency arising out of a failure to realize sufficient
proceeds from the Collateral) against Borrower. The provisions of the preceding
sentence shall not apply to any Obligations other than the principal of, and
accrued and unpaid interest on, the Term Loans.

          (c) The limitations on Lender's ability to seek recourse or a

the extent, and only to the extent, that the validity, priority or
enforceability of Lender's Lien in any of the Financing Contracts constituting
part of the Portfolio or proceeds thereof either (i) is being challenged in a
proceeding by any Person (other than the JV, the Lender or an Affiliate of
Lender or (ii) has been found to be invalid, junior, unenforceable or is
otherwise terminated, modified, limited or impaired by a nonappealable order of
a court of competent jurisdiction (other than by reason of acts or omissions of
Lender, including, without limitation, the failure to file any required
continuation statement); provided that to the extent that (A) the limitation in
clause (b) above is not applicable for a period of time pursuant to subclause
(i) of this clause (c), (B) the challenge providing the basis for such
inapplicability is ultimately unsuccessful and (C) during such period the Lender
has received and applied to the Term Loans payments from Obligors to which
Lender would not have been entitled but for this clause (c), then Lender shall
refund to Borrower within five (5) Business Days after the date such challenge
is defeated and becomes nonappealable or is otherwise formally and permanently
abandoned an amount equal to the excess of (X) the payments so received and
applied over (Y) the aggregate amount of Lease Payments and Installment Payments
paid by Obligors during such period which have not and will not be received by
Lender; provided Lender shall have no obligation to bring any action against any
third party to enforce its rights to receive such Lease Payments or Installment
Payments.

     7.3. Waivers by Borrower.

           Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable
law, Borrower waives: (a) presentment, demand and protest and notice of

benefit of all valuation, appraisal and exemption laws.

     8.1. Successors and Assigns.

           (a) Binding on Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of Borrower,

provided herein or therein.

           (b) No Assignment by Borrower. Borrower may not assign, transfer,
hypothecate or otherwise convey its rights, benefits, obligations or duties

written consent of Lender. Any such purported assignment, transfer,
hypothecation or other conveyance by Borrower without the prior


                                       37

<PAGE>

express written consent of Lender shall be void.

provided that, so long as no GE Capital Termination Event based in whole or in
part on the breach of Section 8.02(a)(iv) of the Program Agreement has occurred,
Lender shall not assign or participate any such rights or obligations to any
Person that directly engages in competition with Xerox in respect of the
marketing or selling (other than retail marketing or selling) of document
processing and imaging goods (and products ancillary thereto as part of a
document solutions system); provided further that Lender shall not assign any of
its rights and obligations (or any interest therein) with respect to outstanding
Additional Incremental Term Loans to any Person (other than an Affiliate of
Lender) unless Lender first complies with the provisions of this Section 8.1(d).

               (i) Lender shall first offer to assign or participate such
Additional Incremental Term Loans ( or an interest therein) to Xerox by delivery
to Xerox of a written offer to sell such Additional Incremental Term Loans
setting forth the price and other terms that Lender then intends to offer to
third parties.

              (ii) If (A) within ten (10) Business Days of delivery of such
notice Xerox does not agree to purchase all of the Additional Incremental Term
Loans (or interest) specified in such notice at the price and on the terms set
forth therein or (B) within 10 (ten) Business Days after Xerox does so agree,
such purchase is not consummated, then Lender may offer such Additional
Incremental Term Loans (or interest) to third parties at the price and on the
terms specified in the notice.

             (iii) If all such Additional Incremental Terms Loans (or interests
therein) are not assigned or participated at the price and on the terms
specified in the notice, then Lender shall be entitled to offer such Additional
Incremental Term Loans (or interest therein) to third parties, and Xerox shall
be entitled to bid for such Additional Incremental Term Loans (or interest
therein) on the same basis as such third parties, and Lender shall be entitled
to negotiate with respect to, and ultimately dispose of, such Additional
Incremental Term Loans (or interest therein) on such terms and such price (which
may be higher or lower than the price and terms initially offered to Xerox) as
Lender may in its sole discretion determine is in its interest so long as Lender
does not act arbitrarily or capriciously in making such determination.

              (iv) Xerox is a third party beneficiary of this Section

8.1(d).

           (e) General Electric Capital Corporation to be Agent for Assignees.

Loans during the pendency of one or more Events of Default; provided that no
Person shall be entitled to reimbursement under this clause (b) in respect of

and results from such Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct, violation
of law, breach of warranty under a Loan Document or such Person's failure to

     9.4. No Waiver.

           Lender's failure, at any time or times, to require strict




                                       40

<PAGE>

performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of Lender thereafter to
demand strict compliance and performance herewith or therewith. Any suspension
or waiver of an Event of Default shall not suspend, waive or affect any other
Event of Default whether the same is prior or subsequent thereto and whether the
same or of a different type. None of the undertakings, agreements, warranties,
covenants and representations of Borrower contained in this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents and no Default or Event of Default by Borrower shall be
deemed to have been suspended or waived by Lender, unless such waiver or
suspension is by an instrument in writing signed by an officer of or other
authorized employee of Lender and directed to Borrower specifying such
suspension or waiver.

     9.5. Severability.

           Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions
of this Agreement or such other Loan Document.

     9.6. Conflict of Terms.

           Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents by specific reference to the applicable provisions of this
Agreement, if any provision contained in this Agreement conflicts with any
provision in any of the other Loan Documents, the provision contained in this
Agreement shall govern and control.

     9.7. Confidentiality.

           Lender agrees that all Confidential Information will be kept
confidential by Lender and its Representatives and will not be (a) disclosed by
Lender or its Representatives to any Person whomsoever or (b) used by Lender or
its Representatives, in each case, except with the prior written consent of
Borrower or except as expressly otherwise permitted by the terms of this Section
9.7, Article 18 of the JV Agreement, Section 2(b) of the Retained Business
Servicing Agreement or Section 2(d)(vi) of the Portfolio Service Agreement.
Neither Lender nor its Representatives will use the Confidential Information for
any reason or purpose other than in connection with (i) the performance,
monitoring or administration of this Agreement, (ii) the enforcement of Lender's
rights and remedies hereunder or under the other Related Transaction Documents
and (iii) participations or assignments of the Term Loans as provided in Section
8.1; provided, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to any
potential assignee or participant, such assignee or participant shall agree (in
a manner that is enforceable by Borrower) that it will use any Confidential
Information delivered to it solely to evaluate its potential purchase of an
assignment or participation and shall agree that it shall not (i) disclose or
make available, without the prior written consent of Borrower, any Confidential
Information (including information relating to any Obligor under any Financing
Contract (including information relating to the pricing of or the provisions of
any such Financing Contract) or (ii) use any Confidential Information to
identify and directly or indirectly solicit any type of business with any
Obligor. Lender also agrees to be responsible for


                                       41

<PAGE>

enforcing the terms of this Section 9.7 as to its Representatives and the
maintenance of the confidentiality of the Confidential Information by Lender and
its Representatives and to take such action, legal or otherwise, to the extent
necessary to cause such Representatives to comply with the terms and conditions
of this Section 9.7 and thereby prevent any improper disclosure or misuse of the
Confidential Information by any of Lender's Representatives (including all
actions that Lender would take to protect its own confidential information).

     9.8. GOVERNING LAW.

           EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS,
IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN THAT STATE AND ANY APPLICABLE
LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BORROWER HEREBY CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT
THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY, CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW
YORK SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR
DISPUTES BETWEEN BORROWER AND LENDER PERTAINING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

     9.10. Section Titles.

            The Section titles and Table of Contents contained in this Agreement
are and shall be without substantive meaning or content of any kind whatsoever
and are not a part of the agreement between the parties hereto.

     9.11. Counterparts.

            This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate
counterparts, each of which shall collectively and separately constitute one
agreement.

     9.12. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

            BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL
TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND
EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY
(RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE
RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE
BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, THE
PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED
TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED AMONG THEM IN CONNECTION WITH,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
THERETO.

     9.13. Press Releases and Related Matters.

            Borrower agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates will in the
future issue any press releases or other public disclosure using the name of
Lender or its Affiliates or referring to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or the other Related Transactions Documents without at least two (2)
Business Days' prior notice to Lender and without the prior written consent of
Lender unless (and only to the extent that) such Borrower or Affiliate thereof
is required to do so under law and then, in any event, such Borrower or
Affiliate thereof will consult with Lender before issuing such press release or
other public disclosure. Borrower consents to the publication by Lender of a
tombstone or similar advertising material relating to the financing transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Lender shall provide a draft of such tombstone
or similar advertising material to Borrower for review and comment prior to the
publication thereof. Lender reserves the right to provide to industry trade
organizations information necessary and customary for inclusion in league table
measurements.


                                       44

<PAGE>

     9.14. Reinstatement.

            This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and continue to
be effective should any petition be filed by or against Borrower for liquidation
or reorganization, should Borrower become insolvent or make an assignment for
the benefit of any creditor or creditors or should a receiver or trustee be
appointed for all or any significant part of Borrower's assets, and shall
continue to be effective or to be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
payment and performance of the Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to
applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or
returned by any obligee of the Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference,"
"fraudulent conveyance," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance
had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned (whether pursuant to the conditions or
circumstances described above or as a result of Lender's being required pursuant
to the Allocation Agreement to return any amounts applied to the Obligations as
a result of such amounts constituting Misdirected Xerox Proceeds or Misapplied
Proceeds), the Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such
amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

     9.15.  Advice of Counsel

            Each of the parties represents to each other party hereto that it
has discussed this Agreement and, specifically, the provisions of Sections 9.8
and 9.12, with its counsel.

     9.16. No Strict Construction.

            The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

     9.17. Survival of Obligations Upon Termination of Financing Arrangements.

            Except as otherwise expressly provided for in the Loan Documents, no
termination or cancellation (regardless of cause or procedure) of any financing
arrangement under this Agreement shall in any way affect or impair the
obligations, duties and liabilities of Borrower or the rights of Lender relating
to any unpaid portion of the Term Loans or any other Obligations, due or not
due, liquidated, contingent or unliquidated or any transaction or event
occurring prior to such termination, or any transaction or event, the
performance of which is required after the Termination Date. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or in any other Loan Document, all undertakings,
agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of or binding upon
Borrower, and all rights of Lender, all as contained in the Loan Documents,
shall not terminate or expire, but rather shall survive any such termination or
cancellation and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination
Date; provided, that the provisions of Article IX, the payment obligations under
Section 1.7, and the indemnities contained in the Loan Documents shall survive
the Termination Date.


                                       45

<PAGE>

     9.18. Non-Business Days.

            If the payment of any Obligation becomes due and payable, or the
performance of any covenant, undertaking or agreement is to be performed, on a
day other than a Business Day, the date for payment or performance thereof will
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
Obligations, interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable Discount Rate.

     9.19. Effect of Amendment and Restatement.

            (a) On the Effective Date, the Existing Loan Agreement shall be
amended and restated in its entirety by this Agreement and the Existing Loan
Agreement shall thereafter be of no further force and effect except to evidence
(i) the incurrence by Borrower of the "Obligations" under and as defined in the
Existing Loan Agreement (whether or not such "Obligations" are contingent as of
the Effective Date), (ii) the representations and warranties made by Borrower
prior to the Effective Date and (iii) any action or omission performed or
required to be performed pursuant to such Existing Loan Agreement prior to the
Effective Date (including any failure, prior to the Effective Date, to comply
with the covenants contained in such Existing Loan Agreement). The amendments
and restatements set forth herein shall not cure any breach of the Existing Loan
Agreement existing prior to the Effective Date. This Agreement is not in any way
intended to constitute a novation of the obligations and liabilities existing
under the Existing Loan Agreement or evidence payment of all or any portion of
such obligations and liabilities.

            (b) The terms and conditions of this Agreement and Lender's rights
and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall apply to
all of the Obligations incurred under the Existing Loan Agreement and the
promissory notes issued thereunder.

            (c) Borrower reaffirms the Liens granted pursuant to the Loan
Documents to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lender, which Liens
shall continue in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement and
any renewals thereof and shall continue to secure the Obligations.

            (d) On and after the Effective Date, (i) all references to the
Existing Loan Agreement (or to any amendment or any amendment and restatement
thereof) in the Loan Documents (other than this Agreement) shall be deemed to
refer to the Existing Loan Agreement as amended and restated hereby, (ii) all
references to any section (or subsection) of the Existing Loan Agreement or in
any Loan Document (but not herein) shall be amended to become, mutatis mutandis,
references to the corresponding provisions of this Agreement and (iii) except as
the context otherwise provides, on or after the Effective Date, all references
to this Agreement herein (including for purposes of indemnification) shall be
deemed to be references to the Existing Loan Agreement as amended and restated
hereby.

            (e) This amendment and restatement is limited as written and except
as set forth in clause (f) below is not a consent to any other amendment,
restatement or waiver, whether or not similar and, except as expressly provided
herein or in any other Loan Document, all terms and conditions of the Loan
Documents remain in full force and effect unless otherwise specifically amended
hereby or any other Loan Document.

            (f) Lender hereby consents to the amendment and restatement, as


                                       46

of the Effective Date, of each of the documents listed on Schedule 9.19(f)
hereto each in the form and substance executed by (or in the case of any such
documents to which Lender is not a party, a fully executed copy thereof was
delivered to) Lender on the Effective Date.
