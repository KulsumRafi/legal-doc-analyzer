        This Pooling and Servicing Agreement,  effective as of December 1, 2002,
among RESIDENTIAL ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC., as the depositor (together with
its permitted  successors and assigns,  the  "Depositor"),  RESIDENTIAL  FUNDING
CORPORATION,  as master  servicer  (together  with its permitted  successors and
assigns, the "Master Servicer"), and DEUTSCHE BANK TRUST COMPANY AMERICAS, a New
York banking corporation, as trustee (together with its permitted successors and
assigns, the "Trustee").

                                    PRELIMINARY STATEMENT:

        The  Depositor  intends  to  sell  mortgage  asset-backed   pass-through
certificates  (collectively,  the  "Certificates"),  to be issued  hereunder  in

ownership interest in the Mortgage Loans (as defined herein).

                                     REMIC I

        As provided  herein,  the REMIC  Administrator  will make an election to
treat the segregated pool of assets  consisting of the Group I Loans and certain
other  related  assets  subject  to this  Agreement  as a real  estate  mortgage
investment  conduit  (a  "REMIC")  for  federal  income tax  purposes,  and such
segregated  pool of  assets  will be  designated  as  "REMIC  I." The  Class R-I
Certificates  will  represent the sole class of "residual  interests" in REMIC I

tax law. The following table irrevocably sets forth the designation,  remittance
rate (the "Uncertificated REMIC I Pass-Through Rate") and initial Uncertificated

        Section  1.01 Definitions.

        Whenever used in this Agreement, the following words and phrases, unless
the  context  otherwise  requires,  shall have the  meanings  specified  in this
Article.

        Accrued Certificate Interest: With respect to each Distribution Date, as
to any Class of Certificates  (other than the Class AP-I  Certificates and Class
AP-II  Certificates),  interest  accrued during the preceding  Interest  Accrual
Period at the related Pass-Through Rate on the Certificate  Principal Balance or
Notional Amount thereof  immediately  prior to such Distribution  Date.  Accrued
Certificate  Interest  will  be  calculated  on the  basis  of a  360-day  year,
consisting of twelve 30-day months. In each case Accrued Certificate Interest on
any Class of  Certificates  (other  than the Class AP-I  Certificates  and Class
AP-II Certificates) will be reduced by the amount of:

               (i) Prepayment  Interest  Shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans in the
        related Loan Group (to the extent not offset by the Master Servicer with
        Compensating Interest as provided in Section 3.16(e)),

               (ii) the interest portion  (adjusted to the Net Mortgage Rate (or
        the Modified Net Mortgage  Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan
        in the related  Loan Group)) of Excess  Special  Hazard  Losses,  Excess
        Fraud Losses,  Excess Bankruptcy Losses and Extraordinary  Losses on the
        Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group, to the extent allocated to the
        related Certificates,

               (iii)  the  interest  portion  of  Advances  that  were made with
        respect to  delinquencies  that were ultimately  determined to be Excess
        Special Hazard Losses,  Excess Fraud Losses, Excess Bankruptcy Losses or
        Extraordinary  Losses on the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group to
        the extent allocated to the related Certificates, and

               (iv) any other  interest  shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans in the
        related  Loan Group not  covered by the  subordination  provided  by the
        related Class M Certificates and related Class B Certificates, including
        interest  that is not  collectible  from the  Mortgagor  pursuant to the
        Relief Act or similar  legislation or regulations as in effect from time
        to  time,  with  all  such   reductions   allocated  among  all  of  the
        Certificates  in  proportion  to their  respective  amounts  of  Accrued
        Certificate  Interest  payable on such  Distribution  Date  absent  such
        reductions.  In addition to that portion of the reductions  described in
        the preceding  sentence that are allocated to any related Class of Class
        B  Certificates  or any related Class of Class M  Certificates,  Accrued
        Certificate Interest on such Class of Class B Certificates or such Class
        of  Class  M  Certificates  will  be  reduced  by the  interest  portion
        (adjusted  to the  Net  Mortgage  Rate)  of  Realized  Losses  that  are
        allocated  solely to such Class of Class B Certificates or such Class of
        Class M Certificates pursuant to Section 4.05.

Mortgage  Loan and either (A) the related  Mortgage  Loan is not in default with
regard to payments due  thereunder or (B)  delinquent  payments of principal and
interest  under the related  Mortgage  Loan and any  premiums on any  applicable
primary hazard  insurance  policy and any related escrow  payments in respect of
such Mortgage Loan are being advanced on a current basis by the Master  Servicer
or a  Subservicer,  in either case  without  giving  effect to any Debt  Service
Reduction.

        Subordinate  Certificates in the related  certificate group in an amount
        greater than the remaining  Certificate  Principal  Balance thereof (any

        (c) The Depositor  may, in lieu of delivering the documents set forth in
Section  2.01(b)(I)(ii),  (iii),  (iv) and (v) and  Section  (b)(II)(ii),  (iv),

documents  in  trust  for  the  use  and  benefit  of  all  present  and  future

Days  following  the  earlier of (i) the  receipt of the  original of all of the

permitted by such Section) for any Mortgage  Loan and (ii) a written  request by
the  Trustee  to  deliver  those  documents  with  respect  to any or all of the
Mortgage Loans then being held by the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer shall
deliver a complete  set of such  documents  to the Trustee or the  Custodian  or
Custodians  that are the duly appointed  agent or agents of the Trustee.  On the
Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall certify that it has in its possession an
original or copy of each of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(b)(I)(ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v) and Section (b)(II)(ii), (iv), (vii), (ix) and (x) which has
been delivered to it by the Depositor.

        (d) In  connection  with any  Mortgage  Loan,  if the  Depositor  cannot
deliver the Mortgage,  any  assignment,  modification,  assumption  agreement or
preferred loan agreement (or copy thereof as permitted by Section  2.01(b)) with
evidence of recording  thereon  concurrently  with the execution and delivery of
this  Agreement  because of (i) a delay  caused by the public  recording  office
where such Mortgage, assignment, modification, assumption agreement or preferred
loan agreement as the case may be, has been delivered for recordation, or (ii) a
delay in the  receipt of certain  information  necessary  to prepare the related
assignments, the Depositor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee
or the respective Custodian a copy of such Mortgage,  assignment,  modification,
assumption agreement or preferred loan agreement.

        The Depositor  shall  promptly  cause to be recorded in the  appropriate
public office for real  property  records the  Assignment  referred to in clause
(I)(iii)  of Section  2.01(b),  except (a) in states  where,  in the  opinion of
counsel acceptable to the Trustee and the Master Servicer, such recording is not
required to protect the Trustee's  interests in the Mortgage Loan or (b) if MERS
is  identified  on the  Mortgage  or on a properly  recorded  assignment  of the
Mortgage as the  mortgagee of record solely as nominee for  Residential  Funding
and its  successors  and assigns,  and shall promptly cause to be filed the Form
UCC-3 assignment and UCC-1 financing  statement  referred to in clause (II)(vii)
and (x), respectively, of Section 2.01(b). If any Assignment, Form UCC-3 or Form
UCC-1, as applicable, is lost or returned unrecorded to the Depositor because of
any defect therein, the


                                              58

<PAGE>



Depositor  shall prepare a substitute  Assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form UCC-1, as
applicable,  or cure such defect,  as the case may be, and cause such Assignment
to be recorded in accordance with this  paragraph.  The Depositor shall promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the respective Custodian such
Mortgage  or  assignment,  Form UCC-3 or Form  UCC-1,  as  applicable,  (or copy
thereof as permitted by Section  2.01(b)) with  evidence of recording  indicated
thereon  upon  receipt  thereof  from the  public  recording  office or from the
related Subservicer.  In connection with its servicing of Cooperative Loans, the
Master Servicer will use its best efforts to file timely continuation statements
with regard to each financing  statement and assignment  relating to Cooperative
Loans as to which the related  Cooperative  Apartment is located  outside of the
State of New York.

        If the Depositor  delivers to the Trustee or Custodian any Mortgage Note
or Assignment  of Mortgage in blank,  the  Depositor  shall,  or shall cause the
Custodian to,  complete the  endorsement of the Mortgage Note and the Assignment
of  Mortgage  in the  name  of the  Trustee  in  conjunction  with  the  Interim
Certification issued by the Custodian, as contemplated by Section 2.02.

        In connection with the assignment of any Mortgage Loan registered on the
MERS(R)  System,  the  Depositor  further  agrees  that  it will  cause,  at the
Depositor's  own  expense,  within 30 days after the Closing  Date,  the MERS(R)
System to indicate that such Mortgage  Loans have been assigned by the Depositor
to the  Trustee  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement  for the  benefit  of the
Certificateholders  by including  (or  deleting,  in the case of Mortgage  Loans
which are  repurchased in accordance with this Agreement) in such computer files
(a) the code in the field which identifies the specific Trustee and (b) the code
in the field "Pool Field" which identifies the series of the Certificates issued
in connection  with such Mortgage  Loans.  The Depositor  further agrees that it
will not, and will not permit the Master  Servicer  to, and the Master  Servicer
agrees  that it will not,  alter the codes  referenced  in this  paragraph  with
respect to any Mortgage Loan during the term of this Agreement  unless and until
such  Mortgage  Loan  is  repurchased  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of this
Agreement.

        (e) It is intended that the  conveyances by the Depositor to the Trustee
of the  Mortgage  Loans as provided  for in this  Section 2.01 be construed as a
sale by the  Depositor to the Trustee of the  Mortgage  Loans for the benefit of
the Certificateholders.  Further, it is not intended that any such conveyance be
deemed to be a pledge of the Mortgage  Loans by the  Depositor to the Trustee to
secure a debt or other obligation of the Depositor.  However,  in the event that
the Mortgage  Loans are held to be property of the  Depositor or of  Residential
Funding,  or if for any  reason  this  Agreement  is held or  deemed to create a
security  interest in the  Mortgage  Loans,  then it is  intended  that (a) this
Agreement shall also be deemed to be a security  agreement within the meaning of
Articles  8 and 9 of the New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code  and  the  Uniform
Commercial  Code of any  other  applicable  jurisdiction;  (b)  the  conveyances
provided  for in this  Section  2.01  shall be  deemed  to be (1) a grant by the
Depositor to the Trustee of a security  interest in all of the Depositor's right
(including the power to convey title thereto),  title and interest,  whether now
owned or hereafter  acquired,  in and to (A) the Mortgage  Loans,  including (i)
with respect to each  Cooperative  Loan,  the related  Mortgage  Note,  Security
Agreement, Assignment of Proprietary Lease, Cooperative Stock


                                              59

Certificate and Cooperative Lease, (ii) with respect to each Mortgage Loan other
than a Cooperative Loan, the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage, (B) all amounts
payable  pursuant to the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms thereof and
(C) any and all general  intangibles  consisting of, arising from or relating to
any  of  the  foregoing,  and  all  proceeds  of the  conversion,  voluntary  or
involuntary,  of the  foregoing  into  cash,  instruments,  securities  or other
property,  including  without  limitation  all amounts from time to time held or
invested in the  Certificate  Account or the Custodial  Account,  whether in the
form of cash, instruments, securities or other property and (2) an assignment by
the  Depositor  to the  Trustee  of any  security  interest  in any  and  all of
Residential Funding's right (including the power to convey title thereto), title
and interest,  whether now owned or hereafter  acquired,  in and to the property
described in the foregoing  clauses  (1)(A),  (B) and (C) granted by Residential
Funding  to  the  Depositor  pursuant  to  the  Assignment  Agreement;  (c)  the
possession  by the Trustee,  the  Custodian or any other agent of the Trustee of
Mortgage Notes or such other items of property as constitute instruments, money,
negotiable  documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be  "possession by the
secured  party," or  possession  by a purchaser or a person  designated  by such
secured party, for purposes of perfecting the security  interest pursuant to the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the States of New York and Minnesota and
any other applicable jurisdiction; and (d) notifications to persons holding such
property,  and  acknowledgments,  receipts or confirmations from persons holding
such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, financial intermediaries,  bailees or agents (as applicable)
of the  Trustee for the  purpose of  perfecting  such  security  interest  under
applicable law.

        The Depositor and, at the Depositor's direction, Residential Funding and
the Trustee  shall,  to the extent  consistent  with this  Agreement,  take such
reasonable  actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this  Agreement  were
deemed  to  create a  security  interest  in the  Mortgage  Loans  and the other
property  described  above,  such  security  interest  would be  deemed  to be a
perfected  security  interest of first priority under applicable law and will be
maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement.  Without  limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  the  Depositor  shall prepare and deliver to the
Trustee  not less than 15 days prior to any filing date and,  the Trustee  shall
forward for filing, or shall cause to be forwarded for filing, at the expense of
the  Depositor,  all filings  necessary  to maintain  the  effectiveness  of any
original filings necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
jurisdiction  to  perfect  the  Trustee's  security  interest  in or lien on the
Mortgage  Loans as  evidenced  by an  Officers'  Certificate  of the  Depositor,
including  without  limitation (x) continuation  statements,  and (y) such other
statements  as may be  occasioned  by (1) any  change  of  name  of  Residential
Funding,  the Depositor or the Trustee (such  preparation and filing shall be at
the expense of the Trustee,  if occasioned  by a change in the Trustee's  name),
(2) any  change of  location  of the place of  business  or the chief  executive
office of  Residential  Funding  or the  Depositor  or (3) any  transfer  of any
interest of Residential Funding or the Depositor in any Mortgage Loan.

        (f)  Residential  Funding  hereby  assigns to the Trustee  its  security
interest in and to any Additional  Collateral,  its right to receive amounts due
or to become due in respect of any Additional Collateral pursuant to the related
Subservicing  Agreement and its rights as  beneficiary  under the Surety Bond in
respect of any  Additional  Collateral  Loans.  With  respect to any  Additional
Collateral Loan,  Residential Funding shall cause to be filed in the appropriate
recording office a

to the Trust Fund and shall  thereafter cause the timely filing of all necessary

Bond assigned to the Trustee  pursuant to Section 2.01, in trust for the use and
benefit of all present and future  Certificateholders.  The Trustee or Custodian
(such Custodian being so obligated under a Custodial  Agreement) agrees, for the
benefit of  Certificateholders,  to review each  Mortgage  File  delivered to it
pursuant to Section  2.01(b)  within 45 days after the Closing Date to ascertain
that all required documents (specifically as set forth in Section 2.01(b)), have
been executed and received, and that such documents relate to the Mortgage Loans
identified  on the  Mortgage  Loan  Schedule,  as  supplemented,  that have been
conveyed  to it, and to  deliver  to the  Trustee a  certificate  (the  "Interim
Certificate") to the effect that all documents required to be delivered pursuant
to Section 2.01(b) above have been executed and received and that such documents
relate to the Mortgage Loans  identified on the Mortgage Loan  Schedule,  except
for any exceptions listed on Schedule A attached to such Interim  Certification.
Upon delivery of the Mortgage Files by the Depositor or the Master Servicer, the
Trustee shall acknowledge receipt (or, with respect to Mortgage Loans subject to
a Custodial Agreement, and based solely upon a receipt or certification executed
by the  Custodian,  receipt by the  respective  Custodian as the duly  appointed
agent of the Trustee) of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(c) above. The
Trustee or  Custodian  (such  Custodian  being so  obligated  under a  Custodial
Agreement)  agrees to review  each  Mortgage  File  delivered  to it pursuant to
Section  2.01(c)  within 45 days after  receipt  thereof to  ascertain  that all
documents  required to be delivered pursuant to such Section have been received,
and that such documents  relate to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage
Loan Schedule, as supplemented, that have been conveyed to it.

        If  the  Custodian,  as the  Trustee's  agent,  finds  any  document  or
documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be missing or defective, the
Trustee, after receiving notice from the Custodian, shall promptly so notify the
Master Servicer and the Depositor;  provided,  that if the Mortgage Loan related
to such Mortgage File is listed on Schedule A of the  Assignment  Agreement,  no
notification  shall be  necessary.  Pursuant  to  Section  2.3 of the  Custodial
Agreement,  the Custodian will notify the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the
Trustee of any such  omission or defect  found by it in respect of any  Mortgage
File held by it. If such omission or defect materially and adversely affects the
interests in the related  Mortgage  Loan of the  Certificateholders,  the Master
Servicer shall


                                              61

<PAGE>



promptly  notify the related  Subservicer of such omission or defect and request
that such  Subservicer  correct or cure such  omission or defect  within 60 days
from the date the Master  Servicer was notified of such  omission or defect and,
if such Subservicer does not correct or cure such omission or defect within such
period, that such Subservicer purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at
its  Purchase  Price,  in either  case  within 90 days from the date the  Master
Servicer was notified of such omission or defect;  provided that if the omission
or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified  mortgage"
as defined in Section  860G(a)(3) of the Code, any such cure or repurchase  must
occur  within 90 days from the date such  breach was  discovered;  and  provided
further,  that no cure,  substitution  or  repurchase  shall be required if such
omission or defect is in respect of a Mortgage  Loan listed on Schedule A of the
Assignment  Agreement.  The Purchase  Price for any such  Mortgage Loan shall be
deposited  or caused to be  deposited  by the Master  Servicer in the  Custodial
Account  maintained  by it pursuant  to Section  3.07 and,  upon  receipt by the
Trustee of written  notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,
the Trustee or any  Custodian,  as the case may be, shall  release to the Master
Servicer the related  Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver
such instruments of transfer or assignment  prepared by the Master Servicer,  in
each case without recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the Subservicer or
its designee, as the case may be, any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto and
thereafter  such  Mortgage  Loan  shall  not be  part  of  the  Trust  Fund.  In
furtherance of the  foregoing,  if the  Subservicer or Residential  Funding that
repurchases  the  Mortgage  Loan is not a  member  of MERS and the  Mortgage  is
registered on the MERS(R) System,  the Master  Servicer,  at its own expense and
without any right of  reimbursement,  shall cause MERS to execute and deliver an
assignment of the Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS
to such  Subservicer or Residential  Funding and shall cause such Mortgage to be
removed from  registration  on the MERS(R) System in accordance with MERS' rules
and  regulations.  It is  understood  and  agreed  that  the  obligation  of the
Subservicer, to so cure or purchase any Mortgage Loan as to which a material and
adverse defect in or omission of a constituent  document exists shall constitute
the  sole   remedy   respecting   such   defect   or   omission   available   to
Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders.

     Section  2.03  Representations,  Warranties  and  Covenants  of the  Master
          Servicer and the Depositor.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  hereby  represents and warrants to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders that:

               (i) The Master Servicer is a corporation duly organized,  validly
        existing and in good standing  under the laws governing its creation and
        existence and is or will be in compliance with the laws of each state in
        which any  Mortgaged  Property  is located to the  extent  necessary  to
        ensure the  enforceability  of each Mortgage Loan in accordance with the
        terms of this Agreement;

               (ii) The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by the Master
        Servicer  and its  performance  and  compliance  with the  terms of this
        Agreement  will  not  violate  the  Master  Servicer's   Certificate  of
        Incorporation or Bylaws or constitute a material default (or an event


                                              62

<PAGE>



        which,  with  notice  or lapse of time,  or  both,  would  constitute  a
        material  default)  under,  or result in the  material  breach  of,  any
        material  contract,  agreement or other  instrument  to which the Master
        Servicer is a party or which may be applicable to the Master Servicer or
        any of its assets;

               (iii) This Agreement,  assuming due authorization,  execution and
        delivery by the Trustee and the  Depositor,  constitutes a valid,  legal
        and binding obligation of the Master Servicer, enforceable against it in
        accordance  with the terms  hereof  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,
        insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and other laws  affecting  the
        enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general  principles of
        equity,  regardless  of whether  such  enforcement  is  considered  in a
        proceeding in equity or at law;

               (iv) The Master  Servicer is not in default  with  respect to any
        order or decree of any court or any order,  regulation  or demand of any
        federal,  state,  municipal or governmental  agency, which default might
        have  consequences  that  would  materially  and  adversely  affect  the
        condition  (financial or other) or operations of the Master  Servicer or
        its  properties  or  might  have   consequences  that  would  materially
        adversely affect its performance hereunder;

               (v) No  litigation  is  pending  or,  to the  best of the  Master
        Servicer's knowledge, threatened against the Master Servicer which would
        prohibit its entering into this Agreement or performing its  obligations
        under this Agreement;

               (vi) The Master Servicer will comply in all material  respects in
        the  performance  of  this  Agreement  with  all  reasonable  rules  and
        requirements of each insurer under each Required Insurance Policy;

               (vii)  No  information,  certificate  of  an  officer,  statement
        furnished in writing or report delivered to the Depositor, any Affiliate
        of the  Depositor  or the Trustee by the Master  Servicer  will,  to the
        knowledge  of the Master  Servicer,  contain any untrue  statement  of a
        material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the information,
        certificate, statement or report not misleading;

               (viii) The Master  Servicer has examined each existing,  and will
        examine each new, Subservicing Agreement and is or will be familiar with
        the terms thereof. The terms of each existing Subservicing Agreement and
        each  designated  Subservicer  are acceptable to the Master Servicer and
        any new  Subservicing  Agreements  will  comply with the  provisions  of
        Section 3.02; and

               (ix) The Master  Servicer  is a member of MERS in good  standing,
        and will comply in all material  respects with the rules and  procedures
        of MERS in connection  with the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are
        registered with MERS.

     It is understood  and agreed that the  representations  and  warranties set
forth in this Section


                                              63

<PAGE>



2.03(a) shall survive  delivery of the respective  Mortgage Files to the Trustee
or any Custodian.

        Upon discovery by either the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee
or any Custodian of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Section  2.03(a) which  materially  and  adversely  affects the interests of the
Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall
give  prompt  written  notice  to the  other  parties  (any  Custodian  being so
obligated under a Custodial  Agreement).  Within 90 days of its discovery or its
receipt of notice of such breach, the Master Servicer shall either (i) cure such
breach in all  material  respects or (ii) to the extent that such breach is with
respect to a Mortgage  Loan or a related  document,  purchase such Mortgage Loan
from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the manner set forth in Section
2.02;  provided  that if the omission or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to
be other than a  "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the
Code,  any such cure or repurchase  must occur within 90 days from the date such
breach was discovered. The obligation of the Master Servicer to cure such breach
or to so purchase such Mortgage Loan shall constitute the sole remedy in respect
of a breach of a  representation  and warranty set forth in this Section 2.03(a)
available   to  the   Certificateholders   or  the  Trustee  on  behalf  of  the
Certificateholders.

        (b) The Depositor hereby  represents and warrants to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders  that as of the Closing Date (or, if otherwise
specified below, as of the date so specified):

               (i) The  information  set forth in Exhibit  F-1,  Exhibit F-2 and
        Exhibit F-3 hereto with  respect to each  Mortgage  Loan or the Mortgage
        Loans, as the case may be, is true and correct in all material  respects
        at the respective date or dates which such information is furnished;

               (ii) Immediately prior to the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans to
        the Trustee, the Depositor had good title to, and was the sole owner of,
        each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any pledge,  lien,  encumbrance  or
        security   interest   (other  than  rights  to  servicing   and  related
        compensation)  and such conveyance  validly  transfers  ownership of the
        Mortgage  Loans to the  Trustee  free and  clear  of any  pledge,  lien,
        encumbrance or security interest; and

               (iii) Each Mortgage Loan  constitutes a qualified  mortgage under
        Section  860G(a)(3)(A)  of the Code  and  Treasury  Regulations  Section
        1.860G-2(a)(1).

        It is understood and agreed that the  representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 2.03(b) shall survive delivery of the respective  Mortgage
Files to the Trustee or any Custodian.

        Upon discovery by any of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee
or any Custodian of a breach of any of the  representations  and  warranties set
forth in this  Section  2.03(b)  which  materially  and  adversely  affects  the
interests of the  Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering
such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties (any Custodian
being so obligated under a Custodial Agreement);  provided, however, that in the
event of a breach


                                              64

<PAGE>



of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 2.03(b)(iii),  the party
discovering  such breach shall give such notice  within five days of  discovery.
Within  90 days of its  discovery  or its  receipt  of  notice  of  breach,  the
Depositor  shall  either (i) cure such breach in all  material  respects or (ii)
purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price and in the
manner set forth in Section 2.02;  provided  that the  Depositor  shall have the
option to  substitute  a Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan or Loans for such
Mortgage Loan if such substitution occurs within two years following the Closing
Date;  provided  that if the omission or defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to
be other than a  "qualified  mortgage" as defined in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the
Code, any such cure,  substitution  or repurchase must occur within 90 days from
the date such breach was discovered.  Any such substitution shall be effected by
the  Depositor  under the same terms and  conditions as provided in Section 2.04
for substitutions by Residential  Funding.  It is understood and agreed that the
obligation  of the Depositor to cure such breach or to so purchase or substitute
for any Mortgage  Loan as to which such a breach has occurred and is  continuing
shall  constitute  the sole  remedy  respecting  such  breach  available  to the
Certificateholders   or  the  Trustee  on  behalf  of  the   Certificateholders.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Depositor  shall not be  required to cure
breaches  or  purchase  or  substitute  for  Mortgage  Loans as provided in this
Section  2.03(b) if the  substance of the breach of a  representation  set forth
above also constitutes fraud in the origination of the Mortgage Loan.

        Section  2.04 Representations and Warranties of Residential Funding.

        The Depositor,  as assignee of Residential  Funding under the Assignment
Agreement,   hereby   assigns   to  the   Trustee   for  the   benefit   of  the
Certificateholders  all of its  right,  title and  interest  in  respect  of the
Assignment  Agreement  applicable to a Mortgage Loan.  Insofar as the Assignment
Agreement  relates to the  representations  and  warranties  made by Residential
Funding in respect of such  Mortgage Loan and any remedies  provided  thereunder
for any breach of such  representations  and warranties,  such right,  title and
interest may be enforced by the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders.  Upon the discovery by the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,
the  Trustee  or any  Custodian  of a breach of any of the  representations  and
warranties  made in the Assignment  Agreement in respect of any Mortgage Loan or
of any Repurchase Event which materially and adversely  affects the interests of
the  Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach
shall give prompt written  notice to the other parties (any  Custodian  being so
obligated  under a Custodial  Agreement).  The Master  Servicer  shall  promptly
notify  Residential  Funding of such breach or Repurchase Event and request that
Residential  Funding  either  (i) cure such  breach or  Repurchase  Event in all
material  respects within 90 days from the date the Master Servicer was notified
of such breach or Repurchase  Event or (ii) purchase such Mortgage Loan from the
Trust Fund at the  Purchase  Price and in the manner set forth in Section  2.02;
provided that, in the case of a breach or Repurchase  Event under the Assignment
Agreement,  Residential  Funding shall have the option to substitute a Qualified
Substitute  Mortgage Loan or Loans for such  Mortgage Loan if such  substitution
occurs within two years following the Closing Date;  provided that if the breach
would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" as defined
in Section  860G(a)(3)  of the Code,  any such cure or  substitution  must occur
within 90 days  from the date the  breach  was  discovered.  In the  event  that
Residential Funding elects to substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans for a Deleted Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04,


                                              65

<PAGE>



Residential  Funding  shall  deliver  to the  Trustee  for  the  benefit  of the
Certificateholders  with respect to such Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage Loan or
Loans, the original  Mortgage Note, the Mortgage,  an Assignment of the Mortgage
in recordable  form, and such other  documents and agreements as are required by
Section  2.01,  with the Mortgage  Note endorsed as required by Section 2.01. No
substitution will be made in any calendar month after the Determination Date for
such month.  Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified  Substitute Mortgage
Loans in the month of substitution  shall not be part of the Trust Fund and will
be  retained  by the Master  Servicer  and  remitted  by the Master  Servicer to
Residential  Funding on the next succeeding  Distribution Date. For the month of
substitution,  distributions to the Certificateholders  will include the Monthly
Payment due on a Deleted Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter Residential
Funding  shall be  entitled  to retain all  amounts  received in respect of such
Deleted  Mortgage Loan.  The Master  Servicer shall amend or cause to be amended
the Mortgage  Loan  Schedule,  and, if the Deleted  Mortgage Loan was a Discount
Mortgage  Loan,  the  Schedule  of  Discount  Fractions,  for the benefit of the
Certificateholders  to reflect the removal of such Deleted Mortgage Loan and the
substitution of the Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage Loan or Loans and the Master
Servicer shall deliver the amended  Mortgage Loan Schedule,  and, if the Deleted
Mortgage Loan was a Group I Discount Mortgage Loan or Group II Discount Mortgage
Loan, the amended related Schedule of Discount Fractions,  to the Trustee.  Upon
such  substitution,  the  Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage Loan or Loans shall be
subject to the terms of this Agreement and the related Subservicing Agreement in
all  respects,  and  Residential  Funding  shall  be  deemed  to have  made  the
representations and warranties with respect to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan  contained  in  Section 4 of the  Assignment  Agreement,  as of the date of
substitution,  and the  covenants,  representations  and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.04, and in Section 2.03 hereof and in Section 4 of the Assignment
Agreement,  and  the  Master  Servicer  shall  be  obligated  to  repurchase  or
substitute for any Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage Loan as to which a Repurchase
Event (as defined in the Assignment  Agreement) has occurred pursuant to Section
4 of the Assignment  Agreement.  In connection  with the  substitution of one or
more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans,
the Master  Servicer  will  determine the amount (if any) by which the aggregate
principal balance of all such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date
of substitution is less than the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance of all such
Deleted Mortgage Loans (in each case after  application of the principal portion
of the  Monthly  Payments  due in  the  month  of  substitution  that  are to be
distributed to the Certificateholders in the month of substitution). Residential
Funding shall deposit the amount of such shortfall into the Custodial Account on
the day of substitution, without any reimbursement therefor. Residential Funding
shall give notice in writing to the Trustee of such event, which notice shall be
accompanied by an Officers'  Certificate as to the calculation of such shortfall
and by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such substitution will not cause
(a)  any  federal  tax  to be  imposed  on the  Trust  Fund,  including  without
limitation,  any federal tax imposed on "prohibited  transactions" under Section
860F(a)(1)  of the Code or on  "contributions  after  the  startup  date"  under
Section  860G(d)(1)  of the Code or (b) any portion of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC
III or REMIC IV to fail to qualify  as a REMIC at any time that any  Certificate
is outstanding.

        It is  understood  and agreed  that the  obligation  of the  Residential
Funding to cure such breach or purchase (or in the case of  Residential  Funding
to substitute for) such Mortgage Loan as to which


                                              66

<PAGE>



such a breach has occurred and is continuing  shall  constitute  the sole remedy
respecting  such breach  available to the  Certificateholders  or the Trustee on
behalf of the Certificateholders. If the Master Servicer is Residential Funding,
then the Trustee shall also have the right to give the  notification and require
the purchase or substitution  provided for in the second preceding  paragraph in
the event of such a breach of a  representation  or warranty made by Residential
Funding in the  Assignment  Agreement.  In  connection  with the  purchase of or
substitution  for any such Mortgage  Loan by  Residential  Funding,  the Trustee
shall  assign to  Residential  Funding all of the right,  title and  interest in
respect of the Assignment Agreement applicable to such Mortgage Loan.

     Section 2.05 Execution and  Authentication  of Certificates;  Conveyance of
          Uncertificated Regular Interests.

        (a) The Trustee  acknowledges the assignment to it of the Mortgage Loans
and the  delivery of the Mortgage  Files to it, or any  Custodian on its behalf,
subject to any exceptions noted, together with the assignment to it of all other
assets  included  in the Trust  Fund,  receipt of which is hereby  acknowledged.
Concurrently with such delivery and in exchange therefor, the Trustee,  pursuant
to the written request of the Depositor executed by an officer of the Depositor,
has executed and caused to be  authenticated  and delivered to or upon the order
of the Depositor the  Certificates  in authorized  denominations  which evidence
ownership of the entire Trust Fund.

        (b) The Depositor,  concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof,
does hereby  transfer,  assign,  set over and  otherwise  convey in trust to the
Trustee without recourse,  all the right, title and interest of the Depositor in
and to the REMIC I Regular  Interests,  the REMIC II Regular  Interests  and the
REMIC III  Regular  Interests  for the  benefit  of the  Holders of the REMIC IV
Regular  Interests and the Holders of the Class R-IV  Certificates.  The Trustee
acknowledges  receipt  of the REMIC I Regular  Interests,  the REMIC II  Regular
Interests and the REMIC III Regular Interests (each of which are uncertificated)
and declares that it holds and will hold the same in trust for the exclusive use
and benefit of the Holders of the REMIC IV Regular  Interests and Holders of the
Class R-IV Certificates. The interests evidenced by the Class R-IV Certificates,
together with the REMIC IV Regular  Interests,  constitute the entire beneficial
ownership interest in REMIC IV.

        (c) In exchange for the REMIC I Regular Interests,  the REMIC II Regular
Interests  and the  REMIC  III  Regular  Interests  and,  concurrently  with the
assignment  to the  Trustee  thereof,  pursuant  to the  written  request of the
Depositor  executed by an officer of the  Depositor,  the Trustee has  executed,
authenticated  and delivered to or upon the order of the Depositor,  the Regular
Certificates  in authorized  denominations  evidencing  (together with the Class
R-IV Certificates) the entire beneficial ownership interest in REMIC IV.

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                                OF MORTGAGE LOANS

        Section  3.01 Master Servicer to Act as Servicer.

        (a) The Master  Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans
in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement  and the  respective  Mortgage
Loans,  following such  procedures as it would employ in its good faith business
judgment  and  which are  normal  and usual in its  general  mortgage  servicing
activities,  and shall have full power and  authority,  acting  alone or through
Subservicers  as provided in Section 3.02, to do any and all things which it may
deem   necessary  or   desirable  in   connection   with  such   servicing   and
administration.  Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  the Master
Servicer in its own name or in the name of a  Subservicer  is hereby  authorized
and empowered by the Trustee when the Master Servicer or the Subservicer, as the
case may be,  believes  it  appropriate  in its best  judgment,  to execute  and
deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee or any of them, any
and all  instruments  of  satisfaction  or  cancellation,  or of partial or full
release or discharge,  or of consent to assumption or modification in connection
with a proposed  conveyance,  or of assignment of any Mortgage and Mortgage Note
in connection  with the  repurchase of a Mortgage Loan and all other  comparable
instruments,  or with respect to the  modification or re-recording of a Mortgage
for the purpose of correcting the Mortgage, the subordination of the lien of the
Mortgage in favor of a public utility company or government  agency or unit with
powers of  eminent  domain,  the  taking of a deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  the
completion  of  judicial  or  non-judicial  foreclosure,  the  conveyance  of  a
Mortgaged  Property to the related  insurer,  the  acquisition  of any  property
acquired  by  foreclosure  or deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  or the  management,
marketing and conveyance of any property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu
of  foreclosure  with  respect  to the  Mortgage  Loans and with  respect to the
Mortgaged Properties. The Master Servicer further is authorized and empowered by
the Trustee,  on behalf of the  Certificateholders  and the Trustee,  in its own
name  or in the  name  of the  Subservicer,  when  the  Master  Servicer  or the
Subservicer, as the case may be, believes it is appropriate in its best judgment
to register any Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)  System,  or cause the removal from
the  registration  of any Mortgage  Loan on the MERS(R)  System,  to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders or any of them, any
and all instruments of assignment and other comparable  instruments with respect
to such assignment or re-recording of a Mortgage in the name of MERS,  solely as
nominee for the Trustee and its successors and assigns. Any expenses incurred in
connection with the actions  described in the preceding  sentence shall be borne
by the Master  Servicer in  accordance  with Section  3.16(c),  with no right of
reimbursement;  provided, that if, as a result of MERS discontinuing or becoming
unable to continue  operations  in connection  with the MERS System,  it becomes
necessary to remove any Mortgage Loan from  registration  on the MERS System and
to arrange for the assignment of the related Mortgages to the Trustee,  then any
related expenses shall be reimbursable to the Master  Servicer.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  subject to Section 3.07(a), the Master Servicer shall not permit
any modification  with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would both constitute a
sale or exchange of such Mortgage Loan within the meaning of


                                              68

<PAGE>



Section  1001 of the  Code and any  proposed,  temporary  or  final  regulations
promulgated  thereunder (other than in connection with a proposed  conveyance or
assumption of such  Mortgage  Loan that is treated as a Principal  Prepayment in
Full  pursuant  to Section  3.13(d)  hereof) and cause any of REMIC I, REMIC II,
REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code.  The Trustee
shall  furnish  the  Master  Servicer  with any  powers  of  attorney  and other
documents  necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to service and
administer  the Mortgage  Loans.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action
taken by the Master  Servicer  or any  Subservicer  pursuant  to such  powers of
attorney.  In servicing and administering any Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, the
Master  Servicer  shall,  to the extent not  inconsistent  with this  Agreement,
comply with the Program Guide as if it were the originator of such Mortgage Loan
and had retained the servicing  rights and  obligations in respect  thereof.  In
connection  with  servicing and  administering  the Mortgage  Loans,  the Master
Servicer and any Affiliate of the Master Servicer (i) may perform  services such
as appraisals and brokerage  services that are  customarily  provided by Persons
other than  servicers  of mortgage  loans,  and shall be entitled to  reasonable
compensation  therefor in accordance  with Section 3.10 and (ii) may, at its own
discretion and on behalf of the Trustee,  obtain credit  information in the form
of a "credit score" from a credit repository.

        (b) All costs  incurred  by the Master  Servicer or by  Subservicers  in
effecting the timely payment of taxes and assessments on the properties  subject
to the  Mortgage  Loans  shall  not,  for the  purpose  of  calculating  monthly
distributions to the Certificateholders,  be added to the amount owing under the
related Mortgage Loans,  notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so
permit,  and such costs shall be recoverable to the extent  permitted by Section
3.10(a)(ii).

        (c) The  Master  Servicer  may  enter  into  one or more  agreements  in
connection with the offering of pass-through  certificates  evidencing interests
in one or more of the  Certificates  providing  for the  payment  by the  Master
Servicer of amounts  received by the Master  Servicer as servicing  compensation
hereunder and required to cover certain  Prepayment  Interest  Shortfalls on the
Mortgage Loans, which payment obligation will thereafter be an obligation of the
Master Servicer hereunder.

        Section       3.02 Subservicing  Agreements  Between Master Servicer and
                      Subservicers;  Enforcement of  Subservicers'  Obligations;
                      Special Servicing.

        (a) The Master Servicer may continue in effect  Subservicing  Agreements
entered into by Residential  Funding and Subservicers prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement,  and may enter into new Subservicing Agreements with
Subservicers,  for  the  servicing  and  administration  of all or  some  of the
Mortgage Loans. Each Subservicer shall be either (i) an institution the accounts
of which are  insured by the FDIC or (ii)  another  entity  that  engages in the
business of originating or servicing mortgage loans, and in either case shall be
authorized  to  transact  business  in the state or states in which the  related
Mortgaged  Properties  it is to  service  are  situated,  if and  to the  extent
required by applicable law to enable the  Subservicer to perform its obligations
hereunder and under the  Subservicing  Agreement,  and in either case shall be a
Freddie Mac,  Fannie Mae or HUD approved  mortgage  servicer.  In addition,  any
Subservicer of a Mortgage Loan insured by the FHA


                                              69

<PAGE>



must  be an  FHA-approved  servicer,  and any  Subservicer  of a  Mortgage  Loan
guaranteed  by the VA must be a  VA-approved  servicer.  Each  Subservicer  of a
Mortgage  Loan shall be  entitled  to receive  and  retain,  as  provided in the
related Subservicing Agreement and in Section 3.07, the related Subservicing Fee
from  payments of interest  received on such  Mortgage Loan after payment of all
amounts  required  to be  remitted  to the  Master  Servicer  in respect of such
Mortgage Loan. For any Mortgage Loan that is a Nonsubserviced Mortgage Loan, the
Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to receive and retain an amount equal to the
Subservicing  Fee from  payments  of  interest.  Unless  the  context  otherwise
requires,  references  in this  Agreement to actions taken or to be taken by the
Master  Servicer in servicing the Mortgage Loans include  actions taken or to be
taken by a  Subservicer  on behalf of the  Master  Servicer.  Each  Subservicing
Agreement will be upon such terms and  conditions as are generally  required by,
permitted by or consistent with the Program Guide and are not inconsistent  with
this Agreement and as the Master Servicer and the Subservicer have agreed.  With
the approval of the Master  Servicer,  a Subservicer  may delegate its servicing
obligations  to  third-  party  servicers,  but  such  Subservicer  will  remain
obligated under the related  Subservicing  Agreement.  The Master Servicer and a
Subservicer  may  enter  into   amendments   thereto  or  a  different  form  of
Subservicing  Agreement,  and the form  referred  to or  included in the Program
Guide is merely provided for information and shall not be deemed to limit in any
respect the discretion of the Master  Servicer to modify or enter into different
Subservicing  Agreements;   provided,  however,  that  any  such  amendments  or
different  forms shall be  consistent  with and not violate  the  provisions  of
either this  Agreement or the Program  Guide in a manner which would  materially
and adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders.

        (b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder,  the Master Servicer,
for the benefit of the Trustee  and the  Certificateholders,  shall use its best
reasonable  efforts to enforce the  obligations  of each  Subservicer  under the
related  Subservicing  Agreement,  to the extent that the non-performance of any
such  obligation  would have a material and adverse  effect on a Mortgage  Loan,
including,  without  limitation,  the  obligation to purchase a Mortgage Loan on
account of defective documentation,  as described in Section 2.02, or on account
of a breach of a representation or warranty,  as described in Section 2.04. Such
enforcement,  including,  without  limitation,  the legal prosecution of claims,
termination of Subservicing Agreements, as appropriate, and the pursuit of other
appropriate  remedies,  shall be in such form and  carried out to such an extent
and at such time as the Master  Servicer would employ in its good faith business
judgment  and  which are  normal  and usual in its  general  mortgage  servicing
activities.  The Master Servicer shall pay the costs of such  enforcement at its
own expense,  and shall be reimbursed  therefor only (i) from a general recovery
resulting  from such  enforcement  to the  extent,  if any,  that such  recovery
exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related  Mortgage  Loan or (ii) from a
specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys fees against the party against
whom such enforcement is directed.

        Section  3.03 Successor Subservicers.

        The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  terminate  any  Subservicing
Agreement  that may exist in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions of such
Subservicing  Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that  in the  event  of  termination  of  any  Subservicing
Agreement by the Master Servicer or the  Subservicer,  the Master Servicer shall
either act as servicer of the related Mortgage Loan or enter into a Subservicing
Agreement with a successor  Subservicer  which will be bound by the terms of the
related  Subservicing  Agreement.  If the Master  Servicer or any  Affiliate  of
Residential  Funding  acts as  servicer,  it will not assume  liability  for the
representations  and  warranties of the  Subservicer  which it replaces.  If the
Master  Servicer   enters  into  a  Subservicing   Agreement  with  a  successor
Subservicer,  the  Master  Servicer  shall use  reasonable  efforts  to have the
successor  Subservicer assume liability for the  representations  and warranties
made by the terminated Subservicer in respect of the related Mortgage Loans and,
in the event of any such  assumption  by the successor  Subservicer,  the Master
Servicer may, in the exercise of its business  judgment,  release the terminated
Subservicer from liability for such representations and warranties.

        Section  3.04 Liability of the Master Servicer.

        Notwithstanding  any  Subservicing  Agreement,  any of the provisions of
this  Agreement  relating  to  agreements  or  arrangements  between  the Master
Servicer or a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or
otherwise,  the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trustee
and Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage Loans
in accordance  with the  provisions  of Section 3.01 without  diminution of such
obligation   or  liability  by  virtue  of  such   Subservicing   Agreements  or
arrangements  or by  virtue  of  indemnification  from  the  Subservicer  or the
Depositor  and to the same extent and under the same terms and  conditions as if
the Master Servicer alone were servicing and  administering  the Mortgage Loans.
The  Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to enter  into any  agreement  with a
Subservicer for  indemnification of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

     Section 3.05 No Contractual Relationship Between Subservicer and Trustee or
          Certificateholders.

        Any  Subservicing  Agreement  that may be  entered  into  and any  other
transactions or services  relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Subservicer
in its capacity as such and not as an  originator  shall be deemed to be between
the   Subservicer   and  the  Master   Servicer   alone  and  the   Trustee  and
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights,  obligations,  duties or liabilities  with respect to the Subservicer in
its  capacity  as such  except  as set  forth in  Section  3.06.  The  foregoing
provision  shall  not in any way  limit a  Subservicer's  obligation  to cure an
omission or defect or to  repurchase  a Mortgage  Loan as referred to in Section
2.02 hereof.



                                              71

     Section 3.06  Assumption  or  Termination  of  Subservicing  Agreements  by
          Trustee.

        (a) In the event the Master  Servicer  shall for any reason no longer be
the master servicer  (including by reason of an Event of Default),  the Trustee,
its  designee  or its  successor  shall  thereupon  assume all of the rights and
obligations of the Master  Servicer under each  Subservicing  Agreement that may
have been entered into. The Trustee,  its designee or the successor servicer for
the  Trustee  shall be  deemed  to have  assumed  all of the  Master  Servicer's
interest  therein  and to have  replaced  the Master  Servicer as a party to the
Subservicing  Agreement to the same extent as if the Subservicing  Agreement had
been assigned to the assuming  party except that the Master  Servicer  shall not
thereby be relieved  of any  liability  or  obligations  under the  Subservicing
Agreement.

        (b) The Master  Servicer  shall,  upon request of the Trustee but at the
expense of the Master Servicer,  deliver to the assuming party all documents and
records  relating to each  Subservicing  Agreement  and the Mortgage  Loans then
being  serviced  and an  accounting  of  amounts  collected  and  held by it and
otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and  efficient  transfer of
each Subservicing Agreement to the assuming party.

     Section 3.07  Collection  of Certain  Mortgage Loan  Payments;  Deposits to
          Custodial Account.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall make  reasonable  efforts to collect all
payments  called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage  Loans,  and
shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and
the terms and provisions of any related Primary  Insurance  Policy,  follow such
collection procedures as it would employ in its good faith business judgment and
which  are  normal  and  usual in its  general  mortgage  servicing  activities.
Consistent  with the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer may in its discretion (i)
waive any late payment  charge or any prepayment  charge or penalty  interest in
connection  with the  prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the Due Date
for  payments  due on a Mortgage  Loan in  accordance  with the  Program  Guide,
provided,  however, that the Master Servicer shall first determine that any such
waiver  or  extension  will not  impair  the  coverage  of any  related  Primary
Insurance  Policy  or  materially  adversely  affect  the  lien  of the  related
Mortgage.  In the event of any such arrangement,  the Master Servicer shall make
timely  advances on the related  Mortgage  Loan during the  scheduled  period in
accordance  with  the  amortization  schedule  of  such  Mortgage  Loan  without
modification  thereof by reason of such arrangements  unless otherwise agreed to
by the  Holders  of the  Classes of  Certificates  affected  thereby;  provided,
however,  that no  such  extension  shall  be made  if any  advance  would  be a
Nonrecoverable Advance.  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Master
Servicer may also waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent
to the  postponement  of strict  compliance  with any such term or in any manner
grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Master Servicer's determination such
waiver,  modification,  postponement or indulgence is not materially  adverse to
the  interests of the  Certificateholders  (taking  into  account any  estimated
Realized Loss that might result absent such action), provided, however, that the
Master  Servicer may not modify  materially or permit any  Subservicer to modify
any Mortgage Loan,  including  without  limitation any  modification  that would
change the Mortgage Rate, forgive the payment of any principal or interest


                                              72

<PAGE>



(unless in  connection  with the  liquidation  of the related  Mortgage  Loan or
except in connection with prepayments to the extent that such  reamortization is
not  inconsistent  with the terms of the  Mortgage  Loan),  or extend  the final
maturity date of such Mortgage Loan, unless such Mortgage Loan is in default or,
in the judgment of the Master Servicer,  such default is reasonably foreseeable.
In connection with any Curtailment of a Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer,  to
the extent not  inconsistent  with the terms of the Mortgage  Note and local law
and  practice,  may permit the Mortgage  Loan to be  re-amortized  such that the
Monthly  Payment  is  recalculated  as an amount  that will fully  amortize  the
remaining Stated Principal  Balance thereof by the original  Maturity Date based
on the original Mortgage Rate;  provided,  that such reamortization shall not be
permitted if it would  constitute a reissuance  of the Mortgage Loan for federal
income tax purposes.

               (i) The Master  Servicer shall establish and maintain a Custodial
        Account  in which  the  Master  Servicer  shall  deposit  or cause to be
        deposited on a daily basis,  except as otherwise  specifically  provided
        herein, the following payments and collections  remitted by Subservicers
        or received by it in respect of the  Mortgage  Loans  subsequent  to the
        Cut-off  Date (other than in respect of  principal  and  interest on the
        Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-off Date):

               (ii) All payments on account of  principal,  including  Principal
        Prepayments  made by Mortgagors on the Mortgage  Loans and the principal
        component of any Subservicer  Advance or of any REO Proceeds received in
        connection  with  an REO  Property  for  which  an REO  Disposition  has
        occurred;

               (iii)  All  payments  on  account  of  interest  at the  Adjusted
        Mortgage Rate on the Mortgage Loans, including the interest component of
        any  Subservicer  Advance or of any REO Proceeds  received in connection
        with an REO Property for which an REO Disposition has occurred;

               (iv)  Insurance  Proceeds and  Liquidation  Proceeds  (net of any
          related expenses of the Subservicer);

               (v) All  proceeds of any  Mortgage  Loans  purchased  pursuant to
        Section 2.02,  2.03 or 2.04 and all amounts  required to be deposited in
        connection with the substitution of a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan
        pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04;

               (vi) Any  amounts  required to be  deposited  pursuant to Section
          3.07(c); and

               (vii) Any amounts realized by the Subservicer and received by the
          Master Servicer in respect of any Additional Collateral; .

        The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Custodial Account shall be
exclusive,  it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments on the Mortgage Loans which are not part of the Trust
Fund (consisting of payments in respect of principal


                                              73

<PAGE>



and  interest  on the  Mortgage  Loans due on or before  the  Cut-off  Date) and
payments or  collections  in the nature of  prepayment  charges or late  payment
charges or assumption  fees may but need not be deposited by the Master Servicer
in the Custodial  Account.  In the event any amount not required to be deposited
in the Custodial  Account is so deposited,  the Master  Servicer may at any time
withdraw such amount from the  Custodial  Account,  any provision  herein to the
contrary notwithstanding. The Custodial Account may contain funds that belong to
one or more trust funds created for mortgage pass-through  certificates of other
series and may  contain  other  funds  respecting  payments  on  mortgage  loans
belonging to the Master  Servicer or serviced or master serviced by it on behalf
of others.  Notwithstanding such commingling of funds, the Master Servicer shall
keep  records  that  accurately  reflect  the funds on deposit in the  Custodial
Account that have been  identified by it as being  attributable  to the Mortgage
Loans.

        (b) With  respect  to  Insurance  Proceeds,  Liquidation  Proceeds,  REO
Proceeds  and the  proceeds of the  purchase of any  Mortgage  Loan  pursuant to
Sections 2.02,  2.03, 2.04 and 4.07 received in any calendar  month,  the Master
Servicer may elect to treat such amounts as included in the Group I and Group II
Available Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date in the month of receipt,
but is not  obligated to do so. If the Master  Servicer so elects,  such amounts
will be deemed to have been  received  (and any related  Realized  Loss shall be
deemed  to have  occurred)  on the last day of the  month  prior to the  receipt
thereof.

        (c) The  Master  Servicer  shall  use its  best  efforts  to  cause  the
institution  maintaining  the  Custodial  Account  to  invest  the  funds in the
Custodial  Account  attributable to the Mortgage Loans in Permitted  Investments
which shall  mature not later than the  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date next
following the date of such investment (with the exception of the Amount Held for
Future  Distribution)  and which shall not be sold or disposed of prior to their
maturities.  All income and gain realized from any such investment  shall be for
the benefit of the Master  Servicer as  additional  servicing  compensation  and
shall be subject to its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any
losses  incurred  in  respect  of  any  such  investments  attributable  to  the
investment of amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans shall be deposited in the
Custodial  Account by the Master  Servicer out of its own funds  immediately  as
realized.

        (d) The  Master  Servicer  shall  give  notice  to the  Trustee  and the
Depositor  of any  change  in the  location  of the  Custodial  Account  and the
location of the Certificate Account prior to the use thereof.

        Section  3.08 Subservicing Accounts; Servicing Accounts.

        (a) In those  cases where a  Subservicer  is  servicing a Mortgage  Loan
pursuant  to a  Subservicing  Agreement,  the Master  Servicer  shall  cause the
Subservicer,  pursuant to the Subservicing  Agreement, to establish and maintain
one or more Subservicing Accounts which shall be an Eligible Account or, if such
account is not an Eligible Account,  shall generally satisfy the requirements of
the Program Guide and be otherwise  acceptable  to the Master  Servicer and each
Rating  Agency.  The  Subservicer  will be required  thereby to deposit into the
Subservicing Account


                                              74

<PAGE>



on a daily basis all  proceeds of Mortgage  Loans  received by the  Subservicer,
less its Subservicing Fees and unreimbursed advances and expenses, to the extent
permitted by the Subservicing  Agreement.  If the Subservicing Account is not an
Eligible  Account,  the Master  Servicer  shall be deemed to have  received such
monies upon receipt thereof by the  Subservicer.  The  Subservicer  shall not be
required to deposit in the  Subservicing  Account payments or collections in the
nature of prepayment  charges or late charges or  assumption  fees. On or before
the  date  specified  in the  Program  Guide,  but in no  event  later  than the
Determination Date, the Master Servicer shall cause the Subservicer, pursuant to
the Subservicing  Agreement,  to remit to the Master Servicer for deposit in the
Custodial  Account all funds held in the  Subservicing  Account  with respect to
each Mortgage Loan serviced by such Subservicer that are required to be remitted
to the Master Servicer.  The Subservicer will also be required,  pursuant to the
Subservicing  Agreement, to advance on such scheduled date of remittance amounts
equal to any scheduled  monthly  installments of principal and interest less its
Subservicing  Fees on any Mortgage  Loans for which  payment was not received by
the  Subservicer.  This obligation to advance with respect to each Mortgage Loan
will continue up to and  including the first of the month  following the date on
which  the  related  Mortgaged  Property  is  sold at a  foreclosure  sale or is
acquired by the Trust Fund by deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise. All such
advances  received by the Master  Servicer shall be deposited  promptly by it in
the Custodial Account.

        (b) The Subservicer may also be required,  pursuant to the  Subservicing
Agreement,  to remit to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Custodial Account
interest at the Adjusted  Mortgage  Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate plus the
rate per annum at which the  Servicing  Fee,  if any,  accrues  in the case of a
Modified  Mortgage  Loan) on any  Curtailment  received by such  Subservicer  in
respect of a Mortgage Loan from the related  Mortgagor  during any month that is
to be applied by the Subservicer to reduce the unpaid  principal  balance of the
related  Mortgage  Loan as of the  first  day of such  month,  from  the date of
application  of such  Curtailment to the first day of the following  month.  Any
amounts paid by a Subservicer  pursuant to the preceding  sentence  shall be for
the benefit of the Master  Servicer as  additional  servicing  compensation  and
shall be  subject  to its  withdrawal  or order  from time to time  pursuant  to
Sections 3.10(a)(iv) and (v).

        (c) In addition to the Custodial  Account and the  Certificate  Account,
the Master Servicer shall for any Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, and shall cause
the Subservicers  for Subserviced  Mortgage Loans to, establish and maintain one
or more Servicing  Accounts and deposit and retain therein all collections  from
the  Mortgagors  (or  advances  from  Subservicers)  for the  payment  of taxes,
assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,  Primary Insurance Policy premiums,  if
applicable,  or  comparable  items  for  the  account  of the  Mortgagors.  Each
Servicing Account shall satisfy the requirements for a Subservicing Account and,
to the extent  permitted by the Program  Guide or as is otherwise  acceptable to
the Master Servicer, may also function as a Subservicing Account. Withdrawals of
amounts  related to the Mortgage  Loans from the Servicing  Accounts may be made
only to effect timely payment of taxes, assessments,  hazard insurance premiums,
Primary  Insurance  Policy  premiums,  if applicable,  or comparable  items,  to
reimburse the Master Servicer or Subservicer out of related  collections for any
payments made  pursuant to Sections 3.11 (with respect to the Primary  Insurance
Policy) and 3.12(a) (with respect to hazard insurance), to refund to any


                                              75

<PAGE>



Mortgagors  any sums as may be  determined to be overages,  to pay interest,  if
required,  to Mortgagors  on balances in the  Servicing  Account or to clear and
terminate  the  Servicing  Account  at the  termination  of  this  Agreement  in
accordance with Section 9.01 or in accordance with the Program Guide. As part of
its servicing  duties,  the Master Servicer shall,  and the  Subservicers  will,
pursuant to the  Subservicing  Agreements,  be required to pay to the Mortgagors
interest on funds in this account to the extent required by law.

        (d) The Master  Servicer  shall advance the payments  referred to in the
preceding  subsection  that are not timely paid by the Mortgagors or advanced by
the  Subservicers on the date when the tax, premium or other cost for which such
payment is  intended  is due,  but the Master  Servicer  shall be required so to
advance only to the extent that such advances, in the good faith judgment of the
Master  Servicer,  will be recoverable  by the Master  Servicer out of Insurance
Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or otherwise.

     Section 3.09 Access to Certain  Documentation and Information Regarding the
          Mortgage Loans.

        In the event that compliance with this Section 3.09 shall make any Class
of  Certificates  legal for  investment  by federally  insured  savings and loan
associations,  the Master Servicer shall provide,  or cause the  Subservicers to
provide,  to the Trustee,  the Office of Thrift  Supervision or the FDIC and the
supervisory  agents and examiners thereof access to the documentation  regarding
the Mortgage  Loans  required by applicable  regulations of the Office of Thrift
Supervision,  such access being afforded without charge but only upon reasonable
request and during normal business hours at the offices designated by the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer shall permit such representatives to photocopy any
such  documentation  and shall  provide  equipment  for that purpose at a charge
reasonably approximating the cost of such photocopying to the Master Servicer.

        Section  3.10 Permitted Withdrawals from the Custodial Account.

        (a) The Master Servicer may, from time to time as provided herein,  make
withdrawals from the Custodial Account of amounts on deposit therein pursuant to
Section  3.07 that are  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans for the  following
purposes:

               (i) to make deposits into the Certificate  Account in the amounts
          and in the manner provided for in Section 4.01;

               (ii)  to  reimburse   itself  or  the  related   Subservicer  for
        previously  unreimbursed  advances or expenses made pursuant to Sections
        3.01, 3.08, 3.12(a), 3.14 and 4.04 or otherwise reimbursable pursuant to
        the terms of this  Agreement,  such  withdrawal  right being  limited to
        amounts  received on  particular  Mortgage  Loans  (including,  for this
        purpose,  REO Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds,  Liquidation  Proceeds and
        proceeds  from the purchase of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.02,
        2.03,  2.04 or 4.07) which  represent  (A) Late  Collections  of Monthly
        Payments for which any such advance was made in the case of


                                              76

        Subservicer  Advances or Advances  pursuant to Section 4.04 and (B) late
        recoveries of the payments for which such advances were made in the case
        of Servicing Advances;

               (iii)  to pay  to  itself  or the  related  Subservicer  (if  not
        previously retained by such Subservicer) out of each payment received by
        the  Master  Servicer  on  account of  interest  on a  Mortgage  Loan as
        contemplated  by  Sections  3.14  and  3.16,  an  amount  equal  to that
        remaining  portion of any such payment as to interest (but not in excess
        of the  Servicing  Fee  and  the  Subservicing  Fee,  if not  previously
        retained) which,  when deducted,  will result in the remaining amount of
        such  interest  being  interest  at a rate  per  annum  equal to the Net
        Mortgage  Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage  Rate in the case of a Modified
        Mortgage Loan) on the amount specified in the  amortization  schedule of
        the  related  Mortgage  Loan as the  principal  balance  thereof  at the
        beginning of the period  respecting  which such  interest was paid after
        giving effect to any previous Curtailments;

               (iv) to pay to itself as additional  servicing  compensation  any
        interest or investment income earned on funds deposited in the Custodial
        Account that it is entitled to withdraw pursuant to Section 3.07(c);

               (v) to pay to itself as  additional  servicing  compensation  any
        Foreclosure  Profits,  and  any  amounts  remitted  by  Subservicers  as
        interest in respect of Curtailments pursuant to Section 3.08(b);

               (vi) to pay to itself, a Subservicer,  Residential  Funding,  the
        Depositor  or any other  appropriate  Person,  as the case may be,  with
        respect to each  Mortgage Loan or property  acquired in respect  thereof
        that has been  purchased  or otherwise  transferred  pursuant to Section
        2.02,  2.03,  2.04, 4.07 or 9.01, all amounts  received  thereon and not
        required to be distributed to Certificateholders as of the date on which
        the related Stated Principal Balance or Purchase Price is determined;

               (vii) to  reimburse  itself or the  related  Subservicer  for any
        Nonrecoverable  Advance  or  Advances  in the  manner  and to the extent
        provided in subsection (c) below,  any Advance made in connection with a
        modification  of a Mortgage  Loan that is in default or, in the judgment
        of the Master Servicer,  default is reasonably  foreseeable  pursuant to
        Section 3.07(a),  to the extent the amount of the Advance has been added
        to the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan;

               (viii) to reimburse itself or the Depositor for expenses incurred
        by and reimbursable to it or the Depositor  pursuant to Section 3.14(c),
        6.03, 10.01 or otherwise;

               (ix) to reimburse  itself for amounts expended by it (a) pursuant
        to Section  3.14 in good faith in  connection  with the  restoration  of
        property  damaged by an Uninsured  Cause, and (b) in connection with the
        liquidation  of a Mortgage Loan or disposition of an REO Property to the
        extent not otherwise reimbursed pursuant to clause (ii) or (viii) above;
        and


                                              77

<PAGE>




               (x) to withdraw  any amount  deposited in the  Custodial  Account
        that was not required to be deposited  therein pursuant to Section 3.07,
        including any payoff fees or penalties or any other  additional  amounts
        payable to the Master  Servicer or Subservicer  pursuant to the terms of
        the Mortgage Note.

        (b) Since,  in  connection  with  withdrawals  pursuant to clauses (ii),
(iii),  (v) and (vi), the Master  Servicer's  entitlement  thereto is limited to
collections  or other  recoveries  on the  related  Mortgage  Loan,  the  Master
Servicer  shall keep and maintain  separate  accounting,  on a Mortgage  Loan by
Mortgage  Loan basis,  for the purpose of  justifying  any  withdrawal  from the
Custodial Account pursuant to such clauses.

        (c) The Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to  reimburse  itself or the
related  Subservicer for any Advance or Subservicer Advance made in respect of a
Mortgage Loan that the Master Servicer determines to be a Nonrecoverable Advance
by  withdrawal  from  the  Custodial  Account  of  amounts  on  deposit  therein
attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans on any  Certificate  Account  Deposit Date
succeeding  the  date of such  determination.  Such  right of  reimbursement  in
respect of a Nonrecoverable Advance on any such Certificate Account Deposit Date
shall be limited  to an amount  not  exceeding  the  portion of such  Advance or
Subservicer Advance previously paid to  Certificateholders  (and not theretofore
reimbursed to the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer).

        Section  3.11 Maintenance of Primary Insurance Coverage.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall not take, or permit any  Subservicer  to
take, any action which would result in noncoverage under any applicable  Primary
Insurance  Policy of any loss which,  but for the actions of the Master Servicer
or Subservicer,  would have been covered  thereunder.  To the extent coverage is
available,  the Master Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and
effect each such Primary  Insurance  Policy until the  principal  balance of the
related Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged  Property is reduced to 80% or less
of the Appraised Value at origination in the case of such a Mortgage Loan having
a  Loan-to-Value  Ratio at  origination  in  excess of 80%,  provided  that such
Primary  Insurance  Policy  was in place as of the  Cut-off  Date and the Master
Servicer had knowledge of such Primary  Insurance  Policy.  The Master  Servicer
shall not cancel or refuse to renew any such Primary Insurance Policy applicable
to a  Nonsubserviced  Mortgage Loan, or consent to any Subservicer  canceling or
refusing to renew any such Primary  Insurance  Policy  applicable  to a Mortgage
Loan subserviced by it, that is in effect at the date of the initial issuance of
the  Certificates  and is  required  to be kept in force  hereunder  unless  the
replacement  Primary Insurance Policy for such canceled or non-renewed policy is
maintained  with an insurer  whose  claims-paying  ability is acceptable to each
Rating Agency for mortgage pass-through certificates having a rating equal to or
better than the lower of the  then-current  rating or the rating assigned to the
Certificates as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency.

        (b) In connection with its activities as  administrator  and servicer of
the  Mortgage  Loans,  the  Master  Servicer  agrees to  present or to cause the
related Subservicer to present, on behalf of the


                                              78

<PAGE>



Master Servicer,  the Subservicer,  if any, the Trustee and  Certificateholders,
claims to the insurer under any Primary Insurance  Policies,  in a timely manner
in accordance  with such policies,  and, in this regard,  to take or cause to be
taken such reasonable  action as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any
Primary Insurance  Policies  respecting  defaulted  Mortgage Loans.  Pursuant to
Section  3.07,  any  Insurance  Proceeds  collected by or remitted to the Master
Servicer  under  any  Primary  Insurance  Policies  shall  be  deposited  in the
Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.10.

     Section 3.12  Maintenance  of Fire  Insurance  and  Omissions  and Fidelity
          Coverage.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan (other than a Cooperative Loan) fire insurance with extended coverage in an
amount  which is equal to the  lesser  of the  principal  balance  owing on such
Mortgage Loan (together with the principal  balance of any mortgage loan secured
by a lien that is senior to the Mortgage  Loan) or 100 percent of the  insurable
value of the improvements; provided, however, that such coverage may not be less
than the minimum amount required to fully compensate for any loss or damage on a
replacement cost basis. To the extent it may do so without breaching the related
Subservicing  Agreement,  the Master Servicer shall replace any Subservicer that
does not cause such insurance,  to the extent it is available, to be maintained.
The Master Servicer shall also cause to be maintained on property  acquired upon
foreclosure,  or deed in lieu of foreclosure, of any Mortgage Loan (other than a
Cooperative  Loan),  fire insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is
at  least  equal  to the  amount  necessary  to  avoid  the  application  of any
co-insurance  clause contained in the related hazard insurance policy.  Pursuant
to Section 3.07,  any amounts  collected by the Master  Servicer  under any such
policies  (other than amounts to be applied to the  restoration or repair of the
related Mortgaged  Property or property thus acquired or amounts released to the
Mortgagor in accordance with the Master Servicer's normal servicing  procedures)
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to
Section 3.10. Any cost incurred by the Master  Servicer in maintaining  any such
insurance  shall not, for the purpose of calculating  monthly  distributions  to
Certificateholders,  be added to the  amount  owing  under  the  Mortgage  Loan,
notwithstanding  that the terms of the Mortgage Loan so permit. Such costs shall
be  recoverable  by the Master  Servicer  out of related  late  payments  by the
Mortgagor or out of Insurance  Proceeds and  Liquidation  Proceeds to the extent
permitted by Section  3.10.  It is  understood  and agreed that no earthquake or
other  additional  insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor or maintained on
property  acquired  in respect of a Mortgage  Loan other than  pursuant  to such
applicable  laws and  regulations  as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance. Whenever the improvements securing a Mortgage
Loan (other than a Cooperative  Loan) are located at the time of  origination of
such Mortgage  Loan in a federally  designated  special  flood hazard area,  the
Master  Servicer  shall cause flood  insurance  (to the extent  available) to be
maintained in respect thereof.  Such flood insurance shall be in an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount required to compensate for any loss or damage to
the Mortgaged  Property on a replacement  cost basis and (ii) the maximum amount
of such  insurance  available  for the  related  Mortgaged  Property  under  the
national flood insurance program (assuming that the area in which such Mortgaged
Property is located is participating in such program).


                                              79

        In the event  that the  Master  Servicer  shall  obtain  and  maintain a
blanket fire insurance  policy with extended  coverage  insuring  against hazard
losses on all of the Mortgage  Loans,  it shall  conclusively  be deemed to have
satisfied  its  obligations  as set forth in the first  sentence of this Section
3.12(a),  it being  understood  and  agreed  that  such  policy  may  contain  a
deductible  clause,  in which case the Master  Servicer shall, in the event that
there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged  Property a policy
complying with the first  sentence of this Section  3.12(a) and there shall have
been a loss  which  would  have been  covered  by such  policy,  deposit  in the
Certificate  Account the amount not otherwise  payable under the blanket  policy
because of such deductible clause. Any such deposit by the Master Servicer shall
be made on the Certificate  Account Deposit Date next preceding the Distribution
Date which occurs in the month  following the month in which  payments under any
such policy would have been  deposited in the Custodial  Account.  In connection
with its activities as  administrator  and servicer of the Mortgage  Loans,  the
Master  Servicer  agrees to  present,  on  behalf of  itself,  the  Trustee  and
Certificateholders, claims under any such blanket policy.

        (b) The Master Servicer shall obtain and maintain at its own expense and
keep in full force and effect  throughout  the term of this  Agreement a blanket
fidelity bond and an errors and omissions  insurance  policy covering the Master
Servicer's  officers and  employees  and other  persons  acting on behalf of the
Master  Servicer in connection  with its activities  under this  Agreement.  The
amount  of  coverage  shall be at  least  equal to the  coverage  that  would be
required by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, whichever is greater, with respect to the
Master  Servicer if the Master  Servicer were  servicing and  administering  the
Mortgage Loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In the event that any such bond or
policy  ceases to be in effect,  the Master  Servicer  shall obtain a comparable
replacement  bond or  policy  from an  issuer  or  insurer,  as the case may be,
meeting the  requirements,  if any, of the Program  Guide and  acceptable to the
Depositor. Coverage of the Master Servicer under a policy or bond obtained by an
Affiliate of the Master  Servicer and  providing  the coverage  required by this
Section 3.12(b) shall satisfy the requirements of this Section 3.12(b).

     Section  3.13   Enforcement   of   Due-on-Sale   Clauses;   Assumption  and
          Modification Agreements; Certain Assignments.

        (a) When any Mortgaged Property is conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Master
Servicer or  Subservicer,  to the extent it has  knowledge  of such  conveyance,
shall enforce any due-on-sale clause contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,
to the extent permitted under applicable law and governmental  regulations,  but
only to the extent that such enforcement will not adversely affect or jeopardize
coverage under any Required Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

               (i) the  Master  Servicer  shall not be  deemed to be in  default
        under this Section 3.13(a) by reason of any transfer or assumption which
        the Master Servicer is restricted by law from preventing; and

               (ii) if the  Master  Servicer  determines  that it is  reasonably
          likely that any


                                              80

<PAGE>



        Mortgagor will bring,  or if any Mortgagor  does bring,  legal action to
        declare invalid or otherwise avoid  enforcement of a due-on-sale  clause
        contained in any Mortgage Note or Mortgage,  the Master  Servicer  shall
        not be  required to enforce the  due-on-sale  clause or to contest  such
        action.

        (b) Subject to the Master  Servicer's  duty to enforce  any  due-on-sale
clause  to the  extent  set  forth in  Section  3.13(a),  in any case in which a
Mortgaged Property is to be conveyed to a Person by a Mortgagor, and such Person
is to enter into an  assumption or  modification  agreement or supplement to the
Mortgage Note or Mortgage which requires the signature of the Trustee,  or if an
instrument of release signed by the Trustee is required  releasing the Mortgagor
from liability on the Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer is authorized,  subject
to the requirements of the sentence next following,  to execute and deliver,  on
behalf of the  Trustee,  the  assumption  agreement  with the Person to whom the
Mortgaged  Property  is  to be  conveyed  and  such  modification  agreement  or
supplement  to the  Mortgage  Note  or  Mortgage  or  other  instruments  as are
reasonable  or necessary to carry out the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage
or otherwise to comply with any  applicable  laws  regarding  assumptions or the
transfer of the Mortgaged Property to such Person;  provided,  however,  none of
such terms and requirements  shall both constitute a "significant  modification"
effecting an exchange or  reissuance  of such  Mortgage  Loan under the Code (or
final,  temporary or proposed Treasury regulations  promulgated  thereunder) and
cause any of REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC  III or REMIC IV to fail to  qualify  as
REMICs under the Code or the imposition of any tax on "prohibited  transactions"
or "contributions" after the startup date under the REMIC Provisions. The Master
Servicer  shall  execute  and  deliver  such  documents  only  if it  reasonably
determines that (i) its execution and delivery thereof will not conflict with or
violate any terms of this  Agreement or cause the unpaid balance and interest on
the Mortgage  Loan to be  uncollectible  in whole or in part,  (ii) any required
consents of insurers  under any Required  Insurance  Policies have been obtained
and (iii) subsequent to the closing of the transaction  involving the assumption
or  transfer  (A) the  Mortgage  Loan will  continue  to be  secured  by a first
mortgage  lien (or junior  lien of the same  priority  in relation to any senior
mortgage loan,  with respect to any Mortgage Loan secured by a junior  Mortgage)
pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage,  (B) such  transaction will not adversely
affect the coverage under any Required Insurance Policies, (C) the Mortgage Loan
will fully amortize over the remaining term thereof, (D) no material term of the
Mortgage Loan (including the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan) will be altered
nor  will  the  term  of  the   Mortgage   Loan  be  changed   and  (E)  if  the
seller/transferor  of the Mortgaged Property is to be released from liability on
the Mortgage  Loan,  the  buyer/transferee  of the Mortgaged  Property  would be
qualified  to assume the  Mortgage  Loan based on  generally  comparable  credit
quality  and  such  release  will  not  (based  on  the  Master   Servicer's  or
Subservicer's good faith  determination)  adversely affect the collectability of
the Mortgage  Loan.  Upon receipt of  appropriate  instructions  from the Master
Servicer  in  accordance  with the  foregoing,  the  Trustee  shall  execute any
necessary  instruments  for such  assumption  or  substitution  of  liability as
directed  by  the  Master  Servicer.   Upon  the  closing  of  the  transactions
contemplated by such documents, the Master Servicer shall cause the originals or
true and correct  copies of the assumption  agreement,  the release (if any), or
the  modification or supplement to the Mortgage Note or Mortgage to be delivered
to the Trustee or the Custodian  and  deposited  with the Mortgage File for such
Mortgage Loan. Any fee collected by the Master Servicer


                                              81

<PAGE>



or such related  Subservicer  for entering into an assumption or substitution of
liability  agreement will be retained by the Master Servicer or such Subservicer
as additional servicing compensation.

        (c) The Master Servicer or the related Subservicer,  as the case may be,
shall be entitled to approve a request from a Mortgagor for a partial release of
the related Mortgaged Property,  the granting of an easement thereon in favor of
another Person,  any alteration or demolition of the related Mortgaged  Property
(or, with respect to a Cooperative Loan, the related  Cooperative  Apartment) or
other similar matters if it has  determined,  exercising its good faith business
judgment  in the same  manner  as it would if it were the  owner of the  related
Mortgage Loan, that the security for, and the timely and full collectability of,
such  Mortgage  Loan would not be  adversely  affected  thereby and that each of
REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV would  continue  to qualify as a REMIC
under the Code as a result thereof and that no tax on "prohibited  transactions"
or  "contributions"  after the  startup  day would be imposed on any of REMIC I,
REMIC II, REMIC III or REMIC IV as a result  thereof.  Any fee  collected by the
Master Servicer or the related Subservicer for processing such a request will be
retained by the Master  Servicer or such  Subservicer  as  additional  servicing
compensation.

        (d)  Subject  to any  other  applicable  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement,  the  Trustee  and Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled to approve an
assignment in lieu of satisfaction  with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  provided
the  obligee  with  respect  to  such  Mortgage  Loan  following  such  proposed
assignment provides the Trustee and Master Servicer with a "Lender Certification
for  Assignment of Mortgage  Loan" in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit M, in
form and substance  satisfactory to the Trustee and Master  Servicer,  providing
the  following:  (i) that the  Mortgage  Loan is secured by  Mortgaged  Property
located in a  jurisdiction  in which an  assignment in lieu of  satisfaction  is
required to preserve lien priority,  minimize or avoid mortgage  recording taxes
or otherwise  comply with, or facilitate a refinancing  under,  the laws of such
jurisdiction;  (ii) that the substance of the  assignment is, and is intended to
be, a refinancing of such Mortgage Loan and that the form of the  transaction is
solely to comply with, or facilitate  the  transaction  under,  such local laws;
(iii) that the Mortgage Loan following the proposed  assignment will have a rate
of  interest at least 0.25  percent  below or above the rate of interest on such
Mortgage Loan prior to such proposed  assignment;  and (iv) that such assignment
is at the request of the borrower under the related Mortgage Loan. Upon approval
of an assignment in lieu of satisfaction  with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the
Master  Servicer  shall receive cash in an amount equal to the unpaid  principal
balance of and accrued  interest on such Mortgage  Loan and the Master  Servicer
shall treat such amount as a Principal  Prepayment  in Full with respect to such
Mortgage Loan for all purposes hereof.

        Section  3.14 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

        (a) The Master  Servicer shall  foreclose  upon or otherwise  comparably
convert  (which may include an REO  Acquisition)  the  ownership  of  properties
securing such of the Mortgage  Loans as come into and continue in default and as
to which no satisfactory  arrangements  can be made for collection of delinquent
payments pursuant to Section 3.07.  Alternatively,  the Master Servicer may take
other  actions in respect of a defaulted  Mortgage  Loan,  which may include (i)
accepting a short


                                              82

<PAGE>



sale (a payoff of the  Mortgage  Loan for an amount  less than the total  amount
contractually  owed in order to facilitate a sale of the  Mortgaged  Property by
the Mortgagor) or permitting a short  refinancing (a payoff of the Mortgage Loan
for an  amount  less  than  the  total  amount  contractually  owed in  order to
facilitate refinancing transactions by the Mortgagor not involving a sale of the
Mortgaged Property),  (ii) arranging for a repayment plan or (iii) agreeing to a
modification   in  accordance   with  Section  3.07.  In  connection  with  such
foreclosure or other conversion or action, the Master Servicer shall, consistent
with  Section  3.11,  follow  such  practices  and  procedures  as it shall deem
necessary  or  advisable,  as shall be normal and usual in its general  mortgage
servicing activities and as shall be required or permitted by the Program Guide;
provided that the Master  Servicer shall not be liable in any respect  hereunder
if the Master  Servicer is acting in  connection  with any such  foreclosure  or
other conversion or action in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of
this Agreement.  The Master Servicer,  however,  shall not be required to expend
its own  funds  or incur  other  reimbursable  charges  in  connection  with any
foreclosure,  or attempted  foreclosure  which is not completed,  or towards the
correction  of any default on a related  senior  mortgage  loan,  or towards the
restoration of any property unless it shall determine (i) that such  restoration
and/or  foreclosure  will increase the proceeds of  liquidation  of the Mortgage
Loan to Holders of  Certificates of one or more Classes after  reimbursement  to
itself for such expenses or charges and (ii) that such expenses and charges will
be recoverable to it through Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance Proceeds,  or REO
Proceeds  (respecting  which it shall have priority for purposes of  withdrawals
from the  Custodial  Account  pursuant  to  Section  3.10,  whether  or not such
expenses and charges are actually recoverable from related Liquidation Proceeds,
Insurance Proceeds or REO Proceeds). In the event of such a determination by the
Master Servicer  pursuant to this Section 3.14(a),  the Master Servicer shall be
entitled to reimbursement of its funds so expended pursuant to Section 3.10.

        In addition to the  foregoing,  the Master  Servicer  shall use its best
reasonable  efforts to realize upon any  Additional  Collateral  for such of the
Additional Collateral Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which
no satisfactory  arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent  payments
pursuant to Section 3.07; provided that the Master Servicer shall not, on behalf
of the Trustee, obtain title to any such Additional Collateral as a result of or
in lieu of the disposition  thereof or otherwise;  and provided further that (i)
the Master Servicer shall not proceed with respect to such Additional Collateral
in any manner  that would  impair the  ability to recover  against  the  related
Mortgaged  Property,  and (ii) the Master  Servicer  shall  proceed with any REO
Acquisition in a manner that preserves the ability to apply the proceeds of such
Additional  Collateral  against amounts owed under the defaulted  Mortgage Loan.
Any proceeds realized from such Additional  Collateral (other than amounts to be
released to the Mortgagor or the related guarantor in accordance with procedures
that the  Master  Servicer  would  follow in  servicing  loans  held for its own
account,  subject  to the terms  and  conditions  of the  related  Mortgage  and
Mortgage  Note  and to the  terms  and  conditions  of any  security  agreement,
guarantee  agreement,  mortgage or other agreement  governing the disposition of
the proceeds of such Additional  Collateral) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account,  subject to  withdrawal  pursuant to Section  3.10.  Any other  payment
received by the Master Servicer in respect of such Additional  Collateral  shall
be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section
3.10.



                                              83

<PAGE>



        In addition,  the Master  Servicer  may pursue any remedies  that may be
available in  connection  with a breach of a  representation  and warranty  with
respect to any such  Mortgage  Loan in  accordance  with Sections 2.03 and 2.04.
However,  the  Master  Servicer  is not  required  to  continue  to pursue  both
foreclosure  (or  similar  remedies)  with  respect  to the  Mortgage  Loans and
remedies in  connection  with a breach of a  representation  and warranty if the
Master Servicer determines in its reasonable  discretion that one such remedy is
more likely to result in a greater  recovery as to the Mortgage  Loan.  Upon the
occurrence of a Cash  Liquidation or REO  Disposition,  following the deposit in
the Custodial Account of all Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation Proceeds and other
payments and recoveries  referred to in the definition of "Cash  Liquidation" or
"REO  Disposition,"  as  applicable,  upon  receipt  by the  Trustee  of written
notification of such deposit signed by a Servicing  Officer,  the Trustee or any
Custodian,  as the case may be, shall release to the Master Servicer the related
Mortgage  File and the Trustee  shall  execute and deliver such  instruments  of
transfer or  assignment  prepared by the Master  Servicer,  in each case without
recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the Master Servicer or its designee,
as the case may be, the related Mortgage Loan, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan
shall not be part of the Trust Fund.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this  Agreement,  in the Master  Servicer's  sole  discretion  with
respect  to any  defaulted  Mortgage  Loan or REO  Property  as to either of the
following provisions, (i) a Cash Liquidation or REO Disposition may be deemed to
have occurred if substantially all amounts expected by the Master Servicer to be
received in connection with the related defaulted  Mortgage Loan or REO Property
have been  received,  and (ii) for  purposes  of  determining  the amount of any
Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds,  REO Proceeds or other  unscheduled
collections  or the amount of any Realized  Loss,  the Master  Servicer may take
into account minimal amounts of additional  receipts  expected to be received or
any  estimated  additional  liquidation  expenses  expected  to be  incurred  in
connection with the related defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

        (b) In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired by the
Trust Fund as an REO Property by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of  foreclosure,
the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee or to its nominee
on behalf of  Certificateholders.  Notwithstanding any such acquisition of title
and  cancellation of the related  Mortgage Loan, such REO Property shall (except
as otherwise  expressly  provided  herein) be  considered  to be an  Outstanding
Mortgage  Loan held in the Trust Fund until such time as the REO Property  shall
be  sold.  Consistent  with  the  foregoing  for  purposes  of all  calculations
hereunder so long as such REO Property  shall be considered to be an Outstanding
Mortgage Loan it shall be assumed that,  notwithstanding  that the  indebtedness
evidenced by the related Mortgage Note shall have been discharged, such Mortgage
Note and the  related  amortization  schedule  in effect at the time of any such
acquisition  of title  (after  giving  effect to any previous  Curtailments  and
before any adjustment  thereto by reason of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding
or any moratorium or similar waiver or grace period) remain in effect.

        (c) In the event  that the  Trust  Fund  acquires  any REO  Property  as
aforesaid  or otherwise in  connection  with a default or imminent  default on a
Mortgage Loan, the Master  Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund shall dispose of
such REO  Property  as soon as  practicable,  giving  due  consideration  to the
interests  of the  Certificateholders,  but in all cases within three full years
after the  taxable  year of its  acquisition  by the Trust Fund for  purposes of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code


                                              84

(or such shorter period as may be necessary under  applicable  state  (including
any state in which such  property is located) law to maintain the status of each
of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV as a REMIC under  applicable  state
law and avoid  taxes  resulting  from such  property  failing to be  foreclosure
property  under  applicable  state law) or, at the  expense  of the Trust  Fund,
request,  more than 60 days  before  the day on which such  grace  period  would
otherwise  expire,  an extension of such grace period unless the Master Servicer
obtains for the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel,  addressed to the Trustee and the
Master  Servicer,  to the effect  that the holding by the Trust Fund of such REO
Property subsequent to such period will not result in the imposition of taxes on
"prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F of the Code or cause any of
REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to  qualify  as a REMIC  (for
federal (or any applicable State or local) income tax purposes) at any time that
any Certificates  are outstanding,  in which case the Trust Fund may continue to
hold such REO Property  (subject to any conditions  contained in such Opinion of
Counsel).  The Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to be  reimbursed  from the
Custodial  Account for any costs  incurred in obtaining such Opinion of Counsel,
as  provided  in  Section  3.10.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this
Agreement,  no REO  Property  acquired  by the Trust  Fund  shall be rented  (or
allowed to continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust
Fund in such a manner or  pursuant  to any terms  that  would (i) cause such REO
Property  to fail to qualify as  "foreclosure  property"  within the  meaning of
Section  860G(a)(8)  of the Code or (ii) subject REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III or
REMIC IV to the imposition of any federal income taxes on the income earned from
such REO Property,  including any taxes imposed by reason of Section  860G(c) of
the Code,  unless the Master  Servicer has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

        (d) The proceeds of any Cash Liquidation, REO Disposition or purchase or
repurchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, as well
as any recovery resulting from a collection of Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance
Proceeds or REO Proceeds,  will be applied in the  following  order of priority:
first, to reimburse the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer in accordance
with Section  3.10(a)(ii);  second, to the  Certificateholders  to the extent of
accrued and unpaid  interest on the Mortgage  Loan,  and any related REO Imputed
Interest,  at the Net Mortgage  Rate (or the  Modified Net Mortgage  Rate in the
case of a Modified  Mortgage  Loan),  to the Due Date in the  related Due Period
prior to the  Distribution  Date on which such  amounts  are to be  distributed;
third, to the Certificateholders as a recovery of principal on the Mortgage Loan
(or REO Property) (provided that if any such Class of Certificates to which such
Realized Loss was allocated is no longer  outstanding,  such subsequent recovery
shall be  distributed  to the  persons  who were the  Holders  of such  Class of
Certificates when it was retired); fourth, to the Master Servicer; fifth, to all
Servicing Fees and Subservicing  Fees payable therefrom (and the Master Servicer
and the Subservicer  shall have no claims for any  deficiencies  with respect to
such fees which result from the foregoing allocation); and sixth, to Foreclosure
Profits.

        Section  3.15 Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.

        (a) Upon becoming  aware of the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or
upon the receipt by the Master  Servicer of a notification  that payment in full
will be escrowed in a manner  customary for such purposes,  the Master  Servicer
will  immediately  notify the Trustee (if it holds the related Mortgage File) or
the Custodian by a  certification  of a Servicing  Officer (which  certification
shall  include a  statement  to the effect  that all  amounts  received or to be
received in  connection  with such payment which are required to be deposited in
the  Custodial  Account  pursuant  to  Section  3.07  have  been  or  will be so
deposited),  substantially  in one of the forms  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit G
requesting   delivery  to  it  of  the  Mortgage  File.  Upon  receipt  of  such
certification  and request,  the Trustee shall  promptly  release,  or cause the
Custodian to release,  the related  Mortgage  File to the Master  Servicer.  The
Master  Servicer  is  authorized  to execute and  deliver to the  Mortgagor  the
request for  reconveyance,  deed of  reconveyance  or release or satisfaction of
mortgage or such  instrument  releasing the lien of the Mortgage,  together with
the Mortgage Note with, as appropriate, written evidence of cancellation thereon
and to cause the removal  from the  registration  on the MERS(R)  System of such
Mortgage  and to  execute  and  deliver,  on  behalf  of  the  Trustee  and  the
Certificateholders  or any of them, any and all  instruments of  satisfaction or
cancellation  or of  partial  or full  release,  including  any  applicable  UCC
termination  statements.  No expenses incurred in connection with any instrument
of  satisfaction  or deed of  reconveyance  shall be chargeable to the Custodial
Account or the Certificate Account.

        (b) From time to time as is appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure
of any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Custodian, with a
copy to the Trustee,  a certificate of a Servicing Officer  substantially in one
of the forms attached as Exhibit G hereto, requesting that possession of all, or
any document  constituting  part of, the Mortgage File be released to the Master
Servicer and  certifying as to the reason for such release and that such release
will not invalidate any insurance  coverage  provided in respect of the Mortgage
Loan under any Required  Insurance  Policy.  Upon receipt of the foregoing,  the
Trustee shall deliver,  or cause the Custodian to deliver,  the Mortgage File or
any document  therein to the Master  Servicer.  The Master  Servicer shall cause
each  Mortgage  File or any  document  therein so released to be returned to the
Trustee, or the Custodian as agent for the Trustee when the need therefor by the
Master  Servicer  no  longer  exists,  unless  (i) the  Mortgage  Loan  has been
liquidated and the Liquidation  Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan have been
deposited in the  Custodial  Account or (ii) the Mortgage  File or such document
has been  delivered  directly or through a Subservicer  to an attorney,  or to a
public  trustee or other  public  official as required by law,  for  purposes of
initiating or pursuing legal action or other  proceedings for the foreclosure of
the  Mortgaged  Property  either  judicially or  non-judicially,  and the Master
Servicer  has  delivered  directly  or through a  Subservicer  to the  Trustee a
certificate of a Servicing Officer  certifying as to the name and address of the
Person to which  such  Mortgage  File or such  document  was  delivered  and the
purpose or  purposes  of such  delivery.  In the event of the  liquidation  of a
Mortgage  Loan,  the Trustee  shall deliver the Request for Release with respect
thereto to the Master Servicer upon deposit of the related Liquidation  Proceeds
in the Custodial Account.

     (c) The  Trustee or the  Master  Servicer  on the  Trustee's  behalf  shall
execute and deliver


                                              86

<PAGE>



to the  Master  Servicer,  if  necessary,  any  court  pleadings,  requests  for
trustee's sale or other documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale
in respect of a  Mortgaged  Property  or to any legal  action  brought to obtain
judgment  against any  Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or to obtain a
deficiency judgment,  or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the
Mortgage Note or Mortgage or otherwise  available at law or in equity.  Together
with such documents or pleadings (if signed by the Trustee), the Master Servicer
shall deliver to the Trustee a  certificate  of a Servicing  Officer  requesting
that such pleadings or documents be executed by the Trustee and certifying as to
the reason such  documents or pleadings  are required and that the execution and
delivery thereof by the Trustee will not invalidate any insurance coverage under
any Required  Insurance Policy or invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the
Mortgage,  except  for the  termination  of such a lien upon  completion  of the
foreclosure or trustee's sale.

        Section  3.16 Servicing and Other Compensation; Compensating Interest.

        (a) The Master Servicer,  as compensation for its activities  hereunder,
shall be entitled to receive on each  Distribution Date the amounts provided for
by clauses (iii),  (iv), (v) and (vi) of Section 3.10(a),  subject to clause (e)
below. The amount of servicing  compensation  provided for in such clauses shall
be accounted for on a Mortgage  Loan-by-Mortgage  Loan basis.  In the event that
Liquidation  Proceeds,  Insurance  Proceeds  and REO  Proceeds  (net of  amounts
reimbursable  therefrom  pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(ii))  in respect of a Cash
Liquidation  or REO  Disposition  exceed  the unpaid  principal  balance of such
Mortgage  Loan plus  unpaid  interest  accrued  thereon  (including  REO Imputed
Interest)  at a per annum rate equal to the  related Net  Mortgage  Rate (or the
Modified Net Mortgage Rate in the case of a Modified  Mortgage Loan), the Master
Servicer  shall be entitled to retain  therefrom and to pay to itself and/or the
related   Subservicer,   any  Foreclosure  Profits  and  any  Servicing  Fee  or
Subservicing Fee considered to be accrued but unpaid.

        (b) Additional servicing compensation in the form of prepayment charges,
assumption  fees,  late  payment  charges,  investment  income on amounts in the
Custodial  Account or the Certificate  Account or otherwise shall be retained by
the Master Servicer or the Subservicer to the extent provided herein, subject to
clause (e) below.

        (c) The Master  Servicer  shall be required to pay, or cause to be paid,
all  expenses  incurred  by it  in  connection  with  its  servicing  activities
hereunder (including payment of premiums for the Primary Insurance Policies,  if
any,  to the extent  such  premiums  are not  required to be paid by the related
Mortgagors,  and the fees and  expenses of the Trustee  and any  Custodian)  and
shall not be entitled to reimbursement  therefor except as specifically provided
in Sections 3.10 and 3.14.

        (d) The Master  Servicer's right to receive  servicing  compensation may
not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of
all of its  responsibilities  and  obligations of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement.

        (e)  Notwithstanding  clauses (a) and (b) above, the amount of servicing
compensation  that the Master  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to receive  for its
activities hereunder for the period ending on


                                              87

<PAGE>



each  Distribution Date shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal
to  Compensating  Interest (if any) for such  Distribution  Date. Such reduction
shall be applied during such period as follows:  first,  to any Servicing Fee or
Subservicing  Fee to which the Master  Servicer is entitled  pursuant to Section
3.10(a)(iii);  second,  to any income or gain  realized  from any  investment of
funds  held in the  Custodial  Account or the  Certificate  Account to which the
Master   Servicer  is  entitled   pursuant  to  Sections   3.07(c)  or  4.01(b),
respectively;  and third, to any amounts of servicing  compensation to which the
Master  Servicer is entitled  pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(v) or (vi). In making
such reduction, the Master Servicer will not withdraw from the Custodial Account
any such amount  representing  all or a portion of the Servicing Fee to which it
is entitled  pursuant to Section  3.10(a)(iii);  (ii) will not withdraw from the
Custodial Account or Certificate Account any such amount to which it is entitled
pursuant  to Section  3.07(c) or 4.01(b)  and (iii) will not  withdraw  from the
Custodial  Account  any such  amount of  servicing  compensation  to which it is
entitled   pursuant  to  Section   3.10(a)(v)  or  (vi).  With  respect  to  any
Distribution Date, (i) Compensating  Interest derived from Loan Group I shall be
used on such  Distribution Date to cover any Prepayment  Interest  Shortfalls on
the Group I Loans, (ii)  Compensating  Interest derived from Loan Group II shall
be used on such Distribution Date to cover any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on
the Group II Loans and (iii)  Compensating  Interest derived from Loan Group III
shall  be used on  such  Distribution  Date to  cover  any  Prepayment  Interest
Shortfalls on the Group III Loans.

        Section 3.17 Reports to the Trustee and the Depositor.

        Not later than fifteen  days after each  Distribution  Date,  the Master
Servicer  shall forward to the Trustee and the Depositor a statement,  certified
by a Servicing Officer,  setting forth the status of the Custodial Account as of
the close of business on such  Distribution  Date as it relates to the  Mortgage
Loans and showing,  for the period covered by such  statement,  the aggregate of
deposits in or withdrawals from the Custodial Account in respect of the Mortgage
Loans for each  category of deposit  specified in Section 3.07 and each category
of withdrawal specified in Section 3.10.

        Section  3.18 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

        The Master  Servicer will deliver to the Depositor and the Trustee on or
before March 31 of each year,  beginning  with the first March 31 that occurs at
least six months after the Cut-off Date, an Officers' Certificate stating, as to
each signer thereof,  that (i) a review of the activities of the Master Servicer
during the preceding  calendar  year related to its servicing of mortgage  loans
and of its  performance  under the pooling and servicing  agreements,  including
this Agreement, has been made under such officers' supervision, (ii) to the best
of such  officers'  knowledge,  based on such  review,  the Master  Servicer has
complied in all material respects with the minimum servicing standards set forth
in the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers and has fulfilled
all of its material  obligations in all material respects  throughout such year,
or, if there has been material  noncompliance with such servicing standards or a
default in the  fulfillment  in all  material  respects  of any such  obligation
relating to this  Agreement,  such statement shall include a description of such
noncompliance  or specify each such  default,  as the case may be, known to such
officer  and the  nature  and  status  thereof  and  (iii)  to the  best of such
officers' knowledge, each Subservicer has


                                              88

<PAGE>



complied in all material respects with the minimum servicing standards set forth
in the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers and has fulfilled
all of its material obligations under its Subservicing Agreement in all material
respects throughout such year, or if there has been material  noncompliance with
such  servicing  standards  or a  material  default in the  fulfillment  of such
obligations relating to this Agreement,  specifying such statement shall include
a description of such  noncompliance  or specify each such default,  as the case
may be, known to such officer and the nature and status thereof.

        Section  3.19 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report.

        On or before  March 31 of each year,  beginning  with the first March 31
that occurs at least six months after the Cut-off Date,  the Master  Servicer at
its expense shall cause a firm of independent  public accountants which shall be
members of the American  Institute of Certified Public  Accountants to furnish a
report to the Depositor  and the Trustee  stating its opinion that, on the basis
of an  examination  conducted  by such firm  substantially  in  accordance  with
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the  assertions  made  pursuant to Section 3.18  regarding  compliance  with the
minimum servicing  standards set forth in the Uniform Single Attestation Program
for Mortgage Bankers during the preceding calendar year are fairly stated in all
material respects,  subject to such exceptions and other qualifications that, in
the opinion of such firm, such  accounting  standards  require it to report.  In
rendering  such  statement,  such firm may rely,  as to matters  relating to the
direct servicing of mortgage loans by Subservicers,  upon comparable  statements
for examinations  conducted by independent public  accountants  substantially in
accordance  with standards  established  by the American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants  (rendered within one year of such statement) with respect to
such Subservicers.

        Section 3.20 Right of the Depositor in Respect of the Master Servicer.

        The Master Servicer shall afford the Depositor,  upon reasonable notice,
during  normal  business  hours access to all records  maintained  by the Master
Servicer  in  respect  of its rights  and  obligations  hereunder  and access to
officers of the Master Servicer responsible for such obligations.  Upon request,
the Master  Servicer shall furnish the Depositor with its most recent  financial
statements and such other information as the Master Servicer possesses regarding
its business,  affairs,  property and  condition,  financial or  otherwise.  The
Master   Servicer  shall  also  cooperate  with  all  reasonable   requests  for
information  including,  but not limited to, notices, tapes and copies of files,
regarding  itself,  the Mortgage  Loans or the  Certificates  from any Person or
Persons identified by the Depositor or Residential  Funding.  The Depositor may,
but is not obligated to perform,  or cause a designee to perform,  any defaulted
obligation of the Master Servicer hereunder or exercise the rights of the Master
Servicer  hereunder;  provided that the Master Servicer shall not be relieved of
any of its obligations  hereunder by virtue of such performance by the Depositor
or its designee.  The Depositor shall not have the  responsibility  or liability
for any action or failure to act by the Master  Servicer and is not obligated to
supervise  the  performance  of the  Master  Servicer  under this  Agreement  or
otherwise.

invest or cause the institution  maintaining  the Certificate  Account to invest
the funds in the Certificate Account in Permitted Investments  designated in the
name of the  Trustee  for the  benefit of the  Certificateholders,  which  shall

following  the date of such  investment  (except that (i) any  investment in the
institution with which the Certificate  Account is maintained may mature on such

        Certificates)  pro rata in accordance with their respective  outstanding
        Certificate  Principal  Balances,  (ii) the  remaining  Group II  Senior
        Principal  Distribution  Amount  will be  distributed  to the  Group  II

        accordance  with  their  respective  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
        Balances,  (iii) the remaining Group III Senior  Principal  Distribution
        Amount will be  distributed  to the Group III  Certificates  pro rata in
        accordance  with  their  respective  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
        Balances,  (iv) the related Senior Interest  Distribution Amount will be
        distributed as described in Section  4.02(a)(i)(X),  (Y) and (Z) and (v)
        an  amount  equal to the  related  Discount  Fraction  of the  principal
        portion of scheduled  payments and unscheduled  collections  received or
        advanced  in  respect  of  related  Discount   Mortgage  Loans  will  be
        distributed to the Class AP-I Certificates and Class AP-II Certificates,
        as applicable.

        (c) In  addition to the  foregoing  distributions,  with  respect to any
Mortgage Loan that was  previously  the subject of a Cash  Liquidation or an REO
Disposition that resulted in a Realized Loss, in the event that within two years
of the date on which such  Realized  Loss was  determined  to have  occurred the
Master Servicer receives amounts which the Master Servicer  reasonably  believes
to represent subsequent recoveries (net of any related liquidation expenses), or
determines that it holds surplus amounts previously  reserved to cover estimated
expenses specifically related to such Mortgage Loan (including,  but not limited
to,  recoveries  (net of any  related  liquidation  expenses)  in respect of the
representations  and  warranties  made by the  related  Seller  pursuant  to the
applicable  Seller's  Agreement),  the Master  Servicer  shall  distribute  such
amounts to the Class or Classes to which such Realized Loss was allocated  (with
the  amounts  to be  distributed  allocated  among  such  Classes  in  the  same
proportions as such Realized Loss was allocated),  and within each such Class to
the Certificateholders of record as of the Record Date immediately preceding the
date of such  distribution  (or if  such  Class  of  Certificates  is no  longer
outstanding,  to the Certificateholders of record at the time that such Realized
Loss was allocated) with respect to the Certificates of any Class, on a pro rata
basis based on the Percentage  Interest  represented by each Certificate of such
Class as of such Record Date; provided that no such distribution to any Class of
Certificates of subsequent  recoveries  related to a Mortgage Loan shall exceed,
either individually or in the aggregate and together with any other amounts paid
in reimbursement therefor, the amount of the


                                              97

related Realized Loss that was allocated to such Class of Certificates.

        (d) Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry  Certificate shall be
paid  to the  Depository,  as  Holder  thereof,  and  the  Depository  shall  be
responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution to the accounts of its
Depository   Participants  in  accordance  with  its  normal  procedures.   Each
Depository  Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such distribution to
the  Certificate  Owners that it represents  and to each indirect  participating
brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect  participating  firm") for which
it acts as agent.  Each brokerage firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds
to  the  Certificate  Owners  that  it  represents.  None  of the  Trustee,  the
Certificate  Registrar,  the  Depositor  or the Master  Servicer  shall have any
responsibility  therefor  except as  otherwise  provided  by this  Agreement  or
applicable law.

        (e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01, if the Master Servicer
anticipates that a final  distribution with respect to any Class of Certificates
will be made on the next Distribution  Date, the Master Servicer shall, no later
than the Determination Date in the month of such final distribution,  notify the
Trustee and the Trustee  shall,  no later than two (2) Business  Days after such
Determination  Date,  mail  on  such  date  to each  Holder  of  such  Class  of
Certificates a notice to the effect that: (i) the Trustee  anticipates  that the
final  distribution  with respect to such Class of Certificates  will be made on
such  Distribution  Date  but  only  upon  presentation  and  surrender  of such
Certificates at the office of the Trustee or as otherwise specified therein, and
(ii) no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from and after the end of the
prior calendar month. In the event that Certificateholders required to surrender
their   Certificates   pursuant  to  Section  9.01(c)  do  not  surrender  their
Certificates for final cancellation, the Trustee shall cause funds distributable
with respect to such  Certificates to be withdrawn from the Certificate  Account
and   credited   to  a  separate   escrow   account  for  the  benefit  of  such
Certificateholders as provided in Section 9.01(d).

The  determination  by the Master Servicer of such amounts shall, in the absence
of  obvious  error,  be  presumptively  deemed to be  correct  for all  purposes
hereunder  and the Trustee  shall be  protected in relying upon the same without
any independent check or verification.

        (b) On or before  2:00 P.M.  New York time on each  Certificate  Account
Deposit Date, the Master  Servicer  shall either (i) deposit in the  Certificate
Account from its own funds, or funds received therefor from the Subservicers, an
amount equal to the Advances to be made by the Master Servicer in respect of the
related  Distribution  Date,  which shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the
aggregate  amount of  Monthly  Payments  (with  each  interest  portion  thereof
adjusted to a per annum rate equal to the Net Mortgage Rate), less the amount of
any related Servicing  Modifications,  Debt Service  Reductions or reductions in
the amount of interest collectable from the Mortgagor pursuant to the Relief Act
or  similar  legislation  or  regulations  then in  effect,  on the  Outstanding
Mortgage  Loans as of the related  Due Date in the  related  Due  Period,  which
Monthly  Payments  were due during the related Due Period and not received as of
the close of business as of the related  Determination  Date;  provided  that no
Advance  shall be made if it would be a  Nonrecoverable  Advance,  (ii) withdraw

Amount  Held for Future  Distribution  so used shall be  replaced  by the Master
Servicer by deposit in the Certificate  Account on or before 11:00 A.M. New York
time on any future  Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date to the extent that funds
attributable  to the Mortgage Loans that are available in the Custodial  Account
for deposit in the Certificate  Account on such Certificate Account Deposit Date
shall be less than  payments  to  Certificateholders  required to be made on the
following  Distribution  Date. The Master  Servicer shall be entitled to use any
Advance made by a  Subservicer  as  described  in Section  3.07(b) that has been
deposited in the Custodial  Account on or before such  Distribution Date as part
of the Advance made by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.04.

        The   determination   by  the  Master   Servicer  that  it  has  made  a
Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute a
Nonrecoverable  Advance,  shall be  evidenced  by a  certificate  of a Servicing
Officer delivered to the Depositor and the Trustee.

        In the event that the Master Servicer  determines as of the Business Day
preceding any Certificate Account Deposit Date that it will be unable to deposit
in the  Certificate  Account an amount equal to the Advance  required to be made
for the immediately  succeeding  Distribution  Date, it shall give notice to the
Trustee of its inability to advance (such notice may be given by telecopy),  not
later than 3:00 P.M.,  New York  time,  on such  Business  Day,  specifying  the
portion of such amount  that it will be unable to  deposit.  Not later than 3:00
P.M., New York time, on the Certificate  Account Deposit Date the Trustee shall,
unless by 12:00 Noon,  New York time,  on such day the  Trustee  shall have been
notified in writing (by telecopy)  that the Master  Servicer shall have directly
or indirectly deposited in the Certificate Account such portion of the amount of
the Advance as to which the Master  Servicer shall have given notice pursuant to
the  preceding  sentence,  pursuant to Section  7.01,  (a)  terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Master Servicer under this

Agreement  in  accordance  with  Section  7.01 and (b)  assume  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Master  Servicer  hereunder,  including  the  obligation  to

immediately succeeding Distribution Date.

4.04 into the Certificate Account.

the Class  M-II-1  Certificates  and Class  M-II-1  Certificates,  on a pro rata
basis,  until the Certificate  Principal  Balances  thereof have been reduced to
zero;  provided  however that such losses will be so allocated  pursuant to this
provision  solely to the extent of the  remaining  Special  Hazard Loss  Amount,
Bankruptcy  Amount  or  Fraud  Loss  Amount,  as  applicable,   related  to  the
certificate  group to which these losses are  allocated and to the extent of the
Certificate   Principal   Balance  of  the  Class  B  Certificates  or  Class  M
Certificates  related to that Loan Group,  and thereafter shall be allocated pro

applicable.

        As used herein,  an  allocation of a Realized Loss on a "pro rata basis"
among two or more specified Classes of Certificates means an allocation on a pro
rata  basis,  among the  various  Classes  so  specified,  to each such Class of
Certificates  on the  basis  of their  then  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
Balances prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such Distribution
Date in the case of the  principal  portion of a  Realized  Loss or based on the
Accrued Certificate  Interest thereon payable on such Distribution Date (without
regard to any Compensating  Interest for such Distribution  Date) in the case of
an interest portion of a Realized Loss.

        Furthermore,  any allocation of an Excess  Bankruptcy Loss, Excess Fraud
Loss  or  Excess  Special  Hazard  Loss as  specified  in the  second  preceding
paragraph shall be accomplished according to the following provisions:

               (i) any  allocation of an Excess  Bankruptcy  Loss,  Excess Fraud
        Loss  or  Excess  Special  Hazard  Loss  on a "pro  rata"  basis  to two
        Subordinate  Certificates,  each of a non- related Loan Group,  shall be
        allocated  among  such  Subordinated  Certificates  according  to  their
        Certificate  Principal  Balances  prior  to any  distributions  on  such
        Distribution Date, but after application of any Realized Losses from the
        related Loan Group of each such Subordinate Certificate;

               (ii) any  allocation of Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess Fraud
        Losses or Excess Special Hazard Losses from two non-related  Loan Groups
        to a  Subordinate  Certificate  shall be allocated  to such  Subordinate
        Certificate from each non-related Loan Group on a pro rata basis,  based
        on the  amount of such  Excess  Bankruptcy  Loss,  Excess  Fraud Loss or
        Excess Special Hazard Loss from each such non-related Loan Group; and

               (iii) if on any Distribution  Date the aggregate amount of Excess
        Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess Fraud Losses or Excess Special Hazard Losses
        to be  allocated  from two  non-  related  Loan  Groups  to a Class  M-1
        Certificate  is  greater  than  the  outstanding  Certificate  Principal
        Balance  of  such  Class  prior  to such  allocation,  then  the  Excess
        Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess Fraud Losses or Excess Special Hazard Losses
        shall be allocated  from such non-  related  Loan Groups,  on a pro rata
        basis  based on the  respective  amounts  of Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses,
        Excess Fraud Losses or Excess Special Hazard Losses, in an aggregate


                                             104

<PAGE>



        amount  necessary to reduce the  Certificate  Principal  Balance of such
        Class  M-1  Certificate  to zero,  and any  remaining  amount  of Excess
        Bankruptcy  Losses,  Excess Fraud Losses or Excess Special Hazard Losses
        shall be  allocated to the Senior  Certificates  (other than the related
        Discount  Fraction  of the  principal  portion of any  Excess  Loss on a
        Discount  Mortgage  Loan  which  will be  allocated  to the  Class  AP-I
        Certificates or Class AP-II Certificates) of the related Loan Group.

        (c) Any  allocation of the principal  portion of Realized  Losses (other
than  Debt  Service  Reductions)  to the  Class A,  Class R,  Class M or Class B
Certificates shall be made by reducing the Certificate Principal Balance thereof
by the amount so allocated, which allocation shall be deemed to have occurred on
such Distribution Date.  Allocations of the interest portions of Realized Losses
shall be made by operation of the definition of "Accrued  Certificate  Interest"
and by operation of the priority of payment  provisions of Section 4.02(a).  All
Realized  Losses  and all  other  losses  allocated  to a Class of  Certificates
hereunder will be allocated  among the  Certificates of such Class in proportion
to the Percentage Interests evidenced thereby.

        (d) All Realized Losses on the Mortgage Loans shall be allocated on each
Distribution Date to the following REMIC I Regular  Interests,  REMIC II Regular
Interests  and REMIC III  Regular  Interests:  (a) with  respect  to the Group I
Loans,  concurrently  to REMIC I  Regular  Interest  LT-IA1  and REMIC I Regular
Interest  LT-IA2  until the  Certificate  Principal  Balances  thereof have been
reduced to zero;  (b) with  respect  to the Group II Loans,  to REMIC II Regular
Interest LT-II until the Certificate  Principal Balance thereof has been reduced
to zero;  and (c) with  respect  to the Group III  Loans,  to REMIC III  Regular
Interest  LT-III  until the  Certificate  Principal  Balance has been reduced to
zero.

     Section 4.06 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonment of Mortgaged Property.

        The Master Servicer or the Subservicers  shall file information  returns
with  respect  to the  receipt  of  mortgage  interest  received  in a trade  or
business, the reports of foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property
and the  informational  returns relating to cancellation of indebtedness  income
with respect to any Mortgaged  Property  required by Sections  6050H,  6050J and
6050P of the  Code,  respectively,  and  deliver  to the  Trustee  an  Officers'
Certificate  on or before  March 31 of each year  stating that such reports have
been filed.  Such reports shall be in form and substance  sufficient to meet the
reporting  requirements  imposed by such Sections 6050H,  6050J and 6050P of the
Code.

        Section  4.07 Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

        As to any  Mortgage  Loan which is  delinquent  in payment by 90 days or
more, the Master  Servicer may, at its option,  purchase such Mortgage Loan from
the Trustee at the Purchase  Price  therefor;  provided,  that any such Mortgage
Loan that becomes 90 days or more delinquent  during any given Calendar  Quarter
shall only be eligible for purchase  pursuant to this Section  during the period
beginning  on the first  Business Day of the  following  Calendar  Quarter,  and
ending at the


                                             105

<PAGE>



close of business on the second-to-last  Business Day of such following Calendar
Quarter.  Such option if not exercised  shall not thereafter be reinstated as to
any  Mortgage  Loan,  unless  the  delinquency  is cured and the  Mortgage  Loan
thereafter  again  becomes  delinquent  in  payment  by 90  days  or  more  in a
subsequent  Calendar Quarter. If at any time the Master Servicer makes a payment
to the Certificate  Account covering the amount of the Purchase Price for such a
Mortgage Loan, and the Master  Servicer  provides to the Trustee a certification
signed by a Servicing  Officer  stating that the amount of such payment has been
deposited  in the  Certificate  Account,  then the  Trustee  shall  execute  the
assignment of such Mortgage Loan at the request of the Master  Servicer  without
recourse to the Master Servicer which shall succeed to all the Trustee's  right,
title and interest in and to such Mortgage  Loan, and all security and documents
relative  thereto.  Such assignment shall be an assignment  outright and not for
security.  The Master  Servicer will thereupon own such  Mortgage,  and all such
security and  documents,  free of any further  obligation  to the Trustee or the
Certificateholders with respect thereto.

        Section  4.08  Distributions  on  the  Uncertificated  REMIC  I  Regular
Interests.

        (a) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall be deemed to distribute
to itself, as the holder of the Uncertificated  REMIC I Regular  Interests,  the
Uncertificated  REMIC II  Regular  Interests  and the  Uncertificated  REMIC III
Regular Interests, Uncertificated Accrued Interest on the Uncertificated REMIC I
Regular  Interests,  the  Uncertificated  REMIC  II  Regular  Interests  and the
Uncertificated  REMIC III Regular Interests for such Distribution Date, plus any
Uncertificated REMIC I, REMIC II or REMIC III Accrued Interest thereon remaining
unpaid  from  any  previous  Distribution  Date  in  the  same  manner  as it is
distributed to the Corresponding Certificate.

        (b) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall be deemed to distribute
to itself, as the holder of the Uncertificated  REMIC I Regular  Interests,  the
Uncertificated  REMIC II  Regular  Interests  and the  Uncertificated  REMIC III
Regular Interests, as principal on the Uncertificated REMIC I Regular Interests,
the Uncertificated  REMIC II Regular Interests and the Uncertificated  REMIC III
Regular  Interests,  an amount  equal to the sum of the amounts  distributed  as
principal  on the  Certificates  (other  than the  Class R  Certificates)  under
Sections  4.02(a)(ii),  (iv), (vi),  (viii),  (x), (xii), (xiv) and (xv), in the
same manner as such amounts are distributed to the Corresponding Certificates.

        (c) In  determining  from time to time the amounts to be  distributed to
the  Uncertificated  REMIC I  Regular  Interests,  the  Uncertificated  REMIC II
Regular Interests and the Uncertificated  REMIC III Regular Interests,  Realized
Losses allocated under Section 4.05 shall be deemed allocated to  Uncertificated
REMIC I Regular Interests, the Uncertificated REMIC II Regular Interests and the
Uncertificated  REMIC III Regular Interests for the related Distribution Date in
the same manner as allocated to the Corresponding Certificates.

        (d) Notwithstanding the deemed distributions on the Uncertificated REMIC
I Regular  Interests,  the  Uncertificated  REMIC II Regular  Interests  and the
Uncertificated  REMIC III Regular  Interests  described  in this  Section  4.08,
distributions of funds from the Certificate Account shall be


                                             106

made only in accordance with Section 4.02.

        Section  4.09 Surety Bond.

        (a) If a Required Surety Payment is payable  pursuant to the Surety Bond
with respect to any Additional  Collateral  Loan,  the Master  Servicer shall so
notify the  Trustee as soon as  reasonably  practicable  and the  Trustee  shall
promptly  complete the notice in the form of Attachment 1 to the Surety Bond and
shall  promptly  submit  such  notice to the  Surety  as a claim for a  Required
Surety.  The Master Servicer shall upon request assist the Trustee in completing
such  notice and shall  provide  any  information  requested  by the  Trustee in
connection therewith.

        (b) Upon receipt of a Required  Surety Payment from the Surety on behalf
of the Holders of  Certificates,  the Trustee shall deposit such Required Surety
Payment in the  Certificate  Account and shall  distribute  such Required Surety
Payment,  or the proceeds thereof,  in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.02.

        (c) The Trustee shall (i) receive as  attorney-in-fact of each Holder of
a Certificate  any Required Surety Payment from the Surety and (ii) disburse the
same to the Holders of such Certificates as set forth in Section 4.02.

        (d) The Depositor  hereby directs the Trustee to acknowledge  and accept
the  Assignment  and Notice of Transfer  attached as  Attachment 2 to the Surety
Bond.

                                THE CERTIFICATES

        Section  5.01 The Certificates.

        (a) The Class A  Certificates  (other than the Class AP-I,  Class AP-II,
Class AV-I and Class  AV-II  Certificates),  Class AP-I  Certificates  and Class
AP-II Certificates,  Class AV-I Certificates and Class AV-II Certificates, Class
M  Certificates,  Class  B  Certificates  and  Class  R  Certificates  shall  be
substantially  in the forms set forth in  Exhibits  A-1,  A-2,  A-3, B, C and D,
respectively,  and shall,  on original  issue,  be executed and delivered by the
Trustee to the Certificate  Registrar for authentication and delivery to or upon
the order of the Depositor upon receipt by the Trustee or one or more Custodians
of the documents  specified in Section  2.01.  The Class A (other than the Class
A-I-3  Certificates),  Class M-I-1, Class M-II-1 and Class M-III-1  Certificates
shall be  issuable  in minimum  dollar  denominations  of $25,000  and  integral
multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Class M-I-2, Class M-II-2, Class M-III-2,
Class M-I-3, Class M-II-3, Class M-III-3,  Class B-I-1, Class B-I-2, Class B-I-3
, Class B-II-1,  Class B-II-2,  Class B-II-3,  Class B-III-1,  Class B-III-2 and
Class B-III-3  Certificates shall be issuable in minimum dollar denominations of
$250,000 and integral  multiples of $1 in excess thereof,  except in the case of
the Class  B-I-1,  Class B-I-2,  Class  B-II-1,  Class B-II-2 and Class  B-III-2
Certificates  which will be issued in minimum  original  denominations  equal to
their  respective  initial  Certificate  Principal  Balances.  The  Class  A-I-3
Certificates  and  each  Class  of  Class R  Certificates  shall  be  issued  in
registered,  certificated  form in minimum  percentage  interests  of 20.00% and
integral multiples of 0.01% in excess thereof; provided, however, that one Class
R Certificate of each Class will be issuable to the REMIC  Administrator as "tax
matters  person"  pursuant  to  Section  10.01(c)  in  a  minimum   denomination
representing a Percentage Interest of not less than 0.01%.

        The Certificates  shall be executed by manual or facsimile  signature on
behalf of an authorized officer of the Trustee.  Certificates bearing the manual
or facsimile  signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers
of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee,  notwithstanding that such individuals or
any of them have ceased to hold such  offices  prior to the  authentication  and
delivery of such  Certificate  or did not hold such  offices at the date of such
Certificates.  No  Certificate  shall be  entitled  to any  benefit  under  this
Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate
a certificate of  authentication  substantially  in the form provided for herein
executed by the Certificate Registrar by manual signature,  and such certificate
upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence,  and the only evidence,  that
such  Certificate  has been duly  authenticated  and  delivered  hereunder.  All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

        (b) The Class A and Class M  Certificates  shall  initially be issued as
one or more Certificates registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee
and, except as provided  below,  registration  of such  Certificates  may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository that agrees to hold such
Certificates for the respective Certificate Owners with Ownership Interests


                                             108

therein.  The Certificate Owners shall hold their respective Ownership Interests
in and to each Class A or Class M Certificate, through the book-entry facilities
of the  Depository  and,  except as  provided  below,  shall not be  entitled to
Definitive Certificates in respect of such Ownership Interests. All transfers by
Certificate  Owners of their  respective  Ownership  Interests in the Book-Entry
Certificates shall be made in accordance with the procedures  established by the
Depository  Participant or brokerage firm representing  such Certificate  Owner.
Each Depository  Participant shall transfer the Ownership  Interests only in the
Book-Entry  Certificates  of  Certificate  Owners it  represents or of brokerage
firms  for which it acts as agent in  accordance  with the  Depository's  normal
procedures.

        The Trustee,  the Master Servicer and the Depositor may for all purposes
(including  the making of payments due on the  respective  Classes of Book-Entry
Certificates)  deal with the Depository as the authorized  representative of the
Certificate  Owners  with  respect  to  the  respective  Classes  of  Book-Entry
Certificates  for the purposes of  exercising  the rights of  Certificateholders
hereunder.  The rights of  Certificate  Owners  with  respect to the  respective
Classes of Book-Entry  Certificates shall be limited to those established by law
and agreements between such Certificate  Owners and the Depository  Participants
and brokerage firms representing such Certificate Owners.  Multiple requests and
directions  from,  and votes of, the  Depository as Holder of any Class of Book-
Entry  Certificates  with respect to any  particular  matter shall not be deemed
inconsistent if they are made with respect to different  Certificate Owners. The
Trustee may establish a reasonable record date in connection with  solicitations
of consents  from or voting by  Certificateholders  and shall give notice to the
Depository of such record date.

        If  (i)(A)  the  Depositor  advises  the  Trustee  in  writing  that the
Depository   is  no  longer   willing  or  able  to   properly   discharge   its
responsibilities  as  Depository  and (B) the  Depositor  is  unable to locate a
qualified  successor or (ii) the Depositor at its option  advises the Trustee in
writing  that  it  elects  to  terminate  the  book-entry   system  through  the
Depository,  the  Trustee  shall  notify all  Certificate  Owners,  through  the
Depository,  of the  occurrence  of any such  event and of the  availability  of
Definitive   Certificates  to  Certificate  Owners  requesting  the  same.  Upon
surrender  to the  Trustee of the  Book-Entry  Certificates  by the  Depository,
accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository for registration of
transfer,  the Trustee  shall  issue the  Definitive  Certificates.  Neither the
Depositor,  the Master  Servicer nor the Trustee shall be liable for any actions
taken by the Depository or its nominee, including, without limitation, any delay
in  delivery of such  instructions  and may  conclusively  rely on, and shall be
protected  in relying on, such  instructions.  Upon the  issuance of  Definitive
Certificates  all  references  herein  to  obligations  imposed  upon  or  to be
performed by the  Depositor in  connection  with the issuance of the  Definitive
Certificates  pursuant to this  Section  5.01 shall be deemed to be imposed upon
and  performed by the  Trustee,  and the Trustee and the Master  Servicer  shall
recognize  the  Holders of the  Definitive  Certificates  as  Certificateholders
hereunder.

        (c) Each of the Certificates is intended to be a "security"  governed by
Article 8 of the Uniform  Commercial  Code as in effect in the State of New York
and any other applicable  jurisdiction,  to the extent that any of such laws may
be applicable.

        Section  5.02 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.

        (a) The Trustee shall cause to be kept at one of the offices or agencies
to be appointed by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.12
a Certificate  Register in which,  subject to such reasonable  regulations as it
may prescribe,  the Trustee shall provide for the  registration  of Certificates
and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein  provided.  The Trustee
is initially  appointed  Certificate  Registrar  for the purpose of  registering
Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The
Certificate Registrar,  or the Trustee, shall provide the Master Servicer with a
certified list of Certificateholders as of each Record Date prior to the related
Determination Date.

        (b) Upon surrender for  registration  of transfer of any  Certificate at
any office or agency of the  Trustee  maintained  for such  purpose  pursuant to
Section 8.12 and, in the case of any Class R Certificate,  upon  satisfaction of
the  conditions set forth below,  the Trustee shall execute and the  Certificate
Registrar  shall  authenticate  and  deliver,  in the  name  of  the  designated
transferee  or  transferees,  one or more new  Certificates  of a like Class and
aggregate Percentage Interest.

        (c)  At  the  option  of  the  Certificateholders,  Certificates  may be
exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like Class and
aggregate  Percentage  Interest,  upon  surrender  of  the  Certificates  to  be
exchanged  at any such  office  or  agency.  Whenever  any  Certificates  are so
surrendered for exchange the Trustee shall execute and the Certificate Registrar
shall  authenticate  and  deliver  the  Certificates  of such  Class  which  the
Certificateholder  making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate
presented or  surrendered  for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the
Trustee or the Certificate  Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by
a written  instrument  of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

        (d) No  transfer,  sale,  pledge  or  other  disposition  of a  Class  B
Certificate  shall  be  made  unless  such  transfer,   sale,  pledge  or  other
disposition is exempt from the  registration  requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),  and any applicable  state securities laws
or is made in accordance with said Act and laws. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section  5.02(d),  in the event that a transfer of a Class B Certificate is
to be made, (i) unless the Depositor directs the Trustee otherwise,  the Trustee
shall  require  a  written  Opinion  of  Counsel  acceptable  to and in form and
substance  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the Depositor that such transfer may
be made pursuant to an exemption,  describing the  applicable  exemption and the
basis therefor, from said Act and laws or is being made pursuant to said Act and
laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee, the Trust
Fund, the Depositor or the Master  Servicer,  and (ii) the Trustee shall require
the transferee to execute a representation letter,  substantially in the form of
Exhibit I hereto,  and the Trustee  shall  require the  transferor  to execute a
representation  letter,  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit J  hereto,  each
acceptable  to and in form and substance  satisfactory  to the Depositor and the
Trustee  certifying to the Depositor and the Trustee the facts  surrounding such
transfer,  which representation  letters shall not be an expense of the Trustee,
the  Trust  Fund,  the  Depositor  or  the  Master  Servicer.  In  lieu  of  the
requirements set forth in the


                                             110

preceding sentence,  transfers of Class B Certificates may be made in accordance
with this Section  5.02(d) if the  prospective  transferee of such a Certificate
provides  the  Trustee  and  the  Master  Servicer  with  an  investment  letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit N attached hereto,  which investment letter
shall not be an expense of the Trustee,  the Depositor,  or the Master Servicer,
and which investment letter states that, among other things, such transferee (i)
is a "qualified  institutional buyer" as defined under Rule 144A, acting for its
own account or the accounts of other "qualified institutional buyers" as defined
under Rule 144A, and (ii) is aware that the proposed  transferor intends to rely
on the exemption from registration  requirements  under the 1933 Act provided by
Rule 144A. The Holder of a Class B Certificate  desiring to effect any transfer,
sale, pledge or other disposition shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee,  the  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer  and the  Certificate  Registrar
against any  liability  that may result if the transfer,  sale,  pledge or other
disposition is not so exempt or is not made in accordance  with such federal and
state laws and this Agreement.

        (e) (i) In the case of any Class B or Class R Certificate  presented for
registration in the name of any Person,  either (i) the Trustee shall require an
Opinion of Counsel  acceptable to and in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Trustee,  the Depositor and the Master  Servicer to the effect that the purchase
or  holding  of  such  Class B or  Class  R  Certificate  is  permissible  under
applicable  law,  will not  constitute  or result in any  non-exempt  prohibited
transaction  under  Section  406 of  ERISA,  or  Section  4975 of the  Code  (or
comparable  provisions of any subsequent  enactments),  and will not subject the
Trustee,  the  Depositor or the Master  Servicer to any  obligation or liability
(including  obligations or liabilities  under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
in addition to those  undertaken  in this  Agreement,  which  Opinion of Counsel
shall not be an expense of the Trustee,  the Depositor or the Master Servicer or
(ii) the prospective  transferee  shall be required to provide the Trustee,  the
Depositor and the Master Servicer with a  certification  to the effect set forth
in Exhibit O (with respect to a Class B Certificate),  or in paragraph  fourteen
of Exhibit H-1 (with  respect to a Class R  Certificate),  which the Trustee may
rely upon without further inquiry or investigation, or such other certifications
as the Trustee may deem  desirable or necessary in order to establish  that such
transferee or the Person in whose name such registration is requested either (a)
is not an  employee  benefit  plan  or  other  plan  subject  to the  prohibited
transaction  provisions  of ERISA or  Section  4975 of the Code,  or any  Person
(including an insurance company  investing its general  accounts,  an investment
manager,  a named  fiduciary  or a trustee of any such plan) who is using  "plan
assets" of any such plan to effect such acquisition (each, a "Plan Investor") or
(b) in  the  case  of a  Class  B  Certificate,  the  following  conditions  are
satisfied: (i) such Transferee is an insurance company, (ii) the source of funds
used to purchase or hold such Certificate (or interest therein) is an "insurance
company  general  account" (as defined in U.S.  Department  of Labor  Prohibited
Transaction  Class Exemption  ("PTCE") 95-60, and (iii) the conditions set forth
in  Sections I and III of PTCE  95-60  have been  satisfied  (each  entity  that
satisfies this clause (b), a "Complying Insurance Company").

        (f) Any  Transferee  of a Class M  Certificate  will be  deemed  to have
represented  by  virtue of its  purchase  or  holding  of such  Certificate  (or
interest therein) that either (a) such Transferee is not a Plan Investor, (b) it
has acquired and is holding such Certificate in reliance on Prohibited


                                             111

Transaction  Exemption  ("PTE") 94-29,  59 Fed. Reg. 14674 (March 29, 1994),  as
amended by PTE 97-34,  62 Fed. Reg. 39021 (July 21, 1997),  and PTE 2000-58,  65
Fed. Reg. 67765  (November 13, 2000) and PTE 2002-41,  67 Fed Reg. 54487 (August
22, 2002) (the "RFC Exemption"),  and that it understands that there are certain
conditions  to the  availability  of  the  RFC  Exemption  including  that  such
Certificate  must be rated,  at the time of purchase,  not lower than "BBB-" (or
its equivalent) by Standard & Poor's, Fitch or Moody's or (c) such Transferee is
a Complying Insurance Company.

        (g) (A) If any Class M Certificate (or any interest therein) is acquired
or held by any  Person  that  does  not  satisfy  the  conditions  described  in
paragraph (ii) above, then the last preceding  Transferee that either (i) is not
a Plan  Investor,  (ii) acquired  such  Certificate  in compliance  with the RFC
Exemption,  or (iii) is a Complying Insurance Company shall be restored,  to the
extent  permitted by law, to all rights and  obligations  as  Certificate  Owner
thereof  retroactive  to the date of such Transfer of such Class M  Certificate.
The Trustee  shall be under no  liability  to any Person for making any payments
due on such Certificate to such preceding Transferee.

        (B) Any purported  Certificate Owner whose acquisition or holding of any
Class M  Certificate  (or  interest  therein)  was  effected in violation of the
restrictions  in this Section  5.02(e)  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless the
Company, the Trustee, the Master Servicer,  any Subservicer,  and the Trust Fund
from and against any and all liabilities,  claims, costs or expenses incurred by
such parties as a result of such acquisition or holding.

        (h) (i) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership  Interest in a
Class R Certificate  shall be deemed by the  acceptance or  acquisition  of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to
have  irrevocably  authorized the Trustee or its designee under clause  (iii)(A)
below to deliver  payments to a Person  other than such Person and to  negotiate
the terms of any mandatory  sale under clause  (iii)(B) below and to execute all
instruments of transfer and to do all other things  necessary in connection with
any such sale. The rights of each Person  acquiring any Ownership  Interest in a
Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:

                      (A)  Each  Person   holding  or  acquiring  any  Ownership
               Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee
               and shall promptly  notify the Trustee of any change or impending
               change in its status as a Permitted Transferee.

                      (B)  In  connection  with  any  proposed  Transfer  of any
               Ownership  Interest in a Class R  Certificate,  the Trustee shall
               require  delivery to it, and shall not  register  the Transfer of
               any Class R  Certificate  until its receipt of, (I) an  affidavit
               and agreement (a "Transfer  Affidavit and Agreement," in the form
               attached hereto as Exhibit H-1) from the proposed Transferee,  in
               form  and  substance   satisfactory   to  the  Master   Servicer,
               representing  and  warranting,  among other things,  that it is a
               Permitted  Transferee,  that it is not  acquiring  its  Ownership
               Interest  in the Class R  Certificate  that is the subject of the
               proposed  Transfer as a nominee,  trustee or agent for any Person
               who is not a Permitted Transferee, that for so long as it retains
               its

               Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate,  it will endeavor to
               remain  a  Permitted  Transferee,  and that it has  reviewed  the
               provisions  of this  Section  5.02(f)  and  agrees to be bound by
               them,  and (II) a  certificate,  in the form  attached  hereto as
               Exhibit  H-2,  from the Holder  wishing to  transfer  the Class R
               Certificate,  in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Master
               Servicer,  representing and warranting,  among other things, that
               no purpose of the proposed  Transfer is to impede the  assessment
               or collection of tax.

                      (C)  Notwithstanding  the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit
               and Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if
               a  Responsible  Officer of the  Trustee  who is  assigned to this
               Agreement has actual  knowledge  that the proposed  Transferee is
               not a Permitted Transferee,  no Transfer of an Ownership Interest
               in a Class R  Certificate  to such proposed  Transferee  shall be
               effected.

                      (D)  Each  Person   holding  or  acquiring  any  Ownership
               Interest  in a Class R  Certificate  shall agree (x) to require a
               Transfer  Affidavit and  Agreement  from any other Person to whom
               such  Person  attempts to transfer  its  Ownership  Interest in a
               Class  R  Certificate  and  (y)  not to  transfer  its  Ownership
               Interest  unless it provides a certificate  to the Trustee in the
               form attached hereto as Exhibit H-2.

                      (E) Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest
               in a Class R Certificate,  by purchasing an Ownership Interest in
               such Certificate,  agrees to give the Trustee written notice that
               it is a "pass-  through  interest  holder"  within the meaning of
               Temporary  Treasury   Regulations   Section   1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A)
               immediately  upon  acquiring an  Ownership  Interest in a Class R
               Certificate,  if it is, or is holding an Ownership  Interest in a
               Class R  Certificate  on  behalf  of, a "pass-  through  interest
               holder."

               (ii) The  Trustee  will  register  the  Transfer  of any  Class R
        Certificate  only if it shall have  received the Transfer  Affidavit and
        Agreement,  a certificate of the Holder  requesting such transfer in the
        form attached  hereto as Exhibit H-2 and all of such other  documents as
        shall have been  reasonably  required by the  Trustee as a condition  to
        such  registration.  Transfers of the Class R Certificates to Non-United
        States  Persons and  Disqualified  Organizations  (as defined in Section
        860E(e)(5) of the Code) are prohibited.

               (iii) If any Disqualified Organization shall become a holder of a
        Class R Certificate,  then the last preceding Permitted Transferee shall
        be  restored,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  to all  rights  and
        obligations as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of
        such Transfer of such Class R Certificate. If a Non-United States Person
        shall become a holder of a Class R Certificate,  then the last preceding
        United States Person shall be restored,  to the extent permitted by law,
        to all rights and obligations as Holder thereof  retroactive to the date
        of  registration  of such  Transfer  of such Class R  Certificate.  If a
        transfer  of a  Class  R  Certificate  is  disregarded  pursuant  to the
        provisions of Treasury


                                             113

        Regulations  Section  1.860E-1  or  Section  1.860G-3,   then  the  last
        preceding  Permitted  Transferee  shall  be  restored,   to  the  extent
        permitted  by law,  to all  rights  and  obligations  as Holder  thereof
        retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of such Class R
        Certificate.  The Trustee  shall be under no liability to any Person for
        any  registration  of Transfer of a Class R Certificate  that is in fact
        not permitted by this Section  5.02(f) or for making any payments due on
        such  Certificate  to the holder  thereof or for taking any other action
        with respect to such holder under the provisions of this Agreement.

               (iv) If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class
        R Certificate in violation of the  restrictions  in this Section 5.02(f)
        and to the extent that the retroactive  restoration of the rights of the
        Holder of such Class R Certificate as described in clause (iii)(A) above
        shall be invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable,  then the Master  Servicer
        shall have the right,  without  notice to the holder or any prior holder
        of such  Class R  Certificate,  to sell such  Class R  Certificate  to a
        purchaser  selected  by the Master  Servicer on such terms as the Master
        Servicer may choose.  Such purported  Transferee  shall promptly endorse
        and deliver each Class R Certificate in accordance with the instructions
        of the Master Servicer. Such purchaser may be the Master Servicer itself
        or any Affiliate of the Master Servicer.  The proceeds of such sale, net
        of the commissions (which may include  commissions payable to the Master
        Servicer or its  Affiliates),  expenses  and taxes due, if any,  will be
        remitted by the Master Servicer to such purported Transferee.  The terms
        and  conditions  of  any  sale  under  this  clause  (iii)(B)  shall  be
        determined in the sole discretion of the Master Servicer, and the Master
        Servicer shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership  Interest
        in a Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.

               (v) The Master  Servicer,  on behalf of the  Trustee,  shall make
        available,  upon  written  request  from the  Trustee,  all  information
        necessary  to compute any tax imposed (A) as a result of the Transfer of
        an Ownership  Interest in a Class R  Certificate  to any Person who is a
        Disqualified  Organization,  including the information regarding "excess
        inclusions" of such Class R Certificates  required to be provided to the
        Internal  Revenue  Service and certain  Persons as described in Treasury
        Regulations  Sections  1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E- 2(a)(5),  and (B) as a
        result of any  regulated  investment  company,  real  estate  investment
        trust,  common trust fund,  partnership,  trust,  estate or organization
        described in Section  1381 of the Code that holds an Ownership  Interest
        in a Class R Certificate  having as among its record holders at any time
        any Person who is a Disqualified  Organization.  Reasonable compensation
        for providing such  information  may be required by the Master  Servicer
        from such Person.

               (vi) The  provisions  of this Section  5.02(f) set forth prior to
        this clause (v) may be modified,  added to or eliminated,  provided that
        there shall have been delivered to the Trustee the following:

                      (A) Written  notification  from each Rating  Agency to the
               effect that the modification,  addition to or elimination of such
               provisions will not cause such Rating


                                             114

               Agency to  downgrade  its  then-current  ratings,  if any, of the
               Class A, Class M or Class B  Certificates  below the lower of the
               then-current  rating or the rating assigned to such  Certificates
               as of the Closing Date by such Rating Agency; and

                      (B) A certificate of the Master Servicer  stating that the
               Master  Servicer has received an Opinion of Counsel,  in form and
               substance satisfactory to the Master Servicer, to the effect that
               such modification, addition to or absence of such provisions will
               not  cause  any of REMIC I,  REMIC  II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to
               cease to  qualify  as a REMIC and will not cause (x) any of REMIC
               I,  REMIC  II,  REMIC  III  or  REMIC  IV  to  be  subject  to an
               entity-level   tax  caused  by  the   Transfer  of  any  Class  R
               Certificate  to a Person that is a Disqualified  Organization  or
               (y) a  Certificateholder  or  another  Person to be  subject to a
               REMIC-related tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate
               to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.

        (i) No service  charge  shall be made for any  transfer  or  exchange of
Certificates  of any  Class,  but  the  Trustee  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover  any tax or  governmental  charge  that may be  imposed  in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

     (j) All  Certificates  surrendered  for  transfer  and  exchange  shall  be
destroyed by the Certificate Registrar.

        Section  5.03 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

        If (i) any  mutilated  Certificate  is  surrendered  to the  Certificate
Registrar,  or the Trustee and the  Certificate  Registrar  receive  evidence to
their  satisfaction of the destruction,  loss or theft of any  Certificate,  and
(ii) there is  delivered  to the  Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar  such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them  harmless,
then, in the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate  Registrar that
such  Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,  the Trustee shall
execute  and the  Certificate  Registrar  shall  authenticate  and  deliver,  in
exchange  for or in lieu  of any  such  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Certificate,  a new Certificate of like tenor, Class and Percentage Interest but
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate  under this  Section,  the  Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental  charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the
Trustee  and the  Certificate  Registrar)  connected  therewith.  Any  duplicate
Certificate  issued  pursuant to this  Section  shall  constitute  complete  and
indefeasible  evidence of ownership in the Trust Fund, as if originally  issued,
whether or not the lost,  stolen or destroyed  Certificate shall be found at any
time.

        Section  5.04 Persons Deemed Owners.

        Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Depositor,  the Master Servicer,  the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and
any agent of the Depositor,  the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar  may treat the Person in whose name any  Certificate  is registered as
the  owner  of such  Certificate  for the  purpose  of  receiving  distributions
pursuant to Section 4.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, except as and to
the extent  provided in the  definition  of  "Certificateholder"  and in Section
4.08,  and  neither  the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee,  the
Certificate Registrar nor any agent of the Depositor,  the Master Servicer,  the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary
except as provided in Section 5.02(f).

        Section  5.05 Appointment of Paying Agent.

        The  Trustee  may  appoint  a Paying  Agent  for the  purpose  of making
distributions  to  Certificateholders  pursuant to Section 4.02. In the event of
any such appointment,  on or prior to each Distribution Date the Master Servicer
on behalf of the Trustee shall deposit or cause to be deposited  with the Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to make the payments to Certificateholders in the amounts
and in the manner  provided for in Section 4.02 and 4.03, such sum to be held in
trust for the benefit of Certificateholders.

        The Trustee  shall cause each Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying  Agent shall agree with the Trustee
that  such  Paying  Agent  will  hold all  sums  held by it for the  payment  to
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the  Certificateholders  entitled
thereto  until such sums shall be paid to such  Certificateholders.  Any sums so
held by such Paying Agent shall be held only in Eligible  Accounts to the extent
such sums are not distributed to the  Certificateholders  on the date of receipt
by such Paying Agent.

                      THE DEPOSITOR AND THE MASTER SERVICER

     Section  6.01  Respective  Liabilities  of the  Depositor  and  the  Master
          Servicer.

        The Depositor and the Master Servicer shall each be liable in accordance
herewith only to the extent of the  obligations  specifically  and  respectively
imposed upon and undertaken by the Depositor and the Master Servicer herein.  By
way of  illustration  and not  limitation,  the  Depositor is not liable for the
servicing  and  administration  of the  Mortgage  Loans,  nor is it obligated by
Section  7.01 or 10.01 to assume any  obligations  of the Master  Servicer or to
appoint a designee  to assume such  obligations,  nor is it liable for any other
obligation  hereunder  that it may, but is not  obligated  to,  assume unless it
elects to assume such obligation in accordance herewith.

     Section  6.02  Merger  or  Consolidation  of the  Depositor  or the  Master
          Servicer;  Assignment  of Rights  and  Delegation  of Duties by Master
          Servicer.

        (a) The Depositor and the Master  Servicer will each keep in full effect
its  existence,  rights and  franchises as a  corporation  under the laws of the
state of its incorporation,  and will each obtain and preserve its qualification
to do  business  as a foreign  corporation  in each  jurisdiction  in which such
qualification   is  or  shall  be   necessary   to  protect  the   validity  and
enforceability of this Agreement,  the Certificates or any of the Mortgage Loans
and to perform its respective duties under this Agreement.

        (b) Any Person into which the  Depositor  or the Master  Servicer may be
merged  or  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting  from  any  merger  or
consolidation to which the Depositor or the Master Servicer shall be a party, or
any Person  succeeding to the business of the Depositor or the Master  Servicer,
shall be the successor of the Depositor or the Master Servicer,  as the case may
be,  hereunder,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act
on the  part of any of the  parties  hereto,  anything  herein  to the  contrary
notwithstanding;  provided,  however,  that the successor or surviving Person to
the Master  Servicer  shall be qualified to service  mortgage loans on behalf of
Fannie Mae or Freddie  Mac;  and  provided  further  that each  Rating  Agency's
ratings,  if any, of the Class A, Class R, Class M or Class B Certificates  will
not be  qualified,  reduced or withdrawn as a result  thereof (as evidenced by a
letter to such effect from each Rating Agency).

        (c) Notwithstanding  anything else in this Section 6.02 and Section 6.04
to the  contrary,  the Master  Servicer  may assign its rights and  delegate its
duties and obligations under this Agreement;  provided that the Person accepting
such  assignment or  delegation  shall be a Person which is qualified to service
mortgage   loans  on  behalf  of  Fannie  Mae  or  Freddie  Mac,  is  reasonably
satisfactory  to the  Trustee  and the  Depositor,  is willing  to  service  the
Mortgage  Loans and executes and  delivers to the  Depositor  and the Trustee an
agreement,  in form and substance  reasonably  satisfactory to the Depositor and
the Trustee, which contains an assumption by such Person of the due and punctual
performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or


                                             117

<PAGE>



observed by the Master Servicer under this Agreement; provided further that each
Rating Agency's  rating of the Classes of  Certificates  that have been rated in
effect  immediately  prior  to  such  assignment  and  delegation  will  not  be
qualified,  reduced or withdrawn as a result of such  assignment  and delegation
(as evidenced by a letter to such effect from each Rating  Agency).  In the case
of any such  assignment and  delegation,  the Master  Servicer shall be released
from its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Master Servicer shall
remain  liable for all  liabilities  and  obligations  incurred  by it as Master
Servicer  hereunder  prior  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  conditions  to  such
assignment and delegation set forth in the next preceding sentence.

     Section 6.03 Limitation on Liability of the Depositor,  the Master Servicer
          and Others.

        Neither the  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer nor any of the  directors,
officers,  employees or agents of the Depositor or the Master  Servicer shall be
under any liability to the Trust Fund or the  Certificateholders  for any action
taken or for refraining  from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to
this  Agreement,  or for  errors  in  judgment;  provided,  however,  that  this
provision  shall not  protect  the  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer or any such
Person  against any breach of warranties or  representations  made herein or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross  negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless
disregard  of  obligations  and  duties  hereunder.  The  Depositor,  the Master
Servicer and any  director,  officer,  employee or agent of the Depositor or the
Master  Servicer  may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie
properly  executed and submitted by any Person  respecting  any matters  arising
hereunder.  The  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and any  director,  officer,
employee or agent of the Depositor or the Master  Servicer  shall be indemnified
by the Trust  Fund and held  harmless  against  any loss,  liability  or expense
incurred in connection  with any legal action  relating to this Agreement or the
Certificates,  other than any loss, liability or expense related to any specific
Mortgage Loan or Mortgage  Loans (except as any such loss,  liability or expense
shall be  otherwise  reimbursable  pursuant  to this  Agreement)  and any  loss,
liability  or expense  incurred by reason of willful  misfeasance,  bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless
disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.

        Neither  the  Depositor  nor the  Master  Servicer  shall be  under  any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal or administrative action,
proceeding,  hearing or  examination  that is not  incidental to its  respective
duties  under this  Agreement  and which in its  opinion  may  involve it in any
expense  or  liability;  provided,  however,  that the  Depositor  or the Master
Servicer may in its discretion undertake any such action, proceeding, hearing or
examination that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement
and the  rights  and  duties of the  parties  hereto  and the  interests  of the
Certificateholders  hereunder.  In such event,  the legal  expenses and costs of
such action,  proceeding,  hearing or  examination  and any liability  resulting
therefrom  shall be expenses,  costs and  liabilities of the Trust Fund, and the
Depositor and the Master  Servicer  shall be entitled to be reimbursed  therefor
out of amounts  attributable  to the Mortgage  Loans on deposit in the Custodial
Account as provided by Section 3.10 and, on the Distribution  Date(s)  following
such reimbursement,  the aggregate of such expenses and costs shall be allocated
in reduction of the Accrued Certificate  Interest on each Class entitled thereto
in the same manner as if such expenses


                                             118

and costs constituted a Prepayment Interest Shortfall.

        Section  6.04 Depositor and Master Servicer Not to Resign.

        Subject to the provisions of Section 6.02, neither the Depositor nor the
Master  Servicer shall resign from its respective  obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon  determination that its duties hereunder are no longer
permissible  under  applicable  law.  Any  such  determination   permitting  the
resignation  of the  Depositor or the Master  Servicer  shall be evidenced by an
Opinion  of  Counsel  (at the  expense of the  resigning  party) to such  effect
delivered to the  Trustee.  No such  resignation  by the Master  Servicer  shall
become  effective  until the Trustee or a successor  servicer shall have assumed
the Master  Servicer's  responsibilities  and  obligations  in  accordance  with
Section 7.02.

and, in either case,  such failure shall  continue  unremedied for a period of 5
days after the date upon which written  notice of such failure,  requiring  such
failure to be  remedied,  shall have been  given to the Master  Servicer  by the
Trustee  or the  Depositor  or to the Master  Servicer,  the  Depositor  and the
Trustee by the  Holders of  Certificates  of such  Class  evidencing  Percentage
Interests aggregating not less than 25%; or

               (i) the Master  Servicer  shall fail to observe or perform in any
        material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of

        this Agreement and such failure shall  continue  unremedied for a period
        of 30 days (except that such number of days shall be 15 in the case of a

        remedied, shall have been given to the Master Servicer by the Trustee or
        the Depositor,  or to the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Trustee
        by the  Holders  of  Certificates  of any Class  evidencing,  as to such
        Class, Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25%; or

               (ii) a  decree  or  order of a court  or  agency  or  supervisory

        similar law or appointing a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any
        insolvency,  readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities
        or similar  proceedings,  or for the  winding-up or  liquidation  of its

        or  relating  to,  the Master  Servicer  or of, or  relating  to, all or
        substantially all of the property of the Master Servicer; or

               (iv) the Master  Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to
          pay its debts

        commence  a  voluntary  case  under,   any   applicable   insolvency  or
        reorganization  statute,  make  an  assignment  for the  benefit  of its
        creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations; or

               (v) the Master  Servicer  shall  notify the  Trustee  pursuant to
        Section 4.04(b) that it is unable to deposit in the Certificate  Account
        an amount equal to the Advance.

        If an Event of  Default  described  in clauses  (i)-(v) of this  Section
shall  occur,  then,  and in each and every such case,  so long as such Event of
Default shall not have been remedied,  either the Depositor or the Trustee shall
at the  direction  of Holders of  Certificates  entitled  to at least 51% of the
Voting Rights, by notice in writing to the Master Servicer (and to the Depositor
if given by the Trustee or to the Trustee if given by the Depositor),  terminate
all of the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer under this Agreement
and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, other than its rights
as a Certificateholder hereunder; provided, however, the successor to the Master
Servicer  appointed  pursuant to Section 7.02 shall have  accepted the duties of
Master  Servicer  effective upon the resignation of the Master  Servicer.  If an
Event of Default  described in clause (v) hereof shall occur, the Trustee shall,
by notice to the Master Servicer and the Depositor, immediately terminate all of
the rights and  obligations  of the Master  Servicer under this Agreement and in
and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds  thereof,  other than its rights as a
Certificateholder  hereunder  as  provided in Section  4.04(b).  On or after the
receipt by the Master Servicer of such written  notice,  all authority and power
of the  Master  Servicer  under  this  Agreement,  whether  with  respect to the
Certificates  (other  than  as a  Holder  thereof)  or  the  Mortgage  Loans  or
otherwise, shall subject to Section 7.02 pass to and be vested in the Trustee or
the  Trustee's  designee  appointed  pursuant  to  Section  7.02;  and,  without
limitation,  the  Trustee is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to execute  and
deliver, on behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any
and all documents and other instruments,  and to do or accomplish all other acts
or things  necessary  or  appropriate  to effect the  purposes of such notice of
termination,  whether to complete the transfer and  endorsement or assignment of
the Mortgage  Loans and related  documents,  or otherwise.  The Master  Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the  termination of the Master
Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation,
the transfer to the Trustee or its designee for administration by it of all cash
amounts  which  shall at the time be credited  to the  Custodial  Account or the
Certificate  Account or  thereafter  be received  with  respect to the  Mortgage
Loans. No such  termination  shall release the Master Servicer for any liability
that it would  otherwise  have  hereunder  for any act or omission  prior to the
effective time of such termination.

        Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of Residential Funding
in its  capacity as Master  Servicer  hereunder,  Residential  Funding  shall be
entitled  to  receive,  out of any late  collection  of a Monthly  Payment  on a
Mortgage  Loan  which  was  due  prior  to the  notice  terminating  Residential
Funding's rights and obligations as Master Servicer hereunder and received after
such notice,  that portion to which Residential Funding would have been entitled
pursuant to Sections 3.10(a)(ii), (vi) and (vii) as well as its Servicing Fee in
respect thereof,  and any other amounts payable to Residential Funding hereunder
the  entitlement  to which  arose  prior to the  termination  of its  activities
hereunder.  Upon the  termination  of  Residential  Funding  as Master  Servicer
hereunder the Depositor shall


                                             121

deliver to the Trustee a copy of the Program Guide.

        Section  7.02 Trustee or Depositor to Act; Appointment of Successor.

        (a) On and  after  the time the  Master  Servicer  receives  a notice of
termination pursuant to Section 7.01 or resigns in accordance with Section 6.04,
the Trustee or, upon notice to the  Depositor and with the  Depositor's  consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) a designee (which meets the standards
set forth below) of the Trustee,  shall be the  successor in all respects to the
Master  Servicer  in its  capacity  as  servicer  under this  Agreement  and the
transactions  set forth or  provided  for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities,  duties and liabilities  relating thereto placed on the Master
Servicer (except for the  responsibilities,  duties and liabilities contained in
Sections 2.02 and 2.03(a),  excluding the duty to notify related Subservicers as
set forth in such Sections, and its obligations to deposit amounts in respect of
losses  incurred  prior to such notice or termination on the investment of funds
in the Custodial Account or the Certificate Account pursuant to Sections 3.07(c)
and 4.01(c) by the terms and provisions  hereof);  provided,  however,  that any
failure to  perform  such  duties or  responsibilities  caused by the  preceding
Master Servicer's failure to provide information  required by Section 4.04 shall
not be considered a default by the Trustee hereunder.  As compensation therefor,
the Trustee shall be entitled to all funds  relating to the Mortgage Loans which
the Master Servicer would have been entitled to charge to the Custodial  Account
or the Certificate Account if the Master Servicer had continued to act hereunder
and, in addition, shall be entitled to the income from any Permitted Investments
made with  amounts  attributable  to the  Mortgage  Loans held in the  Custodial
Account or the Certificate  Account.  If the Trustee has become the successor to
the Master  Servicer in  accordance  with  Section  6.04 or Section  7.01,  then
notwithstanding  the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to so act,
or shall, if it is unable to so act,  appoint,  or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint,  any established housing and home finance  institution,
which  is  also  a  Fannie  Mae  or  Freddie  Mac-approved   mortgage  servicing
institution, having a net worth of not less than $10,000,000 as the successor to
the  Master  Servicer  hereunder  in the  assumption  of all or any  part of the
responsibilities,  duties  or  liabilities  of the  Master  Servicer  hereunder.
Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder, the Trustee
shall become  successor to the Master Servicer and shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove  provided.  In connection with such appointment and assumption,  the
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on  Mortgage  Loans as it and such  successor  shall  agree;  provided,
however,  that no such  compensation  shall be in excess of that  permitted  the
initial Master Servicer hereunder. The Depositor, the Trustee, the Custodian and
such successor shall take such action,  consistent with this Agreement, as shall
be  necessary to  effectuate  any such  succession.  The  Servicing  Fee for any
successor  Master  Servicer  appointed  pursuant  to this  Section  7.02 will be
lowered with respect to those Mortgage Loans, if any, where the Subservicing Fee
accrues at a rate of less than  0.50% per annum in the event that the  successor
Master  Servicer  is  not  servicing  such  Mortgage  Loans  directly  and it is
necessary to raise the related  Subservicing Fee to a rate of 0.50% per annum in
order to hire a Subservicer with respect to such Mortgage Loans.

     (b) In  connection  with  the  termination  or  resignation  of the  Master
Servicer hereunder,


                                             122

<PAGE>



either (i) the successor Master  Servicer,  including the Trustee if the Trustee
is acting as successor Master Servicer, shall represent and warrant that it is a
member  of MERS in good  standing  and shall  agree to  comply  in all  material
respects with the rules and procedures of MERS in connection  with the servicing
of the  Mortgage  Loans  that  are  registered  with  MERS,  in  which  case the
predecessor  Master Servicer shall cooperate with the successor  Master Servicer
in causing  MERS to revise its records to reflect the  transfer of  servicing to
the successor Master Servicer as necessary under MERS' rules and regulations, or
(ii) the predecessor  Master Servicer shall cooperate with the successor  Master
Servicer in causing  MERS to execute and  deliver an  assignment  of Mortgage in
recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to the Trustee and to execute
and  deliver  such other  notices,  documents  and other  instruments  as may be
necessary or desirable to effect a transfer of such  Mortgage  Loan or servicing
of such Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)  System to the successor  Master  Servicer.
The  predecessor  Master  Servicer  shall  file or cause  to be  filed  any such
assignment in the appropriate  recording office. The predecessor Master Servicer
shall  bear any and all fees of MERS,  costs of  preparing  any  assignments  of
Mortgage,  and fees and costs of filing any  assignments of Mortgage that may be
required under this  subsection  (b). The successor  Master Servicer shall cause
such  assignment to be delivered to the Trustee or the  Custodian  promptly upon
receipt of the original with evidence of recording  thereon or a copy  certified
by the public recording office in which such assignment was recorded.

        Section  7.03 Notification to Certificateholders.

        (a) Upon any such  termination  or  appointment  of a  successor  to the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee shall give prompt  written  notice thereof to the
Certificateholders  at their respective  addresses  appearing in the Certificate
Register.

        (b) Within 60 days after the  occurrence  of any Event of  Default,  the
Trustee  shall  transmit by mail to all Holders of  Certificates  notice of each
such Event of  Default  hereunder  known to the  Trustee,  unless  such Event of
Default shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 7.04 hereof.

        Section  7.04 Waiver of Events of Default.

        The  Holders   representing  at  least  66%  of  the  Voting  Rights  of
Certificates  affected by a default or Event of Default  hereunder may waive any
default or Event of Default;  provided,  however, that (a) a default or Event of
Default  under  clause  (i) of  Section  7.01 may be  waived  only by all of the
Holders of Certificates  affected by such default or Event of Default and (b) no
waiver pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall affect the Holders of Certificates in
the manner set forth in Section 11.01(b)(i), (ii) or (iii). Upon any such waiver
of a default or Event of  Default  by the  Holders  representing  the  requisite
percentage of Voting Rights of Certificates affected by such default or Event of
Default,  such  default  or Event of Default  shall  cease to exist and shall be
deemed to have been remedied for every purpose  hereunder.  No such waiver shall
extend to any  subsequent  or other  default  or Event of  Default or impair any
right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

        Section  8.01 Duties of Trustee.

        (a) The  Trustee,  prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default  and
after the curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are  specifically  set forth in this
Agreement. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or
waived),  the Trustee shall  exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this  Agreement,  and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise
as a prudent  investor  would  exercise  or use under the  circumstances  in the
conduct of such investor's own affairs.

        (b)  The  Trustee,  upon  receipt  of  all  resolutions,   certificates,
statements,  opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically  required to be furnished  pursuant to any
provision  of this  Agreement,  shall  examine  them to  determine  whether they
conform to the  requirements  of this  Agreement.  The Trustee  shall notify the
Certificateholders  of any such documents which do not materially conform to the
requirements  of  this  Agreement  in the  event  that  the  Trustee,  after  so
requesting, does not receive satisfactorily corrected documents.

        The Trustee shall  forward or cause to be forwarded in a timely  fashion
the  notices,  reports and  statements  required to be  forwarded by the Trustee
pursuant to Sections 4.03, 4.06, 7.03, and 10.01. The Trustee shall furnish in a
timely fashion to the Master  Servicer such  information as the Master  Servicer
may reasonably  request from time to time for the Master Servicer to fulfill its
duties as set forth in this Agreement.  The Trustee covenants and agrees that it
shall perform its obligations hereunder in a manner so as to maintain the status
of each of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III and REMIC IV as a REMIC under the REMIC
Provisions  and (subject to Section  10.01(f)) to prevent the  imposition of any
federal, state or local income,  prohibited  transaction,  contribution or other
tax on the Trust Fund to the extent that  maintaining  such status and  avoiding
such taxes are  reasonably  within the control of the Trustee and are reasonably
within the scope of its duties under this Agreement.

        (c) No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent  action,  its own negligent failure
to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, however, that:

               (i) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, and after the
        curing or waiver of all such Events of Default which may have  occurred,
        the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined  solely by
        the express  provisions  of this  Agreement,  the  Trustee  shall not be
        liable except for the  performance of such duties and obligations as are
        specifically  set  forth in this  Agreement,  no  implied  covenants  or
        obligations  shall be read into this Agreement  against the Trustee and,
        in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee,  the Trustee may
        conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the


                                             124

<PAGE>



        correctness of the opinions expressed therein,  upon any certificates or
        opinions  furnished  to the  Trustee  by  the  Depositor  or the  Master
        Servicer and which on their face, do not contradict the  requirements of
        this Agreement;

               (ii) The Trustee shall not be  personally  liable for an error of
        judgment  made in good faith by a  Responsible  Officer  or  Responsible
        Officers of the Trustee,  unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was
        negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

               (iii) The Trustee shall not be personally  liable with respect to
        any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
        accordance  with  the  direction  of  the   Certificateholders   holding
        Certificates which evidence,  Percentage Interests  aggregating not less
        than 25% of the  affected  classes  as to the time,  method and place of
        conducting any proceeding  for any remedy  available to the Trustee,  or
        exercising  any trust or power  conferred  upon the Trustee,  under this
        Agreement;

               (iv) The  Trustee  shall not be  charged  with  knowledge  of any
        default  (other than a default in payment to the  Trustee)  specified in
        clauses  (i) and  (ii) of  Section  7.01 or an Event  of  Default  under
        clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 7.01 unless a Responsible Officer
        of the Trustee  assigned to and working in the  Corporate  Trust  Office
        obtains  actual  knowledge  of such  failure  or  event  or the  Trustee
        receives  written notice of such failure or event at its Corporate Trust
        Office from the Master Servicer, the Depositor or any Certificateholder;
        and

               (v) Except to the extent  provided in Section  7.02, no provision
        in this  Agreement  shall  require the Trustee to expend or risk its own
        funds  (including,  without  limitation,  the making of any  Advance) or
        otherwise incur any personal  financial  liability in the performance of
        any of its duties as Trustee hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
        rights or powers,  if the  Trustee  shall have  reasonable  grounds  for
        believing  that  repayment of funds or adequate  indemnity  against such
        risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

        (d) The Trustee shall timely pay, from its own funds,  the amount of any
and all federal,  state and local taxes  imposed on the Trust Fund or its assets
or transactions  including,  without  limitation,  (A) "prohibited  transaction"
penalty  taxes as defined in Section 860F of the Code,  if, when and as the same
shall be due and  payable,  (B) any tax on  contributions  to a REMIC  after the
Closing  Date  imposed  by  Section  860G(d) of the Code and (C) any tax on "net
income from foreclosure property" as defined in Section 860G(c) of the Code, but
only if such  taxes  arise out of a breach  by the  Trustee  of its  obligations
hereunder,  which breach  constitutes  negligence  or willful  misconduct of the
Trustee.

        Section  8.02 Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

        (a)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

               (i) The  Trustee  may rely and  shall be  protected  in acting or
        refraining  from  acting  upon any  resolution,  Officers'  Certificate,
        certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument,
        opinion,  report, notice, request,  consent,  order, appraisal,  bond or
        other  paper or  document  believed by it to be genuine and to have been
        signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

               (ii) The  Trustee  may  consult  with  counsel and any Opinion of
        Counsel  shall be full and  complete  authorization  and  protection  in
        respect of any action  taken or suffered or omitted by it  hereunder  in
        good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

               (iii) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of
        the trusts or powers  vested in it by this  Agreement  or to  institute,
        conduct or defend any litigation  hereunder or in relation hereto at the
        request, order or direction of any of the  Certificateholders,  pursuant
        to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  unless such  Certificateholders
        shall have  offered to the  Trustee  reasonable  security  or  indemnity
        against  the  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  which may be  incurred
        therein or thereby; nothing contained herein shall, however, relieve the
        Trustee of the  obligation,  upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default
        (which has not been  cured),  to exercise  such of the rights and powers
        vested in it by this  Agreement,  and to use the same degree of care and
        skill in their  exercise  as a prudent  investor  would  exercise or use
        under the circumstances in the conduct of such investor's own affairs;

               (iv) The Trustee  shall not be  personally  liable for any action
        taken,  suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
        authorized or within the  discretion or rights or powers  conferred upon
        it by this Agreement;

               (v) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default  hereunder and
        after the curing of all Events of Default which may have  occurred,  the
        Trustee shall not be bound to make any  investigation  into the facts or
        matters stated in any resolution,  certificate,  statement,  instrument,
        opinion,  report, notice,  request,  consent,  order, approval,  bond or
        other paper or  document,  unless  requested  in writing so to do by the
        Holders  of  Certificates  of any Class  evidencing,  as to such  Class,
        Percentage Interests,  aggregating not less than 50%; provided, however,
        that if the  payment  within a  reasonable  time to the  Trustee  of the
        costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making
        of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee,  not reasonably
        assured to the  Trustee by the  security  afforded to it by the terms of
        this Agreement,  the Trustee may require  reasonable  indemnity  against
        such  expense  or  liability  as  a  condition  to  so  proceeding.  The
        reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Master
        Servicer,  if an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing,
        and otherwise by the Certificateholder requesting the investigation;


                                             126

<PAGE>




               (vi)  The  Trustee  may  execute  any of  the  trusts  or  powers
        hereunder  or perform  any duties  hereunder  either  directly  or by or
        through  agents or  attorneys  provided  that the Trustee  shall  remain
        liable for any acts of such agents or attorneys; and

               (vii) To the extent authorized under the Code and the regulations
        promulgated  thereunder,  each  Holder of a Class R  Certificate  hereby
        irrevocably   appoints   and   authorizes   the   Trustee   to  be   its
        attorney-in-fact  for purposes of signing any Tax Returns required to be
        filed on behalf of the Trust Fund.  The Trustee  shall sign on behalf of
        the Trust Fund and deliver to the Master Servicer in a timely manner any
        Tax  Returns  prepared by or on behalf of the Master  Servicer  that the
        Trustee  is  required  to  sign as  determined  by the  Master  Servicer
        pursuant to applicable  federal,  state or local tax laws, provided that
        the Master Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for signing any such Tax
        Returns that contain errors or omissions.

        (b) Following the issuance of the  Certificates  (and except as provided
for in Section 3.22(d)), the Trustee shall not accept any contribution of assets
to the Trust  Fund  unless it shall  have  obtained  or been  furnished  with an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such  contribution  will not (i) cause any
of REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any
time that any  Certificates  are  outstanding or (ii) cause the Trust Fund to be
subject  to any  federal  tax as a result of such  contribution  (including  the
imposition of any federal tax on "prohibited transactions" imposed under Section
860F(a) of the Code).

        Section  8.03 Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Mortgage Loans.

        The recitals  contained herein and in the  Certificates  (other than the
execution of the  Certificates and relating to the acceptance and receipt of the
Mortgage  Loans) shall be taken as the statements of the Depositor or the Master
Servicer as the case may be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.  The  Trustee  makes  no  representations  as to  the  validity  or
sufficiency  of  this  Agreement  or  of  the  Certificates   (except  that  the
Certificates  shall be duly and  validly  executed  and  authenticated  by it as
Certificate  Registrar) or of any Mortgage Loan or related document,  or of MERS
or the MERS(R) System.  Except as otherwise  provided herein,  the Trustee shall
not be  accountable  for the use or  application  by the Depositor or the Master
Servicer of any of the Certificates or of the proceeds of such Certificates,  or
for the use or  application  of any funds  paid to the  Depositor  or the Master
Servicer in respect of the Mortgage  Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from the
Custodial  Account or the  Certificate  Account by the  Depositor  or the Master
Servicer.

        The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee  of  Certificates  with the same  rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

     Section  8.05  Master   Servicer  to  Pay  Trustee's   Fees  and  Expenses;
          Indemnification.

        (a) The Master  Servicer  covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee and
any co- trustee from time to time, and the Trustee and any  co-trustee  shall be
entitled  to,  reasonable  compensation  (which  shall  not  be  limited  by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust)
for all services  rendered by each of them in the execution of the trusts hereby
created  and in the  exercise  and  performance  of any of the powers and duties
hereunder of the Trustee and any co-trustee, and the Master Servicer will pay or
reimburse  the  Trustee  and any  co-trustee  upon  request  for all  reasonable
expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  incurred  or made by the Trustee or any
co-trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including
the reasonable  compensation  and the expenses and  disbursements of its counsel
and of all persons not regularly in its employ, and the expenses incurred by the
Trustee or any  co-trustee in connection  with the  appointment  of an office or
agency  pursuant  to Section  8.12)  except any such  expense,  disbursement  or
advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith.

        (b) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold
the Trustee harmless  against,  any loss,  liability or expense incurred without
negligence or willful  misconduct on its part,  arising out of, or in connection
with, the acceptance and  administration of the Trust Fund,  including the costs
and expenses (including  reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself
against any claim in connection  with the exercise or  performance of any of its
powers or duties under this Agreement, provided that:

               (i) with respect to any such claim,  the Trustee shall have given
        the Master  Servicer  written notice thereof  promptly after the Trustee
        shall have actual knowledge thereof;

               (ii) while maintaining control over its own defense,  the Trustee
        shall  cooperate and consult fully with the Master Servicer in preparing
        such defense; and

               (iii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
        the Master  Servicer  shall not be liable for settlement of any claim by
        the  Trustee  entered  into  without  the prior  consent  of the  Master
        Servicer which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations created by
this Section  8.05(b) of the Master  Servicer to indemnify the Trustee under the
conditions and to the extent set forth herein.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the indemnification  provided by the Master
Servicer in this


                                             128

<PAGE>



Section  8.05(b)  shall not  pertain  to any loss,  liability  or expense of the
Trustee, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim,
incurred in connection with any actions taken by the Trustee at the direction of
Certificateholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

        Section  8.06 Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

        The  Trustee  hereunder  shall  at  all  times  be  a  national  banking
association or a New York banking  corporation  having its principal office in a
state and city  acceptable to the  Depositor  and  organized and doing  business
under the laws of such state or the United States of America,  authorized  under
such laws to exercise  corporate  trust  powers,  having a combined  capital and
surplus of at least  $50,000,000  and subject to  supervision  or examination by
federal or state authority.  If such corporation or national banking association
publishes  reports of  condition  at least  annually,  pursuant to law or to the
requirements of the aforesaid  supervising or examining authority,  then for the
purposes of this  Section the combined  capital and surplus of such  corporation
shall be deemed to be its combined  capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published.

        In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the
manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07.

        Section 8.07 Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

        (a) The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts
hereby  created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor and the Master
Servicer.  Upon  receiving  such  notice of  resignation,  the  Depositor  shall
promptly appoint a successor trustee by written  instrument,  in duplicate,  one
copy of which  instrument  shall be delivered to the  resigning  Trustee and one
copy to the  successor  trustee.  If no  successor  trustee  shall  have been so
appointed and have accepted  appointment within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of  resignation  then the  resigning  Trustee may  petition  any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

        (b) If at any time the Trustee  shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the  provisions  of  Section  8.06 and shall fail to resign  after  written
request  therefor by the  Depositor,  or if at any time the Trustee shall become
incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged  bankrupt or insolvent,  or a receiver
of the Trustee or of its  property  shall be  appointed,  or any public  officer
shall take  charge or control of the  Trustee or of its  property or affairs for
the purpose of rehabilitation,  conservation or liquidation,  then the Depositor
may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate,  one copy of which  instrument  shall be  delivered to the Trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor  trustee.  In addition,  in the event that
the Depositor  determines that the Trustee has failed (i) to distribute or cause
to be distributed to  Certificateholders  any amount  required to be distributed
hereunder, if such amount is held by the Trustee or its Paying Agent (other than
the Master  Servicer or the  Depositor)  for  distribution  or (ii) to otherwise
observe or perform in any material  respect any of its covenants,  agreements or
obligations  hereunder,  and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period
of 5 days (in respect of clause (i) above) or 30 days (in respect of


                                             129

<PAGE>



clause  (ii)  above)  after the date on which  written  notice of such  failure,
requiring that the same be remedied, shall have been given to the Trustee by the
Depositor,  then the  Depositor  may remove the  Trustee and appoint a successor
trustee by written instrument  delivered as provided in the preceding  sentence.
In  connection  with the  appointment  of a  successor  trustee  pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Depositor shall, on or before the date on which any such
appointment   becomes   effective,   obtain  from  each  Rating  Agency  written
confirmation  that the appointment of any such successor trustee will not result
in the  reduction  of the  ratings  on any class of the  Certificates  below the
lesser of the then current or original ratings on such Certificates.

        (c) The Holders of  Certificates  entitled to at least 51% of the Voting
Rights may at any time remove the  Trustee  and  appoint a successor  trustee by
written  instrument or  instruments,  in  triplicate,  signed by such Holders or
their  attorneys-in-fact duly authorized,  one complete set of which instruments
shall be delivered to the Depositor,  one complete set to the Trustee so removed
and one complete set to the successor so appointed.

        (d) Any  resignation  or removal of the  Trustee  and  appointment  of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in
Section 8.08.

        Section  8.08 Successor Trustee.

        (a) Any  successor  trustee  appointed as provided in Section 8.07 shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor and to its predecessor trustee
an  instrument   accepting  such  appointment   hereunder,   and  thereupon  the
resignation  or removal of the  predecessor  trustee shall become  effective and
such  successor  trustee  shall become  effective  and such  successor  trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become fully vested with all
the rights,  powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor  hereunder,  with
the like  effect as if  originally  named as  trustee  herein.  The  predecessor
trustee shall deliver to the  successor  trustee all Mortgage  Files and related
documents and statements held by it hereunder  (other than any Mortgage Files at
the time held by a  Custodian,  which  shall  become the agent of any  successor
trustee hereunder),  and the Depositor,  the Master Servicer and the predecessor
trustee shall execute and deliver such  instruments  and do such other things as
may  reasonably be required for more fully and certainly  vesting and confirming
in the successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

        (b) No successor  trustee shall accept  appointment  as provided in this
Section unless at the time of such  acceptance  such successor  trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06.

        (c) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in
this Section,  the Depositor shall mail notice of the succession of such trustee
hereunder  to all Holders of  Certificates  at their  addresses  as shown in the
Certificate  Register. If the Depositor fails to mail such notice within 10 days
after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee,  the successor trustee
shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Depositor.

        Section  8.09 Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

        Any corporation or national  banking  association into which the Trustee
may be  merged  or  converted  or  with  which  it may  be  consolidated  or any
corporation  or  national  banking   association   resulting  from  any  merger,
conversion  or  consolidation  to which  the  Trustee  shall be a party,  or any
corporation or national  banking  association  succeeding to the business of the
Trustee,  shall  be  the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,  provided  such
corporation  or  national  banking  association  shall  be  eligible  under  the
provisions of Section 8.06,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the  parties  hereto,  anything  herein to the
contrary  notwithstanding.  The Trustee  shall mail notice of any such merger or
consolidation  to the  Certificateholders  at  their  address  as  shown  in the
Certificate Register.

        Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

        (a)  Notwithstanding  any other provisions  hereof, at any time, for the
purpose of meeting any legal  requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee  acting  jointly shall have the power and shall
execute and deliver all  instruments to appoint one or more Persons  approved by
the Trustee to act as co-trustee or  co-trustees,  jointly with the Trustee,  or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and
to vest in such Person or  Persons,  in such  capacity,  such title to the Trust
Fund, or any part thereof,  and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Master Servicer
and the Trustee may consider  necessary  or  desirable.  If the Master  Servicer
shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it
of a request so to do, or in case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.  No
co-trustee or separate trustee  hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06 hereunder and no notice to
Holders  of  Certificates  of  the  appointment  of  co-trustee(s)  or  separate
trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08 hereof.

        (b) In the case of any  appointment of a co-trustee or separate  trustee
pursuant  to this  Section  8.10 all  rights,  powers,  duties  and  obligations
conferred  or imposed  upon the Trustee  shall be  conferred or imposed upon and
exercised or performed by the Trustee,  and such separate  trustee or co-trustee
jointly,  except to the extent that under any law of any  jurisdiction  in which
any particular act or acts are to be performed  (whether as Trustee hereunder or
as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent
or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights,  powers,
duties and obligations  (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any
portion  thereof in any such  jurisdiction)  shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

        (c) Any notice,  request or other  writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as  effectively  as if given to each of them.  Every  instrument  appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the


                                             131

<PAGE>



conditions of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee,  upon its
acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property
specified in its instrument of  appointment,  either jointly with the Trustee or
separately,  as may be provided  therein,  subject to all the provisions of this
Agreement,  specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to
the conduct of,  affecting  the liability  of, or affording  protection  to, the
Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.

        (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time,  constitute the
Trustee,  its agent or attorney-in-fact,  with full power and authority,  to the
extent not  prohibited  by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name.  If any separate  trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties,  rights,  remedies  and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee,  to the extent  permitted by law,  without the  appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

        Section  8.11 Appointment of Custodians.

        The  Trustee  may,  with the  consent  of the  Master  Servicer  and the
Depositor,  appoint  one or  more  Custodians  who  are  not  Affiliates  of the
Depositor or the Master  Servicer to hold all or a portion of the Mortgage Files
as agent for the Trustee,  by entering  into a Custodial  Agreement.  Subject to
Article  VIII,  the Trustee  agrees to comply  with the terms of each  Custodial
Agreement and to enforce the terms and provisions  thereof against the Custodian
for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each Custodian shall be a depository
institution  subject to supervision by federal or state authority,  shall have a
combined  capital and surplus of at least  $15,000,000 and shall be qualified to
do  business  in the  jurisdiction  in which it holds any  Mortgage  File.  Each
Custodial  Agreement  may be amended  only as  provided  in Section  11.01.  The
Trustee shall notify the  Certificateholders of the appointment of any Custodian
(other than the  Custodian  appointed as of the Closing  Date)  pursuant to this
Section 8.11.

        Section  8.12 Appointment of Office or Agency.

        The  Trustee  will  maintain an office or agency in the City of New York
where  Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange.
The Trustee initially  designates its offices located at DTC Transfer  Services,
55 Water  Street,  Jeanette  Park  Entrance,  New York,  New York  10041 for the
purpose of keeping the Certificate Register. The Trustee will maintain an office
at the address stated in Section 11.05(c) hereof where notices and demands to or
upon the Trustee in respect of this Agreement may be served.

                                   ARTICLE IX

              TERMINATION OR OPTIONAL PURCHASE OF ALL CERTIFICATES

     Section 9.01 Optional  Purchase by the Master Servicer of All Certificates;
          Termination Upon Purchase by the Master Servicer or Liquidation of All
          Mortgage Loans.

        (a)  Subject  to  Section   9.02,   the   respective   obligations   and
responsibilities  of the Depositor,  the Master Servicer and the Trustee created
hereby in respect of the Certificates  (other than the obligation of the Trustee
to make certain payments after the Final Distribution Date to Certificateholders
and the obligation of the Depositor to send certain  notices as hereinafter  set
forth) shall  terminate upon the last action required to be taken by the Trustee
on the Final Distribution Date pursuant to this Article IX following the earlier
of:

               (i) the later of the final payment or other  liquidation  (or any
        Advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in the
        Trust Fund or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure
        or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, or

               (ii) the purchase by the Master Servicer of all Group I Loans and
        all  property  acquired in respect of any Group I Loan  remaining in the
        Trust Fund,  the  purchase by the Master  Servicer of all Group II Loans
        and all property  acquired in respect of any Group II Loan  remaining in
        the Trust Fund and the purchase by the Master  Servicer of all Group III
        Loans  and all  property  acquired  in  respect  of any  Group  III Loan
        remaining in the Trust Fund,  in each case,  at a price equal to 100% of
        the unpaid  principal  balance of each  Mortgage  Loan (or, if less than
        such unpaid  principal  balance,  the fair  market  value of the related
        underlying property of such Mortgage Loan with respect to Mortgage Loans
        as to which title has been  acquired  if such fair market  value is less
        than such unpaid principal  balance) (net of any  unreimbursed  Advances
        attributable  to  principal)  on the  day of  repurchase,  plus  accrued
        interest thereon at the Net Mortgage Rate (or Modified Net Mortgage Rate
        in the case of any Modified  Mortgage Loan), to, but not including,  the
        first day of the month in which such  repurchase  price is  distributed;
        provided,  however,  that in no event  shall  the trust  created  hereby
        continue  beyond the  expiration  of 21 years from the death of the last
        survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late ambassador of
        the United States to the Court of St. James,  living on the date hereof;
        provided  further,  that, if the amount due under any Certificate  shall
        not have been  reduced to zero prior to the  Maturity  Date,  the Master
        Servicer  shall be required to terminate  this  Agreement in  accordance
        with this clause (ii); and provided further, that the purchase price set
        forth above shall be increased as is  necessary,  as  determined  by the
        Master Servicer, to avoid  disqualification of any of REMIC I, REMIC II,
        REMIC III or REMIC IV as a REMIC.

        The right of the Master Servicer to purchase all the assets of the Trust
Fund relating to the Group I Loans, pursuant to clause (ii) above is conditioned
upon the date of such purchase occurring


                                             133

<PAGE>



on or after the  Group I  Optional  Termination  Date.  The right of the  Master
Servicer to purchase  all the assets of the Trust Fund  relating to the Group II
Loans,  pursuant  to  clause  (ii)  above is  conditioned  upon the date of such
purchase occurring on or after the Group II Optional Termination Date. The right
of the Master  Servicer to purchase all the assets of the Trust Fund relating to
the Group III Loans,  pursuant to clause (ii) above is conditioned upon the date
of such purchase occurring on or after the Group III Optional  Termination Date.
If such right is exercised by the Master Servicer,  the Master Servicer shall be
deemed to have been reimbursed for the full amount of any unreimbursed  Advances
theretofore  made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans being  purchased.  In
addition,  the Master  Servicer  shall provide to the Trustee the  certification
required  by Section  3.15 and the  Trustee and any  Custodian  shall,  promptly
following  payment of the  purchase  price,  release to the Master  Servicer the
Mortgage Files pertaining to the Mortgage Loans being purchased.

        In addition to the foregoing,  on any Distribution  Date on or after the
Group I Optional  Termination Date, the Master Servicer shall have the right, at
its option, to purchase the Group I Certificates in whole, but not in part, at a
price equal to the sum of the outstanding  Certificate Principal Balance of such
Certificates plus the sum of one month's Accrued  Certificate  Interest thereon,
or, with respect to the Class A-I-3 Certificates and Class AV-I Certificates, on
their respective  Notional  Amount,  any previously  unpaid Accrued  Certificate
Interest,  and any unpaid Prepayment  Interest  Shortfall  previously  allocated
thereto. On any Distribution Date on or after the Group II Optional  Termination
Date, the Master Servicer shall have the right,  at its option,  to purchase the
Group II Certificates in whole,  but not in part, at a price equal to the sum of
the outstanding  Certificate Principal Balance of such Certificates plus the sum
of one month's Accrued  Certificate  Interest  thereon,  or, with respect to the
Class AV-II  Certificates,  on their  Notional  Amount,  any  previously  unpaid
Accrued  Certificate  Interest,  and any unpaid  Prepayment  Interest  Shortfall
previously allocated thereto. On any Distribution Date on or after the Group III
Optional  Termination  Date, the Master  Servicer  shall have the right,  at its
option,  to purchase the Group III  Certificates in whole, but not in part, at a
price equal to the sum of the outstanding  Certificate Principal Balance of such
Certificates plus the sum of one month's Accrued  Certificate  Interest thereon,
any previously unpaid Accrued  Certificate  Interest,  and any unpaid Prepayment
Interest  Shortfall   previously  allocated  thereto.  If  the  Master  Servicer
exercises this right to purchase the outstanding Group I Certificates,  Group II
Certificates  or Group III  Certificates,  the  Master  Servicer  will  promptly
terminate the  respective  obligations  and  responsibilities  created hereby in
respect of these Certificates pursuant to this Article IX.

        (b) The Master  Servicer  shall give the  Trustee not less than 60 days'
prior notice of the Distribution  Date on which the Master Servicer  anticipates
that the final  distribution  will be made to  Certificateholders  (whether as a
result of the  exercise  by the Master  Servicer  of its right to  purchase  the
assets of the Trust Fund or otherwise).  Notice of any  termination,  specifying
the  anticipated  Final  Distribution  Date  (which  shall be a date that  would
otherwise  be  a  Distribution  Date)  upon  which  the  Certificateholders  may
surrender   their   Certificates  to  the  Trustee  for  payment  of  the  final
distribution  and  cancellation,  shall be given promptly by the Master Servicer
(if it is exercising its right to purchase the assets of the Trust Fund),  or by
the Trustee (in any other case)


                                             134

<PAGE>



by letter to  Certificateholders  mailed not  earlier  than the 15th day and not
later  than the 25th day of the month  next  preceding  the month of such  final
distribution specifying:

               (i) the  anticipated  Final  Distribution  Date upon which  final
        payment of the Certificates is anticipated to be made upon  presentation
        and  surrender  of  Certificates  at the office or agency of the Trustee
        therein designated,

               (ii)   the amount of any such final payment, if known, and

               (iii)  that  the  Record  Date   otherwise   applicable  to  such
        Distribution Date is not applicable,  and that payment will be made only
        upon  presentation  and surrender of the  Certificates  at the office or
        agency of the Trustee therein specified.

        If the Master Servicer is obligated to give notice to Certificateholders
as aforesaid, it shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at the time
such notice is given to Certificateholders. In the event such notice is given by
the  Master  Servicer,  the Master  Servicer  shall  deposit in the  Certificate
Account before the Final  Distribution  Date in immediately  available  funds an
amount equal to the purchase  price for the assets of the Trust Fund computed as
above  provided.  The  Master  Servicer  shall  provide to the  Trustee  written
notification of any change to the anticipated Final Distribution Date as soon as
practicable.  If the  Trust  Fund is not  terminated  on the  anticipated  Final
Distribution  Date,  for any reason,  the  Trustee  shall  promptly  mail notice
thereof to each affected Certificateholder.

        (c)  Upon   presentation  and  surrender  of  the  Certificates  by  the
Certificateholders,  the Trustee shall distribute to the  Certificateholders (i)
the  amount  otherwise  distributable  on  such  Distribution  Date,  if  not in
connection  with the Master  Servicer's  election to repurchase,  or (ii) if the
Master  Servicer  elected to so repurchase,  an amount equal to the  outstanding
Certificate  Principal  Balance of the  Certificates,  plus Accrued  Certificate
Interest  thereon for the related  Interest  Accrual  Period and any  previously
unpaid Accrued Certificate Interest.

        (d) In the event that any  Certificateholders  shall not surrender their
Certificates  for  final  payment  and  cancellation  on  or  before  the  Final
Distribution  Date,  the  Trustee  shall on such  date  cause  all  funds in the
Certificate Account not distributed in final distribution to  Certificateholders
to be withdrawn  therefrom and credited to the remaining  Certificateholders  by
depositing  such  funds in a separate  escrow  account  for the  benefit of such
Certificateholders,  and the  Master  Servicer  (if it  exercised  its  right to
purchase the assets of the Trust Fund), or the Trustee (in any other case) shall
give a second  written notice to the remaining  Certificateholders  to surrender
their  Certificates  for cancellation  and receive the final  distribution  with
respect  thereto.  If within six months after the second notice any  Certificate
shall not have  been  surrendered  for  cancellation,  the  Trustee  shall  take
appropriate  steps as directed by the Master  Servicer to contact the  remaining
Certificateholders  concerning  surrender of their  Certificates.  The costs and
expenses of maintaining the escrow account and of contacting  Certificateholders
shall be paid out of the assets  which remain in the escrow  account.  If within
nine months after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been


                                             135

<PAGE>



surrendered for  cancellation,  the Trustee shall pay to the Master Servicer all
amounts  distributable  to the  holders  thereof and the Master  Servicer  shall
thereafter  hold such amounts until  distributed  to such  holders.  No interest
shall  accrue or be payable to any  Certificateholder  on any amount held in the
escrow account or by the Master Servicer as a result of such Certificateholder's
failure to surrender its  Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance
with this Section 9.01 and the Certificateholders  shall look only to the Master
Servicer for such payment.

        Section  9.02 Additional Termination Requirements.

        (a) Any of REMIC I,  REMIC  II,  REMIC III and REMIC IV, as the case may
be,  shall  be   terminated  in   accordance   with  the  following   additional
requirements,  unless the  Trustee  and the Master  Servicer  have  received  an
Opinion of  Counsel  (which  Opinion  of Counsel  shall not be an expense of the
Trustee) to the effect  that the failure of any of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III
and  REMIC  IV, as the case may be,  to  comply  with the  requirements  of this
Section 9.02 will not (i) result in the imposition on the Trust Fund of taxes on
"prohibited  transactions,"  as described  in Section 860F of the Code,  or (ii)
cause any of REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to  qualify as a
REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding:

               (i) The Master  Servicer  shall  establish  a 90-day  liquidation
        period  for each of REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC  III and  REMIC  IV,  and
        specify  the first day of such  period in a  statement  attached  to the
        Trust Fund's final Tax Return pursuant to Treasury  regulations  Section
        1.860F-1. The Master Servicer also shall satisfy all of the requirements
        of a qualified  liquidation for each of REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III and
        REMIC IV, under Section 860F of the Code and the regulations thereunder;

               (ii)  The  Master  Servicer  shall  notify  the  Trustee  at  the
        commencement of such 90-day  liquidation  period and, at or prior to the
        time of making of the final  payment on the  Certificates,  the  Trustee
        shall sell or otherwise  dispose of all of the  remaining  assets of the
        Trust Fund in accordance with the terms hereof; and

               (iii) If the Master  Servicer is exercising its right to purchase
        the assets of the Trust  Fund,  the Master  Servicer  shall,  during the
        90-day  liquidation  period  and at or prior to the  Final  Distribution
        Date,  purchase all of the assets of the Trust Fund for cash;  provided,
        however,  that in the  event  that a  calendar  quarter  ends  after the
        commencement  of the  90-day  liquidation  period but prior to the Final
        Distribution  Date,  the Master  Servicer  shall not purchase any of the
        assets of the Trust Fund prior to the close of that calendar quarter.

        (b) Each  Holder of a  Certificate  and the Trustee  hereby  irrevocably
approves  and appoints the Master  Servicer as its  attorney-in-fact  to adopt a
plan of complete  liquidation for each of REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III and REMIC
IV at the expense of the Trust Fund in accordance  with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

                                REMIC PROVISIONS

        Section  10.01       REMIC Administration.

        (a) The REMIC  Administrator  shall  make an  election  to treat each of
REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC III and  REMIC IV as a REMIC  under the Code and,  if
necessary,  under  applicable state law. Such election will be made on Form 1066
or other appropriate  federal tax or information return (including Form 8811) or
any appropriate  state return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the
calendar  year in  which  the  Certificates  are  issued.  The  REMIC I  Regular
Interests  shall be  designated  as the  "regular  interests"  and the Class R-I
Certificates  shall be designated  as the sole class of "residual  interests" in
the REMIC I. The REMIC II Regular  Interests shall be designated as the "regular
interests" and the Class R-II Certificates shall be designated as the sole class
of "residual  interests" in REMIC II. The REMIC III Regular  Interests  shall be
designated as the "regular  interests" and the Class R-III Certificates shall be
designated  as the sole class of  "residual  interests"  in REMIC III. The Class
A-I-1,  Class A-I-2,  Class A-I-3,  Class AP-I, Class AV-I,  Class M-I-1,  Class
M-I-2, Class M-I-3,  Class A-II, Class AP-II,  Class AV-II, Class M-II-1,  Class
M-II-2, Class M-II-3, Class A-III, Class M-III-1,  Class M-III-2, Class M-III-3,
Class B-I-1, Class B-I-2, Class B-I-3, Class B-II-1, Class B-II-2, Class B-II-3,
Class B-III-1,  Class B-III-2, Class B-III-3 Certificates shall be designated as
the "regular  interests"  in REMIC IV and the Class R-IV  Certificates  shall be
designated  the sole  class of  "residual  interests"  in REMIC  IV.  The  REMIC
Administrator  and the Trustee shall not permit the creation of any  "interests"
(within  the  meaning of Section  860G of the Code) in the REMIC  other than the
Certificates.

        (b) The Closing Date is hereby  designated  as the "startup day" of each
of REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC III and REMIC IV within  the  meaning  of  Section
860G(a)(9) of the Code.

        (c) The REMIC  Administrator  shall hold a Class R  Certificate  in each
REMIC  representing a 0.01%  Percentage  Interest of the Class R Certificates in
each REMIC and shall be designated  as the "tax matters  person" with respect to
each of REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III and REMIC IV in the manner  provided  under
Treasury  regulations  section  1.860F-4(d)  and  Treasury  regulations  section
301.6231(a)(7)-1.  The REMIC Administrator, as tax matters person, shall (i) act
on behalf of each of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III and REMIC IV in  relation  to
any tax matter or  controversy  involving the Trust Fund and (ii)  represent the
Trust  Fund  in  any  administrative  or  judicial  proceeding  relating  to  an
examination or audit by any governmental  taxing authority with respect thereto.
The legal  expenses,  including  without  limitation  attorneys' or accountants'
fees,  and costs of any such  proceeding and any liability  resulting  therefrom
shall be  expenses  of the  Trust  Fund  and the  REMIC  Administrator  shall be
entitled to reimbursement  therefor out of amounts  attributable to the Mortgage
Loans on deposit in the  Custodial  Account as provided  by Section  3.10 unless
such  legal   expenses   and  costs  are   incurred   by  reason  of  the  REMIC
Administrator's willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. If the REMIC
Administrator  is no longer the  Master  Servicer  hereunder,  at its option the
REMIC Administrator may continue its duties as REMIC


                                             137

<PAGE>



Administrator and shall be paid reasonable compensation not to exceed $3,000 per
year by any  successor  Master  Servicer  hereunder  for so  acting as the REMIC
Administrator.

        (d) The REMIC Administrator shall prepare or cause to be prepared all of
the Tax  Returns  that it  determines  are  required  with  respect to the REMIC
created hereunder and deliver such Tax Returns in a timely manner to the Trustee
and the  Trustee  shall sign and file such Tax Returns in a timely  manner.  The
expenses of  preparing  such returns  shall be borne by the REMIC  Administrator
without any right of reimbursement  therefor.  The REMIC Administrator agrees to
indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Trustee  with respect to any tax or liability
arising  from the  Trustee's  signing  of Tax  Returns  that  contain  errors or
omissions.  The Trustee and Master  Servicer  shall  promptly  provide the REMIC
Administrator with such information as the REMIC  Administrator may from time to
time request for the purpose of enabling the REMIC  Administrator to prepare Tax
Returns.

        (e) The REMIC  Administrator  shall  provide (i) to any  Transferor of a
Class R Certificate  such information as is necessary for the application of any
tax relating to the transfer of a Class R Certificate to any Person who is not a
Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) to the Trustee and the Trustee shall forward to the
Certificateholders  such  information  or reports as are required by the Code or
the REMIC  Provisions  including  reports  relating to interest,  original issue
discount,  if  any,  and  market  discount  or  premium  (using  the  Prepayment
Assumption) and (iii) to the Internal Revenue Service the name,  title,  address
and telephone number of the person who will serve as the  representative of each
REMIC created hereunder.

        (f) The  Master  Servicer  and the REMIC  Administrator  shall take such
actions and shall cause each REMIC created hereunder to take such actions as are
reasonably within the Master Servicer's or the REMIC Administrator's control and
the scope of its duties more specifically set forth herein as shall be necessary
or  desirable  to  maintain  the  status  thereof  as a REMIC  under  the  REMIC
Provisions  (and the  Trustee  shall  assist the Master  Servicer  and the REMIC
Administrator, to the extent reasonably requested by the Master Servicer and the
REMIC  Administrator to do so). In performing their duties as more  specifically
set forth  herein,  the Master  Servicer and the REMIC  Administrator  shall not
knowingly  or  intentionally  take any action,  cause the Trust Fund to take any
action  or fail to take (or fail to cause to be  taken)  any  action  reasonably
within their  respective  control and the scope of duties more  specifically set
forth herein,  that, under the REMIC  Provisions,  if taken or not taken, as the
case may be,  could (i)  endanger  the status of any of REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC
III or REMIC IV as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon any of
REMIC I, REMIC II, REMIC III or REMIC IV  (including  but not limited to the tax
on prohibited  transactions as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code (except
as  provided in Section  3.22(d))  and the tax on  contributions  to a REMIC set
forth in Section  860G(d) of the Code) (either such event,  in the absence of an
Opinion of Counsel  or the  indemnification  referred  to in this  sentence,  an
"Adverse REMIC Event") unless the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator, as
applicable,  has  received  an Opinion of Counsel  (at the  expense of the party
seeking to take such action or, if such party fails to pay such expense, and the
Master  Servicer or the REMIC  Administrator,  as  applicable,  determines  that
taking such action is in the best interest of the Trust Fund and the


                                             138

<PAGE>



Certificateholders,  at the  expense of the Trust  Fund,  but in no event at the
expense of the Master Servicer,  the REMIC  Administrator or the Trustee) to the
effect that the  contemplated  action will not,  with  respect to the Trust Fund
created  hereunder,  endanger such status or, unless the Master  Servicer or the
REMIC  Administrator  or both,  as  applicable,  determine  in its or their sole
discretion  to indemnify  the Trust Fund against the  imposition  of such a tax,
result  in  the  imposition  of  such  a  tax.  Wherever  in  this  Agreement  a
contemplated  action may not be taken  because the timing of such  action  might
result  in the  imposition  of a tax on the  Trust  Fund,  or may  only be taken
pursuant to an Opinion of Counsel that such action would not impose a tax on the
Trust Fund,  such action may  nonetheless  be taken  provided that the indemnity
given in the preceding  sentence with respect to any taxes that might be imposed
on the Trust Fund has been given and that all other  preconditions to the taking
of such action have been  satisfied.  The Trustee shall not take or fail to take
any action (whether or not authorized hereunder) as to which the Master Servicer
or the REMIC Administrator, as applicable, has advised it in writing that it has
received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect  that an Adverse  REMIC Event could
occur with respect to such action. In addition,  prior to taking any action with
respect to the Trust Fund or its  assets,  or causing the Trust Fund to take any
action, which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement,  the
Trustee  will consult with the Master  Servicer or the REMIC  Administrator,  as
applicable,  or its  designee,  in writing,  with respect to whether such action
could cause an Adverse  REMIC Event to occur with  respect to the Trust Fund and
the  Trustee  shall not take any such action or cause the Trust Fund to take any
such  action as to which the  Master  Servicer  or the REMIC  Administrator,  as
applicable,  has advised it in writing that an Adverse  REMIC Event could occur.
The Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator,  as applicable, may consult with
counsel to make such written advice,  and the cost of same shall be borne by the
party seeking to take the action not expressly permitted by this Agreement,  but
in no event at the expense of the Master Servicer or the REMIC Administrator. At
all times as may be  required  by the Code,  the  Master  Servicer  or the REMIC
Administrator,  as  applicable,  will to the extent  within its  control and the
scope of its duties more specifically set forth herein,  maintain  substantially
all of the assets of the REMIC as  "qualified  mortgages"  as defined in Section
860G(a)(3)  of the  Code and  "permitted  investments"  as  defined  in  Section
860G(a)(5) of the Code.

        (g) In the event that any tax is imposed on "prohibited transactions" of
any REMIC  created  hereunder as defined in Section  860F(a)(2)  of the Code, on
"net  income  from  foreclosure  property"  of any REMIC as  defined  in Section
860G(c) of the Code,  on any  contributions  to any REMIC  after the startup day
therefor  pursuant to Section  860G(d) of the Code,  or any other tax imposed by
the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws, such tax shall
be charged (i) to the Master Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from
a breach by the Master Servicer of any of its  obligations  under this Agreement
or the Master  Servicer has in its sole  discretion  determined to indemnify the
Trust Fund against such tax,  (ii) to the Trustee,  if such tax arises out of or
results  from a breach  by the  Trustee  of any of its  obligations  under  this
Article X, or (iii)  otherwise  against  amounts  on  deposit  in the  Custodial
Account as provided by Section 3.10 and on the  Distribution  Date(s)  following
such  reimbursement  the aggregate of such taxes shall be allocated in reduction
of the Accrued  Certificate  Interest on each Class entitled thereto in the same
manner as if such taxes constituted a Prepayment Interest Shortfall.


                                             139

        (h) The Trustee and the Master  Servicer  shall,  for federal income tax
purposes,  maintain  books and records  with respect to each REMIC on a calendar
year and on an  accrual  basis or as  otherwise  may be  required  by the  REMIC
Provisions.

        (i)  Following  the startup  day,  neither the Master  Servicer  nor the
Trustee shall accept any contributions of assets to any REMIC unless (subject to
Section  10.01(f))  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee  shall have received an
Opinion  of  Counsel  (at  the  expense  of  the  party  seeking  to  make  such
contribution)  to the effect that the inclusion of such assets in any REMIC will
not cause any of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to qualify as
a REMIC at any time that any  Certificates  are  outstanding or subject any such
REMIC to any tax under the REMIC  Provisions or other  applicable  provisions of
federal, state and local law or ordinances.

        (j)  Neither  the Master  Servicer  nor the  Trustee  shall  (subject to
Section  10.01(f)) enter into any arrangement by which any of REMIC I, REMIC II,
REMIC III or REMIC IV will receive a fee or other  compensation for services nor
permit  any of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to  receive  any income
from assets other than "qualified mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of
the Code or  "permitted  investments"  as defined in Section  860G(a)(5)  of the
Code.

        (k)  Solely  for the  purposes  of  Section  1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii)  of the
Treasury  Regulations,   the  "latest  possible  maturity  date"  by  which  the
Certificate  Principal  Balance of each Class of  Certificates  (other  than the
Class A-I-3,  Class AV-I and Class AV-II  Certificates)  representing  a regular
interest in the applicable  REMIC and the  Uncertificated  Principal  Balance of
each  Uncertificated  Regular  Interest  is the  Maturity  Date  for  each  such
Certificate and Interest.

        (l) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the REMIC Administrator shall
prepare  and file with the  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form 8811,  "Information
Return for Real  Estate  Mortgage  Investment  Conduits  (REMIC)  and Issuers of
Collateralized Debt Obligations" for the Trust Fund.

        (m) Neither the Trustee nor the Master  Servicer shall sell,  dispose of
or substitute for any of the Mortgage  Loans (except in connection  with (i) the
default,  imminent default or foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan,  including but not
limited to, the acquisition or sale of a Mortgaged  Property acquired by deed in
lieu  of  foreclosure,  (ii)  the  bankruptcy  of  the  Trust  Fund,  (iii)  the
termination  of any REMIC  pursuant  to Article IX of this  Agreement  or (iv) a
purchase of Mortgage Loans  pursuant to Article II or III of this  Agreement) or
acquire  any assets for any REMIC or sell or dispose of any  investments  in the
Custodial   Account  or  the  Certificate   Account  for  gain,  or  accept  any
contributions  to any REMIC  after the Closing  Date  unless it has  received an
Opinion of Counsel that such sale, disposition, substitution or acquisition will
not (a) affect  adversely  the status of any of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or
REMIC IV as a REMIC or (b) unless the Master Servicer has determined in its sole
discretion to indemnify  the Trust Fund against such tax,  cause any REMIC to be
subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the
REMIC Provisions.

          Indemnification.

        (a) The Trustee agrees to indemnify the Trust Fund,  the Depositor,  the
REMIC  Administrator  and the Master Servicer for any taxes and costs including,
without limitation,  any reasonable attorneys fees imposed on or incurred by the
Trust Fund, the Depositor or the Master Servicer, as a result of a breach of the
Trustee's  covenants  set forth in Article  VIII or this Article X. In the event
that  Residential  Funding is no longer the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee shall
indemnify  Residential  Funding  for any  taxes  and  costs  including,  without
limitation,  any reasonable attorneys fees imposed on or incurred by Residential
Funding as a result of a breach of the Trustee's  covenants set forth in Article
VIII or this Article X.

        (b) The REMIC  Administrator  agrees to  indemnify  the Trust Fund,  the

incurred by the Trust Fund, the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer or the Trustee,
as a result of a breach of the REMIC Administrator's covenants set forth in this
Article  X with  respect  to  compliance  with the REMIC  Provisions,  including
without  limitation,  any penalties arising from the Trustee's  execution of Tax
Returns  prepared by the REMIC  Administrator  that contain errors or omissions;
provided,  however,  that such  liability will not be imposed to the extent such
breach is a result of an error or omission in information  provided to the REMIC
Administrator by the Master Servicer in which case Section 10.02(c) will apply.

        (c) The  Master  Servicer  agrees  to  indemnify  the  Trust  Fund,  the
Depositor,  the  REMIC  Administrator  and the  Trustee  for any taxes and costs

                                   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        Section  11.01       Amendment.

        (a) This  Agreement or any Custodial  Agreement may be amended from time
to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee:

               (i)    to cure any ambiguity,

               (ii) to correct or supplement any  provisions  herein or therein,
        which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein or therein or
        to correct any error,

               (iii) to modify,  eliminate  or add to any of its  provisions  to
        such  extent  as  shall  be  necessary  or  desirable  to  maintain  the
        qualification  of REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV as REMICs at
        all times that any  Certificate  is  outstanding or to avoid or minimize
        the risk of the  imposition of any tax on the Trust Fund pursuant to the
        Code that would be a claim  against  the Trust Fund,  provided  that the
        Trustee  has  received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) such
        action is necessary or desirable to maintain  such  qualification  or to
        avoid or  minimize  the risk of the  imposition  of any such tax and (B)
        such  action  will not  adversely  affect in any  material  respect  the
        interests of any Certificateholder,

               (iv) to change  the timing  and/or  nature of  deposits  into the
        Custodial  Account or the  Certificate  Account or to change the name in
        which  the  Custodial  Account  is  maintained,  provided  that  (A) the
        Certificate  Account  Deposit  Date  shall in no event be later than the

        Opinion  of  Counsel,  adversely  affect  in any  material  respect  the
        interests of any  Certificateholder and (C) such change shall not result
        in a reduction of the rating assigned to any Class of Certificates below
        the lower of the  then-current  rating or the  rating  assigned  to such
        Certificates  as of the Closing Date, as evidenced by a letter from each
        Rating Agency to such effect,

               (v) to  modify,  eliminate  or add to the  provisions  of Section
        5.02(f) or any other provision hereof restricting  transfer of the Class
        R Certificates by virtue of their being the "residual  interests" in the
        Trust Fund  provided  that (A) such change shall not result in reduction
        of the rating assigned to any such Class of Certificates below the lower
        of the then- current rating or the rating assigned to such  Certificates
        as of the Closing Date, as evidenced by a letter from each Rating Agency
        to such  effect,  and (B) such  change  shall not,  as  evidenced  by an
        Opinion of Counsel  (at the  expense of the party  seeking so to modify,
        eliminate  or add such  provisions),  cause the Trust Fund or any of the
        Certificateholders  (other  than  the  transferor)  to be  subject  to a
        federal  tax caused by a transfer  to a Person  that is not a  Permitted
        Transferee, or



                                             142

               (vi) to make any other  provisions  with  respect  to  matters or
        questions arising under this Agreement or such Custodial Agreement which
        shall  not be  materially  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  this
        Agreement,  provided  that such  action  shall not, as  evidenced  by an
        Opinion  of  Counsel,  adversely  affect  in any  material  respect  the
        interests of any  Certificateholder and is authorized or permitted under
        Section 11.09(d).

        (b) This  Agreement or any Custodial  Agreement may also be amended from
time to time by the Depositor,  the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Holders
of Certificates  evidencing in the aggregate not less than 66% of the Percentage
Interests  of each Class of  Certificates  affected  thereby  for the purpose of
adding any  provisions  to or changing in any manner or  eliminating  any of the
provisions of this Agreement or such Custodial  Agreement or of modifying in any
manner  the rights of the  Holders  of  Certificates  of such  Class;  provided,
however, that no such amendment shall:

               (i)  reduce in any  manner the amount of, or delay the timing of,
        payments which are required to be distributed on any Certificate without
        the consent of the Holder of such Certificate,

               (ii) adversely affect in any material respect the interest of the
        Holders of Certificates of any Class in a manner other than as described
        in clause (i) hereof without the consent of Holders of  Certificates  of
        such  Class  evidencing,   as  to  such  Class,   Percentage   Interests
        aggregating not less than 66%, or

               (iii) reduce the  aforesaid  percentage  of  Certificates  of any
        Class  the  Holders  of  which  are  required  to  consent  to any  such
        amendment,  in any such case  without  the consent of the Holders of all
        Certificates of such Class then outstanding.

        (c)  Notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  of this  Agreement,  the
Trustee  shall not consent to any  amendment to this  Agreement  unless it shall
have first  received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party  seeking
such  amendment) to the effect that such  amendment or the exercise of any power
granted to the Master Servicer,  the Depositor or the Trustee in accordance with
such amendment is permitted hereunder and will not result in the imposition of a
federal tax on the Trust Fund or cause REMIC I, REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV
to fail to qualify as REMICs at any time that any  Certificate  is  outstanding.
The Trustee may but shall not be obligated to enter into any amendment  pursuant
to this  Section  that  affects  its  rights,  duties  and  immunities  and this
agreement or otherwise; provided however, such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

        (d) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee shall
furnish  written  notification  of the  substance  of  such  amendment  to  each
Certificateholder.   It   shall   not  be   necessary   for   the   consent   of
Certificateholders  under this Section 11.01 to approve the  particular  form of
any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance  thereof.  The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing
the  authorization  of the  execution  thereof  by  Certificateholders  shall be
subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

        (e) The  Depositor  shall have the option,  in its sole  discretion,  to
obtain and deliver to the Trustee any corporate  guaranty,  payment  obligation,
irrevocable  letter  of  credit,   surety  bond,  insurance  policy  or  similar
instrument or a reserve  fund,  or any  combination  of the  foregoing,  for the
purpose of protecting the Holders of the Class R Certificates against any or all
Realized Losses or other  shortfalls.  Any such instrument or fund shall be held
by the Trustee for the benefit of the Class R Certificateholders,  but shall not
be and shall not be deemed to be under any  circumstances  included  in REMIC I,
REMIC II, REMIC III or REMIC IV. To the extent that any such  instrument or fund
constitutes a reserve fund for federal income tax purposes, (i) any reserve fund
so established  shall be an outside  reserve fund and not an asset of the REMIC,
(ii) any such reserve fund shall be owned by the  Depositor,  and (iii)  amounts
transferred  by the REMIC to any such  reserve  fund shall be treated as amounts
distributed  by the REMIC to the  Depositor  or any  successor,  all  within the
meaning of Treasury  regulations  Section  1.860G-2(h).  In connection  with the
provision of any such  instrument  or fund,  this  Agreement  and any  provision
hereof may be modified,  added to,  deleted or  otherwise  amended in any manner
that is related or incidental to such instrument or fund or the establishment or
administration thereof, such amendment to be made by written instrument executed
or  consented  to by the  Depositor  and such  related  insurer  but without the
consent of any  Certificateholder and without the consent of the Master Servicer
or the  Trustee  being  required  unless  any such  amendment  would  impose any
additional  obligation  on, or otherwise  adversely  affect the interests of the
Certificateholders,  the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable; provided
that the Depositor  obtains an Opinion of Counsel  (which need not be an opinion
of Independent counsel) to the effect that any such amendment will not cause (a)
any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund,  including without  limitation,
any federal tax imposed on "prohibited transactions" under Section 860F(a)(1) of
the Code or on "contributions  after the startup date" under Section  860G(d)(1)
of the Code and (b) any of REMIC I,  REMIC II,  REMIC III or REMIC IV to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding. In the event
that the  Depositor  elects to provide  such  coverage  in the form of a limited
guaranty  provided by General Motors Acceptance  Corporation,  the Depositor may
elect that the text of such amendment to this Agreement  shall be  substantially
in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit K (in which case  Residential  Funding's
Subordinate  Certificate  Loss  Obligation as described in such exhibit shall be
established by  Residential  Funding's  consent to such  amendment) and that the
limited  guaranty  shall be executed in the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit L,
with such  changes  as the  Depositor  shall  deem to be  appropriate;  it being
understood  that the Trustee has reviewed and approved the content of such forms
and that the Trustee's consent or approval to the use thereof is not required.

        Section  11.02       Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

        (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is subject
to recordation in all  appropriate  public offices for real property  records in
all the counties or other  comparable  jurisdictions  in which any or all of the
properties  subject to the Mortgages are situated,  and in any other appropriate
public  recording  office or elsewhere,  such  recordation to be effected by the
Master Servicer and at its expense on direction by the Trustee  (pursuant to the
request of the  Holders of  Certificates  entitled to at least 25% of the Voting
Rights), but only upon direction accompanied by


                                             144

<PAGE>



an  Opinion  of  Counsel to the  effect  that such  recordation  materially  and
beneficially affects the interests of the Certificateholders.

        (b) For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this Agreement as
herein  provided  and  for  other  purposes,  this  Agreement  may  be  executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts,  each of which  counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original,  and such counterparts shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.

        Section  11.03       Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders.

        (a) The death or incapacity of any  Certificateholder  shall not operate
to   terminate   this   Agreement   or  the  Trust  Fund,   nor   entitle   such
Certificateholder's  legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or  proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust Fund, nor otherwise affect the rights,  obligations and liabilities of any
of the parties hereto.

        (b) No  Certificateholder  shall  have  any  right  to vote  (except  as
expressly  provided herein) or in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management  of the Trust Fund, or the  obligations  of the parties  hereto,  nor
shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the  Certificates,
be construed so as to  constitute  the  Certificateholders  from time to time as
partners or members of an association;  nor shall any Certificateholder be under
any  liability  to any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties
to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

        (c) No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any provision
of this  Agreement to institute  any suit,  action or proceeding in equity or at
law  upon or  under  or with  respect  to this  Agreement,  unless  such  Holder
previously  shall have given to the  Trustee a written  notice of default and of
the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore  provided,  and unless also the Holders
of  Certificates  of any Class  evidencing in the aggregate not less than 25% of
the related Percentage  Interests of such Class, shall have made written request
upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as
Trustee  hereunder  and  shall  have  offered  to the  Trustee  such  reasonable
indemnity as it may require  against the costs,  expenses and  liabilities to be
incurred  therein  or  thereby,  for 60 days after its  receipt of such  notice,
request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any
such action,  suit or proceeding  it being  understood  and intended,  and being
expressly    covenanted   by   each    Certificateholder    with   every   other
Certificateholder  and the Trustee,  that no one or more Holders of Certificates
of any  Class  shall  have any  right in any  manner  whatever  by virtue of any
provision of this  Agreement to affect,  disturb or prejudice  the rights of the
Holders of any other of such  Certificates  of such Class or any other Class, or
to  obtain or seek to  obtain  priority  over or  preference  to any other  such
Holder,  or to  enforce  any right  under this  Agreement,  except in the manner
herein provided and for the common benefit of  Certificateholders  of such Class
or all Classes,  as the case may be. For the protection  and  enforcement of the
provisions  of this  Section  11.03,  each and every  Certificateholder  and the
Trustee  shall be entitled  to such  relief as can be given  either at law or in
equity.

hereunder, or any portion of any such Class, as to which the Depositor or any of
its  Affiliates  (or  any  designee  thereof)  is  the  registered  Holder  (the
"Resecuritized  Certificates"),  the  Depositor  may deposit such  Resecuritized

"Restructuring  Vehicle") to be held by the Trustee  pursuant to a  Supplemental
Article.  The instrument adopting such Supplemental Article shall be executed by

Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (i) the  Restructuring  Vehicle
will  qualify as a REMIC,  grantor  trust,  FASIT or other entity not subject to
taxation  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  and  (ii)  the  adoption  of  the
Supplemental  Article  will not endanger the status of any of REMIC I, REMIC II,
REMIC III or REMIC IV as a REMIC or result in the  imposition  of a tax upon the
Trust Fund  (including  but not limited to the tax on prohibited  transaction as
defined  in Section  860F(a)(2)  of the Code and the tax on  contributions  to a
REMIC as set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code.

certificate  or other  obligation  secured by or payable  from  payments  on the
Certificates.

         This  certifies  that  Cede  & Co.  is  the  registered  owner  of  the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained by dividing the
Initial [Notional Amount] [Certificate Principal Balance] of this Certificate by
the aggregate Initial [Notional Amount]  [Certificate  Principal Balance] of all
Class  [A-I-_][A-II][A-III]  Certificates,  both as specified  above) in certain
distributions with respect to the Trust Fund consisting primarily of an interest
in a pool of conventional  one- to four-family  fixed and adjustable rate, first
lien mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans"), formed and sold by Residential Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc. (hereinafter called the "Depositor," which term includes
any successor entity under the Agreement  referred to below). The Trust Fund was
created  pursuant the Pooling and  Servicing  Agreement  dated as of December 1,
2002 (the  "Agreement")  among the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer and Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), a summary of certain of
the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the extent not
defined herein,  the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in
the  Agreement.  This  Certificate  is issued under and is subject to the terms,
provisions  and conditions of the  Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of
this  Certificate by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  and the amount of interest
[and  principal],  if any,  required  to be  distributed  to  Holders  of  Class
[A-I-_][A-II][A-III] Certificates on such Distribution Date.

         Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
[Certificate  Principal  Balance]  [Notional  Amount] of this Certificate is set
forth above.  [The Certificate  Principal  Balance hereof will be reduced to the
extent of distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable
hereto.]

     This Certificate is one of a duly authorized  issue of Certificates  issued
in several Classes

                                                       A-1-3

designated  as Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through  Certificates  of the Series
specified hereon (herein collectively called the "Certificates").

         The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the  Depositor  and the Master  Servicer of advances  made, or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

         The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  and the  rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as

requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         The obligations created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last related Mortgage Loan subject
thereto or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in
lieu of  foreclosure  of any related  Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the
Master Servicer from the Trust Fund of all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans, thereby effecting early
retirement  of the related  Certificates.  The Agreement  permits,  but does not
require,  the Master Servicer to (i) purchase at a price  determined as provided
in the Agreement all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and all property acquired
in respect of any related  Mortgage Loan or (ii)  purchase in whole,  but not in
part, all of the related Certificates from the Holders thereof;  provided,  that
any such option may only be exercised if the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance
of the  related  Mortgage  Loans as of the  Distribution  Date  upon  which  the
proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans.

         Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions of this Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Certificate  Registrar,  by manual signature,  this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

         This  certifies  that  Cede  & Co.  is  the  registered  owner  of  the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained by dividing the
Initial  Certificate  Principal  Balance of this  Certificate  by the  aggregate
Initial Certificate Principal Balance of all Class AP-[_] Certificates,  both as
specified  above) in  certain  distributions  with  respect  to the  Trust  Fund
consisting  primarily  of  an  interest  in  a  pool  of  conventional  one-  to
four-family  fixed and adjustable rate, first lien mortgage loans (the "Mortgage
Loans"),   formed  and  sold  by  Residential  Asset  Mortgage  Products,   Inc.
(hereinafter  called the  "Depositor,"  which term includes any successor entity
under the Agreement  referred to below). The Trust Fund was created pursuant the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement dated as of December 1, 2002 (the  "Agreement")
among the  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer  and  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company
Americas  as trustee  (the  "Trustee"),  a summary  of certain of the  pertinent
provisions of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the extent not defined  herein,
the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings  assigned in the Agreement.
This  Certificate  is issued under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and
conditions of the Agreement,  to which Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this Certificate and the amount of principal,
if any,  required to be distributed to Holders of Class AP-[_]  Certificates  on
such Distribution Date.

         Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of this  Certificate  is set forth  above.  The
Certificate   Principal  Balance  hereof  will  be  reduced  to  the  extent  of
distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable hereto.

         This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue of  Certificates
issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

         The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the  Depositor  and the Master  Servicer of advances  made, or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

         The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  and the  rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

     No service  charge  will be made for any such  registration  of transfer or
exchange, but the

Trustee  may  require  payment  of a sum  sufficient  to cover  any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         The obligations created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last related Mortgage Loan subject
thereto or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in
lieu of  foreclosure  of any related  Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the
Master Servicer from the Trust Fund of all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans, thereby effecting early

in the Agreement all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and all property acquired

part, all of the related Certificates from the Holders thereof;  provided,  that
any such option may only be exercised if the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance
of the  related  Mortgage  Loans as of the  Distribution  Date  upon  which  the
proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans.

         Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions of this Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Certificate  Registrar,  by manual signature,  this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

         adjustable   rate,  first  lien  mortgage  loans  formed  and  sold  by
         RESIDENTIAL ASSET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INC.

     This  Certificate  is payable solely from the assets of the Trust Fund, and
does not represent an obligation of or interest in  RESIDENTIAL  ASSET  MORTGAGE
PRODUCTS,  INC.,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee  referred to below or GMAC

four-family  fixed and adjustable rate, first lien mortgage loans (the "Mortgage
Loans"),   formed  and  sold  by  Residential  Asset  Mortgage  Products,   Inc.
(hereinafter  called the  "Depositor,"  which term includes any successor entity
under the Agreement  referred to below). The Trust Fund was created pursuant the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement dated as of December 1, 2002 (the  "Agreement")
among the  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer  and  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company
Americas,  as trustee  (the  "Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the  pertinent
provisions of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the extent not defined  herein,
the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings  assigned in the Agreement.
This  Certificate  is issued under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and
conditions of the Agreement,  to which Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount of interest, if
any, required to be distributed to Holders of Class AV-[__] Certificates on such
Distribution  Date. The Notional Amount of the Class AV-[__]  Certificates as of
any date of determination is equal to the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance of
the Mortgage Loans  corresponding to the Uncertificated  REMIC Regular Interests
represented by such Class AV-[__]  Certificates.  The Class AV-[__] Certificates
have no Certificate Principal Balance.

         Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Notional
Amount of this Certificate is set forth above.

         This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue of  Certificates
issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

     The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections and
recoveries  respecting the Mortgage Loans,  all as more  specifically  set forth
herein and in the Agreement. In

the event Master  Servicer funds are advanced with respect to any Mortgage Loan,
such advance is reimbursable to the Master  Servicer,  to the extent provided in
the Agreement,  from related recoveries on such Mortgage Loan or from other cash
that would have been distributable to Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the  Depositor  and the Master  Servicer of advances  made, or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

         The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  and the  rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         The obligations created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last related Mortgage Loan subject
thereto or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in
lieu of  foreclosure  of any related  Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the
Master Servicer from the Trust Fund of all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans, thereby effecting early
retirement  of the related  Certificates.  The Agreement  permits,  but does not
require,  the Master Servicer to (i) purchase at a price  determined as provided
in the Agreement all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and all property acquired
in respect of any related  Mortgage Loan or (ii)  purchase in whole,  but not in
part, all of the related Certificates from the Holders thereof;  provided,  that
any such option may only be exercised if the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance
of the  related  Mortgage  Loans as of the  Distribution  Date  upon  which  the
proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans.

         Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions of this Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Certificate  Registrar,  by manual signature,  this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

         This  certifies  that  Cede  & Co.  is  the  registered  owner  of  the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained by dividing the
Certificate  Principal Balance of this Certificate by the aggregate  Certificate
Principal Balance of all Class M-[_-_] Certificates, both as specified above) in
certain  distributions  with respect to a Trust Fund  consisting  primarily of a
pool of conventional  one- to four-family  fixed and adjustable rate, first lien
mortgage loans (the  "Mortgage  Loans"),  formed and sold by  Residential  Asset
Mortgage Products, Inc. (hereinafter called the "Depositor," which term includes
any successor entity under the Agreement  referred to below). The Trust Fund was
created  pursuant the Pooling and  Servicing  Agreement  dated as of December 1,
2002 (the  "Agreement")  among the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer and Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), a summary of certain of
the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the extent not
defined herein,  the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in
the  Agreement.  This  Certificate  is issued under and is subject to the terms,
provisions  and conditions of the  Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of
this  Certificate by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the Available  Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate and the amount (of interest
and  principal,  if any) required to be  distributed to Holders of Class M-[_-_]
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

         Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of this  Certificate  is set forth  above.  The
Certificate  Principal  Balance  hereof  will be  reduced  to the  extent of the
distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable hereto.

         As described  above,  any transferee of this Certificate will be deemed
to have represented by virtue of its purchase or holding of this Certificate (or
interest herein) that either (A) such transferee is not a Plan Investor,  (B) it
has acquired and is holding this  Certificate  in reliance on the RFC  Exemption
and that it understands that there are certain conditions to the availability of
the RFC Exemption  including that this Certificate must be rated, at the time of
purchase, not lower than

                                                        B-4

"BBB-" (or its  equivalent)  by  Standard & Poor's,  Fitch or Moody's or (C) the
transferee  is  a  Complying  Insurance  Company.  In  addition,  any  purported
Certificate  Owner whose acquisition or holding of this Certificate (or interest
herein) was effected in violation of the  restrictions in Section 5.02(f) of the
Agreement  shall  indemnify and hold harmless the  Depositor,  the Trustee,  the
Master Servicer,  any  Subservicer,  and the Trust Fund from and against any and
all liabilities,  claims, costs or expenses incurred by such parties as a result
of such acquisition or holding.

         This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue of  Certificates
issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

         The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the  Depositor  and the Master  Servicer of advances  made, or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

         The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  and the  rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer  and the  Trustee  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of  Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates  affected thereby.  Any such consent by the Holder of
this  Certificate  shall be  conclusive  and binding on such Holder and upon all
future  holders  of this  Certificate  and of any  Certificate  issued  upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also permits the
amendment thereof in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of
any of the Certificates and, in certain  additional  circumstances,  without the
consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,
duly  endorsed by, or  accompanied  by an  assignment in the form below or other
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

                                                        B-5

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         The obligations created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last related Mortgage Loan subject
thereto or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in
lieu of  foreclosure  of any related  Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the
Master Servicer from the Trust Fund of all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans, thereby effecting early
retirement  of the related  Certificates.  The Agreement  permits,  but does not
require,  the Master Servicer to (i) purchase at a price  determined as provided
in the Agreement all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and all property acquired
in respect of any related  Mortgage Loan or (ii)  purchase in whole,  but not in
part, all of the related Certificates from the Holders thereof;  provided,  that
any such option may only be exercised if the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance
of the  related  Mortgage  Loans as of the  Distribution  Date  upon  which  the
proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans.

         Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Certificate  Registrar,  by manual signature,  this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

         This certifies that  [_______________]  is the registered  owner of the
Percentage  Interest  evidenced  by this  Certificate  (obtained by dividing the
Initial  Certificate  Principal  Balance of this  Certificate  by the  aggregate
Initial Certificate Principal Balance of all Class B-[_-_] Certificates, both as
specified  above) in  certain  distributions  with  respect  to the  Trust  Fund
consisting  primarily  of  an  interest  in  a  pool  of  conventional  one-  to
four-family  fixed and adjustable rate, first lien mortgage loans (the "Mortgage
Loans"),  formed  and  sold  by  Residential  Asset  Mortgage  Products,   Inc..
(hereinafter  called the  "Depositor,"  which term includes any successor entity
under the Agreement  referred to below).  The Trust Fund was created pursuant to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1, 2002 (together,  the
"Pooling and  Servicing  Agreement"  or the  "Agreement")  among the  Depositor,
Deutsche Bank Trust Company  Americas as trustee (the  "Trustee"),  a summary of
certain of the  pertinent  provisions  of which is set forth  hereafter.  To the
extent not defined herein,  the capitalized  terms used herein have the meanings
assigned in the  Agreement.  This  Certificate is issued under and is subject to
the terms,  provisions and conditions of the Agreement,  to which  Agreement the
Holder of this  Certificate  by virtue of the  acceptance  hereof assents and by
which such Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day immediately following (the "Distribution Date"),  commencing on the
first  Distribution  Date  specified  above,  to the  Person in whose  name this
Certificate  is  registered at the close of business on the last day (or if such
last day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately preceding such last
day) of the month next  preceding  the month of such  distribution  (the "Record
Date"), from the Available Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product
of the  Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  and the amount (of
interest and principal, if any) required to be distributed to Holders of Class B
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

         Distributions  on this  Certificate  will be made  either by the Master
Servicer  acting on behalf of the Trustee or by a Paying Agent  appointed by the
Trustee in immediately  available  funds (by wire transfer or otherwise) for the
account of the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Master  Servicer or such Paying Agent,  or by check mailed to the address of the
Person  entitled  thereto,  as  such  name  and  address  shall  appear  on  the
Certificate Register.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that  purpose in the City and State of New York.  The Initial
Certificate  Principal  Balance  of this  Certificate  is set forth  above.  The
Certificate  Principal  Balance  hereof  will be  reduced  to the  extent of the
distributions allocable to principal and any Realized Losses allocable hereto.

         No  transfer  of this  Class B  Certificate  will be made  unless  such
transfer is exempt from the  registration  requirements of the Securities Act of
1933,  as  amended,  and  any  applicable  state  securities  laws or is made in
accordance  with said Act and laws.  In the event that such a transfer  is to be
made,  (i) the  Trustee  or the  Depositor  may  require  an  opinion of counsel
acceptable to and in

                                                        C-3

form and  substance  satisfactory  to the  Trustee and the  Depositor  that such
transfer is exempt (describing the applicable  exemption and the basis therefor)
from  or is  being  made  pursuant  to  the  registration  requirements  of  the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and of any applicable  statute of any state
and (ii) the transferee shall execute an investment letter in the form described
by Section  5.02(d) of the Agreement.  The Holder hereof desiring to effect such
transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee,  the Depositor,
the  Master  Servicer  and the  Certificate  Registrar  acting  on behalf of the
Trustee  against any liability  that may result if the transfer is not so exempt
or is not made in  accordance  with such Federal and state laws.  In  connection
with any such  transfer,  the Trustee will also require either (i) an opinion of
counsel acceptable to and in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, the
Depositor  and the Master  Servicer with respect to the  permissibility  of such
transfer under the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"),  and  Section  4975 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code (the  "Code") and
stating,  among other things,  that the  transferee's  acquisition  of a Class B
Certificate will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) a  representation
letter,  in the form as  described  by the  Agreement,  either  stating that the
transferee  is not an employee  benefit or other plan subject to the  prohibited
transaction  provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a "Plan"),  or any
other person (including an investment manager, a named fiduciary or a trustee of
any Plan)  acting,  directly  or  indirectly,  on behalf  of or  purchasing  any
Certificate with "plan assets" of any Plan, or stating that the transferee is an
insurance  company,  the  source  of  funds  to be  used by it to  purchase  the
Certificate is an "insurance  company  general  account"  (within the meaning of
Department of Labor Prohibited  Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 95-60), and
the purchase is being made in reliance  upon the  availability  of the exemptive
relief afforded under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60.

         This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue of  Certificates
issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

         The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders may
be made by the  Master  Servicer  from  time to time  for  purposes  other  than
distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without limitation
reimbursement  to the  Depositor  and the Master  Servicer of advances  made, or
certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

Depositor,  the Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders
of Certificates  evidencing in the aggregate not less than 66% of the Percentage
Interests of each Class of Certificates  affected  thereby.  Any such consent by
the Holder of this  Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder
and upon all future holders of this  Certificate and of any  Certificate  issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation  of such  consent  is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also
permits the amendment  thereof in certain  circumstances  without the consent of
the Holders of any of the Certificates and, in certain additional circumstances,
without the consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this  Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in the City and State of New York,

written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the
Certificate  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder  hereof or such  Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of authorized  denominations  evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage
Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee and the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with

(hereinafter  called the  "Depositor,"  which term includes any successor entity
under the Agreement referred to below). The Trust Fund was created pursuant to a
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement dated as specified above (the "Agreement) among
the Depositor,  the Master Servicer and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
trustee (the  "Trustee"),  a summary of certain of the  pertinent  provisions of
which is set forth hereafter.  To the extent not defined herein, the capitalized
terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.  This Certificate
is issued under and is subject to the terms,  provisions  and  conditions of the
Agreement,  to which  Agreement the Holder of this  Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each  month  or,  if such 25th day is not a  Business  Day,  the
Business Day  immediately  following (the  "Distribution  Date"),  commencing as
described  in the  Agreement,  to the Person in whose name this  Certificate  is
registered  at the close of business on the last day (or if such last day is not
a Business  Day, the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such last day) of the
month immediately  preceding the month of such distribution (the "Record Date"),
from the related Available Distribution Amount in an amount equal to the product
of the  Percentage  Interest  evidenced by this  Certificate  and, the amount of
interest and principal, if any, required to be distributed to Holders of Class R
Certificates on such Distribution Date.

         Each  Holder of this  Certificate  will be deemed to have  agreed to be
bound by the restrictions set forth in the Agreement to the effect that (i) each
person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate must be a
United  States  Person and a  Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) the  transfer  of any
Ownership  Interest in this Certificate will be conditioned upon the delivery to
the Trustee of,  among other  things,  an  affidavit  to the effect that it is a
United States Person and Permitted  Transferee,  (ii) any attempted or purported
transfer of any  Ownership  Interest in this  Certificate  in  violation of such
restrictions  will be  absolutely  null and void and will  vest no rights in the
purported  transferee,  and (iv) if any person other than a United States Person
and a Permitted  Transferee  acquires any Ownership Interest in this Certificate
in violation of such restrictions, then the Master Servicer will have the right,
in its sole discretion and without notice to the Holder of this Certificate,  to
sell this  Certificate  to a purchaser  selected by the Master  Servicer,  which
purchaser may be the Master  Servicer,  or any affiliate of the Master Servicer,
on such terms and conditions as the Master Servicer may choose.

         Notwithstanding  the above, the final  distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed
by the Trustee for that purpose in the City and State of New York. The Holder of
this   Certificate  may  have  additional   obligations  with  respect  to  this
Certificate, including tax liabilities.

         No transfer of this Certificate or any interest herein shall be made to
any Plan  subject  to ERISA or  Section  4975 of the Code,  any  Person  acting,
directly or indirectly,  on behalf of any such Plan or any Person acquiring such
Certificates  with "plan assets" of a Plan within the meaning of the  Department
of Labor  regulation  promulgated  at 29 C.F.R.  ss.2510.3-101  ("Plan  Assets")

the Depositor,  the Trustee and the Master Servicer are provided with an Opinion
of Counsel which  establishes to the satisfaction of the Depositor,  the Trustee
and the Master  Servicer that the purchase of this  Certificate  is  permissible
under   applicable  law,  will  not  constitute  or  result  in  any  prohibited
transaction  under  ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code and will not  subject the
Depositor,  the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the Trust Fund to any obligation
or liability (including obligations,  or liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) in addition to those undertaken in the Agreement,  which Opinion of
Counsel  shall not be an expense of the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer,  the
Trustee or the Trust  Fund.  In lieu of such  Opinion of  Counsel,  a Plan,  any
Person acting  directly or indirectly,  on behalf of any such Plan or any Person
acquiring  this   Certificate   with  Plan  Assets  of  a  Plan  may  provide  a
certification in the form of paragraph fourteen of Exhibit H-1 to the Agreement,
which the Trustee may rely upon without further inquiry or investigation.

         This  Certificate  is one of a duly  authorized  issue of  Certificates
issued in several  Classes  designated  as  Mortgage  Asset-Backed  Pass-Through
Certificates  of the Series  specified  hereon (herein  collectively  called the
"Certificates").

         The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections
and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth
herein and in the  Agreement.  In the event Master  Servicer  funds are advanced
with respect to any Mortgage Loan,  such advance is  reimbursable  to the Master
Servicer,  to the extent provided in the Agreement,  from related  recoveries on
such  Mortgage  Loan or from other cash that  would have been  distributable  to
Certificateholders.

         As provided in the Agreement,  withdrawals  from the Custodial  Account
and/or the Certificate Account created for the benefit of Certificateholders and
the Insurer may be made by the Master  Servicer  from time to time for  purposes
other than distributions to Certificateholders,  such purposes including without
limitation  reimbursement  to the Depositor and the Master  Servicer of advances
made, or certain expenses incurred, by either of them.

         The Agreement permits,  with certain  exceptions therein provided,  the
amendment of the Agreement and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the  Depositor,  the  Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  and the  rights of the
Certificateholders  under the Agreement from time to time by the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
evidencing  in the aggregate  not less than 66% of the  Percentage  Interests of
each Class of Certificates affected thereby and the Insurer. Any such consent by
the Holder of this  Certificate  shall be conclusive  and binding on such Holder
and upon all future holders of this  Certificate and of any  Certificate  issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation  of such  consent  is made upon the  Certificate.  The  Agreement  also
permits the amendment  thereof in certain  circumstances  without the consent of
the Holders of any of the Certificates and, in certain additional circumstances,
without the consent of the Holders of certain Classes of Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  the transfer of this  Certificate is registrable in the  Certificate
Register upon surrender of this Certificate for

                                                        D-5

registration of transfer at the offices or agencies  appointed by the Trustee in
the  City and  State  of New  York,  duly  endorsed  by,  or  accompanied  by an
assignment  in the form below or other  written  instrument  of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Trustee and the  Certificate  Registrar duly executed by the
Holder  hereof  or such  Holder's  attorney  duly  authorized  in  writing,  and
thereupon one or more new  Certificates of authorized  denominations  evidencing
the  same  Class  and  aggregate  Percentage  Interest  will  be  issued  to the
designated transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered  Certificates  without
coupons in Classes and in denominations  specified in the Agreement. As provided
in  the  Agreement  and  subject  to  certain  limitations  therein  set  forth,
Certificates are  exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized  denominations
evidencing the same Class and aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange,  but the Trustee may require  payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The  Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the  Trustee,  the  Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor,  the Master  Servicer,  the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Depositor,  the
Master  Servicer,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

         This Certificate  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         The obligations created by the Agreement in respect of the Certificates
and the  Trust  Fund  created  thereby  shall  terminate  upon  the  payment  to
Certificateholders  of all  amounts  held by or on  behalf  of the  Trustee  and
required to be paid to them pursuant to the  Agreement  following the earlier of
(i) the maturity or other  liquidation of the last related Mortgage Loan subject
thereto or the disposition of all property  acquired upon foreclosure or deed in
lieu of  foreclosure  of any related  Mortgage Loan and (ii) the purchase by the
Master Servicer from the Trust Fund of all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and
all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans, thereby effecting early
retirement  of the related  Certificates.  The Agreement  permits,  but does not
require,  the Master Servicer to (i) purchase at a price  determined as provided
in the Agreement all remaining  related Mortgage Loans and all property acquired
in respect of any related  Mortgage Loan or (ii)  purchase in whole,  but not in
part, all of the related Certificates from the Holders thereof;  provided,  that
any such option may only be exercised if the aggregate Stated Principal  Balance
of the  related  Mortgage  Loans as of the  Distribution  Date  upon  which  the
proceeds of any such  purchase are  distributed  is less than ten percent of the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans.

     Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by the
Certificate Registrar,

supplemented from time to time, the "Pooling Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS,  the  Custodian has agreed to act as agent for the Trustee for
the purposes of receiving and holding  certain  documents and other  instruments
delivered by the Company and the Master  Servicer  under the Pooling  Agreement,
all upon the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations hereinafter set

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants and agreements  hereinafter set forth, the Trustee,  the Company,  the
Master Servicer and the Custodian hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   Definitions

         Capitalized  terms used in this  Agreement and not defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned in the Original Pooling  Agreement,  unless otherwise
required by the context herein.

                                   ARTICLE II

                          Custody of Mortgage Documents

     Section 2.1 Custodian to Act as Agent;  Acceptance of Mortgage  Files.  The
Custodian, as

                                                        E-1

<PAGE>



the duly appointed agent of the Trustee for these purposes, acknowledges receipt
of the Mortgage Files relating to the Mortgage Loans  identified on the schedule
attached hereto (the "Mortgage  Files") and declares that it holds and will hold
the Mortgage Files as agent for the Trustee,  in trust,  for the use and benefit
of all present and future Certificateholders.

         Section 2.2 Recordation of  Assignments.  If any Mortgage File includes
one or more  assignments  of the related  Mortgages to the Trustee that have not
been recorded,  each such assignment  shall be delivered by the Custodian to the
Company for the purpose of recording  it in the  appropriate  public  office for
real property records,  and the Company,  at no expense to the Custodian,  shall
promptly cause to be recorded in the appropriate public office for real property
records each such  assignment and, upon receipt thereof from such public office,
shall return each such assignment to the Custodian.

         Section 2.3       Review of Mortgage Files.

         (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Custodian shall deliver to the
Trustee an  Initial  Certification  in the form  annexed  hereto as Exhibit  One
evidencing  receipt  of a Mortgage  File for each  Mortgage  Loan  listed on the
Schedule  attached  hereto (the  "Mortgage Loan  Schedule").  The parties hereto
acknowledge that certain documents  referred to in Subsection  2.01(b)(i) of the
Pooling  Agreement  may be  missing  on or  prior to the  Closing  Date and such
missing documents shall be listed as a Schedule to Exhibit One.

         (b) Within 45 days of the  initial  issuance of the  Certificates,  the
Custodian agrees, for the benefit of Certificateholders, to review in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.02 of the Pooling  Agreement each Mortgage File
and to deliver  to the  Trustee an  Interim  Certification  in the form  annexed
hereto as Exhibit Two to the effect that all documents  required to be delivered
pursuant to Section  2.01 (b) of the Pooling  Agreement  have been  executed and
received and that such documents  relate to the Mortgage Loans identified on the
Mortgage Loan Schedule,  except for any exceptions listed on Schedule A attached
to such Interim Certification.  For purposes of such review, the Custodian shall
compare the following  information  in each  Mortgage File to the  corresponding
information  in the  Mortgage  Loan  Schedule:  (i) the  loan  number,  (ii) the
borrower name and (iii) the original principal  balance.  The Custodian shall be
under no duty or  obligation  to  inspect,  review or  examine  said  documents,
instruments,  certificates  or  other  papers  to  determine  that  the same are
genuine,  enforceable,  or appropriate for the represented  purpose or that they
have  actually been recorded or that they are other than what they purport to be
on their face, or that the MIN is accurate. If in performing the review required
by this Section 2.3 the Custodian finds any document or documents constituting a
part of a  Mortgage  File to be  missing  or  defective  in respect of the items
reviewed as described in this Section  2.3(b),  the Custodian  shall promptly so
notify the Company, the Master Servicer and the Trustee.

         (c) Upon receipt of all documents  required to be in the Mortgage Files
the  Custodian  shall deliver to the Trustee a Final  Certification  in the form
annexed  hereto as Exhibit Three  evidencing  the  completeness  of the Mortgage
Files.

         Upon receipt of written  request  from the Trustee,  the Company or the
Master Servicer,  the Custodian shall as soon as practicable  supply the Trustee
with a list of all of the documents  relating to the Mortgage  Loans required to
be  delivered  pursuant to Section  2.01 (b) of the Pooling  Agreement  not then
contained in the Mortgage Files.

         Section 2.4 Notification of Breaches of Representations and Warranties.
If the Custodian discovers, in the course of performing its custodial functions,
a breach of a  representation  or  warranty  made by the Master  Servicer or the
Company as set forth in the Pooling  Agreement  with respect to a Mortgage  Loan
relating to a Mortgage File,  the Custodian  shall give prompt written notice to
the Company, the Master Servicer and the Trustee.

         Section 2.5 Custodian to Cooperate: Release of Mortgage Files. Upon the
repurchase  or  substitution  of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Article II of the
Pooling Agreement or payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the
Master  Servicer of a  notification  that  payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Master Servicer shall immediately notify
the  Custodian by delivering to the Custodian a Request for Release (in the form
of Exhibit Four attached hereto or a mutually  acceptable  electronic  form) and
shall request  delivery to it of the Mortgage File. The Custodian  agrees,  upon
receipt of such Request for Release,  promptly to release to the Master Servicer
the related  Mortgage File. Upon written  notification  of a  substitution,  the
Master  Servicer  shall deliver to the  Custodian  and the  Custodian  agrees to
accept the Mortgage Note and other documents constituting the Mortgage File with
respect to any  Qualified  Substitute  Mortgage  Loan,  upon  receiving  written
notification from the Master Servicer of such substitution.

         Upon receipt of a Request for Release from the Master Servicer,  signed
by a Servicing  Officer,  that (i) the Master Servicer or a Subservicer,  as the
case may be, has made a deposit into the Certificate  Account in payment for the
purchase of the related  Mortgage Loan in an amount equal to the Purchase  Price
for such  Mortgage Loan or (ii) the Company has chosen to substitute a Qualified
Substitute  Mortgage Loan for such Mortgage Loan, the Custodian shall release to
the Master Servicer the related Mortgage File.

         From time to time as is appropriate  for the servicing or  foreclosures
of any Mortgage Loan, including, for this purpose,  collection under any Primary
Insurance  Policy or any Mortgage Pool  Insurance  Policy,  the Master  Servicer
shall deliver to the Custodian a Request for Release certifying as to the reason
for such release. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the Custodian shall deliver the
Mortgage File or such document to the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall
cause each Mortgage  File or any document  therein so released to be returned to
the Custodian  when the need therefor by the Master  Servicer no longer  exists,
unless (i) the Mortgage Loan has been  liquidated and the  Liquidation  Proceeds
relating to the Mortgage Loan have been  deposited in the  Custodial  Account or
(ii) the Mortgage File or such document has been delivered to an attorney, or to
a public  trustee or other  public  official as required by law, for purposes of
initiating or pursuing legal action or other  proceedings for the foreclosure of
the Mortgaged Property either judicially or non-judicially,

                                                        E-3

and the Master  Servicer has delivered to the  Custodian an updated  Request for
Release signed by a Servicing  Officer  certifying as to the name and address of
the Person to which such  Mortgage  File or such  document was delivered and the
purpose or purposes of such delivery.  Immediately  upon receipt of any Mortgage
File  returned to the  Custodian by the Master  Servicer,  the  Custodian  shall
deliver a signed  acknowledgment to the Master Servicer,  confirming  receipt of
such Mortgage File.

         Upon the request of the Master Servicer, the Custodian will send to the
Master Servicer copies of any documents contained in the Mortgage File.

         Section 2.6  Assumption  Agreements.  In the event that any  assumption
agreement or substitution of liability agreement is entered into with respect to
any Mortgage  Loan subject to this  Agreement in  accordance  with the terms and
provisions  of the  Pooling  Agreement,  the Master  Servicer  shall  notify the
Custodian that such assumption or  substitution  agreement has been completed by
forwarding  to the Custodian  the original of such  assumption  or  substitution
agreement,  which  shall be added to the  related  Mortgage  File  and,  for all
purposes, shall be considered a part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as
all other documents and instruments constituting parts thereof.

                                   ARTICLE III

                            Concerning the Custodian

         Section 3.1  Custodian a Bailee and Agent of the Trustee.  With respect
to each Mortgage Note,  Mortgage and other documents  constituting each Mortgage
File which are  delivered to the  Custodian,  the Custodian is  exclusively  the
bailee and agent of the Trustee  and has no  instructions  to hold any  Mortgage
Note or Mortgage  for the  benefit of any person  other than the Trustee and the
Certificateholders and undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
are  specifically  set forth in this Agreement.  Except upon compliance with the
provisions of Section 2.5 of this Agreement, no Mortgage Note, Mortgage or other
document  constituting  a part of a  Mortgage  File  shall be  delivered  by the
Custodian to the Company or the Master  Servicer or otherwise  released from the
possession of the Custodian.

         The Master  Servicer shall promptly  notify the Custodian in writing if
it shall no longer be a member of MERS,  or if it  otherwise  shall no longer be
capable of registering and recording Mortgage Loans using MERS. In addition, the
Master  Servicer shall (i) promptly  notify the Custodian in writing when a MERS
Mortgage  Loan is no longer  registered  with and  recorded  under MERS and (ii)
concurrently  with any such  deregistration  of a MERS Mortgage  Loan,  prepare,
execute and record an original  assignment  from MERS to the Trustee and deliver
such assignment to the Custodian.

         Section 3.2 Indemnification. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold the Custodian  harmless from and against all claims,  liabilities,  losses,
actions,  suits or proceedings at law or in equity, or any other expenses,  fees
or charges of any character or nature, which the

                                                        E-4

<PAGE>



Custodian  may incur or with which the  Custodian may be threatened by reason of
its acting as custodian under this Agreement,  including  indemnification of the
Custodian against any and all expenses, including attorney's fees if counsel for
the Custodian  has been  approved by the Company,  and the cost of defending any
action,  suit  or  proceedings  or  resisting  any  claim.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  it is specifically  understood and agreed that in the event any such
claim,  liability,  loss,  action,  suit or proceeding or other expense,  fee or
charge shall have been caused by reason of any negligent act,  negligent failure
to act or  willful  misconduct  on the part of the  Custodian,  or  which  shall
constitute  a  willful  breach  of its  duties  hereunder,  the  indemnification
provisions of this Agreement shall not apply.

         Section  3.3  Custodian  May Own  Certificates.  The  Custodian  in its
individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates
with the same rights it would have if it were not Custodian.

         Section 3.4 Master Servicer to Pay Custodian's  Fees and Expenses.  The
Master Servicer  covenants and agrees to pay to the Custodian from time to time,
and the Custodian shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it in the exercise and  performance  of any of the powers and duties
hereunder of the  Custodian,  and the Master  Servicer will pay or reimburse the
Custodian  upon its  request  for all  reasonable  expenses,  disbursements  and
advances  incurred  or made  by the  Custodian  in  accordance  with  any of the
provisions of this  Agreement  (including the  reasonable  compensation  and the
expenses and  disbursements  of its counsel and of all persons not  regularly in
its employ), except any such expense,  disbursement or advance as may arise from
its negligence or bad faith.

         Section 3.5 Custodian  May Resign;  Trustee May Remove  Custodian.  The
Custodian may resign from the  obligations  and duties hereby imposed upon it as
such  obligations  and duties  relate to its acting as Custodian of the Mortgage
Loans. Upon receiving such notice of resignation,  the Trustee shall either take
custody of the  Mortgage  Files  itself and give  prompt  notice  thereof to the
Company, the Master Servicer and the Custodian,  or promptly appoint a successor
Custodian by written  instrument,  in  duplicate,  one copy of which  instrument
shall be  delivered to the  resigning  Custodian  and one copy to the  successor
Custodian. If the Trustee shall not have taken custody of the Mortgage Files and
no  successor   Custodian  shall  have  been  so  appointed  and  have  accepted
appointment  within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation,  the
resigning  Custodian  may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the
appointment of a successor Custodian.

         The Trustee may remove the  Custodian at any time.  In such event,  the
Trustee shall appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint,
a successor Custodian  hereunder.  Any successor Custodian shall be a depository
institution  subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority
and shall be able to satisfy the other requirements contained in Section 3.7 and
shall be unaffiliated with the Master Servicer or the Company.

         Any  resignation  or  removal of the  Custodian  and  appointment  of a
successor  Custodian pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 3.5 shall
become effective upon acceptance of

                                                        E-5

<PAGE>



appointment by the successor Custodian.  The Trustee shall give prompt notice to
the  Company  and  the  Master  Servicer  of the  appointment  of any  successor
Custodian.  No successor Custodian shall be appointed by the Trustee without the
prior approval of the Company and the Master Servicer.

         Section 3.6 Merger or Consolidation of Custodian. Any Person into which
the Custodian  may be merged or converted or with which it may be  consolidated,
or any Person  resulting from any merger,  conversion or  consolidation to which
the Custodian shall be a party, or any Person  succeeding to the business of the
Custodian,  shall be the  successor  of the  Custodian  hereunder,  without  the
execution  or filing of any paper or any  further  act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

         Section 3.7  Representations  of the  Custodian.  The Custodian  hereby
represents  that  it is a  depository  institution  subject  to  supervision  or
examination by a federal or state authority,  has a combined capital and surplus
of at least  $15,000,000 and is qualified to do business in the jurisdictions in
which it will hold any Mortgage File.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                            Miscellaneous Provisions

         Section 4.1 Notices.  All notices,  requests,  consents and demands and
other  communications  required  under this  Agreement  or pursuant to any other
instrument  or document  delivered  hereunder  shall be in writing  and,  unless
otherwise  specifically  provided,  may be delivered personally,  by telegram or
telex,  or by registered or certified  mail,  postage  prepaid,  return  receipt
requested,  at the  addresses  specified on the  signature  page hereof  (unless
changed by the particular party whose address is stated herein by similar notice
in writing), in which case the notice will be deemed delivered when received.

         Section 4.2  Amendments.  No modification or amendment of or supplement
to this Agreement shall be valid or effective  unless the same is in writing and
signed by all parties hereto,  and neither the Company,  the Master Servicer nor
the Trustee  shall enter into any  amendment  hereof  except as permitted by the
Pooling Agreement.  The Trustee shall give prompt notice to the Custodian of any
amendment or supplement to the Pooling  Agreement and furnish the Custodian with
written copies thereof.

         Section 4.3 GOVERNING  LAW. THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE DEEMED A CONTRACT
MADE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     Section 4.4 Recordation of Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, this Agreement is subject to recordation in all appropriate  public offices
for real property records in all

                                                        E-6

the  counties  or other  comparable  jurisdictions  in  which  any or all of the
properties  subject to the Mortgages are situated,  and in any other appropriate
public  recording  office or elsewhere,  such  recordation to be effected by the
Master Servicer and at its expense on direction by the Trustee  (pursuant to the
request  of  holders  of  Certificates  evidencing  undivided  interests  in the
aggregate  of not less than 25% of the  Trust  Fund),  but only  upon  direction
accompanied  by an  Opinion  of Counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Master
Servicer to the effect that the failure to effect such  recordation is likely to
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders.

         For the purpose of  facilitating  the  recordation of this Agreement as
herein  provided  and  for  other  purposes,  this  Agreement  may  be  executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts,  each of which  counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original,  and such counterparts shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.

         Section  4.5  Severability  of  Provisions.  If any  one or more of the
covenants,  agreements,  provisions or terms of this Agreement  shall be for any
reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants,  agreements,  provisions or
terms  shall be  deemed  severable  from the  remaining  covenants,  agreements,
provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability  of the other provisions of this Agreement or of the Certificates
or the rights of the holders thereof.

                    FORM OF TRANSFER AFFIDAVIT AND AGREEMENT

                           ) :ss.
COUNTY OF                  )

         [NAME OF OFFICER], being first duly sworn, deposes and says:

         1.  That he is  [Title  of  Officer]  of [Name  of  Owner]  (record  or
beneficial  owner of the Mortgage  Pass-Through  Certificates,  Series  _______,
Class  R[-__]  (the  "Owner")),  a  [savings  institution]   [corporation]  duly
organized and existing under the laws of [the State of ] [the United States], on
behalf of which he makes this affidavit and agreement.

         2.  That  the  Owner  (i)  is  not  and  will  not  be a  "disqualified
organization"  or an electing large  partnership as of [date of transfer] within
the  meaning of  Sections  860E(e)(5)  and 775,  respectively,  of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or an electing  large  partnership
under  Section  775(a) of the Code,  (ii) will  endeavor to remain  other than a
disqualified  organization  for so long as it retains its ownership  interest in
the  Class  R[-__]  Certificates,  and  (iii)  is  acquiring  the  Class  R[-__]
Certificates  for its own account or for the account of another Owner from which
it has received an affidavit  and  agreement in  substantially  the same form as
this affidavit and agreement.  (For this purpose, a "disqualified  organization"
means an electing  large  partnership  under Section 775 of the Code, the United
States,   any  state  or   political   subdivision   thereof,   any   agency  or
instrumentality  of any of the foregoing (other than an  instrumentality  all of
the activities of which are subject to tax and, except for the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation,  a majority of whose board of directors is not selected by
any  such  governmental   entity)  or  any  foreign  government,   international
organization  or any agency or  instrumentality  of such foreign  government  or
organization,  any rural electric or telephone cooperative,  or any organization
(other than certain farmers' cooperatives) that is generally exempt from federal
income tax unless such organization is subject to the tax on unrelated  business
taxable income).

         3.  That the  Owner is aware (i) of the tax that  would be  imposed  on
transfers of Class R[-__] Certificates to disqualified organizations or electing
large  partnerships,  under the Code,  that  applies to all  transfers  of Class
R[-__]  Certificates  after March 31,  1988;  (ii) that such tax would be on the
transferor  (or, with respect to transfers to electing  large  partnerships,  on
each such  partnership),  or, if such transfer is through an agent (which person
includes a broker, nominee or middleman) for a disqualified organization, on the
agent;  (iii) that the person  (other than with respect to transfers to electing
large partnerships)  otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability
for the tax if the  transferee  furnishes to such person an  affidavit  that the
transferee is not a disqualified organization and, at the time of transfer, such
person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false; and (iv) that
the Class R[-__] Certificates may be "noneconomic residual

interests" within the meaning of Treasury  regulations  promulgated  pursuant to
the Code and that the transferor of a noneconomic  residual interest will remain
liable for any taxes due with respect to the income on such  residual  interest,
unless no  significant  purpose of the transfer was to impede the  assessment or
collection of tax.

         4.  That  the  Owner is aware  of the tax  imposed  on a  "pass-through
entity" holding Class R[-__]  Certificates if either the pass-through  entity is
an electing  large  partnership  under Section 775 of the Code or if at any time
during the taxable year of the pass-through  entity a disqualified  organization
is the record holder of an interest in such entity.  (For this purpose,  a "pass
through  entity"  includes  a  regulated   investment  company,  a  real  estate
investment  trust or common  trust fund,  a  partnership,  trust or estate,  and
certain cooperatives.)

         5. The Owner is either (i) a citizen or resident of the United  States,
(ii) a  corporation,  partnership  or other entity treated as a corporation or a
partnership for U.S.  federal income tax purposes and created or organized in or
under the laws of the  United  States,  any state  thereof  or the  District  of
Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States person
under any applicable Treasury regulations), (iii) an estate that is described in
Section 7701(a)(30)(D) of the Code, or (iv) a trust that is described in Section
7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code.

         6. The Owner hereby agrees that it will not cause income from the Class
R[-__]  Certificates to be attributable to a foreign permanent  establishment or
fixed base (within the meaning of an applicable  income tax treaty) of the Owner
of another United States taxpayer.

         7. That the  Owner is aware  that the  Trustee  will not  register  the
transfer  of any  Class  R[- __]  Certificates  unless  the  transferee,  or the
transferee's  agent,  delivers to it an  affidavit  and  agreement,  among other
things,  in  substantially  the same form as this affidavit and  agreement.  The
Owner expressly agrees that it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows
or believes  that any of the  representations  contained in such  affidavit  and
agreement are false.

         8. That the Owner has reviewed the  restrictions  set forth on the face
of the Class R[-__]  Certificates  and the provisions of Section  5.02(f) of the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement under which the Class R[-__]  Certificates were
issued (in  particular,  clause  (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) of Section  5.02(f) which
authorize  the Trustee to deliver  payments to a person other than the Owner and
negotiate  a  mandatory  sale by the  Trustee in the event the Owner  holds such
Certificates in violation of Section 5.02(f)).  The Owner expressly agrees to be
bound by and to comply with such restrictions and provisions.

         9.  That  the  Owner  consents  to  any  additional   restrictions   or
arrangements that shall be deemed necessary upon advice of counsel to constitute
a reasonable  arrangement to ensure that the Class R[-__] Certificates will only
be  owned,  directly  or  indirectly,  by an  Owner  that is not a  disqualified
organization.

         10.   The Owner's Taxpayer Identification Number is ________________.

         11. This  affidavit  and  agreement  relates  only to the Class  R[-__]
Certificates  held by the Owner and not to any other  holder of the Class R[-__]
Certificates. The Owner understands that the liabilities described herein relate
only to the Class R[-__] Certificates.

         12. That no purpose of the Owner relating to the transfer of any of the
Class R[-__] Certificates by the Owner is or will be to impede the assessment or
collection of any tax; in making this  representation,  the Owner  warrants that
the Owner is familiar  with (i)  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.860E-1(c)  and
recent amendments thereto,  effective as of July 19, 2002, and (ii) the preamble
describing the adoption of the amendments to such regulation,  which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 1.

         13. That the Owner has no present knowledge or expectation that it will
be  unable  to pay  any  United  States  taxes  owed by it so long as any of the
Certificates remain outstanding.  In this regard, the Owner hereby represents to
and for the  benefit  of the  person  from whom it  acquired  the  Class  R[-__]
Certificate  that the Owner  intends to pay taxes  associated  with holding such
Class R[- __]  Certificate as they become due, fully  understanding  that it may
incur tax  liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the Class R[-__]
Certificate.

         14. That the Owner has no present knowledge or expectation that it will
become insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding for so long as any of the
Class R[-__] Certificates remain outstanding.

         15. (a) The Owner is not an employee benefit plan or other plan subject
to the  prohibited  transaction  provisions  of the Employee  Retirement  Income
Security  Act of 1974,  as amended  ("ERISA"),  or Section  4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or an investment  manager,  named
fiduciary or a trustee of any such plan, or any other Person acting, directly or
indirectly, on behalf of or purchasing any Certificate with "plan assets" of any
such plan; or

                  (b) The Owner has provided  the  Trustee,  the Company and the
Master  Servicer  with an  opinion  of  counsel  acceptable  to and in form  and
substance  satisfactory  to the Trustee,  the Company and the Master Servicer to
the effect that the purchase of  Certificates  is permissible  under  applicable
law, will not  constitute  or result in any  non-exempt  prohibited  transaction
under ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code and will not subject the  Trustee,  the
Company  or the  Master  Servicer  to any  obligation  or  liability  (including
obligations or liabilities  under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in addition
to those undertaken in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

         In addition,  the Owner hereby  certifies,  represents and warrants to,
and covenants  with, the Company,  the Trustee and the Master  Servicer that the
Purchaser  will not  transfer  such  Certificates  to any Plan or person  unless
either such Plan or person meets the requirements set forth in either (a) or (b)
above.

Background

   This document contains final regulations regarding the proposed amendments to
26 CFR part 1 under  section  860E of the  Internal  Revenue  Code  (Code).  The
regulations  provide the circumstances under which a transferor of a noneconomic
REMIC  residual   interest   meeting  the   investigation   and   representation
requirements may avail itself of the

                                                       H-1-7

safe harbor by satisfying either the formula test or the asset test.
   Final regulations governing REMICs, issued in 1992, contain rules
governing the transfer of noneconomic REMIC residual interests. In
general, a transfer of a noneconomic residual interest is disregarded
for all tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transfer is to

[[Page 47452]]

enable the  transferor to impede the  assessment or collection of tax. A purpose
to impede the assessment or collection of tax (a wrongful purpose) exists if the
transferor,  at the time of the transfer,  either knew or should have known that
the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the
REMIC's taxable income.
   Under a safe harbor, the transferor of a REMIC noneconomic  residual interest
is presumed not to have a wrongful  purpose if two  requirements  are satisfied:
(1) the  transferor  conducts a  reasonable  investigation  of the  transferee's
financial  condition  (the  investigation  requirement);  and (2) the transferor
secures a  representation  from the transferee to the effect that the transferee
understands the tax obligations  associated with holding a residual interest and
intends to pay those taxes (the representation requirement).
   The IRS and Treasury have been concerned that some transferors of noneconomic
residual  interests claim they satisfy the safe harbor even in situations  where
the economics of the transfer  clearly  indicate the  transferee is unwilling or
unable to pay the tax associated with holding the interest.  For this reason, on
February  7, 2000,  the IRS  published  in the Federal  Register  (65 FR 5807) a
notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-100276-97; REG-122450-98) designed to clarify
the safe harbor by adding the  "formula  test," an economic  test.  The proposed
regulation provides that the safe harbor is unavailable unless the present value
of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the residual interest
does not exceed the sum of: (1) The present value of any consideration  given to
the  transferee to acquire the  interest;  (2) the present value of the expected
future  distributions  on  the  interest;  and  (3)  the  present  value  of the
anticipated  tax  savings  associated  with  holding  the  interest as the REMIC
generates losses.
   The notice of proposed  rulemaking also contained  rules for FASITs.  Section
1.860H-6(g) of the proposed regulations  provides  requirements for transfers of
FASIT  ownership  interests  and adopts a safe harbor by  reference  to the safe
harbor provisions of the REMIC regulations.
   In January 2001, the IRS published Rev. Proc. 2001-12 (2001-3
I.R.B. 335) to set forth an alternative safe harbor that taxpayers

                                                       H-1-8

<PAGE>



could use while the IRS and the  Treasury  considered  comments on the  proposed
regulations.  Under the  alternative  safe  harbor,  if a  transferor  meets the
investigation  requirement and the  representation  requirement but the transfer
fails to meet the formula test, the transferor may invoke the safe harbor if the
transferee  meets a two- prong test (the asset  test).  A  transferee  generally
meets the first prong of this test if, at the time of the transfer,  and in each
of the two years preceding the year of transfer,  the transferee's  gross assets
exceed  $100  million  and its net  assets  exceed  $10  million.  A  transferee
generally  meets  the  second  prong of this test if it is a  domestic,  taxable
corporation  and agrees in writing  not to transfer  the  interest to any person
other  than  another  domestic,  taxable  corporation  that also  satisfies  the
requirements  of the asset test. A  transferor  cannot rely on the asset test if
the transferor knows, or has reason to know, that the transferee will not comply
with its written agreement to limit the restrictions on subsequent  transfers of
the residual interest.
   Rev. Proc.  2001-12 provides that the asset test fails to be satisfied in the
case of a transfer or assignment of a noneconomic residual interest to a foreign
branch of an otherwise  eligible  transferee.  If such a transfer or  assignment
were permitted,  a corporate taxpayer might seek to claim that the provisions of
an  applicable  income tax treaty  would  resource  excess  inclusion  income as
foreign  source  income,  and that,  as a  consequence,  any U.S. tax  liability
attributable  to the excess  inclusion  income  could be offset by  foreign  tax
credits.  Such a claim would impede the  assessment or collection of U.S. tax on
excess inclusion income,  contrary to the congressional purpose of assuring that
such income will be taxable in all events. See, e.g., sections 860E(a)(1),  (b),
(e) and 860G(b) of the Code.
   The Treasury and the IRS have  learned  that certain  taxpayers  transferring
noneconomic residual interests to foreign branches have attempted to rely on the
formula  test to obtain  safe  harbor  treatment  in an  effort  to  impede  the
assessment or collection of U.S. tax on excess  inclusion  income.  Accordingly,
the  final  regulations  provide  that if a  noneconomic  residual  interest  is
transferred  to a  foreign  permanent  establishment  or  fixed  base  of a U.S.
taxpayer,  the transfer is not eligible for safe harbor  treatment  under either
the asset  test or the  formula  test.  The  final  regulations  also  require a
transferee  to  represent  that it will not cause  income  from the  noneconomic
residual  interest to be attributable to a foreign  permanent  establishment  or
fixed base.
   Section 1.860E -1(c)(8) provides  computational rules that a taxpayer may use
to qualify for safe harbor status under the formula test.

                                                       H-1-9

<PAGE>



Section 1.860E-1(c)(8)(i) provides that the transferee is presumed to pay tax at
a rate  equal to the  highest  rate of tax  specified  in  section  11(b).  Some
commentators  were  concerned  that this  presumed rate of taxation was too high
because it does not take into consideration taxpayers subject to the alternative
minimum tax rate.  In light of the comments  received,  this  provision has been
amended in the final regulations to allow certain transferees that compute their
taxable  income using the  alternative  minimum tax rate to use the  alternative
minimum tax rate applicable to corporations.
   Additionally, Sec. 1.860E-1(c)(8)(iii) provides that the present

values in the formula test are to be computed using a discount rate equal to the
applicable  Federal  short-term  rate prescribed by section  1274(d).  This is a
change  from  the  proposed   regulation  and  Rev.  Proc.   2001-12.  In  those
publications  the  provision  stated that "present  values are computed  using a
discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate prescribed in section 1274(d)
compounded  semiannually"  and that "[a] lower  discount rate may be used if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly borrows, in the course of its trade
or  business,  substantial  funds at such  lower  rate from an  unrelated  third
party." The IRS and the Treasury  Department  have learned  that,  based on this
provision,  certain taxpayers have been attempting to use unrealistically low or
zero interest rates to satisfy the formula test,  frustrating  the intent of the
test.  Furthermore,  the  Treasury  Department  and the IRS believe  that a rule
allowing  for a rate  other than a rate based on an  objective  index  would add
unnecessary complexity to the safe harbor. As a result, the rule in the proposed
regulations  that  permits a transferee  to use a lower  discount  rate,  if the
transferee can demonstrate that it regularly  borrows  substantial funds at such
lower rate, is not included in the final regulations; and the Federal short-term
rate  has  been  substituted  for  the  applicable  Federal  rate.  To  simplify
taxpayers' computations, the final regulations allow use of any of the published
short-term  rates,  provided  that  the  present  values  are  computed  with  a
corresponding  period  of  compounding.  With the  exception  of the  provisions
relating to transfers to foreign  branches,  these  changes  generally  have the
proposed  applicability  date of February 4, 2000,  but  taxpayers may choose to
apply the interest  rate formula set forth in the proposed  regulation  and Rev.
Proc. 2001-12 for transfers occurring before August 19, 2002.
   It is anticipated that when final regulations are adopted with
respect to


                                                      H-1-10

[[Page 47453]]

FASITs,  Sec.  1.860H-6(g)  of the  proposed  regulations  will  be  adopted  in
substantially  its  present  form,  with the result  that the final  regulations
contained  in this  document  will  also  govern  transfers  of FASIT  ownership
interests with substantially the same applicability date as is contained in this
document.

Effect on Other Documents

   Rev. Proc. 2001-12 (2001-3 I.R.B. 335) is obsolete for transfers of
noneconomic residual interests in REMICs occurring on or after August
19, 2002.

Special Analyses

   It is hereby  certified  that these  regulations  will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is
based  on the  fact  that it is  unlikely  that a  substantial  number  of small
entities will hold REMIC residual interests. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis  under  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter  6) is not
required.  It  has  been  determined  that  this  Treasury  decision  is  not  a
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.  Therefore, a
regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that sections
553(b) and 553(d) of the  Administrative  Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.  chapter 5) do
not apply to these regulations.

Drafting Information

   The principal author of these  regulations is Courtney  Shepardson.  However,
other  personnel  from the IRS and  Treasury  Department  participated  in their
development.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         This letter is  delivered  to you in  connection  with the  transfer by
________________ (the "Seller") to _______________________  (the "Purchaser") of
$ ___________  Initial  Certificate  Principal Balance of Mortgage  Asset-Backed
Pass-Through  Certificates,  Series 2002-RM1, Class R-I, Class R-II, Class R-III
and Class R-IV (the "Class R  Certificates"),  pursuant  to Section  5.02 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing  Agreement"),  dated
as of December 1, 2002,  among  Residential  Asset Mortgage  Products,  Inc., as
depositor (the "Depositor"), Residential Funding Corporation, as master servicer
and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee").  All terms
used herein and not  otherwise  defined shall have the meanings set forth in the
Pooling and Servicing  Agreement.  The Seller hereby  certifies,  represents and
warrants to, and covenants with, the Depositor and the Trustee that:

1.   No purpose of the Seller relating to the transfer of the Certificate by the
     Seller  to  the  Purchaser  is or  will  be to  impede  the  assessment  or
     collection of any tax.

2.   The Seller  understands that the Purchaser has delivered to the Trustee and
     the Master Servicer a transfer affidavit and agreement in the form attached
     to the Pooling and Servicing  Agreement as Exhibit H-1. The Seller does not
     know or believe that any representation contained therein is false.

3.   The  Seller  has at  the  time  of  the  transfer  conducted  a  reasonable
     investigation  of the financial  condition of the Purchaser as contemplated
     by Treasury Regulations Section 1.860E- 1(c)(4)(i) and, as a result of that
     investigation, the Seller has determined that the Purchaser

         has  historically  paid its debts as they  become  due and has found no
         significant  evidence to indicate that the Purchaser  will not continue
         to  pay  its  debts  as  they  become  due in the  future.  The  Seller
         understands  that  the  transfer  of a Class R  Certificate  may not be
         respected  for United  States  income tax purposes  (and the Seller may
         continue  to be  liable  for  United  States  income  taxes  associated
         therewith) unless the Seller has conducted such an investigation.

4.   The Seller has no actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not both
     a United States Person and a Permitted Transferee.

         the Pooling and Servicing Agreement contains restrictions regarding the
         transfer  of the  Certificates  and (e) the  Certificates  will  bear a
         legend to the foregoing effect.

2.       The  Purchaser is acquiring  the  Certificates  for its own account for
         investment  only and not with a view to or for sale in connection  with

3.       The  Purchaser  is  (a) a  substantial,  sophisticated  [institutional]
         investor having such knowledge and experience in financial and business
         matters,  and, in  particular,  in such matters  related to  securities
         similar to the Certificates,  such that it is capable of evaluating the
         merits and risks of  investment in the  Certificates,  (b) able to bear
         the  economic  risks  of such  an  investment  and  (c) an  "accredited
         investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the
         Act.

4.   The Purchaser has been furnished with, and has had an opportunity to review
     (a) [a copy of the Private Placement  Memorandum,  dated  ________________,
     ____, relating to the Certificates (b)] a copy of the Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement and [b] [c] such other  information  concerning the Certificates,
     the Mortgage Loans and the Depositor as has been requested by the Purchaser
     from  the  Depositor  or the  Seller  and is  relevant  to the  Purchaser's
     decision to purchase the Certificates.  The Purchaser has had any questions
     arising  from such review  answered by the  Depositor  or the Seller to the
     satisfaction  of the  Purchaser.  [If the  Purchaser  did not  purchase the
     Certificates from the Seller in connection with the initial distribution of
     the  Certificates  and was  provided  with a copy of the Private  Placement
     Memorandum (the "Memorandum")  relating to the original sale (the "Original
     Sale") of the  Certificates  by the Depositor,  the Purchaser  acknowledges
     that such Memorandum was provided to it by the Seller,  that the Memorandum
     was  prepared  by the  Depositor  solely  for use in  connection  with  the
     Original Sale and the Depositor did not participate in or facilitate in any
     way the purchase of the Certificates by the Purchaser from the Seller,  and
     the Purchaser  agrees that it will look solely to the Seller and not to the
     Depositor with respect to any damage,  liability,  claim or expense arising
     out of,  resulting  from or in  connection  with (a) error or omission,  or
     alleged  error  or  omission,  contained  in the  Memorandum,  or  (b)  any
     information,   development   or  event   arising  after  the  date  of  the
     Memorandum.]

5.   The  Purchaser  has not and  will  not  nor  has it  authorized  or will it
     authorize any person to (a) offer,  pledge,  sell,  dispose of or otherwise
     transfer  any  Certificate,  any interest in any  Certificate  or any other
     similar security to any person in any manner,  (b) solicit any offer to buy
     or to accept a pledge,  disposition of other  transfer of any  Certificate,
     any interest in any  Certificate  or any other  similar  security  from any
     person in any manner,  (c) otherwise  approach or negotiate with respect to
     any  Certificate,  any  interest in any  Certificate  or any other  similar
     security with any person in any manner,  (d) make any general  solicitation
     by means of  general  advertising  or in any  other  manner or (e) take any
     other action,  that (as to any of (a) through (e) above) would constitute a
     distribution  of any  Certificate  under the Act,  that  would  render  the
     disposition  of any  Certificate a violation of Section 5 of the Act or any
     state  securities law, or that would require  registration or qualification
     pursuant thereto.  The Purchaser will not sell or otherwise transfer any of
     the  Certificates,  except in compliance with the provisions of the Pooling
     and Servicing Agreement.

                                                     Very truly yours,

                   TEXT OF AMENDMENT TO POOLING AND SERVICING
                  AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 11.01(E) FOR A
                                LIMITED GUARANTY


ARTICLE XII

Subordinate Certificate Loss Coverage; Limited Guaranty

         Section 12.01. Subordinate Certificate Loss Coverage; Limited Guaranty.
(a) Subject to subsection  (c) below,  prior to the later of the third  Business
Day prior to each  Distribution  Date or the  related  Determination  Date,  the
Master Servicer shall determine  whether it or any Subservicer  will be entitled
to any  reimbursement  pursuant to Section 4.02(c) on such Distribution Date for
Advances or Subservicer Advances previously made, (which will not be Advances or
Subservicer  Advances  that were made with respect to  delinquencies  which were
subsequently determined to be Excess Special Hazard Losses, Excess Fraud Losses,
Excess  Bankruptcy  Losses or  Extraordinary  Losses)  and,  if so,  the  Master
Servicer shall demand payment from Residential Funding of an amount equal to the
amount of any Advances or Subservicer  Advances  reimbursed  pursuant to Section
4.02(c),  to the extent such  Advances  or  Subservicer  Advances  have not been
included in the amount of the Realized Loss in the related  Mortgage  Loan,  and
shall distribute the same to the Class R  Certificateholders  in the same manner
as if such amount were to be distributed pursuant to Section 4.02(c).

         (b) Subject to  subsection  (c) below,  prior to the later of the third
Business Day prior to each Distribution Date or the related  Determination Date,
the Master  Servicer  shall  determine  whether any Realized  Losses (other than
Excess Special Hazard Losses,  Excess Bankruptcy Losses, Excess Fraud Losses and
Extraordinary  Losses)  will be allocated  to the Class R  Certificates  on such
Distribution  Date  pursuant to Section  4.05,  and, if so, the Master  Servicer
shall demand  payment from  Residential  Funding of the amount of such  Realized
Loss and shall distribute the same to the Class R Certificateholders in the same
manner as if such amount  were to be  distributed  pursuant to Section  4.02(c);
provided, however, that the amount of such demand in respect of any Distribution
Date shall in no event be greater than the sum of (i) the  additional  amount of
Accrued  Certificate  Interest  that  would  have  been  paid  for  the  Class R
Certificateholders  on such  Distribution  Date had such Realized Loss or Losses
not occurred plus (ii) the amount of the reduction in the Certificate  Principal
Balances  of the  Class R  Certificates  on such  Distribution  Date due to such
Realized  Loss or Losses.  Notwithstanding  such payment,  such Realized  Losses
shall be deemed to have been borne by the  Certificateholders  for  purposes  of
Section  4.05.  Excess  Special  Hazard  Losses,  Excess  Fraud  Losses,  Excess
Bankruptcy Losses and Extraordinary Losses allocated to the Class R Certificates
will not be covered by the Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation.

     (c) Demands for payments  pursuant to this  Section  shall be made prior to

Business Day prior to each Distribution Date or the related  Determination  Date
by the Master  Servicer with written notice thereof to the Trustee.  The maximum
amount  that  Residential  Funding  shall be  required  to pay  pursuant to this
Section on any Distribution Date (the "Amount  Available") shall be equal to the
lesser of (X) __________  minus the sum of (i) all previous  payments made under
subsections  (a) and (b) hereof and (ii) all draws  under the  Limited  Guaranty
made in lieu of such payments as described  below in subsection  (d) and (Y) the
then outstanding Certificate Principal Balances of the Class R Certificates,  or
such lower amount as may be established  pursuant to Section 12.02.  Residential
Funding's obligations as described in this Section are referred to herein as the
"Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation."

         (d)  The  Trustee  will  promptly  notify  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation of any failure of Residential Funding to make any payments hereunder
and  shall  demand  payment  pursuant  to the  limited  guaranty  (the  "Limited
Guaranty"),  executed by General Motors Acceptance  Corporation,  of Residential
Funding's  obligation  to make payments  pursuant to this Section,  in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the Amount Available and (ii) such required payments,
by  delivering to General  Motors  Acceptance  Corporation a written  demand for
payment by wire  transfer,  not later than the second  Business Day prior to the
Distribution Date for such month, with a copy to the Master Servicer.

         (e) All payments made by Residential  Funding  pursuant to this Section
or amounts paid under the Limited  Guaranty  shall be deposited  directly in the
Certificate Account, for distribution on the Distribution Date for such month to
the Class R Certificateholders.

         (f) The Depositor  shall have the option,  in its sole  discretion,  to
substitute  for  either  or  both of the  Limited  Guaranty  or the  Subordinate
Certificate  Loss  Obligation  another  instrument  in the  form of a  corporate
guaranty,  an irrevocable  letter of credit, a surety bond,  insurance policy or
similar instrument or a reserve fund; provided that (i) the Depositor obtains an
Opinion of Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent  counsel) to the
effect that obtaining such substitute corporate guaranty,  irrevocable letter of
credit, surety bond, insurance policy or similar instrument or reserve fund will
not cause either (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund,  including
without limitation,  any federal tax imposed on "prohibited  transactions" under
Section  860(F)(a)(1) of the Code or on  "contributions  after the startup date"
under Section  860(G)(d)(1) of the Code or (b) the Trust Fund to fail to qualify
as a REMIC at any time that any  Certificate  is  outstanding,  and (ii) no such
substitution  shall  be made  unless  (A) the  substitute  Limited  Guaranty  or
Subordinate  Certificate  Loss Obligation is for an initial amount not less than
the then  current  Amount  Available  and  contains  provisions  that are in all
material  respects  equivalent to the original  Limited  Guaranty or Subordinate
Certificate   Loss   Obligation   (including   that  no  portion  of  the  fees,
reimbursements  or other  obligations under any such instrument will be borne by
the Trust  Fund),  (B) the long  term debt  obligations  of any  obligor  of any
substitute  Limited Guaranty or Subordinate  Certificate Loss Obligation (if not
supported by the Limited Guaranty) shall be rated at least the lesser of (a) the
rating  of  the  long  term  debt  obligations  of  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation  as of the date of  issuance  of the  Limited  Guaranty  and (b) the
rating  of  the  long  term  debt  obligations  of  General  Motors   Acceptance
Corporation  at the  date of such  substitution  and (C) the  Depositor  obtains
written

confirmation from each nationally recognized credit rating agency that rated the
Class R  Certificates  at the request of the  Depositor  that such  substitution
shall not lower the rating on the Class R  Certificates  below the lesser of (a)
the  then-current  rating  assigned to the Class R  Certificates  by such rating
agency and (b) the original  rating assigned to the Class R Certificates by such
rating  agency.   Any  replacement  of  the  Limited   Guaranty  or  Subordinate
Certificate  Loss Obligation  pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by a
written Opinion of Counsel to the substitute guarantor or obligor,  addressed to
the Master Servicer and the Trustee, that such substitute instrument constitutes
a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the substitute  guarantor or obligor,
enforceable in accordance  with its terms,  and concerning such other matters as
the Master  Servicer  and the  Trustee  shall  reasonably  request.  Neither the
Depositor,  the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall be obligated to substitute
for or replace the Limited  Guaranty or Subordinate  Certificate Loss Obligation
under any  circumstance.  Section  12.02.  Amendments  Relating  to the  Limited
Guaranty.  Notwithstanding  Sections 11.01 or 12.01:  (i) the provisions of this
Article XII may be amended,  superseded or deleted, (ii) the Limited Guaranty or
Subordinate Certificate Loss Obligation may be amended, reduced or canceled, and
(iii) any other  provision of this  Agreement  which is related or incidental to
the matters  described in this Article XI may be amended in any manner;  in each
case by  written  instrument  executed  or  consented  to by the  Depositor  and
Residential Funding but without the consent of any Certificateholder and without
the consent of the Master Servicer or the Trustee being required unless any such
amendment  would impose any  additional  obligation  on, or otherwise  adversely
affect the  interests  of, the Master  Servicer or the Trustee,  as  applicable;
provided  that the  Depositor  shall also obtain a letter  from each  nationally
recognized  credit  rating  agency  that rated the Class R  Certificates  at the
request of the Depositor to the effect that such amendment,  reduction, deletion
or cancellation will not lower the rating on the Class R Certificates  below the
lesser of (a) the  then-current  rating  assigned to the Class R Certificates by
such  rating  agency  and  (b)  the  original  rating  assigned  to the  Class R
Certificates by such rating agency, unless (A) the Holder of 100% of the Class R
Certificates is Residential  Funding or an Affiliate of Residential  Funding, or
(B) such  amendment,  reduction,  deletion or cancellation is made in accordance
with Section 11.01(e) and, provided further that the Depositor  obtains,  in the
case of a material amendment or supersession (but not a reduction,  cancellation
or  deletion  of the  Limited  Guaranty  or  the  Subordinate  Certificate  Loss
Obligation),  an Opinion of Counsel (which need not be an opinion of Independent
counsel) to the effect that any such  amendment or  supersession  will not cause
either (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust  Fund,  including  without
limitation,  any federal tax imposed on "prohibited  transactions" under Section
860F(a)(1)  of the Code or on  "contributions  after  the  startup  date"  under
Section  860G(d)(1)  of the Code or (b) the Trust  Fund to fail to  qualify as a
REMIC  at any time  that  any  Certificate  is  outstanding.  A copy of any such
instrument  shall be provided to the  Trustee and the Master  Servicer  together
with an Opinion of Counsel that such amendment complies with this Section 12.02.

         obligations  of GMAC under this  Limited  Guaranty  shall  continue and
