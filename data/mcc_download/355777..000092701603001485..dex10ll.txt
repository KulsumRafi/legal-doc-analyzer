2.      Amendments to Loan Agreement. As of the Effective Date, the Loan
Agreement is modified in the following respects:

        A.      Restatement of Borrowers.

                (i)     Each Additional Borrower shall, for all purposes, become
                        a Borrower under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
                        Documents and all references to the Borrowers in the
                        Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
                        deemed to include a reference to the Additional
                        Borrowers. Each Additional Borrower agrees to be bound
                        by the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement and
                        the other Loan Documents as if it were originally a
                        Borrower thereunder.

                (ii)    The Former Borrowers shall, for all purposes, cease to
                        be distinct Borrowers under the Loan Agreement and the
                        other Loan Documents and all references to the Former
                        Borrowers therein shall mean and be a reference to
                        LoJack in its capacity as successor in interest thereto.
                        The purpose of the forgoing is to reflect that, pursuant
                        to the mergers described in the recitals to this
                        Agreement, the Former Borrowers have ceased to exist as
                        distinct entities and all rights, powers and privileges,
                        and all debts, duties, restrictions, liabilities and
                        obligations, of such Former Borrowers under the Loan
                        Documents or otherwise have succeeded to LoJack as
                        direct or indirect successor in interest thereto.

                (iii)   The Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
                        amended wherever necessary or appropriate to reflect the
                        modifications set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

        B.      Section 4.4. Section 4.4 of the Loan Agreement is amended by
                inserting the parenthetical "(other than Indebtedness to the
                Lender)" immediately after the first occurrence of the word
                "Indebtedness" therein.

        C.      Section 4.17. Section 4.17 of the Loan Agreement is amended by
                deleting clause (a) thereof in its entirety and substituting
                therefor the following:

                        "(a) any such payments or distributions made by a
                        Borrower to the Lead Borrower or to another Borrower
                        which is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
                        the Lead Borrower,".

3.      Consent and Waiver. The Lender consents to the liquidation, dissolution
and mergers described in the recitals to this Agreement and to any Investments
by LoJack in the Additional Borrowers and waives any Default which would
otherwise arise under the Loan Agreement solely as a result thereof.

4.      Original Note. The Lender agrees that upon the Effective Date or, if
later, upon the satisfaction of the conditions for the effectiveness of this
Agreement set forth in Section 1 hereof, it shall return to LoJack the original
Revolving Credit Note by LoJack, LoJack International, the Former Borrowers and
Vehicle Recovery Systems Company to the order of the Lender, dated June 21,
2002, in the principal amount of $10,000,000.

5.      Representations. LoJack represents and warrants to the Lender that it is
the successor in interest to each of the Former Borrowers and, upon giving
effect to the modifications to the Loan Agreement set forth in Section 2 hereof
and the waivers and consents of the Lender set forth in Section 3 hereof:

        A.      no Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date
                hereof; and

<PAGE>

        B.      the representations and warranties contained in Article 4 of the
                Loan Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on
                and as of the date hereof (except to the extent that such
                representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
                date).

6.      General. The foregoing amendments to the Loan Agreement and the consent
and waiver granted herein are limited as provided herein and do not extend to
any other provisions of the Loan Agreement not specified herein, or to any other
matter. The Loan Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect as
amended hereby, is hereby ratified and confirmed. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures hereto
were upon the same instrument.
