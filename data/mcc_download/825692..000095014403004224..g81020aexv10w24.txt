         thereof pursuant to Section 2.03 or any amendment thereof pursuant to
         Section 9.02.

                  "LC Commitment Amount" shall mean that portion of the
         Commitment Amount that may be used by the Borrower for the issuance of

         to (but not on or after) March 28, 2003, Loans in an aggregate
         principal amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the Commitment
         Amount. Any amounts repaid with respect to the Loans may not be
         reborrowed by Borrower at any time on or after March 28, 2003, and the

(WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF).

         10.      This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts,
