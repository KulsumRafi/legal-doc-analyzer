service mark registrations, copyright registrations, mask work registrations and
domain name registrations comprising the Intellectual Property are in full force

inventions,  technology or software have been developed or created independently

other than pursuant to such employee's regular, salaried responsibilities to the
Company,  and for which the Company  has,  directly  or  indirectly,  paid,  the
Company has a written  agreement with such person with respect thereto,  and the
Company  thereby has obtained  ownership of, and is the exclusive  owner of, all
Intellectual  Property  therein  or  thereto  by  operation  of law or by  valid
assignment.  In each case in which the Company  has  acquired  any  Intellectual
Property  from any  person,  the Company  has  obtained a valid and  enforceable
assignment  sufficient to irrevocably  transfer all rights in such  Intellectual
Property  (including  the right to seek past and  future  damages  with  respect
thereto) to the  Company  and, to the  maximum  extent  provided  for by, and in
accordance with, any applicable laws and  regulations,  the Company has recorded
each such assignment with the relevant governmental  authorities,  including the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their respective
equivalents in any relevant foreign jurisdiction.

required to protect the Company's rights in material trade secrets,  know-how or
other confidential or proprietary  information  (including,  without limitation,
computer software source code) of the Company or provided by any other person to
the Company.  Without limiting the foregoing,  the Company has, and enforces,  a
policy requiring each employee, consultant and contractor to execute proprietary
information,  confidentiality  and assignment  agreements  substantially  in the

contractors of the Company have executed such an agreement in substantially  the
Company's  standard form. To the knowledge of the Company,  none of the material
trade secrets,  know-how or other confidential or proprietary information of the
Company has been  disclosed to any person unless such  disclosure was necessary,
and was made pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement.

reliance  upon such  Investor's  representation  to the Company  that the Shares
purchased  by it are being  acquired  for  investment  for such  Investor's  own
account,  not as a  nominee  or  agent,  and not  with a view to the  resale  or
distribution  of any part thereof in a manner that would violate the  Securities
Act.

     3.3. Disclosure of Information.
          --------------------------
     The Investor represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and

risks of the investment in the securities.

     3.5. Accredited Investor.

     ---------------------------
     The  Investor   understands  that  the  Shares  it  is  acquiring  will  be

involving a public offering and that under applicable regulations, may be resold
without   registration   under  the  Securities  Act  only  in  certain  limited
circumstances.  In this connection,  the Investor represents that it is familiar

Act  covering  such  proposed  disposition  and  such  disposition  is  made  in

disposition and (ii) if reasonably requested by the Company, such Investor shall
have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel that such disposition will
not require registration of such shares under the Securities Act.

     3.8. Legends.
          --------
     It is understood that the certificates  representing the Shares will bear a
restrictive legend substantially in the following form:

     THE  SECURITIES  REPRESENTED  HEREBY  HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED  UNDER  THE
     SECURITIES  ACT  OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,   OR  ANY  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS

     TRANSFERRED,  PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE
     ACTS OR UNLESS AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IS DELIVERED TO THE CORPORATION TO THE

                        Form of Investor Rights Agreement




                            INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     This Investor Rights Agreement (this  "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of January 15, 2003 by and between Nestor,  Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company") and Silver Star Partners I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the "Investor").

                                   Background
                                   ----------

     The  Investor and the Company are parties to that  certain  Stock  Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement"). As part of the
investment to be made by the Investor  pursuant to the Purchase  Agreement,  the
Investor will have certain registration rights with respect to the Common Stock,

     All terms  used  herein and not  defined  herein  shall  have the  meanings

                                      Terms
                                      -----

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1. Registration Rights.
        --------------------

     1.1. Definitions.
          ------------
     (a) "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

     (b)  "Holder"  means the  Investor,  as the owner of record of  Registrable
Securities  that  have not  been  sold to the  public  or  pursuant  to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act.

     (c) "register,"  "registered"  and  "registration"  refer to a registration
effected by preparing and filing a registration statement in compliance with the
Securities  Act,  and the  declaration  or  ordering  of  effectiveness  of such
registration statement.

     (d) "Registrable  Securities" means (a) all shares of Common Stock that are
now owned or may be  hereafter  acquired by the  Investor  and (b) any shares of
Common  Stock issued as a dividend or other  distribution  with respect to or in
exchange  for or in  replacement  of such shares of Common  Stock  described  in
clause (a) of this definition, excluding in each case any Registrable Securities
sold (i) pursuant to Registration under the Securities Act or (ii) sold pursuant
to Rule 144 (or its successor  rule)  promulgated  under the  Securities Act and
excluding  any shares of Common Stock or preferred  stock of the Company  (other
than shares of Common Stock acquired  pursuant to the Purchase  Agreement) which
is registered under the Securities Act.

                                       1
<PAGE>

     (e)  "Registration  Expenses" means all expenses incurred by the Company in
complying with Sections 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 hereof, including,  without limitation,
all registration and filing fees,  printing expenses,  fees and disbursements of
counsel and accountants  for the Company,  and the expense of any special audits
incident to or required by any such registration (but excluding the compensation
of regular  employees  of the  Company,  which shall be paid in any event by the
Company),  but excluding  all  underwriting  discounts  and selling  commissions
applicable to the sale of Registrable Securities.

     (f) "Securities Act" means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

     1.2. Demand Registration.
          --------------------
     At any time after the date hereof,  the Holder may require that the Company
file a  registration  statement  with  regard to  Registrable  Securities  which
represent  more than fifty  percent  (50%) of the  then-outstanding  Registrable
Securities held by such Holder. If the Company shall receive from the Holder, at
any time,  a written  request  that the  Company  effect any  registration  with
respect to all or a part of the  Registrable  Securities,  the Company  will, as
soon as  practicable,  use its best efforts to effect such  registration  of the
sale of the Registrable Securities requested by the Holder;  provided,  however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to effect, or take any action to effect,
any such  registration  pursuant  to this  Section  1.2  after the  Company  has
effected  one (1)  such  registration  pursuant  to this  Section  1.2 and  such
registration  has been  declared  or  ordered  effective  and the  sales of such
Registrable Securities shall have been withdrawn or closed.

     If at any time of any request to register  Registrable  Securities pursuant
to Section 1.2 of this  Agreement,  the Company is engaged in any activity that,
in the good faith  determination  of the Board of Directors  of the Company,  is
material and nonpublic  and would be required to be disclosed in the  applicable
registration statement and such disclosure would be to the material detriment of
the  Company,  then the  Company  may  direct  that  such  request  to  register
Registrable  Securities  be delayed  for a period of not in excess of sixty (60)
days from the date of such request; provided, however, that the right to delay a
request may not be  exercised  by the Company more than once in any twelve month
period with respect to Registrable Securities.

     1.3. Shelf Registrations.
          --------------------
     At the option of the Holder, a request to register  Registrable  Securities
pursuant  to  Section  1.2  may  be  effected  through  an  appropriate  "shelf"
registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 (or any successor thereto) under the
Securities Act (a "Shelf Registration Statement"), and the Company shall use its
best  efforts  to keep such Shelf  Registration  Statement  effective  for sales
thereunder for as long as practicable.  The other registration  rights set forth
in Section 1.4 hereof shall be suspended  for so long as the Shelf  Registration
Statement remains effective and usable for the resale of Registrable Securities.

     1.4. Piggyback Registrations.
          ------------------------
     The Company shall notify the Holder of Registrable Securities in writing at
least  thirty  (30) days prior to filing any  registration  statement  under the
Securities Act for purposes of effecting a public  offering of securities of the
Company (other than a registration  relating solely to the sale of securities to
participants in a Company stock plan) whether for its own account or the account

                                       2
<PAGE>

of other  stockholders  or both and will afford such  Holder an  opportunity  to
include  in such  registration  statement  all or any  part  of the  Registrable
Securities  then held by such  Holder.  If the Holder  desires to include in any
such registration  statement all or any part of the Registrable  Securities held
by  such  Holder  it  shall,  within  twenty  (20)  days  after  receipt  of the
above-described  notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing,  and
in such notice shall inform the Company of the number of Registrable  Securities
such  Holder  wishes to include in such  registration  statement.  If the Holder
decides not to include all of its  Registrable  Securities  in any  registration
statement  thereafter filed by the Company,  such Holder shall forfeit its right
to include  any  remaining  Registrable  Securities  held by such  Holder in any
subsequent  registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by
the Company with respect to offerings of its securities.

     1.5. Expenses of Registration.
          -------------------------
     All Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a demand registration
(pursuant  to Section  1.2),  a Shelf  Registration  and all  issuances  off the
"shelf"  (pursuant to Section 1.3),  and a piggyback  registration  (pursuant to
Section 1.4) shall be borne by the Company.

     1.6. Obligations of the Company.
          ---------------------------
     Whenever required to effect the registration of any Registrable  Securities
under  Sections  1.2,  1.3, and 1.4 of this  Agreement,  the Company  shall,  as
expeditiously as reasonably possible:

     (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration  statement with respect to
such Registrable  Securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective,  and keep such registration  statement  effective
until the distribution is completed,  but, in the case of registrations pursuant
to Sections  1.2 and 1.4,  not more than 180 days,  provided  that such  180-day
period  shall be  extended  for a period of time  equal to the period the Holder
refrains from selling any Registrable  Securities  included in such registration
statement due to circumstances described in Section 1.6(f);

     (b) prepare and file with the SEC such  amendments and  supplements to such
registration   statement  and  the  prospectus  used  in  connection  with  such
registration  statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
registration statement;

     (c) furnish to the Holder such number of copies of a prospectus,  including
a preliminary prospectus,  in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, and all amendments and  supplements  thereto,  and such other  documents as
they may  reasonably  request  in order to  facilitate  the  disposition  of the
Registrable Securities owned by them that are included in such registration;

     (d) use its best  efforts to effect the sale of the  securities  covered by
such  registration  statement in any  jurisdictions  where such  securities  are
exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act;

     (e) in the  event  of any  underwritten  public  offering,  enter  into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting  agreement, in usual and customary
form, with the managing  underwriter(s)  of such offering and cause its officers
and  other  employees  to  participate  in any  "road  shows",  as the  managing
underwriters may reasonably request;

                                       3
<PAGE>

     (f)  notify  the  Holder  of   Registrable   Securities   covered  by  such
registration  statement  (and each  underwriter  in the case of an  underwritten
offering)  at any time when a  prospectus  relating  thereto is  required  to be
delivered under the Securities Act if such  registration  statement,  as then in
effect,  includes  an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not  misleading  in the light of the  circumstances  then  existing and,
following  such  notification,  promptly  deliver  to the  Holder  and each such
underwriter  that number of copies of all amendments or supplements  referred to
in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this Section 1.6 as may be necessary so that,  as
thereafter  delivered to the  purchaser  of such  Registrable  Securities,  such
prospectus  shall not include an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements  therein  not  misleading  in the  light  of the  circumstances  then
existing;

     (g)  furnish,  at  the  request  of  the  Holder  registering   Registrable
Securities,  on the date that such  Registrable  Securities are delivered to the
underwriters  for sale, if such securities are being sold through  underwriters,
or on the date  that  the  registration  statement  becomes  effective,  if such
securities are not being sold through underwriters,  (i) an opinion, dated as of
such date,  of the counsel  representing  the  Company for the  purposes of such
registration,  in form and substance as is customarily  given to underwriters in
an underwritten  public offering  addressed to the underwriters,  if any, and if
there are no underwriters,  to the Holder requesting registration of Registrable
Securities  and  (ii) a  "comfort"  letter  dated  as of  such  date,  from  the
independent  certified public accountants of the Company,  in form and substance
as  is  customarily  given  by  independent   certified  public  accountants  to
underwriters in an underwritten  public offering and reasonably  satisfactory to
the Holder requesting registration,  addressed to the underwriters,  if any, and
if  there  are  no  underwriters,  to  the  Holder  requesting  registration  of
Registrable Securities;

     (h) use its best efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration  statement  with any securities  exchange or interdealer  quotation
system on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted; and

     (i) make available for inspection by the seller of Registrable  Securities,
any underwriter  participating in any distribution pursuant to such registration
statement,  and any attorney,  accountant or other agent retained by such seller
or underwriter,  all financial and other records,  pertinent corporate documents
and properties of the Company,  and cause the Company's officers,  directors and
employees  to supply all  information  reasonably  requested by any such seller,
underwriter,  attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration
statement.

     1.7. Furnish Information.
          --------------------
     It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take
any action  pursuant to Sections 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 that the selling Holder shall
furnish to the Company such information  regarding such Holder,  the Registrable
Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities
as  shall  be  required  to  timely  effect  the   registration  of  Registrable
Securities.

     1.8. Indemnification.
          ----------------
     In the event any  Registrable  Securities  are  included in a  registration
statement under Sections 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4:

                                       4
<PAGE>

     (a) By the  Company.  To the extent  permitted  by law,  the  Company  will
indemnify and hold  harmless the Holder,  the  partners,  members,  officers and
directors  of the Holder,  and each person,  if any,  who  controls  such Holder
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any losses,
claims,  damages,  or  liabilities  (joint or  several) to which they may become
subject  under the  Securities  Act, the Exchange Act or other  federal or state
law,  insofar as such losses,  claims,  damages,  or liabilities  (or actions in

          (i) any untrue  statement  or alleged  untrue  statement of a material
     fact contained or incorporated by reference in such registration statement,
     including any preliminary  prospectus or final prospectus contained therein
     or any amendments or supplements thereto;

          (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
     required to be stated therein,  or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading, or

          (iii)  any  violation  or  alleged  violation  by the  Company  of the
     Securities  Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state  securities  law or
     any rule or regulation  promulgated  under the Securities Act, the Exchange
     Act or any federal or state  securities law in connection with the offering
     covered by such registration statement;

     (b) and the Company will reimburse such Holder, partner, member, officer or
director,  underwriter  or  controlling  person for any legal or other  expenses
reasonably  incurred by them, as incurred,  in connection with  investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided,  however,
that the indemnity  agreement  contained in this  subsection  shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,  liability or action
if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such
case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it
arises out of or is based upon (A) a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished in writing and expressly stated
for use in connection with such  registration by such Holder,  partner,  member,
officer,  director,  underwriter  or  controlling  person of such Holder,  (B) a
Violation which occurs due to a breach of any representation or warranty by such
Holder which in contained  in the  Purchase  Agreement or (C) a Violation  which
occurs  as a result of an untrue  statement  of a  material  fact  contained  or
incorporated by reference in such registration statement that has been corrected
in a subsequent prospectus delivered to such Holder prior to disposition by such
Holder of its Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 1.6(f) hereof.

     (c) By the Selling  Holder.  To the extent  permitted  by law,  the selling
Holder will,  severally and not jointly, if Registrable  Securities held by such
Holder are included in the  securities  as to which such  registration  is being
effected,  indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors,  each
of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any,
who  controls  the  Company  within  the  meaning  of the  Securities  Act,  any
underwriter  (as defined in the  Securities  Act),  against any losses,  claims,
damages  or  liabilities  (joint or  several)  to which the  Company or any such

                                       5
<PAGE>

director,  officer,  controlling person, or underwriter,  or a member,  partner,
director,  officer or controlling  person of such underwriter may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state  securities law
or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
or any federal or state  securities law in connection with the offering  covered
by such  registration  statement,  insofar as such  losses,  claims,  damages or
liabilities  (or actions in respect  thereto) arise out of or are based upon any
Violation,  in each  case to the  extent  (and  only to the  extent)  that  such
Violation  occurs in reliance  upon and in conformity  with written  information
furnished  by such  Holder by an  instrument  duly  executed  by such Holder and
stated to be  specifically  for use in such  registration;  and such Holder will
reimburse any legal or other expenses  reasonably incurred by the Company or any
such director,  officer,  controlling person, or underwriter or partner, member,
officer,  director or controlling  person of such underwriter in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss,  claim,  damage,  liability or action;
provided,  however,  that the indemnity  agreement  contained in this subsection
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,  claim,  damage,
liability or action if such  settlement  is effected  without the consent of the
Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld; and provided further,
that the total  amounts  payable in  indemnity  by the Holder under this Section
1.8(c) in respect of any Violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by
such Holder in the registered offering out of which such Violation arises.

     (d) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified
party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying
party under this Section 1.8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice
of the commencement  thereof and the indemnifying  party shall have the right to
participate in, and, to the extent the  indemnifying  party so desires,  jointly
with any other  indemnifying  party  similarly  noticed,  to assume the  defense
thereof with counsel mutually  satisfactory to the parties;  provided,  however,
that an indemnified  party shall have the right to retain its own counsel,  with
the fees and expenses to be paid by the  indemnifying  party,  if the defendants
include  both  the  indemnifying   party  and  the  indemnified  party  and  the
indemnified  party shall have reasonably  concluded that there may be reasonable
defenses  available  to it  which  are  different  from or  additional  to those
available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party
reasonably  may be deemed to conflict  with the  interests  of the  indemnifying
party. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying  party within a
reasonable  time  of  the  commencement  of  any  such  action,   if  materially
prejudicial   to  its  ability  to  defend  such  action,   shall  relieve  such
indemnifying  party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section
1.8 to the  extent it is  prejudiced  thereby,  but the  omission  so to deliver
written  notice to the  indemnifying  party will not relieve it of any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 1.8.

     (e) Contribution.  In order to provide for just and equitable  contribution
to joint  liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (A) the
Holder exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of such
Holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 1.8 but it is
judicially  determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the
last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case
notwithstanding  the fact that this Section 1.8 provides for  indemnification in
such case, or (B)  contribution  under the Securities Act may be required on the
part of such selling Holder or any such controlling  person in circumstances for

                                       6
<PAGE>

which indemnification is provided under this Section 1.8, then, and in each such
case,  the Company or such Holder  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate  losses,
claims,  damages  or  liabilities  as is  appropriate  to  reflect  not only the
relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying  party,
but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party,
as well as any other relevant  equitable  considerations.  The relative fault of
such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question,  including any untrue or
alleged untrue  statement of a material fact or omission or alleged  omission to
state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information  supplied by,
such  indemnifying  party or  indemnified  parties,  and the  parties'  relative
intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such action;  provided,  however,  that, in any such case, (1) such Holder shall
not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public  offering price
of all such Registrable  Securities  offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to
such   registration   statement;   and  (2)  no  person   guilty  of  fraudulent
misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the  Securities  Act)
shall be  entitled  to  contribution  from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

     (f)  Survival.  The  obligations  of the Company and the Holder  under this
Section  1.8  shall  survive  the  completion  of any  offering  of  Registrable
Securities in a registration statement and the termination of this Agreement.

     1.9. Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights.
          ----------------------------------------------
     From and  after  the date of this  Agreement,  without  the  prior  written
consent of the Holder,  the Company shall not enter into any agreement  with any
holder or  prospective  holder of any securities of the Company that would allow
such holder or prospective  holder to have  registration  rights superior to, or
which limit in any way the  registration  rights of the Holder  granted  hereby;
provided  that in the  event  that the  Company  should  grant to any  holder or
prospective  holder of any  securities of the Company the right to make a demand
registration to the Company,  it is  acknowledged  and agreed by the Holder that
such right may reduce the number of Registrable  Securities that may be included
in  an  underwritten  offering  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  such  demand
registration right, so long as the number of Registrable  Securities included in
such  registration are included pro rata with the number of securities  included
by the holder or holders exercising the demand registration right.

     1.10. Reporting and Information.
           --------------------------
     With a  view  to  making  available  the  benefits  of  certain  rules  and
regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of the  Registrable
Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to:

          (i) make and keep  public  information  available,  as those terms are
     understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times;

          (ii)  file  with the SEC in a timely  manner  all  reports  and  other
     documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange
     Act (whether or not it shall be required to make such Exchange Act Reports)
     and shall comply with all other public information  reporting  requirements
     of the SEC as a condition  to the  availability  of an  exemption  from the
     Securities  Act (under Rule 144 thereof,  as amended from time to time,  or
     successor  rule thereto or  otherwise)  for the sale of Common Stock by the
     Holder;

                                       7
<PAGE>

          (iii) so long as the Holder owns any Registrable  Securities,  furnish
     to the Holder  upon  request a written  statement  by the Company as to its
     compliance  with the  reporting  requirements  of said  Rule 144 and of the
     Securities  Act and the Exchange  Act, a copy of the most recent  annual or
     quarterly  report of the Company,  and such other  reports and documents of
     the Company as the Holder may reasonably  request in availing itself of any
     rule or  regulation  of the SEC  allowing  the  Holder  to  sell  any  such
     securities without registration; and

          (iv) cooperate with the Holder in supplying such information as may be
     necessary  for the Holder to complete  and file any  information  reporting
     forms  presently  or  hereafter  required by the SEC as a condition  to the
     availability  of an  exemption  from the  Securities  Act  (under  Rule 144
     thereof or otherwise) for the sale of Common Stock by the Holder.
