THIS SECOND AMENDMENT ("Amendment No. 2") to the Transport Services Agreement
(Williams Contract No. 99B1610.0l; SBC Agreement No. 00013622) is made and
entered on the date when signed by the last Party ("Effective Date"), by and
between Williams Communications, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and
SBC Operations, Inc. and Southwestern Bell Communications Services, Inc.,
Delaware corporations (collectively, "SBCS"). Williams and SBCS may be referred
to individually as "Party" or collectively as the "Parties."

WHEREAS, the Parties have entered into the Transport Services Agreement, dated
as of February 8, 1999, (the "Agreement"), and as Amended on September 29, 2000
("First Amendment") (collectively the "TSA") pursuant to which SBCS may order
various telecommunications services from Williams (Williams Contract No.
99B1610.0I; SBCS Agreement No. 00013622); and

WHEREAS, such Amendment No. 2 is sought to clarify one specific issue in the

by SBCS.

the Parties agree to amend the TSA as follows:



I.       Section 3.5.1 shall be amended by adding the following sentence at the
         end of the paragraph:

         "With respect to voice products and services provided by Williams to
         SBCS hereunder, the Applicable Rates shall apply to all minutes
         transported on the Williams Network, regardless of whether such minutes
         are associated with complete or incomplete calls."

2.       Schedule K shall be amended by adding the following to Schedule K (vi)
         p.5 at the bottom of the page:

         "iii. SBC Voice MOUs (annual) shall include minutes of use associated
         with complete and incomplete calls."

3.       Except as specifically amended herein, all terms, conditions and
         provisions contained in the Agreement shall remain unchanged and in
         full force and effect.
