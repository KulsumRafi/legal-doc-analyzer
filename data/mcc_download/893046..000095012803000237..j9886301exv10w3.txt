Dear Sir:

     This letter is provided pursuant to Section 4.11 of that certain Asset

Inc. (the "COMPANY"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc. ("RENT-WAY MICHIGAN") and
Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P. ("TTIG" and, together with Rent-Way Michigan, the
"OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

     Following an evaluation of the status of Acquiror's due diligence
investigation up to and including the date hereof, the Acquiror, the Company and
the Operating Subsidiaries hereby mutually agree, in accordance with Section

Period is necessary for Acquiror to adequately complete its due diligence review
of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Extended
Investigation Period shall extend until and include January 20, 2003, provided,
however, that the Extended Investigation Period shall continue after January 20,

of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Other than as specifically provided for herein,
all other terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall remain in
