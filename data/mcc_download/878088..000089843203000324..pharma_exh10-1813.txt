                 C.    This Amendment constitutes a legal, valid and binding
      obligation of Borrower, Parent and each such Credit Party which is a party
      hereto enforceable against Borrower, Parent and each Credit Party in
      accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
      applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
      laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
