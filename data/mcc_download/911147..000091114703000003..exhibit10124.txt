          have  against  CCAL and/or any other  member of the  Century  group of
          whatsoever   nature  arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  their
          appointment and conduct as directors of CCAL;

     7.1.2 COIL with 7.1.1,  CCA shall deliver to COIL a written  waiver by CCI,

     of duty or


                                      -9-
                                     <PAGE>


     breach of trust  where such breach was within the actual  knowledge  of any
     director of CCAL appointed directly or indirectly by CCA or CCI at the time
     of such breach), save for -

          7.1.2.1  any claims  which CCAL  and/or CCA would have had against the
          COIL directors  (subject to the provisions of section 248) in terms of
          sections 423 and 424 of the Companies Act, if CCAL were being wound-up
          or was subject to judicial management; and

          7.1.2.2 any other claim by CCAL,  the waiver of which would be void in
          terms of section 247 of the Companies Act,

     on the basis that CCA shall  procure  that CCAL shall  indemnify  each COIL
     director  against all costs incurred by such COIL director in defending any
     proceedings instituted by CCAL against him for negligence,  default, breach
     of duty, or breach of trust in relation to CCAL  (collectively,  "default")
     where the Court or the arbitrator/s, as the case may be, relieves such COIL
     director   from   liability   because  it  appears  to  the  Court  or  the
     arbitrator/s,  as the case may be, that such COIL director  acted  honestly
     and reasonably,  and that,  having regard to the circumstances of the case,
     including those connected with such COIL director's  appointment,  he ought
     fairly  to be  excused  for the  default.  CCA  shall  indemnify  each COIL
     director  against all costs incurred by such COIL director in defending any
     proceedings  instituted  by CCA against him for any  default,  on,  mutatis
     mutandis, the same basis.

     the  generality  of  the  aforegoing,  the  certificate  of  incorporation,
     memorandum and articles of association, minute books and registers of CCAL,

8 SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS

8.1  CCA shall procure that, on the closing date,  CCAL shall pay to COIL ZAR462
     640,  which payment shall be in full and final  settlement of all claims of

     group may have  against  CCAL,  CCA and/or any other  member of the Century
     group in respect  of all  amounts  paid by COIL or any other  member of the
     Fortes King group on behalf of CCAL in connection with CCAL's business.

     alleges  are  owing  by CCAL  to TDC for  services  rendered  by TDC  ("TDC
     claim").

9.2  COIL shall,  at its own expense  and with the  assistance  of its own legal
     advisers,  be  entitled  to contest the TDC claim in the name of CCAL until
     finally  determined  by the highest  court to which appeal or review may be

     proceedings in regard thereto; provided that -

     legal advisers if they so require)  render to COIL such  assistance as COIL
     may  reasonably  require  of CCA or CCAL in order to  contest  such  claim;
     provided further that COIL shall bear the cost of rendering such assistance
     and involving CCA's and CCAL's legal advisers.  CCA shall procure that CCAL
     complies with this 9.2.1;

     9.2.2  COIL  shall  regularly,  and in any  event on demand by CCA or CCAL,
     inform CCA and CCAL fully of the  status of the TDC claim and  furnish  CCA
     and CCAL with all  documents  and  information  relating  thereto which may
     reasonably be requested by CCA or CCAL;

     delayed),  take any major steps in relation  to the  settlement  of the TDC
     claim and shall not make or agree to any announcement or other publicity in
     relation to such claim.

9.3  The purchase price shall be reduced,  as at the TDC determination  date (as

11 WARRANTIES

11.1 COIL gives CCI and CCA the warranties on the basis that -

     11.1.1 this  agreement is entered into by CCA relying on those  warranties,
     each of which is deemed to be both a material  representation  inducing CCA
     to enter into this  agreement and an essential  contractual  undertaking by
     COIL to ensure that the warranty is true and correct;

     11.1.2 each such  warranty  shall be a separate  and  independent  warranty
     which shall not be limited by reference  to or inference

                                      -14-
                                     <PAGE>

     11.1.5  a  claim  by  CCI or CCA in  respect  of any  breach  of any of the
     warranties  or in terms of any indemnity in terms of this  agreement  shall
     not entitle CCI or CCA to make a claim against COIL in respect of more than
     one of such breach of warranty or claim under  indemnity  where such breach
     and claim arises from or is attributable to the same cause of action. It is
     recorded,  for the sake of clarity,  that CCI and CCA shall be entitled, in
     their discretion,  to determine whether to proceed in respect of the breach
     of warranty or claim under indemnity;

     11.1.6  each  warranty  which is not stated to be given as at a  particular
     date only or in respect of a particular period only is, notwithstanding the
     tense used therein, given as at the signature date and the closing date;

     11.1.7  neither CCI nor CCA shall be entitled to make a claim  against COIL
     in respect of a breach of the warranty contained in 11.2.6,  where CCI, CCA
     and/or CCAL have,  as at the closing date,  the same or materially  similar
     knowledge of any facts or circumstances referred to in 11.2.6.

     shares and COIL loan account are subject to the PSG pledge;

     11.2.4 no person has nor will have any existing or future right  (including
     any option or right of first  refusal) to acquire any of the sale shares or
     sale claims, other than in terms of the PSG pledge;

     11.2.5 between the signature date and the closing date, COIL shall not have
     exercised  its right to require the rate of interest  payable in respect of
     the sale  claims to be  adjusted  above 0% in terms of clause 5 of the loan
     agreement referred to in 10.2.2;

     11.2.6 COIL has disclosed to CCI or CCA all facts and circumstances  within
     the actual knowledge of COIL, Leon Fortes and Kevin King which are material
