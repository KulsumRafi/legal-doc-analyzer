Credit Agreement.

                  It is hereby agreed by you and us that Section 5.02(f) of the
Credit Agreement is, effective as of the date of this Letter Amendment, hereby
amended as follows:

                  (a)      Clauses (iv) and (v) are relettered as clauses (v)
and (vi), respectively, and

                  (b)      A new clause (iv) is added immediately after clause
(iii) to read as follows:

                  "(iv)    Debt consisting of Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2007
         of Platinum Underwriters Finance, Inc. included in the Borrower's
         equity security units in an aggregate amount outstanding not to exceed
         $172,500,000,"

                  This Letter Amendment shall become effective as of the date
first above written when, and only when, on or before October 28, 2002, the
Agent shall have received counterparts of this Letter Amendment executed by the
undersigned and the Required Lenders or, as to any of the Lenders, advice
satisfactory to the Agent that such Lender has executed this Letter Amendment.
This Letter Amendment is subject to the provisions of Section 8.01 of the Credit
Agreement.

                  On and after the effectiveness of this Letter Amendment, each
reference in the Credit Agreement to "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof" or
words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement, and each reference in
the Notes to "the Credit Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof" or words of like

effectiveness of this Letter Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided
herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender or the

which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed

accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
