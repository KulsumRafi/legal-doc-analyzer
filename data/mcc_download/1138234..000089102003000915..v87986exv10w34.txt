                        AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT dated as of
                        March 18, 2003, among AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC., a
                        Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"); the Lenders from
                        time to time party hereto; JPMORGAN CHASE ("JPMCB") and
                        BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as administrative agents for the
                        Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agents");
                        and JPMCB, as paying agent for the Lenders (in such
                        capacity, the "Paying Agent");

                        The Borrower, the Administrative Agents, the
Paying Agent and certain of the Lenders are parties to a 364-Day Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of March 23, 2001, as
amended and restated as of March 15, 2002 (as so amended and restated, the
"Existing Credit Agreement"). The parties hereto desire to amend the Existing
Credit Agreement and to restate it in its entirety giving effect to such
amendment. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Existing Credit
Agreement shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth
herein:

            The Borrower has requested the Lenders to extend credit to the
Borrower to enable it to (a) borrow on a standby revolving credit basis at any
time and from time to time on and after the date hereof and prior to the
Termination Date (as herein defined) a principal amount not in excess of
$1,250,000,000 at any time outstanding, (b) obtain Letters of Credit in an
aggregate stated amount that will not result in the LC Exposure exceeding
$100,000,000 at any time and (c) to establish procedures pursuant to which the
Borrower may invite the Lenders to bid on an uncommitted basis on short-term
borrowings by the Borrower maturing on or prior to the Termination Date. The
proceeds of borrowings hereunder are to be used for working capital and other
general corporate purposes, including capital and other expenditures in
connection with the build-out and operation of the Borrower's wireless system
and the provision of liquidity in connection with any commercial paper program
of the Borrower. The Letters of Credit will be used for general corporate
purposes of the Borrower. The Lenders are willing to extend such credit to the
Borrower on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth.

            Accordingly, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agents agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   Definitions

            SECTION 1.01. Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

            "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

<PAGE>

             "ABR Loan" shall mean any Standby Loan bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the
provisions of Article II.

            "Administrative Agents" shall have the meaning specified in the
recital of parties to this Agreement.

            "Administrative Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 2.07(c).

            "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an Administrative
Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit B hereto.

            "Affiliate" shall mean, when used with respect to a specified
person, another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by
or is under common control with the person specified.

            "Agents" shall mean the Administrative Agents and the Paying Agent.

            "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum
(rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the greater of
(a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the Federal Funds Effective
Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. If for any reason the Paying Agent
shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that it is unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate for any
reason, including the inability of the Paying Agent to obtain sufficient
quotations in accordance with the terms thereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall
be determined without regard to clause (b) of the first sentence of this
definition until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer
exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate
or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the effective date of
such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

            "Applicable Percentage" shall mean, with respect to any Lender, the
percentage of the Total Commitments represented by such Lender's Commitment. If
the Commitments have expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined
based upon the Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any
assignments.

            "Applicable Rate" shall mean, for any day, with respect to any
Standby Loan, or with respect to the facility fees payable hereunder, as the
case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth in the table below under
the caption "Eurodollar Spread", "ABR Spread" or "Facility Fee Rate", as the
case may be, based upon the ratings of S&P and Moody's, respectively, applicable
on such date to the Index Debt:

BBB-/Baa3 or unrated
</TABLE>

            For purposes of the foregoing, (a) if either S&P or Moody's shall
not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the
circumstances referred to in the penultimate sentence of this definition), then
such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 5;
(b) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by S&P and
Moody's for the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the
Applicable Rate shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless (i) one
of the two ratings is two or more Categories lower than the other, in which case
the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the Category next above
that of the lower of the two ratings or (ii) the Borrower's Short-Term Debt is
rated less than A2 or P2 or is unrated by either rating agency, in which case
the lower rating will apply, and (c) if the ratings established or deemed to
have been established by S&P or Moody's for the Index Debt shall be changed
(other than as a result of a change in the rating system of S&P or Moody's),
such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by
the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply
during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on
the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If
the rating system of S&P or Moody's shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,
the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of
ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating of
such rating agency most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) for each day on which the sum of (A) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans , (B) the LC Exposure and
(C) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans under the Five-Year
Credit Agreement shall exceed 33 1/3% of the sum of the Total Commitments
hereunder and the total commitments under the Five-Year Credit Agreement as of
such day, and for each day after the termination of the Commitments on which
Loans are outstanding or there is any LC Exposure, each rate set


                                       3
<PAGE>

forth in the table above under the caption "Eurodollar Spread" or "ABR Spread"
shall be increased by 0.250% per annum, and (ii) for each day after the
Termination Date, each rate set forth in the table above under the caption
"Eurodollar Spread" or "ABR Spread" shall be increased by an additional 1.00%
per annum at all times when the ratings of S&P and Moody's applicable to the
Index Debt shall be at least BBB- and Baa3, respectively, and 2.00% per annum at
all other times.

            "Assignment and Acceptance" shall mean an assignment and acceptance

date and as to which a single Interest Period is in effect.

            "Business Day" shall mean any day (other than a day which is a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the State of New York) on which banks are
open for business in New York City; provided, however, that, when used in
connection with a Eurodollar Loan, the term "Business Day" shall also exclude
any day on which banks are not open for dealings in dollar deposits in the
London interbank market.

            "Capital Lease Obligations" of any Person shall mean the obligations
of such Person to pay rent or other amounts under any lease of (or other

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

            SECTION 2.01. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender
agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Standby Loans to the Borrower, at any
time and from time to time on and after the date hereof and until the earlier of
the Termination Date and the termination of the Commitment of such Lender, in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed such Lender's
Commitment minus the sum of such Lender's LC Exposure at such time and the
amount by which the Competitive Loans outstanding at such time shall be deemed
to have used such Commitment pursuant to Section 2.18, subject, however, to the
conditions that (i) at no time shall (A) the sum of (x) the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of all Standby Loans made by all Lenders plus (y) the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Loans made by all
Lenders plus (z) the LC Exposure exceed (B) the Total Commitment, and (ii) at
all times the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Standby Loans made
by each Lender shall equal the product of (A) its Applicable Percentage times
(B) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Standby Loans. Within the
foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Standby
Loans hereunder, on and


                                       16
<PAGE>

after the Effective Date and prior to the Termination Date, subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein.

            SECTION 2.02. Loans.

            (a) Each Standby Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing
consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to
make any Standby Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by such other Lender). Each Competitive Loan shall be made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.03. The Standby Loans or Competitive
Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be (i) in the case of Competitive Loans, in
an aggregate principal amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) in the case of Standby Loans, in an aggregate
principal amount which is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than
$10,000,000 (or an aggregate principal amount equal to the remaining balance of
the available Commitments, or that is required to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as contemplated in Section 2.05).

            (b) Each Competitive Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of
Eurodollar Competitive Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, and each Standby Borrowing
shall be comprised entirely of Eurodollar Standby Loans or ABR Loans, as the
Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable. Each
Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or
foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any
exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more
than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would
result in an aggregate of more than 20 separate Standby Borrowings comprised of
Eurodollar Standby Loans being outstanding hereunder at any one time. For
purposes of the foregoing, Loans having different Interest Periods, regardless
of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

            (c) Subject to Section 2.06, each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Paying Agent in New York, New York, not later
than 12:00 noon, New York City time, and the Paying Agent shall by 3:00 p.m.,
New York City time, credit the amounts so received to the general deposit
account of the Borrower with the Paying Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur
on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have
been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders; provided
that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.05 shall be remitted by the Paying Agent to the applicable
Issuing Bank. Competitive Loans shall be made by the Lender or Lenders whose
Competitive Bids therefor are accepted pursuant to Section 2.03 in the amounts
so accepted. Standby Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with Section 2.18. Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date (or in the case of ABR Borrowings, prior to 12:00 noon
New York City time on the date of such Borrowing) of any Borrowing that such
Lender will not make available to the Paying Agent such


                                       17
<PAGE>

Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Paying Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such portion available to the Paying Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Paying Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made
such portion available to the Paying Agent, such Lender and the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Paying Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall
repay to the Paying Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 2.03. Competitive Bid Procedure.

            (a) In order to request Competitive Bids, the Borrower shall hand
deliver or telecopy to the Paying Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid Request
in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, to be received by the Paying Agent (i) in the
case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing and (ii)
in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, one Business Day before a proposed Competitive Borrowing. No ABR Loan
shall be requested in, or made pursuant to, a Competitive Bid Request. A
Competitive Bid Request that does not conform substantially to the format of
Exhibit A-1 may be rejected in the Paying Agent's sole discretion, and the
Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of such rejection by telecopy.
Each Competitive Bid Request shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x)
whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or a
Fixed Rate Borrowing, (y) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business
Day) and the aggregate principal amount thereof which shall be in a minimum
principal amount of $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and
(z) the Interest Period with respect thereto (which may not end after the
Termination Date). Promptly after its receipt of a Competitive Bid Request that
is not rejected as aforesaid, the Paying Agent shall invite by telecopy (in the
form set forth in Exhibit A-2 hereto) the Lenders to bid, on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Loans pursuant to the
Competitive Bid Request.

            (b) Each Lender invited to bid may, in its sole discretion, make one
or more Competitive Bids to the Borrower responsive to the Borrower's
Competitive Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid by a Lender must be received by
the Paying Agent via telecopy, in the form of Exhibit A-3 hereto, (i) in the
case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing and (ii)
in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City
time, on the day of a proposed Competitive Borrowing. Multiple bids will be
accepted by the Paying Agent. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially
to the format of Exhibit A-3 may be rejected by the Paying Agent after
conferring with, and upon the instruction of, the Borrower, and the Paying Agent
shall notify the Lender making such nonconforming bid of such rejection


                                       18
<PAGE>

as soon as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and
specify (x) the principal amount (which shall be in a minimum principal amount
of $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the
entire principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing requested by the Borrower)
of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the Lender is willing to make to the
Borrower, (y) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which the Lender is prepared
to make the Competitive Loan or Loans and (z) the Interest Period and the last
day thereof. If any Lender invited to bid shall elect not to make a Competitive
Bid, such Lender shall so notify the Paying Agent via telecopy (I) in the case
of Eurodollar Competitive Loans, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, and (II) in the
case of Fixed Rate Loans, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the
day of a proposed Competitive Borrowing; provided, however, that failure by any
Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make
any Competitive Loan as part of such Competitive Borrowing. A Competitive Bid
submitted by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable.

            (c) The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, by
telecopy, of all the Competitive Bids made, the Competitive Bid Rate and the
principal amount of each Competitive Loan in respect of which a Competitive Bid
was made and the identity of the Lender that made each bid. The Paying Agent
shall send a copy of all Competitive Bids to the Borrower for its records as
soon as practicable after completion of the bidding process set forth in this
Section 2.03.

            (d) The Borrower may in its sole and absolute discretion, subject
only to the provisions of this paragraph (d), accept or reject any Competitive
Bid referred to in paragraph (c) above. The Borrower shall notify the Paying
Agent by telephone, confirmed by telecopy in the form of a Competitive Bid
Accept/Reject Letter, whether and to what extent it has decided to accept or
reject any of or all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above, (x) in the
case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, and (y)
in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City
time, on the day of a proposed Competitive Borrowing; provided, however, that
(i) the failure by the Borrower to give such notice shall be deemed to be a
rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above, (ii) the Borrower
shall not accept a bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if it has
decided to reject a bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii) the
aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not
exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request, (iv) if
the Borrower shall accept a bid or bids made at a particular Competitive Bid
Rate but the amount of such bid or bids shall cause the total amount of bids to
be accepted by the Borrower to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request, then the Borrower shall accept a portion of such bid or bids in an
amount equal to the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the
amount of all other Competitive Bids accepted with respect to such Competitive
Bid Request, which acceptance, in the case of multiple bids at such Competitive
Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid
at such Competitive Bid Rate, and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no
bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in
a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000;
provided further, however, that if a Competitive Loan must be in an


                                       19
<PAGE>

amount less than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such
Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple
thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of acceptances of portions
of multiple bids at a particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv)
the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner
which shall be in the discretion of the Borrower. A notice given by the Borrower
pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be irrevocable.

            (e) The Paying Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender
whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so, in what amount
and at what Competitive Bid Rate) by telecopy sent by the Paying Agent, and each
successful bidder will thereupon become bound, subject to the other applicable
conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has
been accepted.

            (f) A Competitive Bid Request shall not be made within five Business
Days after the date of any previous Competitive Bid Request. No Competitive
Borrowing shall be requested or made hereunder if after giving effect thereto
any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.01 would not be met.

            (g) If the Paying Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in
its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such bid directly to the Borrower one
quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time at which the other Lenders are
required to submit their bids to the Paying Agent pursuant to paragraph (b)
above.

            (h) All notices required by this Section 2.03 shall be given in
accordance with Section 9.01.

            SECTION 2.04. Standby Borrowing Procedure. In order to request a
Standby Borrowing, the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Paying
Agent a duly completed Standby Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit A-5 (a)
in the case of a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Borrowing and (b) in the
case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the
day of a proposed Borrowing. No Fixed Rate Loan shall be requested or made
pursuant to a Standby Borrowing Request. Such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall in each case specify (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to
be a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such
Standby Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; and
(iii) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing, the Interest
Period with respect thereto, which shall not end after the Termination Date. If
no election as to the Type of Standby Borrowing is specified in any such notice,
then the requested Standby Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest
Period with respect to any Eurodollar Standby Borrowing is specified in any such
notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of
one month's duration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Standby
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect to such Standby
Borrowing would end after the Termination Date. The Paying Agent shall promptly
advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.04 and of each
Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.


                                       20

            SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Paying Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, any Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

            (a) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to
an Issuing Bank and the Paying Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested
date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the
issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be
amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this
Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit is
to be a Performance Letter of Credit (and if it is to be a Performance Letter of
Credit, a description of the obligations to be supported by such Letter of
Credit), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall
submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in
connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be
issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $100,000,000 and (ii)
the sum of the total Standby Credit Exposures and the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the Total Commitment.

            (b) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date (assuming, for this
purpose only, and not for purposes of any other Section of this Agreement, that
the term-out option in Section 2.08 has been exercised).

            (c) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from
such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn
under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Paying Agent, for the account of the


                                       21
<PAGE>

applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit, (provided that such
letter of credit shall expire no later than the date set forth in paragraph (c)
of this Section) or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

            (d) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Paying Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that
the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, then, if the Termination
Date shall not have occurred, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to
borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such
payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the
extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be
discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to
make such payment when due, the Paying Agent shall notify each Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Paying Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.02 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the
amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Paying Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the
Paying Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to
the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their
interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of
ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

            (e) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under

any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of
validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any
term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (iii) any
other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the Paying Agent, the Lenders or any
of the Issuing Banks, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability
or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to
the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the
extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by
such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

            (f) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Paying Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any
such LC Disbursement.

            (g) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that,
if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11 shall apply. Interest accrued
pursuant to this


                                       23
<PAGE>

paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

            (h) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Paying Agent shall
notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any
such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees
accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.07(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
applicable replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of
Credit to be issued thereafter. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

            (i) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Paying Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Paying Agent, in the name of the Paying Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (f) or (g) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the
Paying Agent in an interest bearing account or other investment mutually
acceptable to the Borrower and the Paying Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The
Paying Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive
right of withdrawal, over such account. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Paying Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements
for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be
held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for
the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Lenders), shall be
applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If
the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a
result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not
applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

            SECTION 2.06. Conversion and Continuation of Standby Loans. The
Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the
Paying Agent (i) not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the day of
the conversion, to convert all or any part of any Eurodollar Standby Borrowing
into an ABR Borrowing, (ii) not later than 10:30 a.m.,


                                       24
<PAGE>

New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion or continuation, to
convert any ABR Borrowing into a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing or to continue any
Eurodollar Standby Borrowing as a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing for an additional
Interest Period and (iii) not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the Interest Period, with respect
to any Eurodollar Standby Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period,
subject in each case to the following:

            (a) if less than all the outstanding principal amount of any Standby
      Borrowing shall be converted or continued, the aggregate principal amount
      of the Standby Borrowing converted or continued shall be an integral
      multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000;

            (b) accrued interest on a Standby Borrowing (or portion thereof)
      being converted shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of conversion;

            (c) if any Eurodollar Standby Borrowing is converted at a time other
      than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall
      pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.17;

            (d) any portion of a Standby Borrowing maturing or required to be
      repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as a
      Eurodollar Standby Borrowing;

            (e) any portion of a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing which cannot be
      continued as a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing by reason of clause (d) above
      shall be automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in
      effect for such Eurodollar Standby Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing; and

            (f) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar Standby
      Borrowing that would end later than the Maturity Date.

            Each notice of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be
irrevocable and shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and
amount of the Standby Borrowing that the Borrower requests to be converted or
continued, (ii) whether such Standby Borrowing is to be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing, or an ABR Borrowing, (iii) if such
notice requests a conversion, the date of such conversion (which shall be a
Business Day) and (iv) if such Standby Borrowing is to be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect
thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice with respect to
any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with this
Section 2.06 to convert or continue any Standby Borrowing, such Standby
Borrowing shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless
repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be converted or continued
into a new Interest Period as an ABR Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.07. Fees.


                                       25
<PAGE>

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender, through the Paying
Agent, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (with the first
payment being due on March 31, 2003), on each date on which the Commitment of
such Lender shall be terminated or reduced as provided herein and on the
Maturity Date, a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") on the average daily amount of
the Commitment of such Lender, whether used or unused, and after the termination
of the Commitment of such Lender, on the average daily amount of the Loans and
LC Exposure of such Lender, during the preceding quarter (or other period
commencing on the date of this Agreement or ending with the Maturity Date or any
date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall be terminated or reduced) at a
rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate in effect from time to time. All
Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Facility Fee due to each Lender shall
commence to accrue on the date of this Agreement and shall cease to accrue on
the date on which such Lender shall have no outstanding Loans, LC Exposure or
Commitment.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Paying Agent, for the
account of each Lender, a participation fee with respect to its participations
in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used from
time to time to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Standby
Loans (or, in the case of any participation in a Performance Letter of Credit,
at 60% of such Applicable Rate; provided, that at all times when the rate set
forth under the caption "Eurodollar Spread" in the table in the definition of
"Applicable Rate" herein is increased pursuant to the last sentence of such
definition, such participation fee shall be increased by an amount equal to 100%
of any such increase) on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank
a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank on the average
daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date
on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the later of the date on which
the Commitments terminate and the date on which there shall cease to be any LC
Exposure. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

            (c) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agents, for their
own accounts, and the Paying Agent, for its own account, the agency and other
fees referred to in the


                                       26
<PAGE>

Fee Letter or separately agreed to with the Paying Agent (the "Administrative
Fees") at the times and in the amounts agreed upon.

            (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Paying Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of
fees payable to it) for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders.
Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

            SECTION 2.08. Extension of Maturity Date. The Borrower may, by
written notice delivered to the Paying Agent not less than 10 and not more than
20 days prior to the Termination Date, extend the Maturity Date from the
Termination Date to the first anniversary of the Termination Date, subject to
the satisfaction on the Termination Date of the conditions in clauses (b) and
(c) of Section 4.01 and the delivery to the Paying Agent of a certificate signed
by the Financial Officer confirming such compliance.

            SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

            (a) The Borrower hereby agrees that the outstanding principal
balance of each Standby Loan shall be payable on the Maturity Date, and that the
outstanding principal balance of each Competitive Loan shall be payable on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Each Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section
2.10.

            (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid such lending office of such Lender from
time to time under this Agreement.

            (c) The Paying Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section
9.04(d), and a sub-account for each Lender, in which Register and accounts
(taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder,
the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
received by the Paying Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share
thereof.

            (d) The entries made in the Register and accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraph (b) and (c) of this Section 2.09 shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender or the Paying Agent to maintain such account,
such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein shall not
in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made to
the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with their terms.

            SECTION 2.10. Interest on Loans.


                                       27
<PAGE>

            (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11 and paragraph (e)
below, the Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days) at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of each Eurodollar Standby
Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus
the Applicable Rate from time to time in effect and (ii) in the case of each
Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Margin offered by the Lender making such Loan and
accepted by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03.

            (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11 and paragraph (e)
below, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be, for periods during which the Alternate Base Rate is
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and 360 days for periods during which
the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds
Effective Rate) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate from time to time in effect.

            (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, each Fixed Rate Loan
shall bear interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the fixed rate of
interest offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.03.

            (d) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment
Date applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each Interest Period or day
within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined in good faith
by the Paying Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

            SECTION 2.11. Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration
or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the Paying
Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted amount up
to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before
judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2%.

            SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Paying Agent shall have
determined in good faith (i) that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of
the Eurodollar Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in
the London interbank market or (ii) that reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Paying Agent shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, give telecopy notice of such determination to the Borrower and the
Lenders. In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above,
until the Paying Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (x) any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing pursuant to


                                       28
<PAGE>

section 2.03 shall be of no force and effect and shall be denied by the Paying
Agent and (y) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing
pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing.
In the event a Lender notifies the Paying Agent that the rates at which dollar
deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lender of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest
Period, the Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower of such notice and until the
Lender shall have advised the Paying Agent that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice no longer exist, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
Standby Borrowing shall be deemed a request for an ABR Borrowing for the same
Interest Period with respect to such Lender. Each determination by the Paying
Agent hereunder shall be in good faith and conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.13. Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

            (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall be
automatically terminated on the Termination Date.

            (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable telecopy
notice to the Paying Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently
terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Total
Commitment; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the Total
Commitment shall be in an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and in a minimum
principal amount of $10,000,000 and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall
be made which would reduce the Total Commitment to an amount less than the sum
of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Competitive Loans of all
Lenders and the LC Exposure.

            (c) Each reduction in the Total Commitment hereunder shall be made
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. The
Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of the Lenders, on the
date of each termination or reduction of the Commitment, the Facility Fees on
the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued through the date
of such termination or reduction.

            SECTION 2.14. Prepayment.

            (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Standby Borrowing, in whole or in part, upon giving telecopy
notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by telecopy notice) to the Paying
Agent: (i) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) before 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, one Business Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans;
provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is
an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. The Borrower
shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive Borrowing.

            (b) On the date of any termination or reduction of the Commitments
pursuant to Section 2.13, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much of the
Standby Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate principal
amount of the Competitive Loans and Standby Loans outstanding and the aggregate
LC Exposure will not exceed the Total Commitment, after


                                       29
<PAGE>

giving effect to such termination or reduction; provided that the Borrower shall
not be required hereby to repay Standby Loans on the Termination Date if the
Maturity Date has been extended pursuant to Section 2.08.

            (c) Each notice of prepayment from the Borrower shall specify the
prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof)
to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such
Borrowing (or portion thereof) by the amount stated therein on the date stated
therein. All prepayments under this Section 2.14 shall be subject to Section
2.17 but otherwise without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this
Section 2.14 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount
being prepaid to the date of payment.

            SECTION 2.15. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of
this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the
force of law) shall result in the imposition, modification or applicability of
any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets or deposits
with or for the account of or credit extended hereunder by any Lender or any
Issuing Bank, or shall result in the imposition on such Lender or any Issuing
Bank or the London interbank market of any other condition affecting this
Agreement, such Lender's Commitment or any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or Participation therein, and the
result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan or to increase the
cost to such Lender or any Issuing Bank or participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender or any Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then
the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to request
compensation under this paragraph with respect to any Competitive Loan if the
change giving rise to such request was applicable to such Lender at the time of
submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Competitive Loan shall
have been made.

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank shall have determined that the
applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted after the date
hereof pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee
on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the adoption after
the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation
or administration of any of the foregoing by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender or Issuing Bank (or any lending office of
such Lender) or any Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law)
of any


                                       30
<PAGE>

such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect
of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital
or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement, such Lender's Commitment or the Loans
made by or participations in Letters of Credit held by such Lender pursuant
hereto to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank
or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

            (c) A certificate of the Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth
such amount or amounts (including computation of such amount or amounts) as
shall be necessary to compensate the Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding
company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the
case may be, shall be delivered to the Borrower and such amount or amounts may
be reviewed by the Borrower. Unless the Borrower disagrees in good faith with
the computation of the amount or amounts in such certificate, the Borrower shall
pay to the Lender or such Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after receipt by
the Borrower of such certificate delivered by the Lender or such Issuing Bank,
the amount shown as due on any such certificate. If the Borrower, after receipt
of any such certificate from the Lender or such Issuing Bank, disagrees with the
Lender or such Issuing Bank on the computation of the amount or amounts owed to
the Lender or such Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, the
Lender or such Issuing Bank and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to
promptly resolve such disagreement. In either case, however, the Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have a duty to mitigate the damages that
may arise as a consequence of paragraph (a) or (b) above to the extent that such
mitigation will not, in the judgment of the Lender or such Issuing Bank, entail
any cost or disadvantage to the Lender or such Issuing Bank that the Lender or
such Issuing Bank is not reimbursed or compensated for by the Borrower.

            (d) Failure on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand
compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall
not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand
compensation with respect to such period or any other period. The protection of
this Section shall be available to each Lender and Issuing Bank regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule,
regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall have occurred or
been imposed.

            SECTION 2.16. Change in Legality.

            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date
hereof any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by
any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
any Eurodollar Loan, then, by 30 days' (or such shorter period as shall be


                                       31
<PAGE>

required in order to comply with applicable law) written notice to the Borrower
and to the Paying Agent, such Lender may:

            (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by
      such Lender hereunder, whereupon such Lender shall not submit a
      Competitive Bid in response to a request for Eurodollar Competitive Loans
      and any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Standby Borrowing shall,
      as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such
      declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

            (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
      converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
      automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
      notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.

            (b) For purposes of this Section 2.16, a notice to the Borrower by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last
day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all
other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the
Borrower. Before giving any such notice, such Lender shall designate a different
lending office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice
and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender.

            SECTION 2.17. Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any out-of-pocket loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of (a) any failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance,
convert or continue any Loan hereunder after irrevocable notice of such
borrowing, refinancing, conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to
Section 2.03, 2.04 or 2.06, (b) any payment, prepayment or conversion, or an
assignment required under Section 2.22, of a Eurodollar Loan by the Borrower
required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed
made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period, if any,
applicable thereto, (c) any default by the Borrower in payment or prepayment of
the principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon
or of any reimbursement obligation in respect of an LC Disbursement, as and when
due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity,
acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (d) the
occurrence of any Event of Default.

            In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such out-of-pocket loss or expense
shall be limited to an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) such Lender's
cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or not
borrowed, converted or continued (based on the LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for
the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to
borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan
(or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest
Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure)
over (ii) the amount of interest that


                                       32
<PAGE>

would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid,
converted or not borrowed, converted or continued for such period or Interest
Period, as the case may be. In the case of an ABR Loan, such out-of-pocket loss
or expense shall be limited to an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
such Lender's cost of obtaining the funds for the ABR Loan being paid, prepaid,
converted or not borrowed, converted or continued for the period from the date
of such payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, convert or
continue to the next Business Day for such ABR Loan over (ii) the amount of
interest that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid,
prepaid, converted or not borrowed, converted or continued until the next
Business Day, as the case may be.

            A certificate of the Lender setting forth such amount or amounts
(including the computation of such amount or amounts) as shall be necessary to
compensate the Lender or its holding company for the out-of-pocket expenses
defined herein shall be delivered to the Borrower and such amount or amounts may
be reviewed by the Borrower. If the Borrower, after receipt of any such
certificate from the Lender, disagrees in good faith with the Lender on the
computation of the amount or amounts owed to the Lender pursuant to this Section
2.17, the Lender and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to promptly
resolve such disagreement.

            Each Lender shall have a duty to mitigate the damages to such Lender
that may arise as a consequence of clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above to the
extent that such mitigation will not, in the judgment of such Lender, entail any
cost or disadvantage to such Lender that such Lender is not reimbursed or
compensated for by the Borrower.

            SECTION 2.18. Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Sections
2.12, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.21, 2.22 and 2.23, each Standby Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any Standby Borrowing, each reimbursement
of LC Disbursements, each payment of interest on the Standby Loans, each payment
of fees hereunder, each reduction of the Commitments and each refinancing or
conversion of any Borrowing with a Standby Borrowing of any Type, shall be
allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Standby
Loans or LC Exposures). Each payment of principal of any Competitive Borrowing
shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders participating in such Borrowing in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding
Competitive Loans comprising such Borrowing. Each payment of interest on any
Competitive Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders
participating in such Borrowing in accordance with the respective amounts of
accrued and unpaid interest on their outstanding Competitive Loans comprising
such Borrowing. For purposes of determining the available Commitments of the
Lenders at any time, each outstanding Competitive Borrowing shall be deemed to
have utilized the Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which
shall not have made Loans as part of such Competitive Borrowing) pro rata in
accordance with their respective Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in
computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the
Paying Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such
Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.

            SECTION 2.19. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
against the Borrower, or pursuant


                                       33
<PAGE>

to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or
other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim,
received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or
involuntary) in respect of any Standby Loan or Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Standby
Loans or participations in LC Disbursements of such Lender shall be
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Standby Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed
simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall
promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the
Standby Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Standby Loans and participations in the Standby Loans held by each
Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of all Standby Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its Standby
Loans prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other
event was to the principal amount of all Standby Loans outstanding prior to such
exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided,
however, that, if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made
pursuant to this Section 2.19 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a
Standby Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing
by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had
made a Standby Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

            SECTION 2.20. Payments.

            (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or
interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) due hereunder from an
account in the United States not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
the date when due in dollars to the Paying Agent at its offices at 270 Park
Avenue, New York, New York, in immediately available funds.

            (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise
would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or Fees or other amounts, if
applicable.

            SECTION 2.21. Taxes.

            (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made, in
accordance with Section 2.20, free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto imposed by the United
States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof, excluding taxes
imposed on the Paying Agent or any Lender's (or any transferee's or assignee's,


                                       34
<PAGE>

including a participation holder's (any such entity a "Transferee")) net income
and franchise taxes imposed on the Paying Agent or any Lender (or Transferee) by
the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (all
such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender (or any Transferee), Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent,
(i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.21) such Lender (or Transferee), Issuing Bank
or the Paying Agent (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement imposed by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

            (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender (or Transferee), Issuing
Bank and the Paying Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
(including any Taxes or Other Taxes on amounts payable under this Section 2.21)
paid by such Lender (or Transferee), Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, with respect to the Borrower and any liability (including
penalties, interest and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) arising therefrom or
with respect thereto (other than any such liability that results from the
negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender (or Transferee), Issuing Bank or
the Paying Agent), whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental
Authority. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date any
Lender (or Transferee), Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
makes written demand therefor. If the Borrower or any Lender (or Transferee),
Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent shall determine that Taxes or Other Taxes may
not have been correctly or legally assessed by the relevant taxing authority or
other Governmental Authority, and that a Lender (or Transferee), Issuing Bank or
the Paying Agent may be entitled to receive a refund in respect of Taxes or
Other Taxes, it shall promptly notify the other party of the availability of
such refund and such Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying Agent shall, within 30
days after receipt of a request by the Borrower, apply for such refund at the
Borrower's expense. If any Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying Agent receives a
refund or credit or offset against another tax liability in respect of any Taxes
or Other Taxes for which such Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying Agent has
received payment from the Borrower hereunder it shall promptly repay such refund
or credit or offset against another tax liability (including any interest
received by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying Agent from the taxing
authority with respect to the refund with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes)
to the Borrower, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender; provided that
the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying
Agent, agrees to return such refund or credit or offset against another tax
liability (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender (or
Transferee) or the Paying Agent in the event such


                                       35
<PAGE>

Lender (or Transferee) or the Paying Agent is required to repay such refund or
credit or offset against another tax liability. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the Paying Agent or any Lender shall determine in good faith and in
its discretion the amount of any credit or offset against another tax liability
and shall be under no obligation to make available to the Borrower any of its
tax returns or any other information that it deems to be confidential.

            (d) As soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes or
Other Taxes withheld by the Borrower in respect of any payment to any Lender (or
Transferee) or the Paying Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Paying Agent,
at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of
a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

            (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.21
shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans
made hereunder.

            (f) Each Lender (or Transferee) which is organized outside the
United States shall, prior to the due date of the first payment by the Borrower
to such Lender (or Transferee) hereunder, deliver to the Borrower such
certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Code or Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant thereto, including Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service properly completed and duly executed by such Lender (or
Transferee) establishing that such payment is (i) not subject to withholding
under the Code because such payment is effectively connected with the conduct by
such Lender (or Transferee) of a trade or business in the United States or (ii)
totally exempt from United States tax under a provision of an applicable tax
treaty. Each such Lender (or Transferee) that changes its funding office shall
promptly notify the Borrower of such change and, upon written request from the
Borrower, shall deliver any new certificates, documents or other evidence
required pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the immediately following
due date of any payment by the Borrower hereunder. Unless the Borrower and the
Paying Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them
indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to United States withholding
tax, notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Borrower or the Paying Agent shall
withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case
of payments to or for any Lender (or Transferee) organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States.

            (g) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts
to any Lender (or Transferee) in respect of Taxes and Other Taxes pursuant to
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above if the obligation to pay such additional
amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender (or Transferee)
to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) above unless such Lender (or
Transferee) is unable to comply with paragraph (f) because of (i) a change in
applicable law, regulation or official interpretation thereof or (ii) an
amendment, modification or revocation of any applicable tax treaty or a change
in official position regarding the application or interpretation thereof, in
each case after the date hereof (and, in the case of a Transferee, after the
date of assignment or transfer).

            (h) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts
payable under this Section 2.21 shall (i) to the extent legally able to do so,
upon written request from the


                                       36
<PAGE>

Borrower, file any certificate or document if such filing would avoid the need
for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter
accrue, and the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such additional amounts
if, after the Borrower's request, any Lender (or Transferee) could have filed
such certificate or document and failed to do so; or (ii) consistent with legal
and regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction
of its applicable lending office if the making of such change would avoid the
need for or reduce the amount of any additional amounts which may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender (or Transferee),
be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

            SECTION 2.22. Mandatory Assignment; Commitment Termination. In the
event any Lender delivers to the Paying Agent or the Borrower, as appropriate, a
certificate in accordance with Section 2.15(c) or a notice in accordance with
Section 2.12 or 2.16, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amounts
or other payments in accordance with Section 2.21, the Borrower may, at its own
expense, and in its sole discretion (a) require such Lender to transfer and
assign in whole or in part, without recourse (in accordance with Section 9.04),
all or part of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (other
than outstanding Competitive Loans) to an assignee which shall assume such
assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment); provided that (i) such assignment shall not conflict with any
law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority
and (ii) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender
in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date
of such payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts owed to
it hereunder or (b) terminate the Commitment of such Lender and prepay all
outstanding Loans (other than Competitive Loans) of such Lender; provided that
(x) such termination of the Commitment of such Lender and prepayment of Loans
does not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or
Governmental Authority and (y) the Borrower shall have paid to such Lender in
immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of
such payment on the Loans (other than Competitive Loans) made by it hereunder
and all other amounts owed to it hereunder.

            SECTION 2.23. Change of Control. If a Change of Control shall occur,
the Borrower shall, within ten days after the occurrence thereof, give each
Lender notice thereof, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and shall specify an Optional
Termination Date for purposes of this Section 2.23 (the "Optional Termination
Date"), which date shall not be less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the
date of such notice. Each Lender may, by notice to the Borrower and the Paying
Agent given not less than three Business Days prior to the Optional Termination
Date, terminate its Commitment (if any), which shall thereupon be terminated,
and declare the Loans held by it (together with accrued interest thereon) and
any other amounts payable hereunder for its account to be, and such Loans and
such other amounts shall thereupon become, due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower, in each case effective as of the Optional Termination Date. On the
Optional Termination Date, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Paying Agent, in the name of the Paying Agent, an amount in cash equal to such
terminating Lender's Applicable


                                       37
<PAGE>

Percentage of the total outstanding LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued
and unpaid interest thereon. Any such amounts that are deposited pursuant to
this Section 2.23 shall be held and applied in accordance with Section 2.05(j)
For purposes of this Section, "Change of Control" shall mean (i) the acquisition
of ownership, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, by any Person
or group (within the meaning of the regulations adopted by the SEC under the
Exchange Act) of issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the Borrower
representing the greater of (x) 30% of the aggregate ordinary voting power
represented by the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the Borrower and
(y) the aggregate percentage of such voting power so held by AT&T and its
consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (ii) the occupation of a
majority of the seats (other than vacant seats) on the board of directors of the
Borrower by Persons who were neither (A) nominated by the board of directors of
the Borrower nor (B) appointed by directors so nominated.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                         Representations and Warranties

has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under each Loan Document to which it is a party and, in the case
of the Borrower, to borrow funds and obtain Letters of Credit hereunder.

            SECTION 3.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by each Loan Party of each Loan Document, the Borrowings hereunder and the use

Regulations) or of the certificate of incorporation or other constitutive
documents or by-laws of any Loan Party, (2) any order of any Governmental
Authority or (3) any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument

such indenture, agreement or other instrument or (iii) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of any Loan Party.

            SECTION 3.03. Enforceability. This Agreement has been, and the

proceeding in equity or at law.

            SECTION 3.04. Governmental Approvals. No action, consent or approval
of, registration or filing with or any other action by any Governmental
Authority is or will be required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by any Loan Party of any Loan Document, the Borrowings hereunder or
the use of the proceeds thereof, except such as have been obtained or made and
are in full force and effect or the failure to have obtained which would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.05. Financial Statements.

            (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Agents and the
Lenders copies of (i) its audited financial statements for the year ended

March 28, 2002, filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act and (ii) copies of its
unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2002,

and the results of operations of the Borrower as of such dates in accordance
with GAAP.

            (a) There are no actions or proceedings filed or (to the knowledge
of any Loan Party) investigations pending or overtly threatened against any Loan
Party in any court or before any Governmental Authority or arbitration board or
tribunal which question the validity or legality of or seek damages in
connection with any Loan Document or any action taken or to be taken pursuant to
any Loan Document and no order or judgment has been issued or entered
restraining or enjoining any Loan Party from the execution, delivery or
performance of any Loan Document nor is there any action or proceeding which
involves a probable risk of an adverse determination which would have any such
effect; nor is there any other action or proceeding filed or (to the knowledge
of any Loan Party) investigation pending or overtly threatened against any Loan
Party in any court or before any Governmental Authority or arbitration board or
tribunal which involves a probable risk of a material adverse decision which
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or
materially to restrict the ability of any Loan Party to comply with its
obligations under any Loan Document.

            (b) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any law, rule or regulation, or in default with respect to any
judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority, where such
violation or default would reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.07. Federal Reserve Regulations.

            (a) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

            (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for
any purpose which entails a violation of, or which is inconsistent with, the
provisions of the Margin Regulations.

            SECTION 3.08. Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company

            SECTION 3.09. Use of Proceeds. All proceeds of the Loans shall be
used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including capital

            SECTION 6.04. Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent any consolidation of the Borrower
with, or merger of the Borrower into, another corporation or corporations
(whether or not affiliated with the Borrower), or successive consolidations or
mergers to which the Borrower or its successor or successors shall be a party or
parties, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of the Borrower
(including stock of Subsidiaries) as an entirety or substantially as an entirety
to any other corporation (whether or not affiliated with the Borrower)
authorized to acquire and own or operate the same; provided, however, that the
Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that, upon any such consolidation, merger,
sale or conveyance, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and
interest on all the Loans and the due and punctual performance and observance of
all the covenants and conditions of this Agreement to be performed or observed
by the Borrower shall be expressly assumed, by one or more agreements,
reasonably satisfactory in form to the Required Lenders, executed and delivered
to the Paying Agent by the corporation formed by such consolidation, or into
which the Borrower shall have been merged, or which shall have acquired such
property. In the case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and
following such an assumption by the successor corporation, such successor
corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Borrower, with the same
effect as if it had been named herein.

            SECTION 6.05. Actions Limiting Amounts Permitted to be
Guaranteed.(a) The Borrower will not permit the Telecorp Guarantors or the
Tritel Guarantors to make or engage in any Restricted Payment or create, incur,
assume or permit to exist any Indebtedness (as such terms are defined in the
Telecorp Indentures and the Tritel Indentures, respectively), that would reduce
the aggregate amount (the "Guaranteed Amount") of the Indebtedness under this
Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement that would be permitted under the
covenants contained in such Indentures to be guaranteed by the Subsidiary
Guarantee Agreement, other than Indebtedness permitted by Section 6.02(b)(i) and
other than Restricted Payments and Indebtedness (in each instance created after
the date hereof) that in the aggregate would reduce the Guaranteed Amount by not
more than $100,000,000 for each of (a) the Telecorp Guarantors and (b) the
Tritel Guarantors from that which the Guaranteed Amount would have been but for
such Restricted Payments or Indebtedness . The Borrower will not permit the
Telecorp Guarantors or the Tritel Guarantors to enter into any amendments to or
modifications of the Telecorp Indentures or the Tritel Indentures that could
have the effect of limiting or reducing the aggregate amount of the Indebtedness
under this Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement


                                       47
<PAGE>

guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement.

      in respect of Material Financial Obligations when due or within any
      applicable grace period; or the occurrence of any event or condition that
      results in the acceleration of the maturity of Material Indebtedness;

            (i) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate
      amount in excess of $150,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower,
      any Significant Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall
      remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which
      execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally
      taken by a judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the
      Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary to enforce any such judgment;

            (j) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, when taken together
      with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, would reasonably be
      expected to result in a liability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
      an aggregate amount exceeding $150,000,000;

            (k) the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement shall cease to be, or shall

      binding and enforceable obligation of each Loan Party that is party
      thereto; or

            (l) the existence of any DoCoMo Repurchase Obligation, unless the
      Borrower is in pro forma compliance with Sections 6.02 and 6.03 of this
      Agreement (with such DoCoMo Repurchase Obligation being treated for
      purposes of testing such pro forma compliance as Indebtedness) as at and
      for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the
      most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements for the Borrower
      and its Consolidated Subsidiaries have been delivered under Section
      5.02(a) or (b), determined as if such DoCoMo Repurchase Obligation, any
      payment that shall have been made in respect thereof and any related
      incurrence of Indebtedness had occurred as of the first day of such four
      fiscal quarter period;

then, and in every such event (other than an event described in paragraph (f) or
(g) above), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the
Paying Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, by notice to the
Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different
times: (i) terminate forthwith the Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans then
outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued

contrary notwithstanding; and, in any event with respect to the Borrower
described in

accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   The Agents

            In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, JPMCB is hereby appointed to act as Paying Agent on behalf of the
Lenders and Issuing Banks, and JPMCB and Bank of America, N.A. are hereby
appointed to act as Administrative Agents on behalf of the Lenders and Issuing
Banks. Each of the Lenders and Issuing Banks hereby authorizes each Agent to
take such actions on behalf of such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to such Agent by the
terms and provisions hereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. The Paying Agent is hereby expressly authorized
by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on
behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks all payments of principal of and
interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and
promptly to distribute to each Lender or any Issuing Bank its proper share of
each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to
the Borrower of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the
Paying Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency
hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial
statements and other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement as received by the Paying Agent. It is understood that the Agents
shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth
herein.

            Neither any Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or
agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them
except for its or his own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be
responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents
of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or
to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower of
any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. No Agent shall be responsible to the Lenders for the due execution,
genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement or
other instruments or agreements. Each Agent may deem and treat the Lender which
makes any Loan as the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all
purposes hereof until, in the case of the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender or, in the case of any other Agent, such
Agent shall have received notice from the Paying Agent that it received such
notice from such Lender, in each case, given as provided herein, of the transfer
thereof. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (or when expressly required hereby, all the Lenders) and,
except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any
action or inaction pursuant thereto shall


                                       50
<PAGE>

be binding on all the Lenders. Each Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to
the contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or document believed by it
in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons. Neither any Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of
the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its
obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in
performance or breach by any other Lender or the Borrower of any of their
respective obligations hereunder or in connection herewith. Each Agent may
execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents appointed in good
faith by such Agent or employees of any thereof and shall be entitled to rely
upon the advice of legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters
arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

            The Lenders hereby acknowledge that each Agent shall be under no
duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do
so by the Required Lenders.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Paying
Agent as provided below, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation of the
Paying Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Paying Agent acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Paying Agent gives notice of its resignation,
then the retiring Paying Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Banks, appoint a successor Paying Agent which shall be a bank with an office in
New York, New York, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as a Paying Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Paying Agent and the retiring Paying Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent.

            With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, any Agent in its
individual capacity and not as an Agent shall have the same rights and powers as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and
each Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent.

            Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Paying Agent, on demand, in
the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment hereunder) of any
expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by such Agent, including
reasonable counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed
by the Borrower, and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and any of
its directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such
pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions,


                                       51
<PAGE>

judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its
capacity as an Agent or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this
Agreement to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower;
provided that no Lender shall be liable to any Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

            Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Lenders
acknowledges that Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation and Citibank, N.A. have no
responsibilities or obligations pursuant to this Agreement in their capacity as
syndication agents.

Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided, however, that (i)

Federal Reserve Bank, the Borrower must give its prior written consent to such
assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) in the case
of an assignment made by a Lender to a Person other than a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Paying Agent)
shall not be less than $5,000,000 (or the remaining balance of its Commitment)
and the amount of the Commitment of such Lender remaining after such assignment
shall not be less than $5,000,000 or shall be zero, (iii) the parties to each
such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Paying Agent an Assignment and

in full in accordance with this Agreement.

            (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, (ii)
except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, or

hereto or the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee
represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such

<PAGE>

into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and

time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each Agent to
take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that
it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

            (d) The Paying Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in the
City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error
and the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and each Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee together with an Administrative
Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) above and, if required, the written consent of the Borrower to
such assignment, the Paying Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.

            (f) Each Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, any of the
Agents, or any Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) each participating
bank or other entity shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection
provisions contained in Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 2.21 to the same extent as if it
was the selling Lender, except that all claims and petitions for payment and
payments made pursuant to such Sections shall be made through such selling
Lender, and (iv) the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such selling Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
such Lender shall retain the sole right (and participating banks or other
entities shall have no right) to enforce the obligations of the Borrower
relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers
decreasing any fees payable hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate
at which interest is payable on


                                       55
<PAGE>

the Loans, or extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for
the payment of interest on the Loans).

            (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 10.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by
or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, each
such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute
an agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree (subject to
customary exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of any such confidential
information relating to the Borrower.

            (h) The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its respective
rights and duties hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders and
any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void.

            (i) Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
pledge shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such Bank for such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes in the form of Exhibit E hereto evidencing the Loans made to the
Borrower by the assigning Lender hereunder.

            SECTION 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity.

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by any Agent, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel for the Agents, in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein and the preparation and administration
of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the
provisions hereof, and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with this Agreement or the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of a single counsel
for the Agents, the Lenders or any Issuing Bank.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agents, each Issuing Bank
and each Lender, their respective Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents (each such person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their respective
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans


                                       56
<PAGE>

or Letters of Credit (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee.

            (c) The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain operative and
in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any
Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable
on written demand therefor.

            (d) All out-of-pocket expenses that any Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of (a), (b), (c) or (d) of Section 2.17 but that are not
included in the calculations made pursuant to the second and third sentences of
Section 2.17, shall be included in the amount or amounts payable to such Lender
and in the manner provided pursuant to this Section 10.05.

            SECTION 9.06. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

            SECTION 9.07. Waivers; Amendment.

            (a) No failure or delay of any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender
in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the
Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case
shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that
no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the
maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of
any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement, or waive or excuse any such payment
or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan or LC

10.04(h), the provisions of this Section or the definition of the "Required
Lenders", or (iv) release all or substantially all the guarantors under the

or Issuing Bank, as the case may be. Each Lender shall be bound by any waiver,
amendment or modification authorized by this Section and any consent by any
Lender pursuant to this Section shall bind any assignee of its rights and
interests hereunder.

            SECTION 9.08. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, any promissory notes
issued hereunder, and the Fee Letter constitute the entire contract among the
parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this
Agreement and the Fee Letter. Nothing in this Agreement or the Fee Letter
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the
parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement or the Fee Letter.

            SECTION 9.09. Severability. In the event any one or more of the

remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to
replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions
the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

            SECTION 9.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which
when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 10.03.

            SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of

consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.12. Jurisdiction, Etc.

            (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the


                                       58

judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New
York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

            SECTION 9.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY), EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

            FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), hereby promises to pay to the order of
[Name of Lender] (the "Lender"), at the office of JPMorgan Chase Bank (the

            The Borrower hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest
and notice of any kind whatsoever. The nonexercise by the holder of any of its
rights hereunder in any particular instance shall not constitute a waiver
thereof in that or any subsequent instance.

prepayments of the principal hereof and interest hereon and the respective dates
and maturity dates thereof shall be endorsed by the holder hereof on the

such holder in its internal records; provided, however, that the failure of the
holder to make such a notation or any error in such a notation shall not affect
the obligations of the Borrower under this Note.

            The Loans evidenced hereby are Loans referred to in the Credit
Agreement, which, among other things, contains provisions for the acceleration
of the maturity thereof upon the happening of certain events, for optional and
mandatory prepayment of the principal thereof prior to the maturity thereof and
for the amendment or waiver of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, all
upon the terms and conditions therein specified.
