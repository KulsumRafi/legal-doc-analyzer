                               PURCHASE AGREEMENT



To each of the Purchasers on Schedule A


Ladies and Gentlemen:

         NTL Communications Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
proposes to issue and sell to the purchasers listed in Schedule A (the
"Purchasers"), $558,249,000 principal amount of its 19% Senior Secured Notes due
2010 (together with any pay-in-kind notes issued by the Company in respect of
cash interest otherwise due and payable on any Initial Notes, the "Initial
Notes") upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this letter
(the "Agreement"). Immediately after the Closing, on the Effective Date, the
Company will be re-named "NTL Incorporated."

         The Initial Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the
"Indenture"), substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A, to be dated as of
January 10, 2003 by and among the Company, the guarantors listed on the
signature pages to this Agreement (the "Guarantors") and U.S. Bank National
Association, a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and
will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each of the Guarantors other than the
Subordinated Guarantor, whose guaranty will be subordinated as provided in
Section 13 of this Agreement (the "Guaranties"). The term "NTL Companies" means
all of the Subsidiaries of the Company.

         In addition, on the Closing Date the Company shall issue and sell to
the Purchasers, in the aggregate, 500,000 shares of the Common Stock of the
Company, $0.01 par value per share, (the "Shares" and, collectively with the
Initial Notes, the "Securities"), together with associated Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock Purchase Rights under the Company's Stockholders
Rights Plan, dated as of the Effective Date, between the Company and Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Rights").

         The proceeds from the issuance of the Securities will be used, among
other things, to consummate a second amended joint plan of reorganization (the
"Reorganization Plan") confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York by the Debtors on September 5, 2002, including,
without limitation, to repay in full the DIP Facility Claim, purchase the
Delaware/NTL (UK) Group Note, pay transaction costs related to consummation of
the Reorganization Plan and to provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with
working capital.

         Holders of the Initial Notes will be entitled to the benefits of an
Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit B (the "Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement"), pursuant to
which, among other things, (a) the Company will, under the circumstances
described in the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, exchange the
Initial Notes for certain exchange notes of the Company (the "Exchange Notes,"
together with the Initial Notes and any pay-in-kind notes issued by the Company
in respect of cash interest otherwise due and payable on any Exchange Notes, the
"Notes"), which are identical in all material respects to the Initial Notes
(except that the Exchange Notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer
restrictions or Special Interest), which will be registered pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and (b) the Company will, under certain
circumstances described in the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, file
with the Commission shelf

registration statements pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), covering the resale of the Initial Notes.
Holders of the Shares will also be entitled to the benefits of a Registration
Rights Agreement, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C (the
"Equity Registration Rights Agreement"), providing certain registration rights
with respect to the Shares.

Senior Guarantor, (d) among BG Subsidiaries,  or (e) among DT Subsidiaries) that

the NTL Companies  will be in default,  and no forbearance of default will be in
effect as of the Closing Date, in the payment of the principal of or interest on

Existing  Indebtedness  of the  Company or any of the NTL  Companies  that would
permit (or that with notice,  lapse of time or both, would permit) any person to
cause such  Existing  Indebtedness  to become due and payable  before its stated
maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment, in each case, that,
individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect or that would, if such default had occurred after
the Closing Date,  create a Default or an Event of Default under the  Indenture.
Except as set forth on  Schedule  1.14  neither  the  Company nor any of the NTL
Companies  has agreed or  consented  to cause or permit in the future  (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property or assets,  whether
now  owned  or  hereafter  acquired,  to be  subject  to a lien  that  would  be
prohibited  by the  Indenture if incurred  after the  Closing,  other than liens
provided  under  the  terms  of joint  venture  agreements  or other  agreements

obligations under the Intercompany Receivable in favor of any person.

Diamond Cable Notes immediately prior to the consummation of the  Reorganization
Plan.

proceedings pending by or before any Governmental Authority to which the Company
or any of the NTL Companies or of which any property or assets of the Company or
any of the  NTL  Companies  is  the  subject  which,  (a)  singularly  or in the
aggregate,  if determined  adversely to the Company or any of the NTL Companies,
could  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect or (b) question
the validity or enforceability of any of the Transaction Documents or any action
taken or to be taken  pursuant  to the  Transaction  Documents;  and to the best
knowledge of the Company and each of the  Guarantors,  no such  proceedings  are
threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or by others.

Applicable Law or order has been enacted,  adopted or issued by any Governmental
Authority  which prevents the issuance of the Securities or suspends the sale of
the Securities in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any of the Guarantors
operates;  no injunction,  restraining order or order of any nature by any court

violation in respect of NTL Companies  which are not Guarantors  which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  (b) in default in any
respect,  and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would  constitute  such a default,  in the due  performance or observance of any
term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
loan  agreement or other debt  agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which it is bound or to which any of its property or assets is subject, other

restatement  of the Senior  Facilities  to take  effect  from or by the  Closing
Date), singularly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (c) in violation in any respect of any Applicable Law or order

are subject,  other than any such  violation as could not,  singularly or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     1.18  Licenses,  Permits,  etc.  The Company and each of the NTL  Companies
possess or operate under all licenses, certificates,  authorizations and permits
issued by, and have made all  declarations  and filings  with,  all  appropriate

Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations
thereunder  ("ERISA"),  which  is  maintained  by  the  Company  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries  or to which the  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  contributes
(each,  a  "Plan";  collectively  the  "Plans")  to comply  with the  applicable
requirements  of  ERISA  and  the  Code  other  than  any  such  failures  that,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  have not had and  would not  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  There is no material pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  threatened  litigation
relating  to the Plans.  Neither the  Company  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has
engaged in a  transaction  with  respect to any Plan that,  assuming the taxable
period  of such  transaction  expired  as of the date of this  Agreement,  could
subject the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  to a tax or penalty  imposed by
either  Section  4975 of the Code or  Section  502(i) of ERISA  other than those
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 1.26, no liability  under Subtitle C
or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is  expected to be incurred by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  with  respect  to any  ongoing,  frozen or
terminated "single-employer  plan,"  within the  meaning of Section  4001(a)
(15)of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-
employer plan of any entity  which is considered one employer with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries  under  Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code(an "ERISA Affiliate").  Except as set forth in Schedule 1.26, neither the
Company,  any of its  Subsidiaries  nor an ERISA  Affiliate has  contributed to
a  "multiemployer plan,"  within the  meaning of Section  3(37) of ERISA,  at
any time on or after December  31, 1997.  No notice of a  "reportable  event,"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day  reporting
requirement  has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA ("Pension Plan") or by any  ERISA  Affiliate  within  the  12-month
period  ending on the date of this Agreement.

      (c)  Neither  any  Pension  Plan nor any  single-employer  plan of an
ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the  meaning  of Section  412 of the Code or  Section  302 of ERISA and
no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.  Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries  has provided,  or is required to provide,  security to
any Pension Plan or to any  single-employer  plan of an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

      (d) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer defined benefit
plan (within the meaning of Section  3(35) of ERISA),  as of the last day of
the most recent  plan year ended  prior to the date of this  Agreement,  the
actuarially determined  present  value of all "benefit  liabilities,"  within
the meaning of Section  4001(a)(16)  of ERISA (as determined on a plan
termination  and on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the
Plan's most recent actuarial valuation),  did not exceed the then  current
value of the assets of such Plan, and there has been no material  change in the
financial  condition of such Plan since the last day of the most recent plan
year.

      (e) Neither the Company nor any of the NTL  Companies  has any
obligations for  retiree  health  and life  insurance  benefits  under any
Plan,  except as required by Applicable Law, rule or regulation or as set forth
in Schedule 1.26. Except as set forth on Schedule 1.26, the Company or the
Subsidiaries may amend or  terminate  any such Plan  under  the terms of such
Plan at any time  without incurring any liability under such Plan.

unreasonably  small amount of capital  with which to conduct its business  after

through any agent, made any offer or sale,  solicited offers to buy or otherwise
negotiated in respect of any of the Shares or the Notes or any securities of the

moratorium and other similar laws affecting  creditors'  rights generally and by
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law), (d) it is not a party to any contract,  agreement or  understanding  other
than this  Agreement  with any  person  that  would  give rise to a valid  claim

such Purchaser is to hold these  securities for a deferred sale or for any fixed
period in the future and (h) it can  afford to bear such  economic  risk and can
afford to suffer the complete loss of its investment under this Agreement.  Each

                                                              Purchase Agreement

accompanied  by a  certificate  signed  on behalf  of the  Company  by the chief
executive  officer,   chief  financial  officer,  chief  accounting  officer  or
treasurer to the foregoing  effect;  provided,  however,  that if the Company is
then subject to the reporting  requirements under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of
the  Exchange  Act,  the  delivery  by the  Company  to such  Purchaser  or such
Subsequent  Purchaser of a quarterly  report on Form 10-Q or any successor  form
within the time periods above described  shall satisfy the  requirements of this
Section 8.1(a).

     (b) Annual  Statements.  As soon as available,  but in any event within the
time periods  permitted for filing annual reports on Form 10-K by the Commission
after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, duplicate copies of:

            (i)  an audited  consolidated  balance sheet of the Company as at
                 the end of such year, and

            (ii) consolidated  statements of income or  operations,
                 stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company for such
                 year,

in each case setting forth in comparative  form the figures for the prior fiscal
year,  all in  reasonable  detail,  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP,  fairly
presenting,  in all material  respects,  the financial position of the companies
being  reported on and their  results of operations  and cash flows,  subject to
changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments, and accompanied by:

          (A) an opinion thereon of independent  certified public accountants of
     recognized  national  standing,  which  opinion  (i) shall  state that such
     consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
     the  financial  position of the  companies  being  reported  upon and their
     results of  operations  and cash flows and have been prepared in conformity
     with GAAP, and that the examination of such  accountants in connection with
     such financial  statements (other than  consolidating  statements) has been
     made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United
     States, and that such audit provides a reasonable basis for such opinion in
     the  circumstances,  and (ii) shall not  contain a "going  concern" or like
     qualification,  or any exception or other qualification  arising out of the
     scope of the audit,

          (B)  a  written   statement  by  the  independent   certified   public
     accountants  giving the report thereon stating whether,  in connection with
     their audit examination,  any condition or event that constitutes a Default
     or Event of Default with respect to the covenants contained in Section 5.02
     and Section 5.04 of the Indenture has come to their  attention and, if such
     a condition or event has come to their attention, specifying the nature and
     period  of  existence  of such  condition  or  event;  provided  that  such
     accountants  shall  not be  liable  by  reason  of any  failure  to  obtain
     knowledge  of any such  Default  or  Event of  Default  that  would  not be
     disclosed in the course of their audit  examination;  provided further that
     if the Company's nationally recognized "big four" accounting firm does not,
     as a matter of firm policy,  provide  such  statements,  no such  statement
     under this clause (B) will be required, and

          (C) a certificate of the chief financial  officer,  treasurer or chief
     executive  officer on behalf of the  Company  stating  that such  financial
     statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP  applicable  to
     periodic financial statements generally and fairly present, in all material
     respects,  the financial  position of the companies  being  reported on and
     their results of operations and income, retained earnings

          and stockholders' equity, and cash flows;  provided,  however, that if
          the  Company  is then  subject  to the  reporting  requirements  under
          Section 13 or 15(d) of the  Exchange  Act, the delivery by the Company
          to such Purchaser or such Subsequent  Purchaser of an Annual Report on
          Form  10-K  or any  successor  form  within  the  time  periods  above
          described shall satisfy the requirements of this Section 8.1(b).

behalf of the Company by an authorized  financial  officer of the Company (i)

reasonable detail of the  transactions  and  condition  of the Company and each
of the NTL  Companies during the fiscal  quarter or year, as the case may be,
and that the signer does not have  knowledge  of the  existence  and
continuance  as at the date of such certificate of any condition or event which

exists, specifying the nature and period of existence of such condition or
event and what action the Company has taken or is taking or proposes to take
with respect to such  condition or event and (ii) if not specified in the
quarterly and annual  financial  statements  referred to above,  the aggregate
amount of interest paid or accrued by the Company and the NTL Companies on a

period.

               (d) Promptly upon receipt thereof, copies of all final reports
submitted to the  Company  or to any of its  subsidiaries  by  independent
certified  public accountants  in  connection  with each annual,  interim or

connection  with their annual audit.

               (e)  Promptly  upon  their  becoming  available,  copies  of all
financial statements,  reports,  notices  and  proxy  statements  sent
generally  to  its securityholders  by the Company or any of the NTL  Companies
and all regular and periodic reports and all registration statements and final

additional  financial and other information  as any  Purchasers or Subsequent
Purchasers  may from time to time reasonably request.

               (f)  Promptly,  but in any event  within five (5)  Business
Days,  after a officer of the Company becomes aware of the existence of any
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture or that any person has given
any notice or taken any other  action with  respect to a claimed  Default or
Event of Default  under the Indenture,  a  written  notice  of the  claimed
Default  or  Event  of  Default specifying the nature and existence of such
claimed  Default or Event of Default and what action the  Company is taking
or proposes to take with  respect to the claimed Default or Event of Default.

               (g) As promptly as reasonably  practicable and in any event no

Notes (as may be refinanced)  or the Triangle Notes (as may be  refinanced),
copies of all other financial statements,  reports or projections with respect
to the Company or its Subsidiaries  which are  broader in scope or on a more
frequent  basis than the Company  is  required  to  provide  under  this
Agreement;  provided  that this requirement shall not apply to any information
prepared or compiled in relation to the Company and its  Subsidiaries  by a
third party  acting for and on behalf of, and appointed  by, a Person other
than the Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company and who is not an affiliate
of, or otherwise acting in concert with,

     the Company;  provided,  further that (A) only if the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries  receives,  views,  becomes  aware  of  the  content  of or is
     otherwise  provided  access  to  such  information,  or any  part  of  such
     information,  the Company  shall,  or shall cause its  Subsidiaries  to use
     their  commercially  reasonable  efforts to provide such information to the
     Purchasers,  and (B) subject to clause (A) above, the Purchasers  shall, at
     all times,  be promptly  furnished  with copies of the Monthly  Performance
     Update  Report  prepared by the  Reporting  Accountants  (as defined in the
     Senior Credit  Facility)  pursuant to the Senior  Facilities as in force at
     the Closing  Date;  provided that the  Reporting  Accountants  or the Agent
     under the Senior  Facilities  may  require  the  deletion  of  confidential
     information  from the  Monthly  Performance  Update  Report  which has been
     provided  by the  Reporting  Accountants  to the  lenders  under the Senior
     Facilities to be provided to the Holders. On request by the third party who
     prepared or compiled such  information,  each of the  Purchasers  agrees to
     sign any reasonable  "hold harmless"  letter,  non-disclosure  agreement or
     other similar letter or agreement  reasonably  required by such Person as a
     condition precedent to receiving any such information as aforesaid.

              (h) At any time a Purchaser  may notify the  Company  that it
     does not want to receive  any form of information under this Section 8,
     and upon receipt of such notice the Company  will no longer  provide (or
     be required to provide)  such  information  (for the period,  if any,
     provided in such notice).

         8.2   Confidentiality.
               ---------------

               (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this Section 8.2,
each Purchaser agrees that it will not disclose without the prior consent of
the Company (other than to its employees, auditors, advisors or counsel or to
another Purchaser if the Purchaser or such Purchaser's holding or parent
company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have
access to such information; provided such Persons shall agree to be subject to
the provisions of this Section 8.2 to the same extent as such Purchaser) any
nonpublic information which is now or in the future furnished or made available
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; provided that any
Purchaser may disclose any such information (i) as has become generally
available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of this Section 8.2(a)
by such Purchaser or any other Person to whom such Purchaser has provided such
information as permitted by this Section 8.2, (ii) as may be required or
appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal,
state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over
such Purchaser or to the Commission or similar organizations (whether in the
United States of America or elsewhere) or their successors, (iii) as may be
required or appropriate in respect of any summons or subpoena or in connection
with any litigation, (iv) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or
ruling applicable to such Purchaser and (v) to any prospective or actual
Subsequent Purchaser in connection with any contemplated transfer of any of
the Notes by such Purchaser; provided that such prospective Subsequent
Purchaser agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in
this Section 8.2.

               (b) The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
Purchaser may share with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share
with such Purchaser, any information related to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any nonpublic information
regarding the creditworthiness of the Company and its subsidiaries); provided
such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2 to the
same extent as such Purchaser.

   9. COVENANT REGARDING BOOKS AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS.

      The Company and each of the  Guarantors  will keep  complete  and
accurate books and  records of their  transactions  in  accordance  with good
accounting practices  on the basis of GAAP  applied

                                                              Purchase Agreement

on  a  consistent  basis  (including  the   establishment   and  maintenance  of
appropriate  reserves).  Until the  occurrence  of a Note  Registration,  to the
extent  reasonably  required in connection with any resale of the Notes and upon
reasonable  notice and,  at any time,  at the  reasonable  request of any of the
Purchasers so long as such Purchaser is a Holder,  the Company shall,  and shall
cause  its   subsidiaries  to,  subject  to  compliance  with  Applicable  Laws,
confidentiality   obligations  to  third   parties,   (x)  give  each  Purchaser
participating  in any sales (or placement agent or underwriter  participating in
such  resale) and their  authorized  representatives  reasonable  access  during
normal business hours to all contracts, books, records,  personnel,  offices and
other  facilities and  properties of the Company and the NTL Companies,  and (y)
permit each Purchaser (and any such sales or placement agent or any underwriter)
to make such copies and  inspections as such  Purchaser may reasonably  request;
provided,  however,  that no investigation or information  furnished pursuant to
this  Section 9 shall  affect  any  representations  or  warranties  made by the
Company  herein  or the  conditions  to the  obligations  of the  Purchasers  to
consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Any such visit will
be  at  the  expense  of  such  Purchaser  (or  sales  or  placement   agent  or
underwriter),  as the case may be, unless there is an occurrence and continuance
of an Event of Default  under either  Indenture (in which case at the expense of
the Company).

        10. PROVISIONS RELATING TO RESALES.

            10.1 Private Offerings.  The Company,  on the one hand, and the
Purchasers, on the  other  hand,  agree  that the  following  provisions  will
apply to any offering by any of the  Purchasers of some or all of the Notes or
Shares without registration under the Securities Act:

               (a) Offers and Sales only to Institutional  Accredited  Investors
          or QIBs.  Offers and sales of the Notes or Shares will be made only by
          the Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates who are qualified
          to do so in the  jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are made.
          Each such  offer or sale  shall  only be made (i) to  persons  who the
          offeror or seller  reasonably  believes to be QIBs,  (ii) to a limited
          number of other Institutional Accredited Investors that are Accredited
          Investors  who are not  QIBs or (iii)  non-U.S.  persons  outside  the
          United States to whom offers and sales of the  Securities  may be made
          in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act.

               (b) No General  Solicitation.  The Securities  will be offered by
          approaching  prospective Subsequent Purchasers on an individual basis.
          No general  solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of
          Rule  502(c)  under the  Securities  Act)  will be used in the  United
          States and no directed  selling  efforts (as defined in  Regulation S)
          will be made outside the United States in connection with the offering
          of the Securities.

               (c) Purchases by Non-Bank Fiduciaries.  In the case of a non-bank
          Subsequent  Purchaser  acting  as a  fiduciary  for one or more  third
          parties,  in  connection  with an  offer  and  sale to such  purchaser
          pursuant  to  this  Section  10,  such  third   parties  shall  be  an
          Institutional  Accredited  Investor  or a  QIB  or a  non-U.S.  person
          outside the United States.

               (d)  Restrictions  on  Transfer.  Upon  original  issuance by the
          Company  and until such time as the same is no longer  required  under
          the applicable  requirements of the Securities Act, (i) the Notes (and
          all securities issued in exchange for the Notes or in substitution for
          the Notes, other than the Exchange Notes) shall bear such legend as is
          required  under  Appendix A to the Indenture and (ii) the Shares shall
          bear such legend as is set forth on Exhibit G to this Agreement.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>


                    (e) No Future Liability.  Following the sale of the Notes or
     Shares by the  Purchasers to any Subsequent  Purchaser  pursuant to the
     terms of this Agreement, the Purchasers shall not be liable or responsible
     to the Company for any losses, damages or liabilities suffered or incurred
     by the Company, including any losses,  damages or  liabilities  under the
     Securities  Act, arising  from  or  relating  to any  resale  or  transfer
     of any  Security previously sold by the Purchaser in compliance with this
     Section 10.

            10.2     Certain Agreements.

                     (a) The Company shall, and the Company shall cause the
Guarantors which are a party to the Exchange and  Registration  Rights
Agreement to, comply with all provisions and obligations of the Exchange and
Registration Rights Agreement and comply with all applicable  federal and state
securities laws in connection with that agreement.

                     (b) The Company shall comply with all provisions and
obligations of the Equity Registration Rights Agreement and comply with all
applicable federal and state securities laws in connection with that agreement.

           10.3  Syndication  Assistance.  At any time after the Closing Date,
so long as the Purchasers and their  Affiliates hold Notes purchased  pursuant
to this Agreement and not subsequently sold and reacquired  representing in the
aggregate at least $150 million in principal amount due at maturity:

                (a) The Company will, if reasonably requested by the
Purchasers, assist the Purchasers in completing any private  resale (a
"Private  Offering") of at least $75  million  principal  amount of Notes,
but in no event more than two Private Offerings  and in no  event  more  than
once in any  six-month period,  by the Purchasers of the Notes in accordance
with the  Purchasers' intended method of distribution  provided that the
Purchasers  shall comply with all  restrictions applicable to the transfer of
the Notes under the Indenture and under applicable federal and state
securities laws.  If any Purchasers  request  assistance to complete a Private
Offering, the Company will notify the other Purchasers of the Private Offering
and the other Purchasers shall be entitled to receive the same assistance
received by the initially  requesting  Purchasers from the Company in the
Private Offering. Such  assistance  by the Company  may, in any such case,
include the following:

               (i)   the Company's using  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
          the end that the distribution  efforts benefit from the Company's
          existing lending relationships;

               (ii)  using  commercially reasonable efforts  to direct  contact
          between the Company's senior management and advisors and prospective
          purchasers to enable them  to conduct their due diligence
          investigation;

               (iii)  responding  to  reasonable  inquiries  of,  and  providing
          answers  to, each  prospective  purchaser  who so  inquires  about the
          Company and any of the Guarantors  (to the extent such  information is
          available  or  can be  acquired  and  made  available  to  prospective
          purchasers without commercially  unreasonable effort or expense and to
          the extent the  provision of such  information  is not  prohibited  by
          Applicable  Law or applicable  confidentiality  restrictions)  and the
          terms and conditions of the applicable distribution;

               (iv) if  requested  by the  Purchasers  in  connection  with  any
          Private Offering,  using commercially reasonable efforts to prepare an
          offering memorandum (the

     "Offering Memorandum") to the extent required by paragraph (c) or (d) below
     of this Section 10.3 and other  materials to be used in connection with the
     distribution  (including  assistance in completion of the Purchasers',  any
     sales or  placement  agent's,  if any,  or in the  case of an  underwritten
     offering,  the lead  manager's and  co-managers'  reasonable  due diligence
     review of the Company and the Guarantors as an aid to such preparation);

          (v)  using  commercially   reasonable  efforts  to  host  meetings  of
     prospective  purchasers,  appropriate  in number for the size and nature of
     proposed offerings;

          (vi) using  commercially  reasonable  efforts to promptly  prepare and
     provide  to  the  Purchasers  (or  any  sales  or  placement  agent  of the
     Purchasers and any initial  purchaser of them) all information with respect
     to the Company as the  Purchasers  (or any sales or placement  agent of the
     Purchasers  and any  underwriter  of  them)  may  reasonably  request;  any
     projections  made  available to the  Purchasers (or each placement or sales
     agent, if any, of the Purchasers and each underwriter,  if any, of them) by
     the  Company or any of its  representatives  will be prepared in good faith
     based upon assumptions  believed in good faith to be reasonable;  provided,
     however,  that in no  event  shall  the  Company  be  required  to give any
     representations or warranties with respect to such projections; and

          (vii) if requested by the  Purchasers,  take  commercially  reasonable
     actions  necessary to enable  Standard & Poor's Rating  Services,  Inc. and
     Moody's Investors Service,  Inc. to provide their respective credit ratings
     of the Notes;

provided, that nothing contained in this Section 10.3(a) shall require the
Company or any of the Guarantors to take any actions that would (i) unreasonably
interfere with or disrupt their businesses or operations, provided that this
limitation shall not limit the Company from taking such action for more than 90
days; (ii) interfere with or disrupt any securities offering by the Company;
(iii) require the Company and its Subsidiaries to incur any significant expense;
(iv) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to provide any non-public
information to any third party unless such third party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company; or (v)
be required to take any actions that would result in any Private Offering being
deemed a public offering under the Securities Act.

         (b) The Company will allow the Purchasers (or any sales or placement
agent of the Purchasers or, in the case of an underwritten  offering, the lead
manager and co-managers of the underwritten  offering,  in each case, as may be
selected by the Purchasers and is reasonably  acceptable to the Company), in
consultation with the  Company,  to manage  all  aspects  of the  distribution
of the Notes, including  decisions as to the selection of  institutions  to be
approached  and when they will be  approached,  when their  commitment  will be
accepted,  which institutions  will  participate,  the allocations of the
commitments  among the prospective  purchasers and the amount and distribution
of fees from the sellers among the prospective purchasers.

         (c) At the request of the Purchasers, in order to facilitate the
consummation of a Private Offering, the Company will prepare and deliver to
each Purchaser copies of an Offering Memorandum describing the terms of the
Notes proposed to be sold and of the Private Offering contemplated by such
resales and containing such other information customarily included in offering
memoranda for similar transactions. The Offering Memorandum for any Private
Offering will not, as of its date and as of the closing of such Private
Offering, include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements in the Offering
Memorandum, in

the light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were made,  not  misleading;
provided,  however,  that the  foregoing  shall  not apply to  statements  in or
omissions from the Offering  Memorandum  made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information  furnished to the Company in writing by any Purchaser expressly
for use in the Offering Memorandum. Without limiting the foregoing, the Offering
Memorandum for any offering will contain all the  information  specified in, and
meeting  the  requirements  of,  subsection  (d)(4)  of Rule  144A and all other
applicable  regulations.  Prior to distributing,  amending or supplementing  the
Offering  Memorandum in connection with any Private Offering,  the Company shall
furnish to the Purchasers a copy of each such proposed Offering  Memorandum,  or
amendment  or  supplement  to  the  Offering  Memorandum,  and,  allowing  for a
reasonable period of review by the Purchasers, the Company shall not distribute,
use or file the Offering Memorandum or any such proposed amendment or supplement
to which any Purchaser  selling Notes  pursuant to such Offering  Memorandum may
reasonably object.

     (d) If, prior to the  completion of the sale of the Notes by the Purchasers
in any Private Offering, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of
which it is necessary to amend or supplement the related Offering  Memorandum in
order  to  make  the  statements  in  the  Offering  Memorandum  not  contain  a
misstatement  of a material  fact or an omission of a material  fact required to
make  the  statements  in  the  Offering   Memorandum,   in  the  light  of  the
circumstances  when  the  Offering  Memorandum  is  delivered  to a  prospective
purchaser  and at the closing of the sale of the Notes  covered by the  Offering
Memorandum,  not  misleading or if, in the opinion of the  Purchasers or counsel
for the  Purchasers,  it is  otherwise  necessary  to  amend or  supplement  the
Offering  Memorandum to comply with  Applicable  Law, then the Company agrees to
promptly prepare,  and furnish at its own expense to the Purchasers,  amendments
or supplements to the Offering Memorandum so that the statements in the Offering
Memorandum as so amended or  supplemented  will not contain a misstatement  of a
material fact or an omission of a material fact required to make the  statements
in the Offering Memorandum,  in the light of the circumstances when the Offering
Memorandum  is delivered to a  prospective  purchaser  and at the closing of the
sale of such  Notes,  not  misleading  or so that the  Offering  Memorandum,  as
amended or supplemented, will comply with Applicable Law.

     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  during any 365-day period, the Company,
acting reasonably,  may choose not to comply with the provisions of this Section
10.3 for up to 2 periods  (each a  "Suspension  Period") of up to 90 days in the
aggregate  during any period of 360  consecutive  days, if there is a reasonable
likelihood  of  an  acquisition  or  business  combination,  material  financing
transaction  or  other  similar  transaction,   business  development  or  event
involving the Company that may require disclosure in the Offering  Memorandum or
otherwise to prospective  purchasers in connection with the  distribution of the
Notes and the Board of  Directors of the Company  determines  in the exercise of
its reasonable judgment that such disclosure is not in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders or that obtaining any financial statements relating
to an  acquisition  or  business  combination  required  to be  included  in the
Offering  Memorandum would be  impracticable.  In such a case, the Company shall
promptly  notify the Purchasers of the Suspension  Period,  such notice to state
the  Suspension  Period and to indicate  that it is a  "Suspension  Notice under
Section 10 of the Purchase Agreement." Such notice shall disclose, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the possible  acquisition or business  combination,
material   financing   transaction  or  other  similar   transaction,   business
development  or other  similar  event;  provided  that such notice  shall not be
required to disclose such possible acquisition or business combination, material
financing  transaction  or other similar  transaction,  business  development or
event if, as a direct  result of doing so,  the  Company  would be  required  by
Applicable  Law to  release  such  information  to the  market  and  the  public
generally when, in absence of disclosing such information to the Purchasers,  it
would  not  otherwise  be  required  by such  Applicable  Law to  disclose  such
information or if such disclosure would result in a breach of a  confidentiality
agreement  entered  into by the  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Upon the
acquisition or business  combination,  material  financing  transaction or other
similar  transaction,  business  development or event or the

availability  of the required  financial  statements  with respect to a possible
acquisition  or  business   combination,   the  Suspension  Period  shall  cease
immediately  and the Company  shall  promptly  comply with this Section 10.3 and
notify such  Purchasers that the use of the Offering  Memorandum,  as amended or
supplemented,  as applicable,  may commence or resume. The Company shall provide
sufficient  copies of the latest  version of such  Offering  Memorandum  to such
Purchasers.

     proceeding  relating to any of the  foregoing,  whether  based on contract,
     tort or other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party to
     the relevant Transaction Document;

provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that (i) such Indemnified Liabilities are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the Indemnitees or (ii)
such Indemnified Liabilities of a Purchaser result from disputes among such
Purchaser and one or more Purchasers. If and to the extent that the foregoing
undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company agrees to make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each
