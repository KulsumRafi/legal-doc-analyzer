all Seller's Product integrated into Buyer's firewall and/or VPN products, in
the aggregate over the twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Buyer will

(the "Stock Consideration" , and such price per share shall be referred to
herein as the "Stock Price").

                  The Stock Consideration shall be subject to the restrictions
of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). At

                  At Closing, Buyer shall deposit Two Hundred Thousand Dollars
($200,000) of the Stock Consideration with Wachovia Bank, National Association
(the "Escrow Agent"). The Stock Consideration deposited with the Escrow Agent

                  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event Buyer, its Affiliates, shareholders, employees or representatives

proceeding is based on any action or inaction of Seller with respect to amounts
owed to Synopsys by Seller for the procurement of software licenses from
Synopsys, claims of intellectual property rights infringement by Synopsys
against Seller, or any other Synopsys claims relating to the acts or omissions
of Seller ("Synopsys Action"), Buyer shall be entitled to deduct such amounts
from the Contingent Payment that will fully indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates,
shareholders, employees and representatives for their costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such Synopsys Action. Further, any amount of
Seller's accounts receivable set forth on Schedule 1.1(a) that remains

including water, sewer, telephone, electricity and gas service. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and Seller hereby specifically
agree that any Synopsys Action against Seller shall not be subject to this
Section 1.5 and any and all amounts which become due and payable on or after the
Closing Date with respect to any Synopsys Action shall be the sole liability of
Seller.

to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification or license is required for it to
conduct the Business and in which failure to obtain such qualification or
license would have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller does not own or
lease property or engage in any activity in any jurisdiction which might require

properly qualified to do business. Seller has no subsidiaries.

                  3.2 CORPORATE POWER. Seller has all requisite legal and
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and to carry out and
perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement.

its directors and stockholders necessary for the authorization, execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, has been taken. This Agreement is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance
with its terms.

                  3.4 NO VIOLATION. None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions provided for herein or
contemplated hereby, and the fulfillment by Seller of the terms hereof, will
(with or without notice or passage of time or both): (a) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Seller; (b) result in a default, give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration, or require any consent or approval under any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
loan, factoring arrangement, license, agreement, lease or other instrument or
obligation to which the Seller is a party or by which it or any of the Assets
may be bound; or (c) violate any law, judgment, order, writ,

                  3.6 ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. As of the Closing,
Seller will not have any material debts, liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, direct, indirect, perfected,
inchoate, unliquidated or otherwise and whether due or to become due) arising
out of transactions entered into on or prior to the Closing, or any transaction,
series of transactions, action or inaction occurring on or prior to the Closing,
or any state of facts or condition existing on or prior to the Closing
(regardless of when such liability or obligation is asserted), including, but
not limited to, liabilities or obligations on account of taxes or governmental
charges or penalties, interest or fines thereon or in respect thereof, except
(a) as and to the extent clearly and accurately reflected and accrued for or
reserved against in the Seller Balance Sheet, (b) for liabilities and
obligations arising after the date of the Seller Balance Sheet in the ordinary

(e) any increase or change (or offer or promise thereof, whether or not legally
binding) in salaries or other compensation or employee benefits with respect to

accurate list (Schedule 1.1(e)) of the Assumed Contracts. Seller has made
available to Buyer true and correct copies of the Assumed Contracts, and has
given, and will give, the agents, employees and representatives of Buyer access
to the originals of the Assumed Contracts. Seller represents and warrants with
respect to the Assumed Contracts that:

                           (a) the Assumed Contracts constitute valid and
legally binding obligations of the parties thereto and are enforceable in
accordance with their terms;

                           (b) each Assumed Contract constitutes the entire

                           (c) all obligations required to be performed by
Seller under the terms of the Assumed Contracts have been performed, no act or
omission has occurred or failed to occur which, with the giving of notice, the
lapse of time or both would constitute a default by Seller under the Assumed
Contracts, and each of such Assumed Contracts is now and will be upon and after
the Closing Date in full force and effect without default on the part of Seller;

                           (d) all consents required for the assignment and
assumption of each Assumed Contract by Buyer have been or will have been
obtained by Seller prior to the Closing; and

                           (e) the assignment of the Assumed Contracts to and
assumption of such Assumed Contracts by Buyer will not result in any penalty or
premium, or variation of the rights, remedies, benefits or obligations of any
party thereunder.

                  3.9 TITLE TO ASSETS. The Seller Balance Sheet reflects all of
the assets of Seller relating to the Business as of the date thereof. Seller has
good and marketable title to all of the Assets free and clear of all claims,
assessments, security interests, liens, restrictions and encumbrances, other

                  3.11 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. As of Closing, the sum of all of
Seller's accounts receivable set forth on Schedule 1.1(a) shall not be less than

lists, schematics, technology, know-how, computer software programs or
applications (in both source code and object code form), and tangible or
intangible proprietary information or material that are used in the Business as
currently conducted by Seller (the "Seller Intellectual Property Right(s)").
Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a complete list of all patents, trademarks,
copyrights, trade names and service marks, and any applications therefor
(whether registered or common law), included in the Seller Intellectual Property
Rights, and specifies, where applicable, the jurisdictions in which each such
Seller Intellectual Property Right has been issued or registered or in which an
application for such issuance and registration has been filed, including the
respective registration or application numbers and the names of all registered
owners.

                           (b) Schedule 3.13(b) sets forth a complete list of
all licenses, sublicenses and other agreements to which Seller is a party and
pursuant to which Seller or any other person is authorized to use any Seller
Intellectual Property Right (excluding object code end-user licenses granted to
end-users in the ordinary course of business that permit use of software
products without a right to modify, distribute or sublicense the same) or trade
secret of Seller, and includes the identity of all parties thereto, a
description of the nature and subject matter thereof, the applicable royalty or
other fees and the term thereof. Each license, sublicense and other agreement
related to the ongoing activities of the Business or the Assets will be
transferred or assigned to Buyer as of and effective upon the Closing. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the transfer or
assignment of the Seller Intellectual Property Rights, will neither cause Seller
to be in violation or default under any such license, sublicense or agreement,
nor entitle any other party to any such license, sublicense or agreement to
terminate or modify such license, sublicense or agreement. Except as set forth
in Schedules 3.13(a) and 3.13(b), Seller is the sole and exclusive owner or
licensee of, with all right, title and interest in and to (free and clear of any
liens or encumbrances), the Seller Intellectual Property Rights, and has sole

to any third party in respect thereof) to the use


<PAGE>

thereof or the material covered thereby in connection with the services or
products in respect of which the Seller Intellectual Property Rights are being
used.

                           (c) No claims with respect to the Seller Intellectual
Property Rights have been asserted or are, to Seller's knowledge, threatened by
any person, nor are there any valid grounds for any claims: (i) to the effect
that the manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any of the products of Seller
infringes on any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, trade secret or
other proprietary right; (ii) against the use by Seller of any trademarks,
service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights, mask works, patents,
technology, know-how or computer software programs and applications used in the
Business as currently conducted by Seller; or (iii) challenging the ownership by
Seller or the validity or effectiveness of any of the Seller Intellectual
Property Rights. All registered trademarks, service marks and copyrights held by
Seller relating to the Business are valid and subsisting. Seller has not
infringed, and the Business as currently conducted does not infringe, any
copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, trade secret or other proprietary
right of any third party. To the best of Seller's knowledge, there is no
material unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of the Seller
Intellectual Property Rights by any third party, including any employee or
former employee of Seller. No Seller Intellectual Property Right or product of
Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject to any outstanding decree, order,
judgment, or stipulation restricting in any manner the licensing thereof by
Seller. Each current employee, consultant or contractor and, to the best of
Seller's knowledge, each former employee, consultant or contractor of Seller has
executed a developments agreement, and a proprietary information and
confidentiality agreement substantially in Seller's standard forms. All software
included in the Seller Intellectual Property Rights is original with Seller and
has been either created by employees of Seller on a work-for-hire basis or by
consultants or contractors who have created such software themselves and have
assigned all rights they may have had in such software to Seller.

Software. For the avoidance of doubt, the Software specifically excludes any and
all software licenses of Seller from Synopsys. Seller has delivered, or will
deliver promptly following the Closing, to Buyer complete copies of all user and
technical documentation related to the Software.

                           (b) Neither Seller nor, to the best knowledge of
Seller, any employee or agent thereof has developed or assisted in the
enhancement of the Software except for enhancements included in the Software as

form are being delivered to Buyer at or promptly following Closing.

Seller has never generated, transported, treated, stored or disposed, or, in any
manner, arranged for disposal or treatment within the meaning of any Hazardous
Substances (as defined herein). To the best of Seller's knowledge, there are no
Hazardous Substances on, in, or under the premises leased or possessed by
Seller. To the best of Seller's knowledge, there have not been and there are not
any past or present events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices,
incidents or actions which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
legal liability or otherwise forms the basis of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or investigation against or involving Seller based on any
condition or any violation or alleged violation of any federal, state, or local
law, regulation, ordinance, or requirement relating to health and safety and
protection of the environment. For purposes hereof, the term Hazardous
Substances shall mean any substances, materials, wastes or other elements which
are classified or regulated as hazardous by any federal, state or local law,
rule or regulation pertaining to environmental regulation, contaminant,
clean-up, or disclosure.

                  3.17 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.17 hereto, Seller does not presently have, nor has it had within the last five
(5) years, any pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, or other employee
pension or health or welfare benefit plan or arrangement in which employees of
Seller participate or have participated. All employee pension benefit plans and
employee health or welfare benefits plans relating to employees of Seller
(collectively "Benefit Plans") have been administered in compliance with all

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended "ERISA"). There are no
"accumulated funding deficiencies" within the meaning of the Code. No reportable
events (within the meaning of ERISA) or prohibited transactions (within the
meaning of the Code) have occurred. There are no pending or, to Seller's
knowledge, threatened claims by or on behalf of the Benefit Plans or by any
employee of Seller alleging a breach or breaches of fiduciary duties or
violations of other applicable state or federal law which could result in
liability on the part of either Seller or the Benefit Plans under any law, nor
is there any basis for such a claim. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17
hereto, all returns, reports, disclosure statements, and premium payments
required to be made under the Code or ERISA with respect to the Benefit Plans
have been timely filed or delivered. Except as described in Schedule 3.17

Section 11.1(i) or Section 11.2(i) (i.e., for misrepresentations and breaches of
warranties), as applicable, only when total indemnification claims exceed
Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), after which Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
shall be liable for all such claims. No party shall be liable for any
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(i) or Section 11.2(i), as applicable,
for any claims for misrepresentations and breaches of warranty which are the
basis upon which any other party shall have failed to consummate the
transactions described herein pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 8.1, as
applicable, or which are based upon misrepresentations and breaches of warranty
which have been waived pursuant to the initial paragraph of Section 7 or Section

of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Seller.

                  11.4 BROKERAGE INDEMNIFICATION. Each of the parties agrees to
indemnify and hold the other party entirely harmless against and from any and

on the basis of any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of the other,
or by its or their agents, officers, employees or representatives.

                  11.5 NOTICE AND CONTROL OF LITIGATION. If any claim or
liability is asserted in writing by a third party against a party entitled to
indemnification under this Section 11.5 (the "Indemnified Party") which would
give rise to a claim under this Section 11.5, the Indemnified Party shall notify
the person giving the indemnity "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing (but
in any event within fifteen (15) days of receipt) of such written assertion of a
claim or liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend a
claim and control the defense, settlement, and prosecution of any litigation. If
the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) days after notice of such claim, fails
to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall (upon further notice to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise, or
settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and at the risk of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the
defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise, or final
determination thereof. Anything in this Section 11.5 notwithstanding, (i) if
there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages or other
money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to defend, compromise, and settle such claim, and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim. All
parties agree to cooperate fully as necessary in the defense of such matters.
Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time
required above, the indemnity with respect to the subject matter of the required
notice shall be limited to the damages that would have resulted absent the
Indemnified Party's failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time

<PAGE>

required above after taking into account such actions as could have been taken
by the Indemnifying Party had it received timely notice from the Indemnified
Party.

                  11.6 NOTICE OF CLAIM. If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of
any breach of the representations or warranties of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder or any other basis for indemnification under this Section 11.6, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the same
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of such breach or claim, specifying
in detail the circumstances and facts which give rise to a claim under this
Section 11.6. Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying Party
within the time frame required above, the indemnity with respect to the subject
matter of the required notice shall be limited to the damages that would have
nonetheless resulted absent the Indemnified Party's failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party in the time required above after taking into account such
actions as could have been taken by the Indemnifying Party had it received
timely notice from the Indemnified Party.

         12.      GENERAL.

party to whom the Schedules, Exhibits or such other instrument is to be

                  12.2 BENEFIT/ASSIGNMENT. Subject to provisions herein to the
contrary, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns and no others. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party, however, Buyer may freely assign this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller in connection with the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Buyer, whether by
merger, acquisition or otherwise.

                  12.3 COST OF TRANSACTION. Whether or not the transactions

Seller by Buyer and its agents are of a confidential and proprietary nature.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that both prior and subsequent to the Closing
it will maintain the confidentiality of all such confidential information,
documents, or instruments delivered to it by each of the other parties hereto or
their agents in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or in
compliance with the terms, conditions, and covenants hereof and will only

officers, members, directors, representatives, and


<PAGE>

agents (including consultants, attorneys, and accountants of each party) and
applicable governmental authorities in connection with any required notification
or application for approval or exemption therefrom. Each of the parties hereto
further agrees that if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated,
it will return all such documents and instruments and all copies thereof in its
possession to the other parties to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
recognizes that any breach of this Section 12.4 would result in irreparable harm
to the other party to this Agreement and its affiliates and that therefore
either Seller or Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction to prohibit any such
breach and is in addition to all of its other legal and equitable remedies.
Nothing in this Section 12.4, however, shall prohibit the use of such
confidential information, documents, or information for such governmental
filings as in the opinion of the Seller's counsel or Buyer's counsel are
required by law or governmental regulations or are otherwise required to be
disclosed pursuant to applicable state law.

                  12.5 WAIVER OF BREACH. The waiver by either party of breach or
violation of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as, or be
construed to constitute, a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or other
provision hereof.

permitted, or desired to be given hereunder shall be deemed effectively given

         2. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY.

                  2.1 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY. Shareholder shall not
transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any of the Common Shares unless such
transfer is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, which conditions are
intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act.

                  2.2 RESTRICTIVE LEGEND. Each certificate representing the
Common Shares or securities issued in respect of the Common Shares, shall
(unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of Section 2.3 below) be stamped
or otherwise imprinted with a legend in the following form (in addition to any
legend required under applicable state securities laws):

         The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered
         under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or any
         applicable state securities laws. These securities are "Restricted
         Securities" as defined in the Rule 144 promulgated under the Act and
         may not be sold or offered for sale or otherwise distributed except (a)
         in conjunction with an effective registration statement for the shares
         under the Act and applicable state securities laws, (b) in compliance
         with Rule 144 and an exemption under applicable state securities laws,
         or (c) pursuant to an opinion of counsel satisfactory to CyberGuard
         Corporation that such registration or compliance is not required as to
         such sale, offer or distribution.

                  2.3 NOTICE OF PROPOSED TRANSFERS. Unless there is an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act covering a proposed transfer,
Shareholder shall notify the Company of its intention to effect a transfer of
any of its Common Shares. Such notice shall describe the manner and
circumstances of the proposed transfer in sufficient detail, and shall be
accompanied (except that the requirements set forth in the balance of this
sentence need not be complied with where the proposed transaction complies with
Rule 144 as long as the Company is furnished with evidence of compliance with
such rule) by:

                           (a) an unqualified written opinion of legal counsel
which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company addressed to the Company's
counsel, to the effect that the proposed transfer of the Common Shares may be
effected without registration of the Securities Act; or

                           (b) a "no action" letter from the Commission to the
effect that the distribution of such securities without registration will not
result in a recommendation by the staff of the Commission that action be taken
with respect thereto.

                  2.4 LIMITED RIGHT TO TRANSFER. If the Company fails to object
as to adequacy of the notice within ten (10) days of its delivery to the
Company, Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer such Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of the notice delivered to the Company. Each
certificate evidencing the Common Shares transferred as above provided shall
bear the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in Section 2.2, except that
such certificate shall not bear such restrictive legend if in the opinion of
counsel for the Company such legend is not required in order to establish
compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act or applicable state
securities laws.

         3. REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

                  3.1 REQUESTED REGISTRATION.


<PAGE>

                           (a) At any time after the ninetieth (90th) day
following the date of this Agreement and at such time as the Company can
register its Common Stock on Form S-3 or any successor form of registration
statement, Shareholder may make one request to the Company to register all or
any portion of Shareholder's Registrable Shares under the Securities Act in
accordance with this Section 3.1. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the prompt registration of all Registrable Shares requested to
be registered, and in connection therewith shall prepare and file on such
appropriate form as the Company, in its reasonable discretion, shall determine,
a registration statement under the Securities Act to effect such registration
(including the execution of an undertaking to file post-effective amendments,
appropriate qualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities
laws and appropriate compliance with applicable regulations issued under the
Securities Act).

                           (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.1 to
the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
registration, or take other specified actions with respect to, or cooperate in
any offering of, Registrable Shares upon the request of Shareholder pursuant to
this Section 3.1:

                                    (1) in any particular jurisdiction in which
the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process
in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance unless the Company
is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required
by the Securities Act;

                                    (2) within 180 days immediately following
the effective date of any registration of the Common Stock; or

                                    (3) after the Company has effected one
registration pursuant to this Section 3.1 that has been declared or ordered
effective.

                           (c) The request by Shareholder for registration of
Registrable Shares pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall:

                  (1) specify the number of Registrable Shares which Shareholder
                  intends to offer and sell;

                  (2) express the intention of Shareholder to offer or cause the
                  offering of such Registrable Shares;

                  (3) describe the nature or method of the proposed offer and
                  sale thereof;

                  (4) contain the undertaking of Shareholder to provide all such
                  information regarding its holdings and the proposed manner of
                  distribution thereof as may be required (i) to permit the
                  Company to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
                  all requirements of the Commission and any other regulatory or
                  self-regulatory body, any other body having jurisdiction, and
                  any securities exchange on which the Registrable Shares are to
                  be listed, and (ii) to obtain acceleration of the effective
                  date of any registration statement filed in connection
                  therewith; and

                  (5) in the case of an underwritten public offering, specify
                  the managing underwriter or underwriters of such Registrable
                  Shares, which shall be selected by the Company.


<PAGE>

                           (d) If at the time of the request to register the
Registrable Shares the Company notifies Shareholder, within ten (10) days of
Shareholder's request, that the Company is engaged or has fixed plans to engage
within thirty (30) days of the time of the request in an underwritten public
offering of securities for the Company's own account and the Company determines
in good faith that such offering would be materially adversely affected by the
registration so requested, the Company may delay filing a registration statement
and may withhold efforts to cause the registration statement to become
effective; provided, however, that the Company shall only be entitled to
postpone for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, the
filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed
by the Company pursuant to this Section 3.1. In addition, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company may delay filing a registration
statement and may withhold efforts to cause the registration statement to become
effective, if the Company determines in good faith that such registration might
(i) interfere with or affect the negotiation or completion of any transaction
that is being contemplated by the Company at the time the right to delay is
exercised or (ii) involve initial or continuing disclosure obligations that
might not be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders.

                           (e) If, after a registration statement becomes
effective, the Company advises Shareholder that the Company considers it
appropriate for the registration statement to be amended, Shareholder shall
suspend any further sales of its registered shares until the Company advises it
that the registration statement has been amended. The Company shall keep the
Registration Statement issued pursuant to this Section 3.1 effective until the
earlier of (i) two years from the date of issuance of the Registrable Shares to
Shareholder or (ii) the date on which the Shareholder no longer owns any of the
Registrable Shares it requested to be registered pursuant to this Section 3.1.
Shareholder shall have no obligation to sell any of the Registrable Shares he
requested to be registered pursuant to this Section 3.1.

                           (f) If Shareholder intends to distribute the
Registrable Shares, which are covered by its request for registration pursuant
to this Section 3.1, by means of an underwriting, Shareholder shall so advise
the Company as a part of its request. The Company shall, together with
Shareholder, enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.1, if the managing
underwriter or underwriters determine that the underwriting would be materially
adversely affected by inclusion in such underwriting of all of the Registrable
Shares requested by Shareholder and so advises Shareholder in writing, then
Shareholder shall reduce accordingly the number of Registrable Shares that will
be included in the registration and underwriting. No Registrable Shares excluded
from the underwriting by reason of the managing underwriter's or underwriters'
marketing or other limitations shall be included in such registration. Should
Shareholder disapprove of the terms of the underwriting, Shareholder may elect
to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the managing
underwriter or underwriters.

                           (g) If the managing underwriter or underwriters have
not limited the number of Registrable Shares to be underwritten, the Company may
include securities for its own account in such registration if the managing
underwriter or underwriters so agree and if the number of Registrable Shares
which would otherwise have been included in such registration and underwriting
will not thereby be limited.

                  3.2 COMPANY REGISTRATIONS.

                           (a) If, at any time, and from time to time, the
Company proposes to register any of Common Stock for its own account, in
connection with an underwritten public offering of


<PAGE>

Common Stock solely for cash (other than a registration statement filed on Form
S-4 or any other form filed in connection with any acquisition, merger,
consolidation or stock exchange, or a registration statement filed solely in
connection with director or employee benefit plans of the Company) the Company
shall:

                                    (1) promptly notify Shareholder of the
proposed registration (which shall include a list of the jurisdictions in which
the Company intends to attempt to qualify such Common Stock under the applicable
state securities laws); and

                                    (2) include in such registration (and any
related qualification under state securities laws or other compliance), and in
any underwriting involved therein, all of the Registrable Shares specified in a
request or requests by Shareholder, made within ten (10) days after delivery of
the notice from the Company.

                           (b) If the registration to be effected under this
Section 3.2 is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the
Company shall so advise Shareholder as a part of the notice given pursuant to
Section 3.2(a)(1). In such a case the right of Shareholder to register its
Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(2) shall be conditioned upon
Shareholder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of its
Registrable Shares in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.
Shareholder (together with the Company and any other shareholders proposing to
offer and sell shares of Common Stock through such underwriting (hereinafter,
the "Additional Selling Shareholders")), shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for
such underwriting by the Company and perform its obligations under such an
agreement.

                           (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of Section
3.2(b) to the contrary, if the managing underwriter or underwriters determine
that such offering would be materially adversely affected by inclusion in such
underwriting of all of the Registrable Shares requested by Shareholder, the
managing underwriter or underwriters may exclude a portion of such Registrable
Shares from such registration and underwriting. In such a case, the Company
shall advise Shareholder of the managing underwriter's determination to exclude
a portion of the Registrable Shares from such registration and underwriting. The
number of shares of Common Stock of Shareholder and the Additional Selling
Shareholders that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be
allocated among Shareholder and the Additional Selling Shareholders in
proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of shares of
Common Stock owned by Shareholder and each of the Additional Selling
Shareholders at the time of filing the registration statement. No Registrable
Shares excluded from the underwriting by reason of the managing underwriter's
determination shall be included in such registration.

                           (d) If Shareholder disapproves of the terms of any
such underwriting, Shareholder may elect to withdraw therefrom all of the
Registrable Shares included in its request for registration by notice to the
Company and the managing underwriter or underwriters, and the Registrable Shares
so withdrawn from the underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such
registration. If one or more Additional Selling Shareholders withdraw shares of
Common Stock from the underwriting and registration, and by virtue of such
withdrawal, a greater number of shares of Common Stock of Shareholder and
Additional Selling Shareholders who have not withdrawn may be included in such
registration (up to the maximum of any limitation imposed by the managing
underwriter), then the Company shall offer to Shareholder and the Additional
Selling Shareholders who have elected to participate in the registration the
right to include additional shares of Common Stock, as applicable, in the
registration in the same proportions as were used above in determining the
underwriter limitation.


<PAGE>

                  3.3 MARKET STAND-OFF AGREEMENT. Upon request of the Company or
the managing underwriter in any underwritten offering of Registrable Securities,
Shareholder shall not make or cause any offering, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, of any Common Shares (or any other securities of the
Company) without the prior approval of the Company or the managing underwriter
for such period of time (not to exceed 180 days) from the effective date of such
registration as may be requested by the Company or the managing underwriter. In
addition, Shareholder agrees, that upon request of the Company or the managing
underwriter in any underwritten offering and registration of shares of Common
Stock (or other securities of the Company) in which Shareholder (having been
given notice and the opportunity as required by Section 3.2(a)(1)) declines to
participate, not to make or cause any offering, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, of any Common Shares (or other securities of the
Company) held by it (other than any such Common Shares sold or otherwise
disposed of pursuant to a previously registered and underwritten offering)
without the prior approval of the Company or the managing underwriter (but not
to exceed a period of time from the effective date of such registration as the
managing underwriter shall have requested of all officers and directors of the
Company and all other persons with registration rights holding no fewer than the
number of shares of Common Stock held by Shareholder). The Company, in enforcing
the provisions of this Section 3.3, may impose stop-transfer instructions with
respect to the Registrable Shares of Shareholder until the end of such period.

                  3.4 EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. The Company shall pay all
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with all registrations under this
Agreement. If Shareholder participates in a registration, Shareholder shall pay
the Selling Expenses incurred in connection with each registration under this
Agreement, pro rata in the same proportion as the number of shares of
Registrable Shares registered and sold by Shareholder bears to the total number
of shares of Common Stock being registered and sold under such registration
statement.

                  3.5 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. In each registration effected by
the Company pursuant to this Section 3, the Company will keep Shareholder
advised as to the initiation of each such registration and as to the completion
thereof. At its expense, the Company shall:

                           (a) prepare and file with the Commission a
registration statement for the Registrable Shares and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective;

                           (b) upon the request of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Common Stock registered thereunder, keep such registration
statement effective for a period ending at the earlier of 120 days following the
effective date of the Registration Statement or the date that the distribution
contemplated in the registration statement has been completed;

                           (c) prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus
used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act regarding the disposition of
all securities covered by such registration statement;

                           (d) furnish to Shareholder such numbers of copies of
a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the
Securities Act, and such other documents (including any exhibits thereto or
documents referred to therein) as Shareholder may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Shares owned by it;


<PAGE>

                           (e) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under
such other securities laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably
requested by Shareholder, provided, that the Company shall not be required in
connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business,
subject itself to taxation, or to file a general consent to service of process
in any such states or jurisdictions;

                           (f) in the event of any underwritten public offering,
enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual
and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering, provided,
that the form of underwriting agreement must be reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Shareholder with respect to secondary distributions;

                           (g) cause all such Registrable Shares registered
pursuant hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed; and

                           (h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Shares registered pursuant hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such
Registrable Shares, in each case not later than the effective date of such
registration.

                  3.6 THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO ABANDON REGISTRATION.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may at any time
prior to the effectiveness of any such registration statement, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of or other obligation to Shareholder,
abandon or postpone the proposed registration under Section 3.2 in which
Shareholder had requested to participate.

                  3.7 AMENDMENTS TO REGISTRATION STATEMENTS. If the Company has
delivered copies of the preliminary or final prospectus to Shareholder and after
having done so the prospectus is amended to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Company shall promptly notify Shareholder and, if requested,
Shareholder shall immediately cease making offers of Registrable Shares and
return all copies of the prospectus to the Company. The Company shall promptly
provide Shareholder with copies of the revised prospectus and, following receipt
of the revised prospectus, Shareholder shall be free to resume making offers of
the Registrable Shares.

         4. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  4.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY. In the case of each
registration of Registrable Securities of Shareholder, the Company will
indemnify Shareholder and its Affiliates, against all claims, losses, damages
and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing
incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, to which any
of them may become subject under the Securities Act or other federal or state
law, arising out of or based on the following:

                           (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus,
offering circular or other similar document (including any related registration
statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration, or based
on any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made;

                           (b) any violation by the Company of any federal,
state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company in connection
with any such registration, qualification or compliance; and


<PAGE>

                           (c) any legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss,
damage, liability or action, as incurred related to the foregoing.

                  4.2 LIMITATION ON THE COMPANY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION.
The Company shall not be liable, and shall have no indemnification obligation
hereunder, for any amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the
Company be liable in any such case for any such claim, loss, damage, liability
or expense to the extent it arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or
omission, made in reliance on and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by an instrument duly executed by Shareholder,
underwriter or controlling person and stated to be specifically for use therein.

                  4.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY SHAREHOLDER. If Registrable Securities
held by Shareholder are included in the securities as to which such registration
is being effected, Shareholder shall indemnify the Company, each of its officers
and directors, each underwriter and each person who controls any underwriter,
and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any such underwriter within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each person affiliated with
or retained by the Company and who may be subject to liability under any
applicable securities laws, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in
settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, to which they may become
subject under the Securities Act or other federal or state law, arising out of
or based on:

                           (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus,
offering circular or other similar document, or any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular
or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by an instrument duly executed by Shareholder and
stated to be specifically for use therein; and

                           (b) any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action, as incurred.

                  4.4 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE. Each party entitled to
indemnification under this Section 4 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice
to the party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to
which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified
Party with respect to the claim and provided further that counsel for the
Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation,
shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at such party's expense, and provided further that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 4 except to the extent
that the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action and provided further, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which
there is a conflict of interest or


<PAGE>

separate and different defenses but shall bear the expense of such defense
nevertheless. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or
litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any claim
or proceeding resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may defend against such
claim or proceeding as the Indemnified Part may deem appropriate and may settle
such claim or proceeding in such manner as the Indemnified Party may deem
appropriate, all without prejudice to its right to indemnification hereunder.

                  4.5 CONTRIBUTION, ALLOCATION, ETC. If the indemnification
provided for in this Section 4 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an Indemnified Party under such paragraphs in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof referred to therein, then
each Indemnifying Party shall in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions in such proportion as
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and
the underwriters and Shareholder, on the other, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or actions as well as any other relevant equitable considerations,
including the failure to give any notice under Section 4.4. The relative fault
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company, on the one hand, or the underwriters or Shareholder, on the other,
and to the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and
Shareholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this paragraph where determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which did not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this paragraph. The amount paid or payable
by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this paragraph, shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, Shareholder shall
not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the lesser of (i) the
proportion that the public offering price of shares sold by Shareholder under
such registration statement bears to the total public offering price of all
securities sold thereunder, but not to exceed the proceeds received by
Shareholder for the sale of Registrable Shares covered by such registration
statement and (ii) the amount of any damages which it would have otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act), shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

                  4.6 CONFLICTS WITH UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 4 to the contrary, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered
into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with
the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall
control.

         5. TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The obligation of the Company to
register any of Shareholder's Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement
shall expire on the earlier of (i) the date when Shareholder ceases beneficially
to own any Registrable Shares, (ii) the date when the Registrable Shares held by
Shareholder may be sold under Rule 144 or (iii) the date which is the second
(2nd) anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

do so, Shareholder may select counsel to represent it in connection with the
registration; provided, that Shareholder shall be solely responsible for the
fees and expenses of any separate counsel so selected, and the Company shall
have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect thereto.

                  6.5 DELAYS OR OMISSIONS. No delay or omission to exercise any
right, power or remedy accruing to Shareholder, upon any breach or default by

of Shareholder nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or
default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default
thereunder occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be
deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter
occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on
the part of Shareholder or any breach or default under this Agreement, or any
waiver on the part of Shareholder of any provisions or conditions of this
Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this
Agreement, or by law or otherwise afforded to Shareholder, shall be cumulative

expressed in this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, the parties intend that the court add to this
Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable

of the parties to the greatest extent possible.

                  6.11 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement does not

                                                                       EXHIBIT B

                                ESCROW AGREEMENT

         THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into and effective
as of February 28, 2003, by and among NETOCTAVE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Seller"), CYBERGUARD CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("Buyer"), and
WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Escrow Agent").

         RECITALS:

         A. Buyer and Seller are parties to that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated January 22, 2003 (the "Purchase Agreement"), which provides,
among other things, that upon Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) a
portion of the Stock Consideration (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) shall
be deposited in escrow for the purpose set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

         B. Buyer and Seller desire that Escrow Agent hold and release 20,645
shares of the Buyer's common stock held in escrow (the "Escrow Shares"), which
shares Buyer and Seller acknowledge represent the number of shares of Buyer's
common stock equal to $200,000 divided by the average closing price per share of
Buyer's common stock for the ten (10) trading days ending two (2) business days
prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement, and Escrow Agent is willing to do
so, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

         AGREEMENT:

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

         1. ESCROW AGENT. Escrow Agent is hereby constituted and appointed the
escrow agent hereunder, and Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act with respect to
the Escrow Shares as hereinafter set forth.

         2. ESCROW SHARES. On the date hereof, Buyer is delivering and
depositing with Escrow Agent the Escrow Shares and corresponding blank stock
power executed by Seller to be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Promptly following receipt of the Escrow Shares and such blank
stock power, Escrow Agent shall provide written confirmation of such receipt to
Buyer and Seller. The Escrow Shares shall be registered in the name of
"NetOctave, Inc."

         3. RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES UPON JOINT AUTHORIZATION. If at any time
Escrow Agent shall receive instructions in a written notice signed by both Buyer
and Seller with respect to the release of all or any portion of the Escrow
Shares, then Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Shares, or the portion
thereof specified in such notice, in accordance with Section 5 herein.

         4. FINAL RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES. Buyer and Seller agree that on the
181st day following the date hereof, Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow
Shares then remaining on deposit with Escrow Agent hereunder to Seller;
provided, however, that if on or prior to that date both David Blaker and Jim
Kristof (collectively, the "Key Employees") are not full-time employees of Buyer
due to a "voluntary termination" or "for cause termination" of employment, the
Escrow Shares then remaining with Escrow Agent shall not be released to Seller,
but rather shall be released and delivered to Buyer.


<PAGE>

Such final release of the Escrow Shares by Escrow Agent, whether to Seller or
Buyer, shall be upon Escrow Agent's receipt of written notice signed by both
Buyer and Seller and in accordance with Section 5 herein. For the avoidance of
any doubt: (i) "voluntary termination" shall only include a cessation of
employment made voluntarily and solely at the discretion of either of the Key
Employees, and shall not include termination due to the disability or death of
either of the Key Employees; and (ii) "for cause termination" shall only include
a cessation of employment made by Buyer because (a) either of the Key Employees
failed to diligently and properly perform their duties for Buyer in the ordinary
course of their employment, (b) either of the Key Employees committed an illegal
act which is materially detrimental to the interests of Buyer, (c) either of the
Key Employees committed a material breach of an Employment Agreement between
such Key Employee and Buyer. Any "for cause termination" shall be subject to
notice from Buyer and the right to cure by such Key Employee, such notice to be
given promptly in writing, and the cure period to be reasonable under the
circumstances but no less than ten (10) business days from the date of such
written notice.

         5. DISBURSEMENTS. Disbursements of the Escrow Shares by Escrow Agent
required pursuant to Section 3 or 4 herein shall be made by Escrow Agent only
upon the receipt of instructions in a written notice signed by both Buyer and
Seller with respect to the release of all or any portion of the Escrow Shares.
Once Escrow Agent has received such notice, Escrow Agent shall deliver the
Escrow Shares and blank stock power to the party entitled to the release of the
Escrow Shares. In the event that a party shall at any time have failed to timely
join in such written notice to Escrow Agent as required by this Section 5, the
other party shall receive from such party its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any actions taken by the other party in connection
with such failure, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

         6. DIVIDENDS; ADJUSTMENTS.

                  6.1 DIVIDENDS. Any cash dividends or distributions of Buyer
securities paid or made to Seller with respect to the Escrow Shares shall be
delivered to and held by Escrow Agent. Such dividends shall be released by
Escrow Agent simultaneously and proportionately with the corresponding Escrow
Shares delivered hereunder, and such delivery shall discharge Escrow Agent from
any further liability or responsibility therefor. Further, all cash received by
Escrow Agent shall be invested by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Agent's cash
sweep money market account or any other investment approved in writing by both
Buyer and Seller.

                  6.2 ADJUSTMENTS. If, during the existence of this Agreement,
the common stock of Buyer shall be reclassified into a different number of
shares of capital stock or a dividend thereon shall be declared in additional
capital stock, the number of Escrow Shares held by Escrow Agent shall be
correspondingly adjusted in the same proportion as such reclassification of
capital stock or dividend in additional capital stock.

         7. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate upon release by Escrow
Agent, in accordance with the provisions hereof, of all of the Escrow Shares.

         8. DUTIES AND RIGHTS OF ESCROW AGENT.

                  8.1 LIMITATION OF DUTIES. Escrow Agent undertakes to perform
only such duties as are expressly set forth herein.

                  8.2 RELIANCE. Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall be
protected in acting or


<PAGE>

refraining from acting upon any notice, instruction or request furnished to it
in writing hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to
inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of such document.

                  8.3 GOOD FAITH. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within
the rights and powers conferred upon it by this Agreement, and may consult with
counsel of its own choice and shall have full and complete authorization and
protection for any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in
accordance with the written opinion of such counsel.

                  8.4 RESIGNATION OF ESCROW AGENT. Escrow Agent may resign and
be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving notice in
writing of such resignation specifying a date (not less than thirty (30) days
after the giving of such notice) when such resignation shall take effect, and by
transferring the Escrow Shares (and/or funds) then held by it pursuant to this
Agreement to the successor escrow agent. Promptly after the giving of such
notice, Buyer and Seller shall by mutual agreement appoint a successor escrow
agent, such escrow agent to receive the Escrow Shares from the resigning Escrow
Agent and thereafter be treated in all respects as the "Escrow Agent" hereunder.
If a successor escrow agent is not appointed within thirty (30) days, Escrow
Agent shall have the right to petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor escrow agent. Buyer and Seller may by mutual
agreement at any time substitute a new escrow agent by giving ten (10) days'
notice thereof in writing to the Escrow Agent then acting. Escrow Agent shall
continue to serve until its successor receives delivery of the Escrow Shares
(and/or funds) held in escrow.

                  8.5 FEES. For its services hereunder, Buyer shall pay to the
Escrow Agent, upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, a one-time payment
of $1,500 for its administration of the Escrow Shares and a one-time payment of
$500 for Escrow Agent's legal costs incurred in the review of this Agreement.
Buyer shall reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or
made by it in connection with its carrying out its duties hereunder.

                  8.6 INDEMNIFICATION. Buyer and Seller agree to indemnify
Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or
expense incurred by it arising out of or in connection with its entering into
this Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability in the premises,
other than as incurred by reason of its gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss
or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if Escrow Agent has been advised of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action. In the event that Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from
any party hereto, which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its
sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it
shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto or by
a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

         9. NOTICE. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
hereunder shall be effective only if it is in writing delivered personally or
sent by telecopy or by nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed as
follows:

by the laws of the State of Florida. Any provision in this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in a court of competent jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or

CYBERGUARD CORPORATION                         EMPLOYEE:

By:

                                    EXHIBIT E

                 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

         THIS NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement")
is made and entered into this 22nd day of January, 2003, by and between
CYBERGUARD CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("Buyer"), and RICHARD HEGBERG
("Shareholder"), a shareholder of NETOCTAVE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Seller").

         RECITALS:

         A. Buyer and Seller are parties to that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to
which Seller agreed to sell, assign and transfer, and Buyer agreed to purchase,
all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Assets of Seller used in
the operation of the Business in exchange for the Purchase Price. Any
capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

         B. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Seller has agreed to cause
Shareholder to execute this Agreement.

         C. Shareholder acknowledges that Shareholder will receive directly or
indirectly, through Shareholder's ownership interest in Seller, the benefit of
the Purchase Price paid by Buyer to Seller.

         D. As contemplated in the Purchase Agreement and as an inducement to
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement,
Shareholder has agreed to the provisions contained in this Agreement and
Shareholder acknowledges that if Shareholder did not enter into this Agreement,
the Purchase Price paid by Buyer to Seller to purchase the Assets would be
greatly reduced.

         AGREEMENT:

         NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises
contained herein and in the Purchase Agreement and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
undersigned parties agree as follows:

         1. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. Shareholder hereby agrees that,
from and after the date of this Agreement, Shareholder shall not for a period of
two (2) years following the date of this Agreement (a) serve, directly or
indirectly, as an operator, owner, partner, consultant, officer, director, or
employee of any firm or corporation directly or indirectly competitive with the
Business on a world-wide basis; (b) solicit or attempt to solicit, or accept
business from, any entity which is a client or customer of the Business or which
at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of this
Agreement, was a client or customer of the Business, for the purpose of doing
business with such client or customer in competition with the Business; or (c)
solicit, attempt to hire, or hire any employee or consultant of Buyer (including
employees of Seller hired by Buyer), or assist in such solicitation or hiring by
any other person or entity, or encourage any employee or consultant to terminate
his or her relationship with Buyer or the Business. It is agreed that the remedy
at law for any breach of the foregoing shall be inadequate and that Buyer shall
be entitled to any other remedy permitted by law or equity. All parties hereto
hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against the competition of

<PAGE>

Shareholder and that the nature and scope of such protection has been carefully
considered by the parties. Shareholder further acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants and provisions of this Section 1 form part of the consideration under
the Purchase Agreement and are among the inducements for Buyer entering into and
consummating the transactions contemplated therein. The period provided and the
area covered are expressly represented and agreed to be fair, reasonable and
necessary. The consideration provided for in the Purchase Agreement is deemed to
be sufficient and adequate to compensate for agreeing to the restrictions
contained in this Section 1. If, however, this Section 1 shall be determined by
any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of it
extending for too great a period of time or over too large a geographic area or
over too great a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only
over the maximum period of time, geographic area or range of activities as to
which it may be enforceable. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Shareholder
(i) from holding or making an investment in securities listed on a national
securities exchange or sold in the over-the-counter market, provided such
investments do not exceed in the aggregate five percent (5%) of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of a corporation which is a competitor of the Business
or (ii) from being employed as an employee of or consultant to a competitor of
the Business if Shareholder is employed by a division or subsidiary which is not
in competition with the Business.

         2. BENEFIT/ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives,
successors and assigns and no others. Neither party may assign this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party, however, Buyer may freely
assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller in connection
with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Buyer,
whether by merger, acquisition or otherwise.

         3. WAIVER OF BREACH. The waiver by either party of breach or violation
of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as, or be construed to
constitute, a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or other provision
hereof.

         4. SEVERABILITY. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason and in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall in no event affect, prejudice
or disturb the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall be and
remain in full force and effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

         5. DIVISIONS AND HEADINGS. The division of this Agreement into sections
and subsections and the use of captions and headings in connection therewith are
solely for convenience and shall have no legal effect in construing the
provisions of this Agreement.

         6. CHOICE OF LAW. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
notwithstanding its conflicts of laws principles.

         7. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY. THIS
WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING FROM ANY
SOURCE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR
ANY STATE THEREIN, COMMON


<PAGE>

LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OR REGULATIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING ITS RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY.

         8. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event suit is brought to enforce or
interpret any part of this Agreement, the successful party shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in connection with such action
(including without limitation fees and costs of any appeals or in connection
with any bankruptcy proceedings), which costs shall be fixed by the court and
included in any judgment. The "successful party" shall be the party determined
by the court to have most successfully prosecuted or defended its position;
provided, however, that if either party has made a written settlement offer not
less than ten days prior to commencement of the trial and such offer is not
accepted, the party to whom such offer is made shall not be considered a
"successful party" unless the outcome of the trial is more favorable to such
party than that which was offered in such settlement offer. No settlement offer

                           NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

         THIS NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into this 22nd day of January, 2003, by and between CYBERGUARD CORPORATION, a
Florida corporation ("Buyer"), and WILLIAM GUPTON ("Gupton"), an employee of
NETOCTAVE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Seller").

         RECITALS:

         A. Buyer and Seller are parties to that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to
which Seller agreed to sell, assign and transfer, and Buyer agreed to purchase,
all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Assets of Seller used in
the operation of the Business in exchange for the Purchase Price. Any
capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

         B. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Seller has agreed to cause
Gupton to execute this Agreement.

         C. Gupton acknowledges that Gupton will benefit, directly or
indirectly, from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement.

         D. As contemplated in the Purchase Agreement and as an inducement to
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement,
Gupton has agreed to the provisions contained in this Agreement and Gupton
acknowledges that if Gupton did not enter into this Agreement, the Purchase
Price paid by Buyer to Seller to purchase the Assets would be greatly reduced.

         AGREEMENT:

         NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises
contained herein and in the Purchase Agreement and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
undersigned parties agree as follows:

         1. Non-Solicitation. Gupton hereby agrees that, from and after the date
of this Agreement, Gupton shall not for a period of two (2) years following the
date of this Agreement (a) solicit or attempt to solicit, or accept business
from, any entity which is a client or customer of the Business or which at any
time during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of this Agreement,
was a client or customer of the Business, for the purpose of doing business with
such client or customer in competition with the Business, or (b) solicit,
attempt to hire, or hire any employee or consultant of Buyer (including
employees of Seller hired by Buyer), or assist in such solicitation or hiring by
any other person or entity, or encourage any employee or consultant to terminate
his or her relationship with the Business. It is agreed that the remedy at law
for any breach of the foregoing shall be inadequate and that Buyer shall be
entitled to any other remedy permitted by law or equity. All parties hereto
hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against solicitation by Gupton
and that the nature and scope of such protection has been carefully considered
by the parties. Gupton further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
provisions of this Section 1 form part of the consideration under the Purchase
Agreement and are among the inducements for Buyer entering into and consummating
the transactions contemplated therein.


<PAGE>

The period provided and the matters covered are expressly represented and agreed
to be fair, reasonable and necessary. The consideration provided for in the
Purchase Agreement is deemed to be sufficient and adequate to compensate for
agreeing to the restrictions contained in this Section 1. If, however, this
Section 1 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable by reason of it extending for too great a period of time or over
too great a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the
maximum period of time or range of activities as to which it may be enforceable.

         2. BENEFIT/ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives,
successors and assigns and no others. Neither party may assign this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party, however, Buyer may freely
assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller in connection
with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Buyer,
whether by merger, acquisition or otherwise.

         3. WAIVER OF BREACH. The waiver by either party of breach or violation
of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as, or be construed to
constitute, a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or other provision
hereof.

         4. SEVERABILITY. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason and in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall in no event affect, prejudice
or disturb the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall be and
remain in full force and effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

         5. DIVISIONS AND HEADINGS. The division of this Agreement into sections
and subsections and the use of captions and headings in connection therewith are
solely for convenience and shall have no legal effect in construing the
provisions of this Agreement.

         6. CHOICE OF LAW. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
notwithstanding its conflicts of laws principles.

         7. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY. THIS
WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING FROM ANY
SOURCE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR
ANY STATE THEREIN, COMMON LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OR REGULATIONS. EACH
PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING ITS RIGHT
TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY.

         8. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event suit is brought to enforce or
interpret any part of this Agreement, the successful party shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in connection with such action
(including without limitation fees and costs of any appeals or in connection
with any bankruptcy proceedings), which costs shall be fixed by the court and
included in any judgment.


<PAGE>

The "successful party" shall be the party determined by the court to have most
successfully prosecuted or defended its position; provided, however, that if
either party has made a written settlement offer not less than ten days prior to
commencement of the trial and such offer is not accepted, the party to whom such
offer is made shall not be considered a "successful party" unless the outcome of
the trial is more favorable to such party than that which was offered in such
settlement offer. No settlement offer made pursuant to this Section shall be
introduced as evidence in any court proceeding unless and until the final
judgment is rendered, in which case either party may disclose such offer to the
court in connection with this determination of which party is the "successful
party" for purposes hereof.

         9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENT. This Agreement supersedes all previous
contracts, and constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature
existing between or among the parties representing the subject matter within and
no party shall be entitled to benefits other than those specified herein. All
prior representations or agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof,
whether written or oral, not expressly incorporated herein are superseded and no
changes in or additions to this Agreement shall be recognized unless and until
made in writing and signed by all parties hereto.

         10. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
