<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, only holders of allowed claims or equity interests in classes of claims or equity interests that are impaired
are entitled to vote to accept or reject a proposed chapter 11 plan. Classes of claims or equity interests in which the holders of claims or equity interests are unimpaired under a chapter 11 plan are
deemed to have accepted the plan and are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are unimpaired, and holders of Claims in such Classes are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan. Classes 4, 5, 8 and 10 are impaired
and, to the extent Claims and Interests in such Classes are Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests, holders of such Claims and Interests will receive distributions and have their rights modified as
provided for in the Plan.
Therefore, in accordance with sections 1126 and 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Proponents are soliciting acceptances only from holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests in Classes 4, 5, 8 and
10. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Bankruptcy Code defines "acceptance" of a plan by a class of claims as acceptance by creditors in that class that hold at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than
one-half in number of the claims that cast ballots for acceptance or rejection of the plan. Acceptance of a plan by a class of interests requires acceptance by at least
two-thirds of the number of shares in such class that cast ballots for acceptance or rejection of the plan. For a more detailed description of the requirements for confirmation of the
Plan, see Section&nbsp;VI.C, "Confirmation and Consummation Procedure&#151;Confirmation." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1129(b)
permits the confirmation of a plan of reorganization notwithstanding the non-acceptance of a plan by one or more impaired classes of claims or

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A. </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Overview of Chapter 11.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 11 is the principal business reorganization chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is authorized to reorganize
its business for the benefit of itself, its creditors and interest holders. In addition to permitting rehabilitation of a debtor, another goal of chapter 11 is to promote equality of treatment for
similarly situated creditors and similarly situated interest holders with respect to the distribution of a debtor's assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
commencement of a chapter 11 case creates an estate that is comprised of all of the legal and equitable interests of the debtor as of the filing date. The Bankruptcy Code provides
that the debtor may continue to operate its business and remain in possession of its property as a "debtor-in-possession." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
consummation of a plan of reorganization is the principal objective of a chapter 11 reorganization case. A plan of reorganization sets forth the means for satisfying claims against
and interests in a debtor. Confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court makes the plan binding upon a debtor, any issuer of securities under the plan, any person acquiring property
under the plan and any creditor or interest holder of a debtor. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the confirmation order discharges a debtor from any debt that arose prior to the date of
confirmation of the plan and substitutes therefor the obligations specified under the confirmed plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
a plan of reorganization has been filed, the holders of claims against or interest in a debtor are permitted to vote to accept or reject the plan if their claims or interests are
impaired. Before soliciting acceptances of the proposed plan, however, section&nbsp;1125 of the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor to prepare a disclosure statement containing adequate information of
a kind, and in sufficient detail, to enable a hypothetical reasonable investor to make an informed judgment about the plan. The Proponents are submitting this Disclosure Statement to holders of Claims
against and Interests in the Debtors to satisfy the requirements of section&nbsp;1125 of the Bankruptcy Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAO
along with its wholly-owned debtor subsidiaries is a leading specialty retailer of high quality developmental, educational and care products for infants and children, and high
quality toys, games, books and multimedia products for children up to the age of 12. The Debtors sell their products under the FAO Schwarz, The Right Start and Zany Brainy brands. As of the Petition
Date, FAO operated a total of 255 retail stores (169 Zany Brainy stores, 61 Right Start Stores, 23 FAO Schwarz stores and two temporary outlet stores) in 32 states throughout the United States. As
described below, FAO's business expanded significantly in the last fiscal year through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc. ("Zany Brainy"), and certain assets
of toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FAO Schwarz "flagship" stores range in size between 22,000 to 67,000 square feet. FAO Schwarz mall stores range in size between 4,000 to 12,000 square feet. Most Zany Brainy stores
range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to approximately 12,000 square feet of retail space, and are located in suburban strip or power centers, selected free-standing locations
and traditional shopping malls. The typical Right Start store averages about 2,200 square feet of retail space. In addition to freestanding locations, the Debtors have opened approximately 98 Right
Start boutiques within the Zany Brainy Stores. Although the vast majority of sales are through retail stores, the Debtors also sell products through catalogues and also online websites. All of the
Debtors' store locations are leased from third parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of the Petition Date, the Debtors' corporate office (including Zany Brainy's support center) is located in an approximately 30,000 square foot facility in King of Prussia,
Pennsylvania. The Debtors also had three distribution centers including a 250,000 square foot facility in Swedesboro, New Jersey, a 220,000 square foot facility in Ontario, California and a 169,000
facility in Somerset, New Jersey. Additionally, the Debtors were parties to a short-term lease for approximately 7,000 square feet of space to serve as a warehousing and distribution
center in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The Debtors' have sought authority to reject the lease for the Somerset, New Jersey distribution facility. The Debtors also have smaller support locations in
Calabasas, California (The Right Start support center) and New York, New York (the FAO Schwarz support center). The Debtors plan to relocate to smaller facilities or reduce considerably in size both
of these locations and such locations will serve as satellite buying offices for the Debtors' ongoing operations. The Debtors have requested court authority to reject these leases as well. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the thirty-nine weeks ended November&nbsp;2, 2002, on a consolidated basis, the Debtors reported net sales of approximately $267&nbsp;million. As of
November&nbsp;2, 2002, the Debtors' books and records reflect, on a book value basis, assets totaling approximately $257.9&nbsp;million and liabilities totaling approximately $238&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
the Petition Date through the date hereof, the Debtors have closed two stores and one temporary store. In addition, the Debtors have obtained court approval to begin store closing
sales at 83 of its stores, and to reject the leases for those stores upon conclusion of the sales. Such store-closing sales are underway. In addition, the Debtors are currently executing plans to
increase the non-holiday business done in their FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy stores. Finally, the Debtors have engaged Morgan Joseph&nbsp;&amp; Co.,&nbsp;Inc. to raise approximately
$30&nbsp;million in additional equity capital upon </FONT></P>

United States Bankruptcy Code.<SUP>2</SUP>
In consideration, ZB Company agreed to pay the following: $7.5&nbsp;million in cash and 1.1&nbsp;million shares of FAO common stock to the Zany Brainy estate for the benefit of unsecured
creditors; $65.8&nbsp;million
(excluding renewed letters of credit) to Zany Brainy's Debtor in Possession lender to be paid at closing from the proceeds of a Loan and Security Agreement that ZB Company obtained (the "ZB Credit
Facility"); $1.1&nbsp;million in bankruptcy-related professional fees of the Zany Brainy estate; $2.1&nbsp;million paid into an escrow at the closing for Zany Brainy management retention bonuses;
and certain other less significant amounts. This price was partially offset by $4.2&nbsp;million owed by the Zany Brainy estate to certain investors. Additionally, ZB Company assumed certain other
liabilities of the Zany Brainy estate of approximately $39.5&nbsp;million consisting of post-petition trade payables, settlement amounts, other bankruptcy-related professional fees,
sales and payroll taxes, accrued salaries and employee benefit obligations and customer gift certificates and merchandise credits. The Zany Brainy asset acquisition was financed with the issuance of
common stock and proceeds from the issuance of contingent convertible preferred stock (since converted), contingent convertible notes (since converted) and the ZB Credit Facility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of the Petition Date, the Debtors estimate that their outstanding obligations to vendors, suppliers and other unsecured creditors aggregated approximately $69&nbsp;million,
including potential damage claims of landlords and other parties to executory contracts and unexpired leases that are expected to be rejected during the chapter 11 cases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>C. </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Events Leading to the Commencement of the Reorganization Cases.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Debtors focused on integrating their operations. In particular, the Debtors opened Right Start boutiques in approximately 98 Zany Brainy stores in
order to increase the sales per square foot in those stores and even out its revenue stream. In addition, the Debtors eliminated four distribution centers, opened a new distribution center in Ontario,
California, reorganized its merchandising functions to separate merchandising from administration, centralized its inventory management, information systems and accounting administration, centralized
catalog and internet operations and outsourced fulfillment operations, reduced inventory shrinkage, improved store expense management, implemented sales training, and hired a marketing executive. In
addition, the Debtors remerchandised
all Zany Brainy stores to include items sought by customers but not previously stocked, including FAOtm plush, car seats, Barbietm and action hero toys. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
the past fiscal year also presented the Debtors with several significant challenges that cumulatively resulted in the need to file the Reorganization Cases. The events of
September&nbsp;11, 2001, a weak economic environment, a soft retail market, reduced travel and tourism, and restrained consumer spending at a time when the Debtors were continuing to integrate their
FAO, Right Start and Zany Brainy operations, all impacted the Debtors' sales. In particular, certain of the Debtors' store locations did not perform to expectations, affecting the Debtors' overall
operations. As a result, the Debtors expect to have suffered a significant loss for fiscal year 2002. In addition to the difficult sales environment, certain restrictions on the Debtors' ability to
borrow under the Prepetition Financing Facility as described below have had a serious impact on the Debtors' liquidity and cash flow, leading to the Debtors' bankruptcy filing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the Petition Date, the Debtors obtained cash for operations from cash flow from operations and availability under the Prepetition Financing Facility. The amount the Debtors
could borrow under the Prepetition Financing Facility was directly related to the Debtors' inventory level and the applicable monthly inventory advance rate. The Debtors' liquidity during the third
quarter of last year was restricted due to the amount by which the Debtors increased inventory levels to prepare for the holiday selling season coupled with the lack of normal vendor terms. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<!-- ZEQ.=3,SEQ=15,EFW="2102365",CP="FAO INC.",DN="3",CHK=989914,FOLIO='14',FILE='DISK039:[03BHL1.03BHL1091]KK1091A.;4',USER='LRAMIRE',CD=';4-FEB-2003;01:36' -->
<A NAME="page_kk1091_1_15"> </A>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the month of November&nbsp;2002, the Bank implemented additional availability reserves in the amount of $10&nbsp;million. In November, the Debtors' borrowing base was
substantially higher than the maximum loan commitment and therefore the new availability reserves had no adverse effect on the Debtors' ability to borrow fully under the current maximum loan
commitment. However, in December&nbsp;2002, as inventory was sold down, the borrowing base decreased below the maximum commitment, at which point the Debtors' ability to borrow became restricted by
these additional reserves. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;2002, the Debtors also entered into a third amendment to the Prepetition Financing Facility which added a covenant limiting the effective advance rate to amounts that
decrease on a weekly basis through December&nbsp;27, 2002 to 35% of eligible inventory. This reduced advance rate was to remain in effect after December&nbsp;27, 2002, until a new effective
advance rate was to be determined by the Bank in connection with the Debtors' business plan for fiscal year 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of result of the liquidity problems resulting from the general slump in retail sales, the poor performance of many of the stores acquired from Zany Brainy, and the lack of borrowing
availability under the Prepetition Financing Facility, it became apparent to the Debtors that a financial restructuring was imperative. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;13, 2002, the amount available under the Prepetition Financing Facility was only $1.0&nbsp;million. Without such restrictions, availability would have been
$23.1&nbsp;million. The Debtors' inability to reduce the outstanding borrowings to the Bank's borrowing limit, or to obtain the Bank's consent to relief from the restrictions could have caused the
entire borrowing under the Prepetition Financing Facility to become due and immediately payable, and, absent another funding source, would severely impact the Debtors' ability to continue as a going
concern. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
order to preserve options while efforts were undertaken to restructure or replace the Prepetition Financing Facility, the Debtor and the Bank entered into a Forbearance Agreement
dated December&nbsp;22, 2002 (the "Forbearance Agreement"). The Forbearance Agreement was designed to maintain the status quo as of the date thereof. The Forbearance Agreement expired on
January&nbsp;10, 2003, but was ultimately extended to January&nbsp;13, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;13, 2003 (the "Petition Date"), the Debtors commenced the Reorganization Cases in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors continue to operate their
businesses and manage their properties as debtors in possession pursuant to sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;21, 2003, the Office of the United States Trustee appointed the Creditors' Committee to represent the interests of unsecured creditors of the
Debtors. Since its formation, the Debtors have consulted with the Creditors' Committee concerning the administration of the Reorganization Cases. The Debtors have kept the Creditors' Committee
informed about their operations and have sought the concurrence of the Creditors' Committee for actions and transactions taken outside of the ordinary course of the Debtors' business. The Creditors'
Committee has participated actively, together with the Debtors' management and professionals, in, among other things, reviewing the Debtors' business plans and operations. The Proponents and their
professionals have met with the Creditors' Committee and its professionals on numerous occasions in connection with the negotiation of the Plan. As of the date of filing of this Disclosure Statement,
negotiations with the Creditors' Committee are continuing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the initial stages of the Reorganization Cases, the Debtors devoted their attention to stabilizing their operations and re-establishing a free
flow of merchandise to their stores. The first step in this process was obtaining court approval of the use of cash collateral pursuant to an agreement with the Banks, thereby restoring vendor
confidence in the Debtors' ability to pay for merchandise and insuring that they have sufficient capital resources to operate during their Reorganization Cases. The Debtors have worked with the
Creditors' Committee and certain critical vendors to obtain payment terms that would permit continued operations by the Debtors. In addition, the Debtors have begun discussions with the Creditors'
Committee and certain vendors who typically accept returns of merchandise to arrange for merchandise returns and guarantees of ongoing trade credit under section&nbsp;546(g)* of the Bankruptcy Code.
To further stabilize employee relations, the Debtors are seeking court approval of key employee and executive retention programs and severance programs. These programs will help ensure that the
employees and executives most important to the Debtors' successful reorganization are more incentivized to remain employed with the Debtors and properly </FONT></P>

course of the Debtors' businesses. This relief was essential to minimize disruptions to the Debtors' businesses as a result of the commencement of the Reorganization Cases. Additionally, other first
day orders were obtained to authorize joint administration of the Debtors' estates, employment of a noticing agent, payment of prepetition obligations of customs duties and broker's fees, adequate
assurance of future payments to utility companies, continued use of cash management systems, payment of prepetition sales and use taxes and continuation of insurance matters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the Petition Date, the Debtors extensively reviewed the performance of all of their retail store locations, including a review of the profitability of each store on a
stand-alone basis. In certain instances, even when a particular store was profitable on a stand-alone basis, the Debtors considered other factors, such as whether the store provided an adequate return
on investment capital or whether the store location was in a "growth" area, before making a decision regarding whether to maintain or
close the store. As a result of this review process, the Debtors identified approximately 80 underperforming and/or unprofitable stores that the Debtors determined should be closed as part of the
Debtors' overall business strategy for increasing profitability. The Debtors determined that conducting store closing or going out of business sales ("GOB Sales") at these stores prior to their
closing would provide the best opportunity for maximizing the value of the inventory located within these stores. To assist in the process of closing these stores, the Debtors entered into an
agreement with The Ozer Group LLC, The Great American Group LLC, and Gordon Brother Retail Partners LLC (collectively, the "GOB Consultant"). </FONT></P>

Further, during the Reorganization Cases, and in the ordinary course of their businesses, the Debtors have sought to amend certain terms of some of their Real Property Leases. These amendments involve
concessions from landlords (rent, common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes), modifications to the term of certain store leases, and other minor or technical modifications. In addition to
the leases rejected in conjunction with the store closings, the Debtors also rejected certain other real property leases as well, including leases of certain office space used by the Debtors in
California and New York. The statutory deadline for determining whether to assume or reject their Real Property Leases currently expires on March&nbsp;14, 2003. The Debtors anticipate that they will

and ZB Company, along with Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc. ("Plaintiffs") filed a First Amended Complaint against Ingram Book Company ("Ingram") in the United States Bankruptcy Court,
District of Delaware (Adv. No.&nbsp;02-4754 associated with the Chapter 11 case of Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc., Case No.&nbsp;01-1749
(MFW)). In the Complaint the Plaintiffs are seeking damages against Ingram for Ingram's alleged failure to honor the terms of an agreement made under section&nbsp;546(g)* of the Bankruptcy Code
requiring Ingram to provide a continuous supply of books and related items for the duration of the agreement and provide revolving trade credit terms. To induce Ingram to enter into this agreement,
Plaintiffs were required to return products to Ingram for credit against Ingram's prepetition claims. Plaintiffs allege that the book returns amounted to approximately $1.5&nbsp;million and that
Ingram is obligated to repay this amount according to the terms of the agreement. The Complaint further alleges that Ingram, after receiving the book returns, refused to sell product to Plaintiffs on
any terms, whether cash or otherwise in further violation of the agreement and that Ingram's actions caused substantial damages to Plaintiffs. The Complaint includes claims based on breach of
contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel and fraud. Plaintiffs seek an award of damages according to proof at trial together with punitive damages.
The Debtors believe this lawsuit is a very valuable asset. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
lease between Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc. and Carousel Center Company, LP was assigned to ZB Company. The lessor filed a motion seeking allowance and payment of back taxes and related
charges allegedly due under the lease. Upon investigation, ZB Company determined that it, along with Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc., had overpaid taxes and therefore the landlord was indebted to ZB Company
(as successor in interest to the rights of Zany Brainy,&nbsp;Inc.) for at least $458,000. The hearing on the landlord's motion has been continued due to the filing of the Reorganization Cases and
the automatic stay. Additionally, to recover the overpayments, the Debtors must initiate an adversary proceeding against the landlord. Although no adversary proceeding has been filed as yet, the
Debtors plan to file such a proceeding in the near future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
claims, if successfully prosecuted may result in substantial additional funds for the Debtors. The projections do not take into account any potential recoveries from the above

distribution center, and executive employees. Further, in conjunction with the Employee Retention Orders, the Debtors propose to pay retention bonuses totaling $1,650,000 to 15 senior management level
employees. Additionally, the Debtors propose to pay retention bonuses to certain of their lower management level employees in a total amount not to exceed $350,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;31, 2003, the Proponents Filed their proposed joint plan of reorganization (the "Plan"). The Plan is the product of negotiations and discussions among the Debtors, the
Creditors' Committee, and various other creditors that are continuing. These negotiations pertain to, among other matters, the classification and treatment of Claims and Interests; the compromise and
settlement of disputes regarding the nature and amount of certain Claims and Interests; the amount of Cash to be distributed on account of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests; and certain other
issues. The Proponents expect that they may need to amend the Plan to reflect the final product of these negotiations at a later date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to section&nbsp;1121 of the Bankruptcy Code, (a)&nbsp;only the debtor may file&nbsp;a plan of reorganization during the 120-day period following the
commencement of a chapter 11 case (the "Exclusive Filing Period"); and (b)&nbsp;if the debtor files a plan of reorganization during the Exclusive Filing Period, only the debtor may solicit
acceptances of such plan of reorganization, and no other party may file&nbsp;a competing plan of reorganization, during the 180-day period following the commencement of a chapter 11 case
(the "Exclusive Solicitation Period"). On request of a party in interest, the Bankruptcy Court, for cause, may extend, shorten or terminate the Exclusive Filing Period and/or the Exclusive
Solicitation Period. The Exclusive Filing Period in this case initially was to expire on March&nbsp;13, 2003. The Debtors filed the Plan prior to the expiration of such Exclusive Filing Period. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>V. THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objectives of the Plan are to: (a)&nbsp;alter the Debtors' debt and capital structures to permit them to emerge from their Reorganization Cases as
viable entities, (b)&nbsp;maximize the value of the ultimate recoveries to all creditor and equity holder groups on a fair and equitable basis, and (c)&nbsp;settle,
compromise or otherwise dispose of certain Claims and Interests on terms that the Debtors believe to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of their respective estates, creditors and equity
holders. The Plan provides for, among other things: (i)&nbsp;the settlement of certain indebtedness in exchange for Cash, (ii)&nbsp;the discharge of Claims, (iii)&nbsp;issuance of additional
Interests as part of the New Equity Financing, (iv)&nbsp;compromise and settlement of certain contingent Claims and exchange of mutual releases among the Debtors, the Entities and holders of Claims
and Interests, and (v)&nbsp;assumption, or rejection, as appropriate, of executory contracts and unexpired leases to which any Debtor is a party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Proponents believe that (a)&nbsp;through the Plan, holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests will obtain a substantially greater recovery from the estates of the Debtors than
the recovery they would receive if the assets of the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (b)&nbsp;the Plan will afford the Debtors the opportunity and ability to
continue in business as a viable going concern, be a source of continuing business to and profits for vendors and preserve ongoing employment for the Debtors' employees. The Plan is annexed hereto as
Exhibit&nbsp;A and forms part of this Disclosure Statement. The summary of the Plan set forth in this Disclosure Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed provisions
of the Plan. </FONT></P>

rendered or expenses incurred in the Reorganization Cases on or prior to the Effective Date (including expenses of the members of the Creditors' Committee incurred as members of the Creditors'
Committee in discharge of their duties as such). All payments to Professionals for Fee Claims will be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules
and the Bankruptcy Court relating to the payment of interim and final compensation for services rendered and reimbursement of expenses. The aggregate amount of compensation for services rendered and
reimbursement of expenses incurred by Professionals (including professionals employed by the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee), through the Effective Date of the Plan is estimated to be
$4&nbsp;million. The Bankruptcy Court will review and determine all applications for compensation for services rendered and reimbursement of expenses. </FONT></P>

Professional who may receive compensation or reimbursement of expenses pursuant to the Ordinary Course Professionals Order

are required to File and serve applications for final allowance of their Fee Claims and that do not File and serve such applications by the required deadline shall be forever barred from asserting
such Claims against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or their respective property and such Fee Claims shall be deemed discharged as of the Effective Date. Objections to any Fee Claim must be
Filed and served on the Proponents and the requesting party by 120&nbsp;days after the Effective Date. To the extent necessary, entry of the Confirmation Order shall amend and supersede any
previously entered order of the Bankruptcy Court, including the Fee Order, regarding the payment of Allowed Fee Claims for services and costs incurred subsequent to the Effective Date. From and after
the Effective Date, no professional shall be entitled to compensation for post-Effective Date services rendered unless specifically agreed by the Reorganized Debtors.
Post-Effective Date fees and costs may be paid by the Reorganized Debtors without further Order of the Court. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A. </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Solicitation of Votes  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following classes of claims are impaired and entitled to vote on the Plan Classes 4, 5, 8 and 10. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
to classes of claims entitled to vote on a plan, the Bankruptcy Code defines acceptance of a plan by a class of creditors as acceptance by holders of at least two-thirds
in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of the claims of that class that have timely voted to accept or reject a plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
to classes of interests entitled to vote on a plan, acceptance is defined as acceptance by holders of at least two-thirds of the number of shares in such class that have
timely voted to accept or reject a plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
vote may be disregarded if the Bankruptcy Court determines, after notice and a hearing, that acceptance or rejection was not solicited or procured in good faith or in accordance with
the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Disclosure Statement Order, a copy of which is annexed hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B, solely for purposes of voting to accept or reject the Plan and not for the purpose of
allowance of, or distribution on account of, a Claim and without prejudice to the rights of the Debtors in any other context, each Claim within a Class of Claims to be entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan will be temporarily Allowed in an amount equal to the amount of such Claim as set forth in a timely Filed proof of claim, or, if no proof of claim was Filed, the amount of such Claim
as set forth in the Schedules. The foregoing general procedure will be subject to the following qualifications: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Claim is deemed Allowed in accordance with the Plan, such Claim is Allowed for voting purposes in the deemed Allowed amount set forth in the Plan; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Claim for which a proof of claim has been timely Filed is marked as contingent, unliquidated or disputed, such Claim will be temporarily Allowed for voting purposes
only, and not for purposes of allowance of distribution, at $1.00; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Claim has been estimated or otherwise Allowed for voting purposes by order of the Bankruptcy Court, such Claim shall be temporarily Allowed in the amount so
estimated or Allowed by the Bankruptcy Court for voting purposes only, and not for purposes of allowance or distribution; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Claim is listed in the Schedules as contingent, unliquidated or disputed and a proof of claim was not (i)&nbsp;Filed by the Bar Date or (ii)&nbsp;deemed timely
Filed by an order of the Bankruptcy Court prior to the Voting Deadline, such Claim will be disallowed for voting purposes and for purposes of allowance and distribution pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rule&nbsp;3003(c); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Proponents have served and Filed an objection to a Claim at least ten days before the Voting Deadline, such Claim will be temporarily disallowed for voting
purposes only and not for the purposes of the allowance or distribution except to the extent and in the manner as may be set forth in the objection; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that if such Claim was listed in the Schedules, such Claim shall be temporarily allowed, for voting purposes only, in an amount equal to the amount of such Claim as

the Voting Deadline shall be deemed to reflect the voter's intent and thus to supersede any prior Ballots. Creditors must vote all of their Claims within a particular Class under the Plan either to

Among the requirements for confirmation of a plan are that the plan is (a)&nbsp;accepted by all impaired classes of claims and equity
interests or, if rejected by an impaired class, that the plan "does not discriminate unfairly" and is "fair and equitable" as to such class, (b)&nbsp;feasible and (c)&nbsp;in the "best interests"

obtain non-consensual confirmation of the Plan, it must be demonstrated to the Bankruptcy Court that the Plan "does not discriminate unfairly" and is "fair and equitable"

"cram down" tests for secured creditors, unsecured creditors and equity holders, as follows: </FONT></P>

Bankruptcy Code permits a plan to be confirmed if it is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization. For purposes of determining whether
the Plan meets this requirement, the Debtors have analyzed their ability to meet their obligations under the Plan. As part of this analysis, the Debtors have prepared the projections of their
financial performance for each of the three fiscal years following the Effective Date. These projections demonstrate that the Debtors will
be able to meet their financial obligations under the Plan. The projections are attached to this Disclosure Statement as Exhibit&nbsp;D.<SUP>3</SUP>
Accordingly, the Proponents believe that confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further reorganization of the Debtors. </FONT></P>

Debtors have prepared two sets of projections based on alternative assumptions. One set assumes that all holders of Claims in Class 8 elect treatment under Option A.
The second set assumes that all holders of Claims in Class 8 elect treatment under Option B. It is expected that some holders will elect Option A, and others will elect Option B. However, the Debtors
believe that the Plan is feasible under either scenario, or a combination thereof.

respect to each impaired Class of Claims and Interests, confirmation of the Plan requires that each holder of a Claim or Interest either (a)&nbsp;accept the Plan or
(b)&nbsp;receive or retain under the Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than the value such holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. To determine what holders of Claims and Interests of each impaired Class would receive if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7, the Bankruptcy Court must
determine the dollar amount that would be generated from the liquidation of the Debtors' assets and properties in the context of a chapter 7 liquidation case. The Cash amount that would be available
for satisfaction of unsecured non-priority Claims and Interests would consist of the proceeds resulting from the disposition of the unencumbered assets and properties of the Debtors,
augmented by the unencumbered Cash held by the Debtors at the time of the commencement of the liquidation case and litigation recoveries, if any. Such Cash amount would be reduced by the amount of the
costs and expenses of the liquidation and by such additional </FONT></P>

administrative and priority claims that might result from the termination of the Debtors' business and the use of chapter 7 for the purposes of liquidation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Debtors' costs of liquidation under chapter 7 would include the fees payable to a trustee in bankruptcy, as well as those fees that might be payable to attorneys and other
professionals that such a trustee might engage. In addition, claims would arise by reason of the breach or rejection of obligations incurred and leases and executory contracts assumed or entered into
by the Debtors during the pendency of the Reorganization Cases. The foregoing types of claims and other claims that might arise in a liquidation case or result from the pending Reorganization Cases,
including any unpaid expenses incurred by the Debtors during the Reorganization Cases such as compensation for attorneys, financial advisors and accountants, would be paid in full from the liquidation
proceeds before the balance of those proceeds would be made available to pay prepetition general unsecured claims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
determine if the Plan is in the best interests of each impaired class, the present value of the distributions from the proceeds of a liquidation of the Debtors' unencumbered assets
and properties, after subtracting the amounts attributable to the foregoing claims, are then compared with the value of the property offered to such Classes of Claims and Interests under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
considering the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the ultimate proceeds available for distribution to creditors in the Reorganization Cases, including
(a)&nbsp;the increased costs and expenses of a liquidation under chapter 7 arising from fees payable to a trustee in bankruptcy and professionals retained by such trustee, (b)&nbsp;the erosion in
value of assets in a chapter 7 case associaetd with the "forced sale" atmosphere that would prevail, and (c)&nbsp;the substantial increases in claims which would be satisfied on a priority basis or
on parity with creditors in the Reorganization Cases, the Debtors have determined that confirmation of the Plan will provide each holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest with a recovery that is not
less than such holder would receive pursuant to liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Debtors also believe that the value of any distributions to each class of Allowed Claims in a chapter 7 case, including all Secured Claims, would be less than the value of
distributions under the Plan because such distributions in a chapter 7 case would not occur for a substantial period of time. It is likely that distribution of the proceeds of the liquidation could be
delayed for two years after the completion of such liquidation in order to resolve claims and prepare for distributions. In the likely event litigation was necessary to resolve claims asserted in the
chapter 7 case, the delay could be prolonged. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Debtors' Liquidation Analysis is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;E. The information set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;E provides a summary of the liquidation values of the Debtors'
assets, assuming a chapter 7 liquidation in which a trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court would liquidate the assets of the Debtors' estates. Reference should be made to the Liquidation Analysis
for the estimated recoveries in chapter 7. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying
the Liquidation Analysis are a number of estimates and assumptions that, although developed and considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of the Debtors and their management. The Liquidation Analysis is also based on assumptions with regard to liquidation
decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, the values reflected might not be realized if the Debtors were, in fact, to undergo such a liquidation. The chapter 7 liquidation period is assumed
to be a period of up to six months, allowing for, among other things, the (a)&nbsp;discontinuation of operations, (b)&nbsp;selling of assets and (c)&nbsp;collection of receivables. </FONT></P>

The Effective Date will not occur, and accordingly, no action in connection therewith shall occur, unless and until the following conditions have been satisfied or duly waived pursuant to
Section&nbsp;9.02 of the Plan: (a)&nbsp;the Confirmation Order shall have been entered, shall not have been reversed, stayed, modified or amended and shall have become a Final Order;
(b)&nbsp;all actions, documents and agreements necessary to implement the Plan shall have been effected or executed; (c)&nbsp;the Debtors shall have received all authorizations, consents,
regulatory approvals, rulings, letters, no-action letters, opinions or documents that are determined by the Debtors to be necessary to implement the Plan; (d)&nbsp;the Reorganized
Debtors shall have entered into the Exit Financing Facility in form and substance acceptable to the Debtors; and (e)&nbsp;the Debtors shall have obtained the Exit Equity Financing on terms
acceptable to the Debtors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Debtors intend to raise not less than $30&nbsp;million in additional capital through the Exit Equity Financing. To that end the Debtors have engaged Morgan
Joseph&nbsp;&amp; Co. to act as investment bankers for the Debtors. The Exit Equity is expected to take the form of additional FAO Common Stock or capital stock convertible into FAO Common Stock that
would dilute the ownership interest of current FAO Common Stock holders. While the exact form of the Exit Equity Financing and the amount of dilution are still unknown, the Debtors expect dilution to
be significant and make no assurances that existing holders of FAO Common Stock will retain significant or any equity interest in Reorganized Debtors. The New Certificate of Incorporation is expected
to authorize the issuance of additional FAO Common Stock in an amount sufficient to permit the issuance of the Exit Equity. In addition, the Debtors currently anticipate that the purchasers of the
Exit Equity may want FAO to remain a public company listed on Nasdaq and, as are result, the New Certificate of Incorporation is expected to effectuate a reverse stock split to permit the minimum
share price to be sufficiently high for Nasdaq listing. Nasdaq has notified FAO that the FAO Common Stock is subject to delisting as a result of the bankruptcy Filing. Amendments of a Nasdaq listed
company's charter documents normally require a shareholder vote under Nasdaq rules and there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will waive these requirements or permit FAO to retain its listing. </FONT></P>

institutions with whom it is currently in discussions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Exit Financing is expected to consist of a revolving credit facility permitting borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $77&nbsp;million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exit Financing
Facility is expected to consist of (a)&nbsp;revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $70&nbsp;million dollars ("Tranche A") and
(b)&nbsp;a $7&nbsp;million special subline revolving facility ("Tranche B"). Interest would be expected to be charged on a sliding scale based on the financial condition of the Reorganized Debtors
and to include options based on LIBOR or prime rate. The Reorganized Debtors have offered to pay a fee equal to $770,000 to the lenders under the Exit Financing at the closing plus other monthly fees
as are customary. The borrowing base on the Tranche A facility is expected be an amount equal to the lesser of (a)&nbsp;$70&nbsp;million and (b)(i)&nbsp;85% of the net retail liquidation value
("NRLV") of eligible inventory less reserves ("Tranche A Inventory Borrowing Base") plus (ii)&nbsp;90% of receivables which would consist solely of credit card "float". The borrowing base for the

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>VIII. SECURITIES LAWS MATTERS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1145 of the Bankruptcy Code generally exempts from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the offer or
sale of a debtor's securities under a chapter 11 plan if such securities are offered or sold in exchange for a claim against, or interest in, such debtor. In reliance upon this exemption, the portion
of the Exit Equity to be issued on the Effective Date to Kayne Anderson as provided in the Plan for the Kayne Anderson Note will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
state securities laws. Accordingly, such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws pursuant to the exemption provided by Section&nbsp;4(1) of
the Securities Act, unless the holder is an "underwriter" with respect to such securities, as that term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1145(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code defines "underwriter" for purposes of the Securities Act as one who (a)&nbsp;purchases a claim with a view to distribution of any security
to be received in exchange for the claim other than in ordinary trading transactions, (b)&nbsp;offers to sell securities issued under a plan for the holders of such securities, (c)&nbsp;offers to
buy securities issued under a plan from persons receiving such securities, if the offer to buy is made with a view to distributions, or (d)&nbsp;is a control person of the issuer of the securities.
Since Kayne Anderson is such a control person, it will be deemed an "underwriter." Accordingly, it may resell such securities only pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act or an
exemption therefrom, including the exemption provided by Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act. Such Rule generally permits the resale of securities received by statutory underwriters pursuant to a
chapter 11 plan, subject to applicable volume limitations, notice and manner of sale requirements, and certain other conditions. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
exemption provided in section&nbsp;1145(a) will not be available for investors in the Exit Equity Financing other than Kayne Anderson. The Exit Equity to be issued on the Effective
Date to investors other than in exchange for the Kayne Anderson Note will be sold under an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Such securities may not be resold without
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from such requirements. The holders of the Exit Equity will be parties to a registration rights agreement with the Reorganized FAO, which will
give them the right to cause the Exit Equity to be registered for resale under the Securities Act, subject to certain conditions and limitations contained in such agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Debtors have been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January&nbsp;13, 2003. In conjunction with the Reorganization Cases and the Plan, the Debtors have closed,
and plan to close, numerous Right Start, Zany Brainy and FAO Schwarz stores, are restructuring their subordinated debt, obtaining the Exit Financing and conducting the Exit Equity Financing, and are
reducing the claims of the Debtors' unsecured creditors at a discount, including the claims of the Debtors' vendors and suppliers. The Debtors expect to renew relationships with customers and vendors
as they emerge from bankruptcy, but there can be no assurances that the Debtors' bankruptcy filing will not have a residual effect on the Debtors' future business even after Confirmation of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Plan, the Debtors have been conducting going-out-of-business sales at the store locations that they plan to close, and also
conducting certain sales promotions at various other stores. The Debtors' assumptions regarding the performance of the stores the Debtors have elected to retain may be incorrect and the Debtors may
not have selected enough stores for closure. In addition, the Debtors have deferred their expansion plans and have deferred other planned capital improvements.
There can be no assurance that the Debtors will be able to resume these growth initiatives in the near term. </FONT></P>

business.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating
results in the Debtor's Zany Brainy and FAO Schwarz stores depend to a significant extent on sales at those stores during the months of November and December, resulting in
operating losses for most of the year and making annual operating results difficult to predict. The Debtors currently are funding operations under a court order that permits the Debtors to use cash
that is the collateral for the lenders under the Debtors' pre-petition credit facility, until April&nbsp;4, 2003. If the Debtors' do not consummate the Plan or an alternative plan on or
prior to April&nbsp;4, 2003, the Debtors' current lenders and other creditors may force a liquidation of the Debtors' remaining assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
claims under the Debtors' pre-petition credit facility will be discharged upon consummation of the Plan. In order to finance the discharge, the Debtors will enter into
the Exit Financing Facility. The Exit Financing Facility is expected to consist of a revolving credit facility permitting borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $77&nbsp;million.
Borrowings under the Exit Financing Facility are expected to be based on a percentage of the Reorganized Debtors' inventory and receivables. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Debtors believe that they were forced to file bankruptcy protection when they did instead of effectuating an out of court restructuring in part due to restrictions imposed under
their pre-petition credit facility. The Exit Financing Facility is expected to include provisions that similarly would give the lenders under the Exit Financing Facility significant
discretion to limit Debtor's ability to borrow under the Exit Financing Facility and would include a number of financial and operating covenants. The Debtors can make no assurances that the lenders
under the Exit Financing Facility will grant waivers or amendments in connection with the Reorganized Debtors' failure to comply with any of these covenants in the future. If the Reorganized Debtors
were to fail to comply with covenants under the Exit Financing Facility and the lenders were not to waive noncompliance, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of obligations under the Exit
Financing Facility, refuse to extend additional credit to the Reorganized Debtors and exercise other remedies which would significantly restrict the Reorganized Debtors' cash flow and limit their
ability to operate their business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Exit Financing Facility is also expected to limit the Debtors' ability to borrow additional money, pay dividends, dispose of assets, make additional corporate investments, increase
director and officer compensation and experience a change of control. The Reorganized Debtors' ability to take desired corporate actions and to fund operations will be dependent on compliance with
these restrictions or the Reorganized Debtors' ability to obtain waivers of them. The Debtors can make no assurances that the Reorganized Debtors will be able to comply with these restrictions or that
the lender under the Exit Financing Facility would waive such restrictions. </FONT></P>

mass market retailers and discounters, such as Toys "R' Us, Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com, have strong brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other
resources than do the Debtors. The Reorganized Debtors could be at a disadvantage in responding to these competitors' merchandising and pricing strategies, advertising campaigns and other initiatives.
Several of these competitors, including Toys "R' Us, have launched successful internet shopping sites which compete with the Debtors' stores and internet marketing channels. In addition, an increase
in focus on the specialty retail market or the sale by these competitors of more products similar to the Reorganized Debtors' products (as has recently been the case) could cause the Reorganized
Debtors to lose market share or selling margin as a result of the need to discount or increase advertising. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>X. CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a summary of certain federal income tax consequences of the implementation of the Plan to the Debtors and to the holders of certain Claims. This
discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code"), Treasury regulations promulgated and proposed thereunder, judicial decisions and published administrative rules
and pronouncements of the IRS as in effect on the date hereof. Changes in such rules or new interpretations thereof may have a retroactive effect and could significantly affect the federal income tax
consequences described below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
federal income tax consequences of the Plan are complex and are subject to significant uncertainties. The Debtors have not requested a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel
with respect to any tax aspects of the Plan. Thus, no assurance can be given as to the IRS' interpretation of any aspect of the Plan. In addition, this discussion does not address the federal income
tax consequences of the Plan to holders whose Claims are entitled to payment in full in Cash or are otherwise unimpaired (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>e.g.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Allowed
Non-Tax Priority Claims) and Stock Interests, any non-income, foreign, state or local tax consequences of the Plan, or the federal income tax consequences of the Plan to
special classes of taxpayers (such as foreign taxpayers, broker-dealers, banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, financial institutions, small business investment companies, regulated investment
companies, tax-exempt organizations, and investors in pass-through entities). Moreover, this summary applies only to
taxpayers who hold their Claims and any property received in connection with the Plan as capital assets within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1221 of the Tax Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For federal income tax purposes, the Debtors expect to report consolidated net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately

tax basis in their assets. As discussed below, such NOL carryforwards and other losses will be eliminated as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the Debtors' tax basis in their respective
assets will be significantly reduced. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
implementation of the Plan, the amount of the Debtors' aggregate outstanding indebtedness will be reduced. In general, the Tax Code provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case must
reduce certain of its tax attributes (such as its NOL carryforwards and any current year NOL, tax credits and, subject to certain limitations, tax basis in assets) by the amount of any cancellation of
debt ("COD") income. COD income is the amount by which the indebtedness discharged exceeds any consideration given in exchange therefor. To the extent the amount of COD income realized in a Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceeding exceeds the tax attributes available for reduction, the excess is not taxed. As a result of the disposition of the Class&nbsp;4, 5, 7 and 8 Claims pursuant to the Plan, the
Debtors expect to realize COD income and to incur tax attribute reduction, except to the extent that one or more statutory exceptions to COD income and tax attribute reduction apply (such as where the
payment of the portion of the cancelled debt which is discharged would have given rise to a tax deduction). As result of such tax attribute reduction, it is anticipated that the aggregate tax basis of
the Debtors' respective inventory assets will be significantly reduced, thus causing the Debtors to realize greater amounts of taxable income upon the ultimate sale of such inventory assets than they
otherwise would realize if the Plan had not been implemented. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
not free from doubt, based on existing authorities, the Debtors believe that any reduction in tax attributes generally should apply separately to the particular corporation
which is realizing COD income, even though the Debtors file&nbsp;a consolidated federal income tax return. The IRS has recently taken the position, however, that consolidated NOLs must be reduced
irrespective of the source of
those losses. The current IRS position as to the impact of the attribute reduction rules on other tax attributes of consolidated group members is unclear. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, any reduction in tax attributes does not effectively occur until the first day of the tax year following the tax year in which the COD income is realized. Accordingly, the
consolidated NOL carryforwards and other losses of the Debtors should be available to offset any gain recognized in connection with the implementation of the Plan, subject to certain limitations
imposed on the utilization of NOL carryforwards under the federal alternative minimum tax. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
implementation of the Plan, the Debtors expect to realize approximately $63&nbsp;million of COD income and to incur a corresponding amount of tax attribute reduction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due
to the possibility that a holder of an Allowed Class&nbsp;8 Claim may receive a Cash distribution subsequent to the Effective Date of the Plan, any loss and a portion of any gain
realized by such holder may be deferred until such time as such holder has received its final Cash distribution. In addition, all holders of Allowed Class&nbsp;8 Claims are urged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the possible application of (or the ability to elect out of) the "installment method" of reporting any gain that may be recognized by such holders in respect of their Allowed
Class&nbsp;8 Claims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Plan, all distributions in respect of Allowed Claims will be allocated first to the principal amount thereof, with any excess allocated to unpaid
accrued interest. However, there is no assurance that such allocation will be respected by the IRS for federal income tax purposes. In general, to the extent any amount received by a holder of an
Allowed Claim is received in discharge of interest accrued on such Allowed Claim during its holding period, such amount will be taxable to the holder as interest income (if, under the holder's
applicable accounting method, such interest was not previously included in the holder's gross income). Conversely, a holder of an Allowed Claim will recognize a
deductible loss (or possibly a write-off against a reserve for bad debts) to the extent any accrued interest with respect to such Claim was previously included in its gross income and is
not paid in full. Each holder of an Allowed Claim is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the allocation of consideration and the deductibility of unpaid interest for federal income tax
purposes. </FONT></P>

payments may, under certain circumstances, be subject to "backup withholding" at a 30% rate. Backup withholding generally applies if the holder (a)&nbsp;fails to furnish its social security number
or other taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), (b)&nbsp;furnishes an incorrect TIN, (c)&nbsp;fails to report interest or dividends properly, or (d)&nbsp;under certain circumstances, fails to
provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that the TIN provided is its correct number and that it is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax but merely an advance payment, which may be refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of tax. Certain persons are exempt from backup withholding, including, in certain circumstances,
corporations and financial institutions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plan is not confirmed and consummated, the Proponents' alternatives include (a)&nbsp;the preparation and presentation of an alternative plan or plans of
reorganization, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or portions of the Debtors' assets pursuant to section&nbsp;363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (c)&nbsp;a chapter 11 liquidation or (d)&nbsp;conversion to a
case, and liquidation, under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plan is not confirmed, the Proponents or any other party in interest could attempt to formulate a different plan of reorganization. Such a plan might
involve either a reorganization and continuation of the Debtors' business, a sale of all or a portion of Debtors' assets pursuant to section&nbsp;363 of the Bankruptcy Code or an orderly liquidation
of their assets. During the course of negotiation of the Plan, the Proponents explored various other alternatives and concluded that the Plan represented the best alternative to protect the interests
of creditors and other parties in interest. The Proponents have not changed their conclusions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Proponents believe that the Plan enables the Debtors to successfully and expeditiously emerge from chapter 11, preserves their business and allows creditors and interest holders to
realize the highest recoveries under the circumstances. In a liquidation under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the assets of the Debtors would be sold in an orderly fashion which could occur over a
more extended period of time than in a liquidation under chapter 7 and a trustee need not be appointed. Accordingly, creditors generally would receive greater recoveries than in a chapter 7
liquidation. Under a section&nbsp;363 sale of assets the period of time to conduct the sale would depend on the interest and timeline of prospective buyers. Although a chapter 11 liquidation is
preferable to a chapter 7 liquidation, the Proponents believe that a liquidation under chapter 11 is a much less attractive alternative to creditors and equity interest holders because a greater
return to creditors and equity interest holders is provided for in the Plan. The Proponents believe that a 363 sale of assets would produce less return to creditors and equity interest holders than
the Plan because a prospective buyer would presumably attempt to pay only enough to repay the secured claims leaving no value for holders of unsecured claims or equity interest holders. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no chapter 11 plan can be confirmed, the Reorganization Cases may be converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in which a trustee would be
elected or appointed to liquidate the assets of the Debtors. A discussion of the effect that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the recovery of holders of Claims and Interests is set forth in
Section&nbsp;VI.C.3, "Confirmation and Consummation Procedure&#151;Confirmation&#151;Best Interests Test." The Proponents believe that liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7 would
result in (a)&nbsp;smaller distributions being made to creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of the additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment
of a trustee and attorneys and other professionals to assist such trustee, (b)&nbsp;additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, which would be generated during the
liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of the Debtors' operations, and (c)&nbsp;the failure to realize the greater, going concern
value of the Debtors' assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proponents believe that confirmation and implementation of the Plan is preferable to any of the alternatives described above because it will provide the
greatest recoveries to holders of Claims and Interests. Other alternatives would involve significant delay, uncertainty and substantial additional administrative costs. Consequently, the Proponents
urge all holders of Claims and Interests to vote to accept the Plan and to evidence their acceptance by duly completing and returning their Ballots so that they will be received on or before
