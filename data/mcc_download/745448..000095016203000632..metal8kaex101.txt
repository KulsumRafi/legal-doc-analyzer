     2.6 Nonassignable Assets and Approvals. In the case of any Governmental
Approvals or any Assumed Contracts which by their terms or by virtue of their

to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable

<PAGE>
                                      -21-


amounts are required by Contract or applicable Law to be paid prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any such
consent is not obtained by the Closing Date, Seller agrees to continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such written consent and to
cooperate with the Company so that the Company can obtain the benefits of such
Non-Assigned Asset until such consent is obtained to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt or an
agreement to assign or cause the assignment of any Non-Assigned Asset, unless
the necessary consent shall have been given.

     2.7 Opening Balance Sheet. (a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Metaldyne a draft balance sheet of the
Company as of the Closing Date (the "Opening Balance Sheet"), which shall be
prepared in accordance with the principles set forth in Schedule 2.7.

     (b) Metaldyne shall have a period of twenty (20) days following receipt of
the Opening Balance Sheet from Seller pursuant to Section 2.7(a) within which to
review the Opening Balance Sheet. If Metaldyne has any objections to the draft
Opening Balance Sheet, it will deliver to Seller a detailed statement describing
such objections (the "Metaldyne Objection Notice") within such twenty (20) day
review period. Seller and Metaldyne will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections set forth in the Metaldyne
Objection Notice. If a final resolution is not obtained within a period of
twenty (20) days following delivery of a Metaldyne Objection Notice, Seller and
Metaldyne will select and jointly engage a nationally-recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to them (the "Accountant") to resolve any remaining
objections. The Accountant shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty
(20) days following its engagement by Seller and Metaldyne, deliver to Seller
and Metaldyne its decision as to any remaining objections set forth in the
Metaldyne Objection Notice. The decision of the Accountant shall be final and
binding on Seller and Metaldyne. If Seller and Metaldyne are unable to agree on
the choice of an accounting firm, they will select a nationally-recognized
accounting firm by lot (after excluding their respective independent public
accountants).

     (c) The Company will revise the draft Opening Balance Sheet as appropriate
to reflect the resolution of any objections set forth in the Metaldyne Objection
Notice (as agreed upon by the Seller and Metaldyne or as determined by the
Accountant) and deliver it to Metaldyne within twenty (20) days after the final
resolution of such objections. Such revised draft shall be the Opening Balance
Sheet.

     (d) If any unresolved objections are submitted to the Accountant for
resolution as provided above, the fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Metaldyne. The Company will provide reasonable
access to the work papers necessary for the preparation of the Opening Balance
Sheet to Seller, Metaldyne and the Accountant during the preparation by Seller
of the Opening Balance Sheet, the review by Metaldyne of the Opening Balance
Sheet, and the resolution of any objections with respect thereto.

submitted a letter to the SEC dated November 4, 2002 in which it is seeking
relief with respect to the requirements of Regulation S-X which may be
applicable to Metaldyne as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Relief Letter"). Metaldyne agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to follow
up with the SEC to pursue the relief sought by the Relief Letter. To the extent
that any of the following requirements would be reduced or otherwise modified as
a result of the SEC's response to the Relief Letter or otherwise, Metaldyne
shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such response or other information) inform Seller and provide Seller
with the correspondence from the SEC to that effect and the following shall be
deemed modified to the extent thereof. If the SEC denies or fails to
definitively respond to the Relief Letter on or prior to the Closing Date,
following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Metaldyne the
following financial statements (which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP)
and, in the case of annual financial statements, shall cause KPMG LLP, its
independent auditors ("KPMG"), to audit and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to cause KPMG to conduct a SAS 71 review typical for a
public reporting entity: (1) to permit Metaldyne to make any required filings on
Form 8-K under the Exchange Act following the Closing Date, as soon as
reasonably possible but in no event later than 55 days after the Closing Date
(which time period shall be extended to 65 days in the event that the request in
the Relief Letter or the equivalent thereof is not granted and it would not
prejudice Metaldyne's ability to comply with its reporting obligations under the
Exchange Act), (x) audited financial statements (comprised of consolidated
balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows and statements of
changes in shareholder's equity) of the Business for the two years ended
December 31, 2002 (and the statements of operations and cash flows and
statements of changes in shareholder's equity for the year ended December 31,
2000 if necessary in the reasonable opinion of Metaldyne's auditors to comply
with the requirements of Form 8-K based upon financial information supplied by
Seller to Metaldyne) and (y) with respect to quarterly periods occurring after
December 31, 2002 but prior to the Closing Date (if any), unaudited financial
statements of the Business (comprised of consolidated balance sheets, statements
of operations and cash flows and statements of changes in shareholder's equity),
together with the comparable quarterly period(s) of the immediately preceding
year; and (2) if Metaldyne provides to Seller a written notice (a "Financing
Notice") of an intention to undertake a securities offering (which notice shall
(1) state that Metaldyne intends to pursue a public or private securities
offering and (2) specifically list the financial information required in
connection


<PAGE>
                                      -49-


therewith), to permit Metaldyne to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Act, as promptly as reasonably possible following receipt of the
Financing Notice, such additional historical financial information as would be
required, in the reasonable opinion of Metaldyne's independent auditors, for
inclusion in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (all
such financial statements, together with the Financial Statements, the "Complete
Financial Statements"). In addition to the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall
cause KPMG to, cooperate with Metaldyne's independent auditors in the
preparation of such pro forma financial information as may be required to be
included in a filing on Form 8-K of Metaldyne or as Metaldyne may be required to
include in connection with any securities offering pursuant to the requirements
of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act or may be advised by the lead
underwriter or placement agent in any securities offering is highly advisable
for the securities offering. Metaldyne shall promptly reimburse Seller for all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with KPMG LLP's audit
and review of the Complete Financial Statements (other than the Financial
Statements, which are not being prepared for this purpose) and in connection
with any securities offering. Each of the Company and Metaldyne acknowledge that
(a) the Complete Financial Statements are being prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the SEC and (b) the financial
position of the Business as reflected in the Complete Financial Statements may
differ from that which would have resulted had the Business operated
autonomously or as an entity independent of Seller. In the event that the Seller
is unable to comply with the provisions of this Section notwithstanding the good
faith efforts of Seller, there shall be no liability on the part of Seller for a
breach of this Section and the only consequences will be those following from
the failure to provide the information under Article 15 of the Operating
Agreement.

     8.13 Further Assurances. From time to time, without further consideration,
each of the parties hereto will execute and deliver such documents as such other
party may reasonably request in order more effectively to consummate the
Transactions.

     8.14 UAW Agreement. (a) In its negotiations with the International UAW as
to a new collective bargaining agreement to become effective in 2003, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which in no event will include
agreeing to arrangements that, in Seller's reasonable judgment, would materially
and adversely affect any of Seller's facilities other than the Facility) to
negotiate the sale of the Facility and to obtain the Facility's complete
withdrawal from the DaimlerChrysler/UAW National Agreement including all side
letters, and including, but not limited to, provisions regarding labor
protection (including, but not limited to, the so-called the so-called ESL, BEL,
SWEL and any and all other job security and job security provisions),
outsourcing restrictions, job relocation provisions, mandatory classification
and training provisions, and all other terms and conditions which would in any
way limit the ability of Metaldyne and/or the Company to operate the Facility in
the manner contemplated by the collective bargaining agreement between Metaldyne
and/or the Company and UAW Local 371 following its possible exercise of the
Metaldyne Call Option under the Operating Agreement.

     (b) At the request of Metaldyne, Seller shall provide Metaldyne with
regular updates on negotiations with the International UAW to the extent the
negotiations impact the sale and the employee programs negotiated as part of the
sale of the Facility, as well as copies of all relevant provisions of any
tentative or final agreements reached.

Metaldyne in obtaining all Local Qualified Collective Bargaining Agreements (as
defined in the Operating Agreement) and shall cause the Company to execute such
Local Qualified Collective Bargaining Agreements upon request by Metaldyne.

months following the later of the JV Termination Date or the date on which there
is no additional Product being made for Seller under the Supply Agreement in the
North Building or the Forge Building, Seller shall complete, in accordance with
all applicable Laws, the demolition of the North Building and the Forge Building
within eighteen (18) months after such request; provided that (i) Seller shall
not be obligated to spend more than $6,000,000 in the aggregate in Demolition
Costs and (ii) Seller shall control all actions relating to such demolition. The
parties acknowledge and agree that their mutual intent is for such demolition to
be completed on or prior to December 31, 2006. Seller shall (A) furnish to
Metaldyne in advance of commencing such demolition a written demolition plan and
provide Metaldyne with a reasonable opportunity to review and approve (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such plan (B) demolish
the North Building and the Forge Building in accordance with such approved plan
and (C) keep Metaldyne reasonably informed as to the progress of the same. For
purposes of this Section 8.15, "Demolition Costs" shall mean only Seller's
out-of-pocket costs directly related to the physical demolition of the North
Building and the Forge Building and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include any other Liabilities that may arise out of or result from such
demolition, such as Liabilities under Environmental Laws or Environmental Claims
or the costs of any Remedial Action.

     8.16 Baseline Environmental Remediation. (a) Within thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date, Metaldyne shall engage a qualified environmental consultant
reasonably acceptable to Seller (the "Consultant") to conduct a comprehensive
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment ("Phase II ESA") of the Real Property
(including, without limitation, the Facility), or such portion thereof and any
other Transferred Assets as Metaldyne shall deem appropriate. The Phase II ESA
shall be completed by [*]. The purpose and intent of the Phase II ESA shall be
to identify Environmental Conditions at the Real Property (including, without
limitation, the Facility) and such other Transferred Assets. Seller shall
promptly provide the Consultant with all reasonable and necessary access to the
Real Property (including, without limitation, the Facility) and such other
Transferred Assets and to perform and complete its Phase II ESA. Within ten (10)
days of receiving the final Phase II ESA, Metaldyne shall provide copies of same
to Seller. [*] Metaldyne and Seller shall share equally the complete costs for
the preparation of the Phase II ESA, including all fees and expenses of the
Consultant. In selecting the Consultant to perform the Phase II ESA, Metaldyne
shall ensure that the terms of engagement include a provision that Seller may
rely upon the contents of the final Phase II ESA. The provisions of this Section
8.16 shall not in any way bar or preclude a claim by Metaldyne for
indemnification under the provisions of Section 13.9 for any Loss relating to,
arising from or in connection with an Environmental Condition not identified in
the Phase II ESA.

     (b) Seller shall provide Metaldyne with copies of all reports, notices and
correspondence that Seller or any of its Affiliates delivers to or receives from
any Governmental Authority in connection with any Environmental Conditions or
current or planned Remedial Action with respect to the Real Property (including,
without limitation, the Facility) and any other Transferred Assets.

indictment, information, notice of violation or other document relating to any
Environmental Conditions or Remedial Action with respect to the Real Property

whether civil, criminal, or investigative; provided, however, that the failure
of a party to give such notice shall not adversely affect the party's rights
under this Agreement except to the extent that the party who is not promptly so
notified shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

     8.17 Intellectual Property Licenses; Discussions Regarding Ownership of
Certain Intellectual Property. (a) The Company hereby grants to Seller and its
Affiliates a non-exclusive worldwide, paid-up, irrevocable and perpetual license

Current Processes not transferred to the Company under Section 2.1 to make, have
made, import, use, offer to sell and sell any product to any Person. To the
extent Seller can sublicense the Company under any Intellectual Property
presently licensed from third parties in the designs of the Ball Joints or in

Research Foundation Limited Partnership dated May 22, 1998 that it is permitted
to grant the Company under that Settlement Agreement.

     (c) All right, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property
developed by the Company after the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
any improvement or modification on any Current Product or Current Process, shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company and Seller shall gain no
right, title or interest in such Intellectual Property by virtue of this
Agreement or any of the Related Agreements (other than as provided in a written
agreement between the Company and Seller, such as in a purchase order of Seller
under which the Company supplies products to Seller) or Seller's ownership of
any Units. In the event of the JV Termination pursuant to the Met-

                                      -52-


aldyne Put Option Closing or the DaimlerChrysler Call Option Closing,
concurrently with such closing, the Company shall grant to Metaldyne a
non-exclusive, worldwide, paid-up, royalty free, assignable, irrevocable and
perpetual license, with the right to sublicense, to use all Intellectual
Property developed by the Company from the Closing Date through the JV
Termination Date, including, without limitation, any improvement or modification
in any Current Product or Current Process.

     (d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Metaldyne
Call Option Closing under the Operating Agreement:

          (i) If the Company licenses any Intellectual Property from any third
     party, the Company will ensure that the license (i) will survive the
     exercise of any put or call option under the Operating Agreement and (ii)
     is transferrable to any successor of the Company, including any Unitholder
     (as defined in the Operating Agreement).

          (ii) To the extent that Metaldyne or an Affiliate of Metaldyne
     performs any design or development work pertaining to any product that the
     Company produces or plans to produce, Metaldyne agrees to and hereby does
     grant the Company a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable,
     worldwide license, with the right to sublicense Seller and Seller's
     Affiliates as to any Seller Related Intellectual Property, to use any
     Intellectual Property in such design or development work in connection with
     the manufacture and sale of products, including, without limitation, to
     make, use, sell, offer to sell and import any product and any improvement
     thereof, and to reproduce, distribute in connection with the Company's
     products, display publicly, perform publicly and prepare derivative works
     based on any copyrighted work. Metaldyne or its Affiliates, as applicable,
     will also provide to the Company all information and documentation
     reasonably necessary for the Company to practice the Intellectual Property
     licensed under this Section 8.17(d)(ii) to the fullest extent under the
     license and to provide the same to Seller and its Affiliates as to all
     Seller Related Intellectual Property.

          (iii) To the extent that Metaldyne allows any of its Intellectual
     Property or Intellectual Property of any of its Affiliates to be
     incorporated into or used to make any product made or planned to be made by
     the Company, then Metaldyne grants the Company the license provided by
     Section 8.17(d)(ii).

     (e) During the period from Closing until the exercise of the Metaldyne Call
Option under the Operating Agreement, Seller agrees to negotiate in good faith
with the Company transferring ownership of any Intellectual Property in the
Current Processes that was not transferred to the Company under Section 2.1 and
any Intellectual Property in the Ball Joints. In the event that Seller agrees
(which decision will be at Seller's sole discretion) to transfer any such
Intellectual Property, it will be deemed included in the Transferred
Intellectual Property licensed to Seller and its Affiliates under Section
8.17(a).

     8.18 Notification of Certain Matters. From time to time prior to the
Closing Date, and as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such
a matter, Seller and Metaldyne, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other
of (i) any matter that, if known, existing or occurring as of

responsibility, or that is necessary to complete or correct any information in
any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, (ii) the
existence or non-existence of any circumstance or condition, or the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event, that would be reasonably likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of such party to consummate the Transactions not to
be satisfied or (iii) the failure of such party to perform, comply with or
satisfy any covenant, agreement or conditions to be performed, complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be likely to
result in any condition to the obligations of such party to consummate the
Transactions not to be satisfied.

     8.19 Cooperation on Subsequent Litigation. With respect to any action,
suit, claim, notice of potential claim, request for accommodation, arbitration,
regulatory proceeding or other litigation, proceedings or investigation by a
Government Authority affecting the Business or any of the Transferred Assets
that is initiated after the Closing Date (whether pending or threatened and

hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any other
party hereto in the defense or prosecution thereof, including, without
limitation, the sharing of any records an information reasonably relevant to
such claim and making a reasonable number of employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material relevant to such claim.

later than ten (10) Business Days hereafter, each of Seller and Metaldyne shall

     contemplated by this Agreement or have a Metaldyne Material Adverse Effect,
     or (ii) a breach of a representation or warranty of Metaldyne hereunder

     shall not have been remedied within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt
     by Metaldyne of a written notice from Seller specifying the breach and
     requesting that such breach be remedied; or

          (d) by Metaldyne, if there shall have been (i) a material breach of

     warranty of the Company or Seller hereunder that would give rise to the
     failure of a condition set forth in Section 11.1, and such breach is
     incapable of being remedied by the End Date or shall not have been remedied
     within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by Seller of a written
     notice from Metaldyne specifying the breach and requesting that such breach

     12.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the

obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except for the obligations
set forth in Sections 8.6, 14.1, 14.8, 14.9 and this Section 12.2, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement, and except that if this Agreement is
terminated by any of the parties hereto because one or more of the conditions to
such party's obligations hereunder are not satisfied as a result of any other
party's failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement, such terminating
party's right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies for breach of contract
and damages shall survive such termination unimpaired.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

     for sale only to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller at the time of sale
     (directly or indirectly through suppliers to Seller or Seller's Affiliates)
     to the extent that the claim of infringement is attributable to a design or

     to the extent the infringement is attributable to a change in such Current
     Process made after the Closing Date which was not created by Seller;

          (e) any third party claim [*] arising out of or relating to [*];

     National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor, the Equal
     Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Health and Safety

     employment laws;

          (i) any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of

                                      -59-


     To the extent that (A) Seller fully satisfies any indemnification
obligation pursuant to Article XVI of the Operating Agreement, it shall have no
further obligation to any Company Indemnified Party or Metaldyne Indemnified
Party for such Loss and (B) Seller indemnifies any Company Indemnified Party or
Metaldyne Indemnified Party for any Loss pursuant to this Section 13.2, it shall
have no obligation to indemnify any other Company Indemnified Party or Metaldyne
Indemnified Party for the same Loss.

     13.3 Indemnification by Metaldyne. Subject to Sections 13.4, 13.5, 13.6,
13.7, 13.8 and 13.10, Metaldyne agrees to indemnify each of the DaimlerChrysler
Indemnified Parties against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by it to the extent relating to, or arising
out of, or resulting from, (a) any breach by Metaldyne of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Metaldyne contained in Article VII
of this Agreement, in each case when read without giving effect to any qualifier
as to "materiality" or "Metaldyne Material Adverse Effect," (b) any breach by
Metaldyne of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement; (c) in the event
that Metaldyne exercises the Metaldyne Call Option and purchases from Seller the

Agreement, from and after the JV Termination Date, the Assumed Liabilities and
any breach by the Company of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement;
(d) the use by Metaldyne or any third party of any of the financial information
provided by Seller pursuant to Section 8.12 (except to the extent any such

warranty or intellectual property infringement claim with respect to any product
sold after the JV Termination Date by the Company to any third party (other than
to a supplier of Seller or its Affiliates who supplies such product to Seller or
its Affiliates).

     13.4 Limitations on Liability. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 13.2(a) or 13.3(a): (i) no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to make
a claim against an Indemnifying Person under Section 13.2(a) or 13.3(a) unless
such claim is made within any applicable survival period set forth in Section
13.1; (ii) the maximum amount of indemnification which can be required of any
Indemnifying Person under Section 13.2(a) or 13.3(a) shall be $10,000,000 (the
"Cap"); and (iii) no Indemnifying Person shall be required to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any Indemnified Person from and against any Losses under
Section 13.2(a) or 13.3(a) unless and until the amount of all Losses under
Section 13.2(a) or 13.3(a), as the case may be, exceeds $500,000 in the
aggregate (the "Threshold Amount"), in which event the Indemnifying Person shall
be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Person to the extent of all Losses
relating to such breach to the extent such Losses exceed the Threshold Amount,
subject to the Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap and the Threshold
Amount shall not apply to Losses relating to a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Section 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.5. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Cap and the Threshold Amount shall not apply to Seller's
indemnification obligations under Sections 13.2(b) through (j) or 13.9 or
Metaldyne's indemnification obligations under Sections 13.3(b) through (e).

     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the only representations and warranties of Seller
with respect to (i) Taxes are set forth in Section 5.19, (ii) Intellectual
Property are set forth in Section 5.12 and (iii) the Environment are set forth
in Section 5.21, and that no other representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall give rise to any liability with respect to
such matters.


<PAGE>
                                      -60-


     (c) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Article XIII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Person under insurance policies of the Indemnified Person (net, in
each case, of all deductibles and costs, charges and expenses of the Indemnified
Person in connection with such recovery). If any Indemnified Person is at any
time entitled to recover under any third-party policy of insurance (excluding
any self-insurance that is not reinsured with a third party), in respect of any
Losses for which indemnification is sought under this Article XIII, the
Indemnified Person shall, at the request of the Indemnifying Person, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such recovery at the expense of and
for the benefit of the Indemnifying Person and, in the event of recovery under
such policy, reduce the amount of Losses for which it is seeking indemnification
under this Article XIII by the amount recovered (net of all deductibles and
costs, charges and expenses of the Indemnified Person in connection with such
recovery); provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required
to renew any insurance policy. If any Indemnifying Person indemnifies an
Indemnified Person for Losses pursuant to this Article XIII and the Indemnified
Person subsequently recovers from a third Person any sum in respect of any
event, change, development, circumstance or state of facts giving rise to such
Losses, the Indemnified Person shall repay to the Indemnifying Person the lesser
of (A) the Losses paid by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person and
relating to such event, change, development, circumstance or state of facts and
(B) the sum (including any interest) recovered from such third Person, in either
case net of any additional Taxes directly incurred by the Indemnified Person as
a result of its receipt of such sum.

     (d) The liability of any Indemnifying Person under this Article XIII shall
be subject to reduction in an amount equal to the value of any net Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnified Person (by reason of a Tax deduction, basis
adjustment, shifting of income, credits and/or deductions, or otherwise from one
or more fiscal periods to another resulting, in each case, from any Loss
suffered by the Indemnified Person that forms the basis of the Indemnifying
Person's obligation hereunder), giving effect to any Tax liabilities of the
Indemnified Person arising as a result of any payments made by an Indemnifying
Person with respect to such claim for indemnification (but only to the extent
such payments are not treated, for income tax purposes, as adjustments to the
purchase price of a Transferred Asset).

     (e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, no Indemnified Person shall
assert any right to recover, and the parties hereby waive any claim against any
Indemnifying Person for, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages
arising out of or resulting from any matter for which such party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article XIII, except to the extent such special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages are out-of-pocket.

     (f) Following the Closing, absent willful concealment or fraud, claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII and claims for specific
performance of covenants of the parties under this Agreement shall,
collectively, be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for claims and
damages arising out of this Agreement and the Transactions and the parties shall
not be entitled to bring, and hereby irrevocably waive, any other claims, rights
or causes of action against the other parties hereto, whether in equity or in
law. The right of indemnification provided in this Article XIII is solely for
the benefit of the Indemnified Persons referred to therein, and such right will
not be


<PAGE>
                                      -61-


extended, directly or indirectly, to any other Person. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 13.4(f) shall not limit a party's ability to bring other
claims after Closing under any Related Agreement.

     (g) No liability shall arise in respect of any breach of any representation
or warranty, covenant or agreement herein to the extent that liability for such
breach occurs (or is increased) directly or indirectly as a result of any
retrospective application of a change in Law, or in accounting policies,
procedures or practices, announced, or if not announced in advance of taking
effect, taking effect, after the Closing Date, in each case, which has
retrospective effect.

     13.5 Claims. The provisions of this Section 13.5 shall be subject to
Section 13.6. As soon as is reasonably practicable but no later than thirty (30)
Business Days after becoming aware of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the Indemnifying
Person of such claim and the amount the Indemnified Person will be entitled to
receive hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, if known; provided that the
failure of the Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this Article XIII except to the
extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby.
The notice to be sent by the Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person
pursuant to this Section 13.5 shall include all information concerning the claim
of which the Indemnified Person is aware and which the Indemnified Person,
acting reasonably and in good faith, considers to be required by the
Indemnifying Person in order for the Indemnifying Person to evaluate such claim
and whether such claim gives rise to an indemnification obligation of the
Indemnifying Person hereunder.

     13.6 Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. (a) The
Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to
the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement; provided that the failure of
the Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person
of its obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent (if any) that
the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. The notice to be
sent by the Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this
Section 13.6 shall include all information concerning the claim of which the
Indemnified Person is aware and which the Indemnified Person, acting reasonably
and in good faith, considers to be required by the Indemnifying Person in order
for the Indemnifying Person to evaluate such claim and whether such claim gives
rise to an indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Person hereunder.
Following receipt of a notice from the Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section 13.6, the Indemnified Person hereunder shall permit the Indemnifying
Person, at the Indemnifying Person's election, to assume, at its own expense,
the defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding with counsel selected
by the Indemnifying Person (and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Person). Prior to any assumption of the defense of a claim, suit, action or
proceeding by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person shall not settle,
compromise or consent to any judgment in respect of any such claim, suit, action
or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

     (b) Following the Indemnifying Person's election to assume the defense of
any claim, action or proceeding pursuant to Section 13.6(a), (i) the Indemnified
Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person, in a timely fashion (which
shall be no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after


<PAGE>
                                      -62-


the Indemnified Person's receipt of notice of such election), copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Person relating to such claim, action or proceeding and (ii) the Indemnified
Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof as reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Person in the
context of the relevant claim, action or proceeding (including the quantum and
nature of damages sought thereunder). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Person's request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Person of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such claim, action or proceeding, and making a reasonable number of employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis, to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided,
however, that the foregoing is organized in a manner as shall not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Indemnified Person's business having regard
to the context in which such cooperation is requested and of the relevant claim,
action or proceeding (including the quantum and nature of the damages sought
thereunder).

     (c) The Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Person for any period during
which the Indemnifying Person has not assumed the defense of a claim, action or
proceeding for which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have
been prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give timely notice of
such claim, action or proceeding as required by Section 13.5.

     (d) If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of any claim, action or
proceeding pursuant to Section 13.6(a), the Indemnified Person shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in such defense and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Person.

     (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume defense of any
claim, action or proceeding pursuant to Section 13.6(a), the Indemnifying Person
may nevertheless participate (but not control) and employ its own counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Person), at its expense, in the
defense of such claim, action or proceeding.

     (f) Each party to this Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate and cause its employees to cooperate with and assist the
appropriate Indemnifying Person and Indemnified Person in connection with any
claim, action, proceeding or liability for which indemnity is sought hereunder,
including, but not limited to claims, actions and proceedings with respect to
which an Indemnifying Person has elected to assume or participate in the
defense, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or
resolve any such claim, action, proceeding or liability for which indemnity is
sought hereunder; provided, however, that in the event that the Indemnified
Person shall fail to use such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or
resolve any claim, action, proceeding or liability, then notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, such failure shall
only affect the Indemnified Person's right to indemnification with respect to
such claim, action, proceeding or liability to the extent of any Losses that
could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Person had
made such commercially reasonable efforts.

     13.7 Settlement or Compromise. Subject to Section 13.4, the Indemnifying
Person may, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to a claim or
any litigation resulting therefrom which is the subject of Section 13.6 if such
settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such action, (ii) includes
no admission of fault or culpability by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person
or its businesses and (iii) provides for settlement or relief solely in the form
of monetary damages to be paid fully by the Indemnifying Person. Any other type
of settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment shall not be
undertaken by the Indemnifying Person without obtaining the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person to its terms, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that if the Indemnified Person shall
have given such consent, the Indemnified Person agrees that it shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, submit to any non-monetary relief of judgment arising
out of or forming part of any such settlement, compromise or consent.

     13.8 Shared Liability. With respect to any third party claim, action or
proceeding in relation to which an Indemnifying Person is required to indemnify
an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article XIII (an "Indemnified Claim")
that is combined or joined with one or more claims, actions or proceedings that
are not Indemnified Claims or with respect to an Indemnified Claim under which
both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person may be liable, which
both desire to contest and control, the control of such claim, action or
proceeding shall rest with the Person having the larger amount in dispute, and
the Person in control may not settle or compromise any such claim without the
prior written consent of the other Person (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if an Indemnifying Person may be
obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Person with respect to any Indemnified
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have the amounts of such
Indemnified Claim in dispute.

     13.9 Environmental Indemnification by Seller. (a) Subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 13.9, Seller agrees to indemnify each of the Company
Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified Parties against, and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from, any and all Environmental Liabilities relating
to, arising out of, in connection with or in respect of any Known Environmental
Conditions. Seller's indemnification obligations under this Section 13.9(a)
shall not be subject to any limits as to amount or time.

     (b) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 13.9, Seller agrees
to indemnify each of the Company Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified
Parties against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all
Environmental Liabilities relating to, arising out of, in connection with or in
respect of any Unknown Environmental Conditions; provided, however, that: (i) no
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to make a claim against Seller under this
Section 13.9(b) unless such claim is made on or prior to [*]; and (ii) Seller
shall only be required to indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnified
Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified Parties from and against [*] of such
Environmental Liabilities unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Environmental Liabilities exceeds [*], in which event Seller shall be obligated
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne
Indemnified Parties from and against [*] of such Environment Liabilities in
excess of [*].


<PAGE>
                                      -64-


     (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of Seller under this Section 13.9 shall not be
subject to the provisions of Sections 13.5 through 13.8.

     (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall
have no obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Company Indemnified
Parties or Metaldyne Indemnified Parties for Environmental Liabilities or any
Losses whatsoever under this Section 13.9 to the extent such Environmental
Liabilities or Losses (i) arise out of or result from Remedial Action that
exceeds the standards necessary to (A) bring an Environmental Condition into
compliance with Environmental Law or (B) satisfy the requirements of an
applicable Governmental Authority with respect to an Environmental Condition to
the extent required by Environmental Law or (ii) result from or would not have
arisen but for (A) Metaldyne or any Metaldyne Indemnified Party undertaking any
invasive drilling and sampling of soil or groundwater other than as required by
or for (w) the Phase II ESA, (x) any Environmental Law in effect at the time of
such drilling or sampling, any Environmental Permit or any applicable
Governmental Authority, (y) any commercial transaction relating to or involving
the Real Property or the Transferred Assets (including, without limitation, the
Facility) or (z) any construction, erection, removal, repair, maintenance,
demolition, alteration, modification or relocation of any physical improvement
or structure, (B) any change of the use of any Real Property after the Closing
Date to a non-industrial or non-commercial use or (C) any disclosure by the
Company, Metaldyne or any of their Affiliates to any applicable Governmental
Authority of information or data, where such disclosure is not otherwise
required by any Environmental Law in effect at the time of such disclosure.

     (e) From and after the Closing, Seller shall control all Remedial Action
and negotiations with any Governmental Authority in respect of all Environmental
Conditions. Seller shall make its environmental personnel and consultants
reasonably available to Metaldyne to discuss Environmental Conditions. Metaldyne
shall provide Seller and its environmental consultants with reasonable access to
the Real Property and Seller shall provide Metaldyne with copies of all
non-privileged information with respect to Remedial Action to be taken in
respect of such Environmental Conditions. Such Remedial Actions shall be
performed in a commercially reasonable manner, including, to the extent allowed
or authorized by applicable Environmental Law or the Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over a Remedial Action, the use of applicable Remediation
Standards. Seller shall select consultants and contractors to implement such
Remedial Action (not reasonably objected to by Metaldyne) and shall also provide
Metaldyne and its environmental consultants with copies of all non-privileged
Environmental Reports, analytical data, correspondence, directives, orders and
documents submitted to or received by Seller from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Remedial Action and other non-privileged documents created
or received by or on behalf of Seller in connection with the Remedial Action.
Seller shall afford Metaldyne a reasonable opportunity to comment on Seller's
proposed response to an Environmental Condition, and Seller shall not
unreasonably refuse to incorporate Metaldyne's comments.

     (f) Metaldyne shall inform Seller promptly in writing of any Environmental
Condition or Environmental Claim in respect of which Seller may have an
indemnification obligation under this Section 13.9; provided that the failure of
Metaldyne to so promptly inform Seller shall not


<PAGE>
                                      -65-


affect the rights of the Company Indemnified Parties or Metaldyne Indemnified
Parties Buyer except to the extent (if any) that Seller shall have been
prejudiced thereby.

     (g) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Company Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified Parties for
Environmental Liabilities under this Section 13.9 to the extent that such
Environmental Liabilities result solely from or to the extent such Environmental
Liabilities are increased as a result of any Environmental Law which is not
binding and in effect as of the Closing Date, or any Environmental Permit that
is not required to be in effect as of the Closing Date.

     (h) Following the Closing, absent willful concealment or fraud, claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 13.9 and claims for specific
performance of covenants of Seller under this Section 13.9 shall, collectively,
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company Indemnified Parties and
Metaldyne Indemnified Parties for claims and damages arising out of
Environmental Laws, Environmental Claims, Environmental Conditions,
Environmental Liabilities, Environmental Permits, Hazardous Materials or any
matters addressed in Section 2.5(b) or Section 5.21 or any Losses with respect
thereto, and the Company Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to bring, and hereby irrevocably waive, any other claims,
rights or causes of action against Seller, whether in equity or in law. The
right of indemnification provided in this Section 13.9 is solely for the benefit
of the Company Indemnified Parties and Metaldyne Indemnified Parties, and such
right will not be extended, directly or indirectly, to any other Person. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 13.9(h) shall not limit a party's ability to
bring other claims after Closing under any Related Agreement.

     13.10 Resolution of Indemnification Disputes. If a dispute arises in
connection with determining the validity or amount of a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this Agreement Article XIII (including
Section 13.9) (a "Dispute"), and if the Dispute cannot be settled through direct
discussions held in good faith between representatives of the Indemnifying
Person and representatives of the Indemnified Persons within one hundred twenty
(120) days following receipt of notice of a Dispute, the parties agree first to
endeavor to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by mediation administered
under the CPR Mediation Procedure established by the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution ("CPR") before resorting to arbitration. If a Dispute cannot be
resolved through such mediation process within sixty (60) days following the
appointment of the mediator, the Dispute will be settled finally by arbitration
under the CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration (the "Rules"), then in
effect, by a sole arbitrator, chosen by agreement of the parties within twenty
(20) days of the receipt by the respondent of a copy of the notice of
arbitration. Any arbitrator appointed by CPR shall be a retired judge or a
practicing attorney with no less than ten (10) years of experience with large
commercial cases and an experienced arbitrator, except that in the case of a
Dispute with respect to a claim for indemnification under Section 13.9, the
arbitrator appointed by CPR shall be a nationally-recognized expert in
environmental matters and an experienced arbitrator. The arbitration will be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss. 1 et seq. Any arbitrator
shall be bound to apply the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law pursuant
to Section 14.8. The hearing on the merits shall be held no later than six (6)
months after the appointment of the arbitrator unless the parties otherwise
agree or the arbitrator extends such time period for good cause shown. The award
shall be in writing and shall state the findings of fact and conclusions of law
on which it is based. The award of


<PAGE>
                                      -66-


the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and judgment upon the
award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Unless the
parties otherwise agree in writing, the mediation and arbitration will be held
in Detroit, Michigan. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) and Seller and Metaldyne shall
each bear one-half of the costs and expenses payable to the mediator and
arbitrator.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  MISCEllANEOUS

the fees and disbursements of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers and
accountants) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller shall
pay all sales, use, stamp, transfer, service, recording, real estate and like
taxes or fees, if any, imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions, contemplated hereby.

     14.2 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented,
superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
signed by each of the parties hereto or, in the case of waiver, by or on behalf
of the party waiving compliance.

     14.3 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given or made hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given or made: (a) on the date of receipt if given in
person; (b) on the date of transmission if sent by facsimile or e-mail with

Any rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver any such
notice because of a changed address of which no notice was given shall be deemed
to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or
inability to deliver.

     14.4 Waivers. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of any
breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing by the party entitled to
the benefits thereof, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed
to be a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other
instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty.

     14.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

limitation" or "included, without limitation," respectively. Unless otherwise
indicated, references to articles, sections, subsections or schedules shall
refer to those portions of this Agreement. Consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein shall not be deemed a waiver of a breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation, warranty or covenant or of any party's rights and remedies
with regard thereto. No specific representation, warranty or covenant contained
herein shall limit the generality or applicability of a more general
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein. A breach of or inaccuracy
in any representation, warranty or covenant shall not be affected by the fact
that any more general or less general representation, warranty or covenant was
not also breached or inaccurate.

provided in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the Related Agreements shall be
brought in any United States federal or state court sitting in the State of
Michigan, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding, agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process, summons or notice on
such party as provided in Section 14.3 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party for any suit, action or proceeding brought in such court.
Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and
may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party is or may
be subject, by suit upon judgment. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS
OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS. THE PARTIES ALSO WAIVE ANY BOND OR SURETY
OR SECURITY UPON SUCH BOND WHICH MIGHT, BUT FOR THIS WAIVER, BE REQUIRED OF ANY
OF THE OTHER PARTIES. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE
ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT
RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW
AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE
WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON
THE WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. THE PARTIES FURTHER WARRANT AND
REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT
EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING
CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY
NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED
HEREBY. IN THE
