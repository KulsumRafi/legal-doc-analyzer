provided that no change shall become effective and binding on Customer until it has been posted in the Guide for at least fifteen (15) calendar days. Tariffs may be modified from time to time in accordance with law. The contractual relationship
between WorldCom and Customer shall be governed by the following order of precedence: (a) Tariffs; (b) provisions in this Agreement that expressly apply in lieu of, or that apply in addition to, provisions contained in Tariffs and/or the Guide; and
(c) provisions contained in the Guide.</font></p> <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>TERM</u>. The &#147;Initial Term&#148; shall begin on the Effective Date and end upon the completion of <b>thirty-six

Extended Term, Customer&#146;s Total Service Charges must equal or exceed one-twelfth (1/12) of the AVC. &#147;Total Service Charges&#148; shall mean all charges for Services provided under this Agreement, after the application of all discounts and

<p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>CHANGES TO THE GUIDE</u>. If WorldCom makes any changes to the Guide or Governmental Charges which affect Customer in a material and adverse manner, Customer, as its sole
remedy, may discontinue the affected Service without liability by providing WorldCom with written notice of discontinuance within sixty (60) days of such change. Customer shall pay all charges incurred up to the time of Service discontinuance.
WorldCom may avoid Service discontinuance if, within sixty (60) days of receipt of Customer&#146;s written notice, it agrees to amend this Agreement to eliminate the applicability of the material and adverse change. If a Service is discontinued
hereunder, the Customer&#146;s AVC will be reduced, as appropriate, to accommodate the discontinuance. A &#147;material and adverse change&#148; shall not include, nor be interpreted to include, the introduction of a new service or any new service

invoice date. All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars. Payments must be made at the address designated on the invoice or other such place as WorldCom may designate. Amounts not paid on or before thirty (30) days from invoice date shall be
considered past due, and Customer agrees to pay a late payment charge equal to the lessor of: (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, compounded; or (b) the maximum amount allowed by applicable law, as applied against the past due amounts.
Failure to remit payment within thirty (30) days of invoice date may result, upon Customer notification, in interruption or cancellation of Services under this Agreement. If Customer does not give WorldCom written notice of a dispute with respect to
WorldCom charges or taxes within six (6) months of the date of an invoice, such invoice shall be deemed to be correct and binding on Customer. At any time during the Term, WorldCom may request, and Customer shall furnish within ten (10) days of such
request a bond or other form of security deposit to assure payment. Customer shall be liable for the payment of all fees and expenses, including attorney&#146;s fees, reasonably incurred in collecting, or attempting to collect, any charges owed
hereunder.</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>TERMINATION FOR CAUSE</u>. Either party may terminate this Agreement for Cause. As to payment of invoices, &#147;Cause&#148; shall mean the
Customer&#146;s failure to pay any invoice within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. For all other matters, &#147;Cause&#148; shall mean a breach by the other party of any material provision of this Agreement, provided that written

facilities or services; or (d) Customer interferes with WorldCom&#146;s provision of services to any other customer.</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</u>. Commencing on
the date Customer executes this Agreement and continuing for a period of three (3) years from the termination of this Agreement, each party shall protect as confidential, and shall not disclose to any third party, any Confidential Information
