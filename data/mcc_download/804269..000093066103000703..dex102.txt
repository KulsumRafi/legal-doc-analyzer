          direct the Indenture Trustee to make any investment of any funds or to
          sell any investment held in any of the Series Accounts unless the
          security interest granted and perfected in such account will continue
          to be perfected in such investment or the proceeds of such sale, in
          either case without any further action by any Person, and, in
          connection with any direction to the Indenture Trustee to make any
          such investment or sale, if requested by the Indenture Trustee, the
          Trust shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to

          Investments or by reason of any insufficiency in any of the Series
          Accounts resulting from any loss on any Eligible Investment included
          therein, except for losses attributable to the Indenture Trustee's
          failure to make payments on such Eligible Investments issued by the
          Indenture Trustee, in its commercial capacity as principal obligor and
          not as trustee, in accordance with their terms.

     (c)  If: (i) the Trust shall have failed to give investment directions for
          any funds on deposit in the Series Accounts to the Indenture Trustee
          by 11:00 a.m. (Toronto time) (or such other time as may be agreed by
          the Trust and the Indenture Trustee) on any Business Day; or (ii) a
          Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with

          Debt Obligations shall not have been declared or become due and
          payable pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Indenture or this Series
          Supplement, or, if the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations shall have been
          declared or have become due and payable following an Event of Default,
          amounts collected or receivable from the Related Collateral are being
          applied in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Series Supplement as if
          there had not been such a declaration or acceleration; then the
          Indenture Trustee shall invest and reinvest funds in the Series
          Accounts in the class of investments specified in Clause (a) of the
          definition of "Eligible Investments".

not in part, on any Monthly Payment Date on which the Servicer or Seller
exercises its option to purchase the Related Collateral pursuant to Section 9.1
of the Sale and Servicing Agreement for a purchase price equal to the Redemption
Price; provided, however, that the Trust has available funds sufficient to pay
the Redemption Price and all accrued and unpaid Additional Class VPN Loan
Amounts to the date fixed for redemption. The Administrator or the Trust shall
furnish the Rating Agencies notice of such redemption. If the Series C2002-1
Debt Obligations are to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 4.1, the
Administrator or the Trust shall furnish notice of such election to the
Indenture Trustee not later than five Business Days prior to the Redemption Date
and the Trust shall deposit with the Indenture Trustee in the Note Distribution
the Redemption Price of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations to be redeemed and
all accrued and unpaid Additional Class VPN Loan Amounts to the date fixed for
redemption.

4.2  FORM OF REDEMPTION NOTICE.

     Notice of redemption under Section 4.1 shall be given by the Indenture
Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than five days
prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of Series C2002-1 Debt
Obligations, as of the close of business on the Record Date preceding the
applicable Redemption Date, at such Holder's address appearing in the Note
Register, or, in the case of Class VPN Loans, to the applicable Class VPN Lender
as provided in the related Class VPN Loan Agreement. If Definitive Notes of a
Class have not been issued, notice of redemption shall be given to the Clearing
Agency in accordance with the Letter of Representations.

     All notices of redemption shall state:

          (i)       the Redemption Date;

          (ii)      the Redemption Price and any unpaid Additional Class VPN
                    Loan Amounts;

          (iii)     the place where the Series C2002-1 Notes of each Class are
                    to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price (which
                    shall be the office or agency of the Trust to be maintained
                    with respect to the Series C2002-1 Notes as provided in the
                    Indenture); and

          (iv)      CUSIP numbers, in the case of Offered Notes for which
                    Definitive Notes have not been issued.

by the Indenture Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Trust. Failure to
give notice of redemption, or any defect therein, to any Holder of any Series
C2002-1 Debt Obligations shall not impair or affect the validity of the
redemption of any other Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations.

5.1  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

     Notwithstanding Section 7.1 of the Indenture, "Event of Default", wherever
used herein or in the Indenture or the other Basic Documents with respect to the
Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations and the other Related Obligations, means any one
of the following events:

     (a)  failure to pay any interest on any Series C2002-1 Debt Obligation
          (other than the Class D Notes) when the same becomes due and payable,
          and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of five days
          following the date that such interest becomes due and payable; or

     (b)  failure to pay the Outstanding Amount of any Note of any Class or any
          Class VPN Loan on the applicable Final Scheduled Payment Date for that
          Class of Note or Class VPN Loan; or

     (c)  default in the observance or performance of any covenant or agreement
          of the Trust made in this Indenture (other than a covenant or
          agreement, a default in the observance or performance of which is
          dealt with specifically elsewhere in this Section), or any
          representation or warranty of the Trust made in this Indenture or in
          any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in
          connection herewith proving to have been incorrect in any material
          respect as of the time when the same shall have been made, and such
          default shall continue or not be cured, or the circumstance or
          condition in respect of which such misrepresentation or warranty was
          incorrect shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cured, for a
          period of 30 days (or for such longer period, not in excess of 90
          days, as may be reasonably necessary to remedy such default; provided
          that such default is capable of remedy within 90 days or less and the
          Servicer on behalf of the Trust delivers an Officer's Certificate to
          the Indenture Trustee to the effect that the Trust has commenced, or
          will promptly commence and diligently pursue, all reasonable efforts
          to remedy such default) after there shall have been given, by
          registered mail, to the Trust by the Indenture Trustee or to the Trust
          and the Indenture Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% of the
          Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations, a written
          notice specifying such default or incorrect representation or warranty
          and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a
          "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

                                      -22-

     (d)  an Insolvency Event shall occur with respect to the Trust.

5.2  ACCELERATION OF SERIES C2002-1 DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

     (a)  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
          Indenture Trustee in its discretion may, or if so requested in writing
          by the Holders of a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Series
          C2002-1 Debt Obligations shall, declare by written notice to the Trust
          that the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations become, whereupon they shall
          become, immediately due and payable at par, together with accrued
          interest thereon.

     (b)  At any time after such declaration of acceleration of maturity has
          been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due
          has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee as hereinafter provided in
          this Article 5 provided, the Holders of a majority of the Outstanding
          Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations, by written notice to
          the Trust and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and
          its consequences if:

          (i)  the Trust has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee a sum
               sufficient to pay:

               (A)  all payments of principal of and interest on all Series
                    C2002-1 Debt Obligations and all other amounts that would
                    then be due hereunder or upon such Series C2002-1 Debt
                    Obligations if the Event of Default giving rise to such
                    acceleration had not occurred; and

               (B)  all sums paid or advanced by the Indenture Trustee hereunder
                    and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
                    advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and
                    counsel; and

               (C)  all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the
                    principal of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations that has
                    become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or
                    waived as provided in Section 7.2 of the Indenture.

     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereto.
