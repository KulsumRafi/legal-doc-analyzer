INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT

To Cendant Mortgage Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion about Cendant Mortgage Corporation's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards identified in the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002
included in the accompanying management assertion.  Management is
responsible for Cendant Mortgage Corporation's compliance with those minimum
servicing standards.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the entity's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about Cendant Mortgage Corporation's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that
our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Our examination
does not provide a legal determination on Cendant Mortgage Corporation's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Cendant Mortgage Corporation
complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2002 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
