relating to this Agreement, or any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement,
to arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&#146;s rules then in
effect (or under any other form of arbitration usually acceptable to the
parties).&#160; A single arbitrator agreed on
by the parties will conduct the arbitration.&#160;
If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, each party must
select one arbitrator and those two arbitrators will select a third arbitrator.&#160; This third arbitrator will hear the
dispute.&#160; The arbitrator&#146;s decision is
final (except as otherwise specifically provided by law) and binds the parties,
