<p align="justify">These amendments reflect the applicable
provisions of the model amendments to comply with the Economic Growth and Tax
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, as amended (&quot;EGTRRA&quot;), released by
the Internal Revenue Service in IRS Notice 2001-57, are intended as good faith
compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA, and are to be construed in
accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder.</p>

<p align="justify">Pursuant to Article IX of the Seventh Restated
Graphic Communications International Union, Twin Cities Local 6A -
Buckbee-Mears Pension Plan, hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Plan&quot;,
the Trustees hereby amend said Plan as follows:</p>

<p align=center>I.</p>

<p align="justify">A new subsection 4.14(e) is hereby added to the
Plan to read in its entirety as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify">&quot;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective Date.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, this
section shall be effective for limitation years ending after December 31, 2001.</p>

  <blockquote>

<p align="justify">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effect on
Participants.&nbsp; Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the
limitations of section 415(b) of the Code will be provided to all employees
participating in this Plan who have one (1) Hour of Service ending after
December 31, 2001.</p>

<p align="justify">Definitions.</p>

<p align="justify">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defined
benefit dollar limitation.&nbsp; The &quot;defined benefit dollar
limitation&quot; is $160,000, as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year,
under section 415(d) of the Code in such manner as the Secretary shall
prescribe, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity.&nbsp; A
limitation as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Code will apply to
limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the
adjustment applies.</p>

<p align="justify">(iv)Maximum
permissible benefit.&nbsp; The &quot;maximum permissible benefit&quot; is the
lesser of the defined benefit dollar limitation or defined benefit compensation
limitation (both adjusted where required, as provided in (a) and, if
applicable, in (b) or (c) below).</p>

  </blockquote>

<p align="justify">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
Participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the defined
benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator
of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the Plan
and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.&nbsp; In the case of a Participant who
has fewer than 10 years of service with the employer, the defined benefit
compensation limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of
which is the number of years (or part thereof) of service with the employer and
(ii) the denominator of which is 10.</p>

<p align="justify">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit dollar
limitation applicable to the Participant at such earlier age is an annual
benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier
age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation
applicable to the Participant at age 62 (adjusted under (a) above, if
required).&nbsp; The defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of (i) the actuarial equivalent (at
such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest
rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Section 4.12(a)
and (ii) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar
limitation computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable
mortality table as defined in Section 4.12(a) of the Plan.&nbsp; Any decrease
in the defined benefit dollar limitation determined in accordance with this
paragraph (b) shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not
forfeited upon the death of the Participant.&nbsp; If any benefits are
forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account.</p>

<p align="justify">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
benefit of a Participant begins after the Participant attains age 65, the
defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at the later
age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity
beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined
benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age 65 (adjusted
under (a) above, if required).&nbsp; The actuarial equivalent of the defined
benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age after age 65 is determined as
(i) the lesser of the actuarial equivalent (at such age) fo the defined benefit
dollar limitation computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or
other tabular factor) specified in Section 4.12(a) of the Plan and (ii) the
actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation
computed using a 5 percent interest rate assumption and the applicable
mortality table as defined in Section 4.12(a) of the Plan.&nbsp; For these
purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall
be ignored.</p>

</blockquote>

<p align=center>II.</p>

<p align="justify">A new subsection 4.12(c) is hereby added to the
Plan to read in its entirety as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify">&quot;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
for distributions made after December 31, 2001, for purposes of the direct
rollover provisions of this Section 4.12, an eligible retirement plan shall
also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code and an
eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state
or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan.&nbsp; The definition of
eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a
surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee
under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the
Code.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p align=center>III.</p>

<p align="justify">Section 11.5 is hereby added to the Plan to read
in its entirety as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify">(a) Effective
date.&nbsp; This section shall apply for purposes of determining whether the
Plan is a top-heavy plan under section 416(g) of the Code for Plan Years
beginning after December 31, 2001, and whether the Plan satisfies the minimum
benefits requirements of section 416(c) of the Code for such years.&nbsp; This
section amends Article XI of the Plan.</p>

<p align="justify">(b)Determination
of top-heavy status.</p>

  <blockquote>

<p align="justify">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Key employee.&nbsp; Key employee means any employee or former employee
(including any deceased employee) who at any time during the Plan Year that
includes the determination date was an officer of the employer having annual
compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under section 416(i)(1) of the
Code for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2002), a 5-percent owner of
the employer, or a 1-percent owner of the employer having annual compensation
of more than $150,000.&nbsp; For this purpose, annual compensation means
compensation of more than $150,000.&nbsp; For this purpose, annual compensation
means compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3) of the Code.&nbsp;
The determination of who is a key employee will be made in accordance with
section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable regulations and other guidance
of general applicability issued thereunder.</p>

<p align="justify">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Determination of present values and amounts.&nbsp; This section (b)(2) shall
apply for purposes of determining the present values of accrued benefits and
the amounts of account balances of employees as of the determination date.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributions
during year ending on the determination date.&nbsp; The present values of
accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of an employee as of the
determination date shall be increased by the distributions made with respect to
the employee under the Plan and any plan aggregated with the Plan under section
416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year period ending on the determination
date.&nbsp; The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a
terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been aggregated
with the Plan under section 416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.&nbsp; In the case of a
distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death, or
disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting 5-year period for
1-year period.</p>

<p align="justify">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees
not performing services during year ending on the determination date.&nbsp; The
accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not performed services
for the employer during the 1-year period ending on the determination date
shall not be taken into account.</p>

</blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minimum benefits.&nbsp; For purposes of satisfying the minimum benefit
requirements of section 416(c)(1) of the Code and the Plan, in determining
years of service with the employer, any service with the employer shall be
disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a Plan Year when the
Plan benefits (within the meaning of section 410(b) of the Code) no key
employee or former key employee.</p>
