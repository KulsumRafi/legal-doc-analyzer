technical Defaults which may have arisen prior to the date hereof with respect
thereto;

      NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows.

      Section 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise specifically defined in the
recitals above, each term used herein which is defined in the Credit Agreement

contained in the Credit Agreement shall, on and after the effectiveness of this
Amendment, refer to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

      Section 2. Subordinated Debt. The definition of "Subordinated Debt" in
Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is amended by inserting after "Senior
Subordinated Notes" the words "but excluding any Indebtedness owed to Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary".

      Section 3. Capital Stock of RAAPL. Section 7.2.11 of the Credit Agreement
is amended by inserting at the beginning of clause (d) thereof the letter "(i)"
and by inserting, immediately after "Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries" in such
clause (d) the following: ", or (ii) the one-time transfer by the Australian
Term Borrower of one share of the Capital Stock of RAAPL to an individual who is
a Related Party".

      Section 4. Amendments to Organic Documents. Section 7.2.12 of the Credit
Agreement is amended by replacing paragraph (b) thereof to read in its entirety
as follows:

      (b) the Organic Documents, except to the extent that such amendment,
      supplement, waiver or other modification or forebearance pursuant to such
      documents could not reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
      the rights and remedies of any Secured Party under any Loan Documents or
      the ability of any Obligor to perform its Obligations under any Loan
      Document, it being understood that the amendments to the Organic Documents
      arising out of certain restructuring and tax-related transactions
      disclosed to the Lenders on or prior to February 28, 2003 shall not be
      considered to have had such a materially adverse affect.

      Section 5. Transactions With Affiliates. Section 7.2.13 of the Credit
Agreement is amended by adding immediately after "Affiliates" the words "(other
than the transaction permitted by Section 7.2.11(d)(ii))".

      Section 6. Waiver of Defaults. The Lenders hereby waive any Default or
Event of Default solely to the extent that such Default or Event of Default is a
result of any noncompliance by the Company with Section 7.2.12 arising prior to
the date of effectiveness hereof as a result of any of the Restructuring
Transactions. Other than as specifically provided herein, this Amendment shall
not operate as a waiver or amendment of any right, power or privilege of the
Lenders under the Credit Agreement or of any other term or condition of the
Credit Agreement, nor shall the entering into of this Amendment preclude the
Lenders from refusing to enter into any further waivers or amendments with
respect to the Credit Agreement.

      Section 7. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Article VI of
the Credit Agreement will be true and correct as of the effective date of this

occurred and be continuing on such date.

      Section 8. Fees and expenses. Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and

of the Credit Agreement with respect to costs and expenses arising in connection
with this Amendment.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

      Section 10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. (a) This Amendment may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

      (b) This Amendment shall become effective upon receipt by the
Administrative Agent of duly executed counterparts hereof signed by Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the Borrowers and the Required Lenders (or, in the case
of any such party as to which an executed counterpart or consent shall not have
been received, the Administrative Agent shall have received telegraphic, telex
or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart
hereof or consent hereto by such party).
