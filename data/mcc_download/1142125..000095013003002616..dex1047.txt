                (a)     On or before the Commencement Date, Buyer shall pay to

part on business, advertising or services provided prior to the Commencement
Time, shall be borne by Sellers and Buyer ratably in proportion to revenues
received, volume of business done or services rendered by each party during the
applicable period. Any and all agency commissions which are subject to
adjustment after the Commencement Time based on revenue, volume of business done
or services rendered by each party in part before the Commencement Time and in

business or services rendered, as the case may be, by each during the applicable
period.

                (b)     Notwithstanding any provision of Section 2.4(a) to the
contrary, with respect to all Contracts relating to Program Rights (the "Program
Contracts"), as between Sellers and Buyer:

                        (i)     Sellers shall make all payments of license and
usage fees pursuant to any Program Contract (the "Program Payments") to the
extent such Program Payments become due and payable under the terms of the
Program Contracts prior to the Commencement Time; and

                        (ii)    Buyer shall make all Program Payments to the
extent such Program Payments become due and payable under the terms of the
Program Contracts on or after the Commencement Time.

                (c)     To the extent not inconsistent with the express
provisions of this Agreement or the Local Marketing Agreement, the allocations

<PAGE>

                (d)     Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 2.4 to the
contrary, any prorations and adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4(a) shall be
subject to the following:

                        (i)     There shall be no adjustment for, and LIN shall
remain solely liable with respect to, any Excluded Contracts and any other
obligation or liability not being assumed by Buyer in accordance with Section
2.7.

                        (ii)    The parties acknowledge and agree that no
adjustment shall be made with respect to any barter or trade agreements.

        2.5     Adjustment.

                (a)     Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, LIN shall deliver to Buyer its good faith estimate of the
prorations and adjustments to be made with respect to the Purchase Price
calculated in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof, including all estimated
accrued liabilities (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement").

                (b)     Subject to the acceptance of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement by Buyer, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, the Purchase Price payable at Closing will be adjusted
by the amount of the prorations and adjustments estimated on the Preliminary
Adjustment Schedule (the "Preliminary Adjustment Amount"). LIN shall, upon
delivery of such Preliminary Adjustment Statement, permit Buyer and its
representatives access to the accounting records and accountant work papers (if
any) used in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.

                (c)     Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to LIN an itemized list of the final prorations and
adjustments calculated in accordance with Section 2.4 (the "Closing Adjustment
Statement"). The Closing Adjustment Statement shall include a description of the
net amount payable by Buyer or LIN as an adjustment pursuant to Section 2.4
hereof (the "Closing Adjustment Amount"). The Closing Adjustment Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently applied. Buyer shall, following such delivery and at the request of
LIN, permit LIN and its representatives access to the accounting records and
accountant work papers (if any) used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Adjustment Statement. In the event Buyer within such ninety (90) day
period fails to deliver the Closing Adjustment Statement, the Preliminary
Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be the Closing Adjustment Amount, which
amount shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of Section
2.5(f) hereof.

                (d)     Within thirty (30) days after the date the Closing
Adjustment Statement is delivered to LIN, LIN shall complete its examination of
the Closing Adjustment Statement and shall deliver to Buyer either (i) the
written acknowledgement of its acceptance of the Closing Adjustment Statement
and the Closing Adjustment Amount or (ii) a written report setting forth any
proposed adjustments to the Closing Adjustment Statements or the Closing
Adjustment Amount (the "Adjustment Report"). In the event LIN within such thirty
(30) day period fails to deliver the Adjustment Report, the Closing Adjustment
Statements shall be deemed to be correct

                                        5

<PAGE>

and the Closing Adjustment Amount to have been finally determined for purposes
of Section 2.5(f) hereof.

                (e)     In the event LIN and Buyer fail to agree on any or all
of the proposed adjustments to the Closing Adjustment Amount contained in the
Adjustment Report within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Adjustment
Report and the net aggregate amount in dispute exceeds Twenty Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000.00), then either party may notify an independent certified
public accounting firm as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties of the need
for its services as an independent auditor and not for LIN or Buyer (the
"Independent Auditor"). The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to make the
final determination with respect to the correctness of the Closing Adjustment
Statement in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement within
thirty (30) days after the submission thereof. The decision by the Independent
Auditor as to the adjustments that should be made to the Closing Adjustment
Statement (the "Final Adjustments") shall be final and binding on LIN and Buyer.
Buyer and LIN shall share equally the costs and expenses of the Independent
Auditor but each party shall bear its own legal and other expenses, if any. If
the net aggregate amount in dispute is equal to or less than Twenty Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), the dispute shall not be submitted to the

        3.4     FCC Licenses.

                (a)     Schedule 3.4(a) identifies the FCC Licenses used in the
operation of the Stations, and includes a complete list as of the date of this
Agreement of all main station, translator, microwave, low power television,
broadcast auxiliary and satellite earth station licenses (transmitting and

force and effect. License Seller is the authorized legal holder of the FCC
Licenses. The FCC Licenses listed on Schedule 3.4(a) constitute all of the
licenses and authorizations required under the Communications Act or the current
rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC for, or used in, the business and
operation of the Stations as currently operated. As of the date of this

investigations or other proceedings affecting the television broadcasting
industry generally, as of the date of this Agreement, LIN has no Knowledge of
any pending or threatened investigation, by or before the FCC, or any order to
show cause, notice of violation, notice of apparent liability, notice of
forfeiture or complaint by, before or with the FCC with respect to the Stations
that would be reasonably expected to (i) impair or hinder the ability of LIN to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) affect the business or
operations of the Stations, in any material, adverse respect. To the Best
Knowledge of LIN, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts,
conditions or events relating to the License Seller that would disqualify the
License Seller under the Communications Act or the existing rules, regulations
and policies of the FCC as a licensee of the FCC Licenses, that would disqualify
License Seller as the assignor of the FCC Licenses as provided in this Agreement
or that would prevent the License Seller from consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby within the times contemplated herein.

                (d)     To LIN's Best Knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, all material returns, reports and statements that the License Seller
is required to file with the FCC or Federal Aviation Administration have been
filed.

has good, valid and marketable title to all of the owned Assets and a valid
leasehold interest in all of the leased Assets, free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens, and complete and unrestricted power and the
unqualified right to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver such title and
leasehold interests to the Buyer, and upon consummation of the transactions

title to the owned Assets and a valid leasehold interest in the leased Assets,
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

        3.6     Conduct of Business in the Ordinary Course. As of the date
hereof, except as set forth in Schedule 3.6 hereto, the business of the Stations

<PAGE>

                (f)     accelerated the collection of Accounts Receivable;

                (g)     made any sale, assignment, lease or other transfer of
any of the Assets other than obsolete assets no longer used in the operation of
the Stations or other assets sold or disposed of in the normal and usual course
of business with suitable replacements being obtained therefore;

                (h)     suffered any extraordinary losses (whether or not
covered by insurance) with respect to either Station, waived any extraordinary
rights of value with respect to either Station or canceled any Debts owed to or
claims held by LIN with respect to the Stations, except in the ordinary course
of business;

                (i)     suffered any material write-down of the value of any of
the assets of either Operating Seller or License Seller or any material
write-off as uncollectible of any of the accounts receivable of either License
Seller or Operating Seller, except in the ordinary course of business;

                (j)     suffered any material change in the financial condition
of the License Seller or Operating Seller; or

                (k)     incurred any liabilities or obligations other than
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices.

        3.7     Assets of the Business. The Stations' Assets, together with the
FCC Licenses and the Excluded Assets, comprise all of the assets necessary to
conduct the Stations' Business and to operate the Stations as conducted and
operated as of the date hereof.

        3.8     Real Property.

                (a)     Except as described on Schedule 3.8, Operating Seller
has good and marketable fee simple or leasehold interests, as applicable, in all
Real Property, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens.

                (b)     No Lien on the Real Property materially interferes with
the operation of the Stations as currently operated. Sellers have not received
notice of any pending condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Real
Property or any portion thereof, and to the Best Knowledge of LIN, no such
action is presently contemplated or threatened. Sellers have not received any
written notice from any insurance company of any defects or inadequacies in the
Real Property, or any part thereof, which would materially adversely affect the
insurability of the Real Property or the premiums for the insurance thereof.
Sellers have not received any notice from any insurance company which has issued
or refused to issue a policy with respect to any portion of the Real Property or
by any board of fire underwriters (or other body exercising similar functions)
requiring the performance of any repairs, alterations or other work with which
compliance has not been made. There is no pending or, to the Best Knowledge of
LIN, threatened governmental proceeding which would impair or curtail the access
to and from completed, dedicated and accepted public roads which exists as of
the Commencement Date.

Knowledge, any other party is in default of any material provision of any lease
of any such property.

        3.10    Non-Infringement. Schedule 3.10 contains a list of all material
copyrights and trademarks held by Sellers. To LIN's Best Knowledge, neither
Operating Seller nor License Seller is infringing upon, unlawfully using or
otherwise acting adversely to any trademarks, trade names, service marks,
service names, copyrights, patents, patent applications, know-how, methods or
processes owned by any other Person. Neither Operating Seller nor License Seller
has received any notice of any kind asserting or otherwise reflecting any such

with its terms and is in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, except as
otherwise disclosed on Schedule 3.11, neither the Operating Seller nor, to LIN's
Best Knowledge, any other party to any Assumed Contract is in default under any

industry and not particular to LIN, there is no claim, legal action,

directors, employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates or any other Person,
with respect to the execution, delivery or performance by LIN of this Agreement
or with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the
delivery to Buyer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates or any other Person of any documentation or other
information by LIN or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates or any other Person with respect to any one or more
of the foregoing.

               SECTION 4 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

        Buyer hereby represents and warrants to LIN as follows:

        4.1     Organization, Standing and Authority. Buyer is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and, on the Closing Date, will be duly qualified to conduct
business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary for Buyer
to own the Assets and operate the Stations and conduct the Stations' Business.
Buyer has the requisite power and authority to (a) execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) own
the Stations' Assets and, subject to obtaining the FCC Consent, the FCC
Licenses. Buyer has no subsidiaries.

        4.2     Authorization and Binding Obligation. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by Buyer have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability of this Agreement may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by judicial discretion in
the enforcement of equitable remedies.

        4.3     Absence of Conflicting Agreements and Required Consents. Subject
to the receipt of the FCC Consent, the execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the documents contemplated hereby (with or without
the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both): (a) do not require the consent
of any other Person; (b) will not conflict with any applicable organizational
and governing documents of Buyer; and (c) will not conflict in any material
respect with, result in a material breach of or constitute a material default
under any

                                       15

<PAGE>

Applicable Law or any material contract or agreement to which Buyer is a party
or by which Buyer may be bound.

        4.4     Buyer Qualifications. Buyer in good faith believes that it is
legally, financially and otherwise qualified to acquire and own the Stations and
operate the Stations' Business under all applicable federal, state and local
laws, rules and regulations, including the Communications Act and the rules,
regulations and policies of the FCC. Neither Buyer nor any party with an
attributable interest in Buyer has filed any applications to acquire any station
in the same market as the Stations which would result in Buyer or persons with
an attributable interest in Buyer owning or seeking to acquire interests in a
greater number of stations in such market than is permitted under the FCC's
multiple ownership rules, and between the date hereof and the Closing neither
Buyer nor any party with an attributable interest in Buyer will file any such
application. To the Best Knowledge of Buyer, the filing of the Assignment
Application will not require any waiver of the FCC's rules, regulations and
policies with respect to Buyer.

        4.5     Litigation. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending, or to Buyer's Best Knowledge threatened, against Buyer,
at law or in equity, in any court or before or by any Governmental Authority
that questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement or any action taken
or to be taken by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, or that could have a
material adverse effect on the business, assets and properties of Buyer taken as
a whole. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5, Buyer is not subject to any
judgment, order or decree entered in any lawsuit or proceeding.

        4.6     Bankruptcy. No insolvency proceedings of any character,
including bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, composition or arrangement
with creditors, voluntary or involuntary, affecting Buyer are pending or, to
Buyer's Best Knowledge, threatened, and Buyer has not made any assignment for
the benefit of creditors or taken any action in contemplation of, or which would
constitute the basis for, the institution of such insolvency proceedings.

        4.7     No Broker. Neither Buyer nor any other Person acting on behalf
of Buyer has incurred any liability for any finders' or brokers' fees or
commissions in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

        4.8     Disclaimer. Buyer disclaims any reliance upon any statements or
representations made by LIN or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates or any other Person, except as
expressly provided herein. Buyer agrees to accept the Assets and comply with its
obligations under this Agreement without regard to the condition of the
Stations' Assets.

             SECTION 5 - OPERATION OF THE STATIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING

        5.1 Generally.

ending on the earlier of the Closing Date or the Termination Date, and except as
otherwise provided in the Local Marketing Agreement, LIN shall operate and

on thirty (30) days notice or be fully performed and satisfied prior to the one
(1) year anniversary thereof;

                        (iii)   take or permit any entity under its control to
take any actions that would result in the Assets being used in violation of any

necessary to prevent the Stations from being operated or the Stations' Business

written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, do any of
the following:

                        (i)     except with respect to the implementation of

and LIN shall have no liability under this Section 5 for any act or omission of
Buyer pursuant to the Local Marketing Agreement.

                (h)     Prior to the Closing Date, LIN will deliver copies of
all Contracts entered into by LIN with respect to the Stations' Business between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

                (i)     Whenever, pursuant to Section 5.1(d) or (e) hereof, LIN
shall request the consent of Buyer, the request shall be sent in writing to
Buyer in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof and Buyer's consent to such request
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        5.2     Access to Information. During the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the earlier to occur of the Closing or termination of this
Agreement, LIN shall give Buyer and its employees and other authorized
representatives, during normal business hours and with reasonable prior notice,

        5.5     Updated Schedules.

                (a)     LIN shall promptly disclose in writing to Buyer, and
Buyer shall promptly disclose in writing to LIN, any information contained in
its respective representations and warranties or LIN's schedules hereto which,
because of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement, is incomplete or
is no longer correct as of all times after the date of this Agreement and until
the Closing Date. Any such disclosure shall be in the form of an updated
Schedule, marked to reflect the new or amended information.

                (b)     In the event LIN makes any such disclosure prior to the
Closing, such disclosure shall not be deemed to amend the representations and
warranties of LIN or LIN's

                                       19

<PAGE>

schedules hereto, and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the
rights of Buyer pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof; provided, however, that if the
Buyer proceeds to Closing notwithstanding such disclosures and otherwise in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the disclosures made by LIN
pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be deemed to amend and supplement the
representations and warranties of LIN and LIN's disclosure schedules hereto and
shall be incorporated herein by reference effective as of the Closing, and in
such event Buyer shall not have the right to be indemnified for any matter
contained in such disclosure.

        5.6     Notice of Certain Matters. LIN shall give prompt written notice

other in writing upon becoming aware of any order or decree or any complaint
praying for an order or decree restraining or enjoining the consummation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, or upon receiving any
notice from any Governmental Authority of its intention to institute an
investigation into, or institute a suit or proceeding to restrain or enjoin the
consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. LIN and
Buyer will each use commercially reasonable efforts to contest, defend and
resolve any such suit, proceeding or injunction brought against it so as to
permit the prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. LIN
shall notify Buyer promptly of any material action filed or threatened against
the Stations or the Assets.

        5.8     Access to Books and Records. LIN shall provide Buyer access to

from time to time, at the request of any other party and without further cost or
expense to such requesting party, execute and deliver such other instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as such other party may
reasonably request in order more effectively to carry out this Agreement and the
other agreements specified in this Agreement and to vest in the Buyer good and
marketable title to the Assets.

        5.10    Employees. Buyer shall offer employment as of the Closing Date
to each Employee other than those Employees identified on Schedule 5.10 (the
Employees accepting employment with Buyer, the "Transferred Employees").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless otherwise
provided under the terms of a written employment or collective bargaining
agreement, each Transferred Employee shall be employed by Buyer on an at will
basis and nothing shall prohibit Buyer from terminating such employment at any
time after the Closing.

        5.11    Welfare Plans. Buyer shall (a) waive or cause to be waived all
limitations as to preexisting conditions (to the extent required by Applicable
Law), exclusions and waiting

<PAGE>

periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Transferred Employees under any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that such employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Closing Date and (b) provide or cause to be provided to each
Transferred Employee credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any such plans that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date.

        5.12    Past Service Credit. Buyer agrees that, with respect to all of
the employee benefit programs and arrangements covering or otherwise benefiting
any of the Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date, service with

arrangements (but not for benefit accrual or any other purpose under such
programs or arrangements).

        5.13    WARN Act. Buyer and LIN agree to cooperate in good faith to
determine whether any notification may be required under the WARN Act as a
result of the transactions contemplated under the Agreement and, if such notices
are required, to provide such notice in a manner that is reasonably satisfactory
to each of the parties hereto.

        5.14    Receipts and Disbursements. In the event that Buyer receives any
payment subsequent to the Closing Date properly payable to LIN in connection
with the Excluded Assets or otherwise, such payment shall promptly be the
property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to, LIN. In the event that LIN
receives any payment subsequent to the Closing Date properly payable to Buyer in
connection with the Assets or otherwise, such payment shall promptly be the
property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to, Buyer.

                  SECTION 6 - SPECIAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

        6.1     FCC Consent.

                (a)     The assignment of the FCC Licenses from License Seller
to Buyer as contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the prior consent and
approval of the FCC.

                (b)     Within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, LIN
and Buyer shall prepare and thereafter shall promptly file with the FCC the
Assignment Application. The FCC filing fees shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by LIN. The parties shall thereafter prosecute the Assignment
Application with commercially reasonable diligence and otherwise use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the grant of the Assignment
Application as expeditiously as practicable. Each party will promptly provide to
the other party a copy of any pleading, order or other document served on them
relating to such Assignment Application. LIN shall comply with all Applicable
Laws regarding public notice of the Assignment Application.

                (c)     Each party agrees to comply with any condition imposed
on it by any FCC Consent, except that no party shall be required to comply with
a condition if (i) the condition was imposed on it as the result of a
circumstance the existence of which does not constitute a breach by that party
of any of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder or (ii)
compliance with the condition would have a material adverse effect upon it.
Buyer and LIN shall oppose any

                                       21

<PAGE>

petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the application for
any FCC Consent and any requests for reconsideration or review of any FCC
Consent.

                (d)     If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason
within the original effective period of any FCC Consent, and neither party shall
have terminated this Agreement under Section 9 hereof, the parties shall jointly
request an extension of the effective period of such FCC Consent. No extension
of the effective period of any FCC Consent shall limit the exercise by either
party of its right to terminate the Agreement under Section 9 hereof.

        6.2     Third Party Consents. LIN shall use all reasonable efforts and
Buyer shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with LIN to obtain any third
party consent or approval required pursuant to any Assumed Contracts as a result
of the purchase and sale of the Assets as contemplated herein. If such a consent
is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment of such an Assumed Contract be
ineffective, LIN shall use all reasonable efforts to provide Buyer the benefits
of any such Assumed Contract and, to the extent Buyer is provided with the
benefits of such Assumed Contract, Buyer shall perform or discharge on behalf of
LIN the obligations and liabilities under such Assumed Contract in accordance
with the provisions thereof. In addition to Buyer's obligation pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, as to any Assumed Contract that is not effectively assigned
to Buyer as of the Effective Time but is thereafter effectively assigned to
Buyer, Buyer shall, from and after the effective date of such assignment,
assume, and shall thereafter pay, perform and discharge as and when due, all
liabilities and obligations of LIN arising under such Assumed Contract.

        6.3     Confidentiality.

                (a)     Neither party will use or disclose to any other Person
(except as may be necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or as required by Applicable Law, and then only with prior
notice to the other party hereto) this Agreement or the Local Marketing
Agreement or any information received from the other party hereto or their
agents in the course of investigating, negotiating and performing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Local Marketing Agreement;
provided, however, that each party may disclose such information to such party's
officers, directors, employees, lenders, advisors, attorneys, accountants and
financial advisors who need to know such information in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who are
informed by such party of the confidential nature of such information. Nothing
shall be deemed to be confidential information that: (i) is already in such
party's possession, provided that such information is not known by such party to
be subject to another confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of
secrecy to the other party hereto or another party, or (ii) becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such party or
such party's officers, directors, employees, lenders, advisors, attorneys or
accountants, or (iii) becomes available to such party on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than another party hereto or its advisors, provided that
such source is not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to the other party hereto or
another party, or (iv) is developed independently by either party without resort
to the confidential information of the other party. In the event this Agreement
is terminated and the purchase and sale contemplated hereby abandoned, each
party will return to the other party all information, including all documents,
work papers and other written confidential material, obtained by such party from
the

                                       22

<PAGE>

other party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The covenant contained in this Section 6.3(a) shall survive for a period of five
(5) years from the earlier of the Closing Date or the date in which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.

                (b)     No party shall publish any press release or make any
other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be withheld unreasonably; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent any party, after notification to the other party,
from making any filings with governmental authorities that, in its judgment, may
be required or advisable in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                (c)     Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.3,
each of LIN and Buyer shall be permitted to disclose this Agreement and the
Local Marketing Agreement (including the terms thereof) to the extent such
disclosure (i) is required in connection with a public offering of securities by
(A) LIN, Buyer or any of their Affiliates or (B) Nexstar Broadcasting Group,
L.L.C., or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) is required in connection with any
regulatory filing or other filing required to be made with a Governmental
Authority by any of the foregoing parties.

        6.4     Cooperation. Buyer and LIN shall cooperate fully with each other
and their respective counsel and accountants in connection with any actions
required to be taken as part of their respective obligations under this
Agreement, and Buyer and LIN shall execute such other documents as may be
necessary or desirable to implement and consummate this Agreement, and otherwise
use their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to fulfill their obligations under this Agreement.

        6.5     Control of the Stations. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct or attempt to control,
supervise or direct, the operations of the Stations; those operations, including
complete control and supervision of all of the Stations' employees and policies,
shall be the sole responsibility of LIN.

        6.6     Local Marketing Agreement. At or prior to the date of this
Agreement, Buyer and Operating Seller shall enter into the Local Marketing
Agreement.

        6.7     Release of Liens. Except for Permitted Liens, at or prior to the
Closing, LIN shall obtain the release of any Liens on the Assets and shall duly
file releases or terminations of all such Liens with any Governmental Authority
with whom evidence of such Lien has previously been filed.

        6.8     Real Estate Matters.

                (a)     Prior to the Closing, Sellers will reasonably cooperate
with Buyer so that Buyer may obtain, for the benefit of and at the sole cost of
Buyer, all documents reasonably required (including estoppel certificates,
owner's affidavits, indemnities and GAP undertakings) for a final commitment for
an ALTA Owners Policy of Title Insurance, as the case may be, Form B-1970 (or if
not reasonably attainable, 1992 Form), for each parcel of Real Property owned by
Operating Seller, issued by a title insurer designated by Buyer (the "Title
Insurer"), in such

                                       23

<PAGE>

amount as Buyer reasonably determines to be the fair market value thereof,
insuring the Buyer's interest in such parcel, subject only to the Permitted
Liens, and with such other endorsements and other terms and conditions as Buyer
may reasonably request.

                (b)     At Buyer's request, Sellers will reasonably cooperate
with Buyer so that Buyer may procure for the benefit of and at the sole cost of
Buyer, in preparation for the Closing, current surveys of each parcel of Owned
Real Property disclosing no survey defects or encroachments which materially
interfere with the current business and operation of the Station, prepared by a
licensed surveyor and conforming to 1992 ALTA/ACSM Minimum Detail Requirements
for Urban Land Title Surveys, and such standards as the Title Insurer may
reasonably require as a condition to the removal of any survey exceptions from
the commitment for the title insurance policy described in Section 6.10(a), and

                (f)     by Buyer, in the event that LIN becomes or is declared

                (h)     by either party after the Termination Date except if the

Agreement by the terminating party.

        9.2     Procedure and Effect of Termination.

                (a)     In the event of termination of this Agreement by any
party or parties pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall be given
promptly to the other party and this Agreement shall terminate and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by
any of the parties hereto, but subject to and without limiting any of the rights
of the parties specified herein in the event a party is in default or breach in
any material respect of its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, upon the Termination Date:

                        (i)     None of the parties hereto nor any of their
respective partners, directors, officers, shareholders, employers, agents or
Affiliates (each, a "Related Party") shall have any liability or further
obligation to the other party or any of their respective Related Parties
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to which termination has occurred,
except for the obligations of LIN and Buyer (but not including LIN's or Buyer's
Related Parties) as stated in Sections 6.3 and 10 and this Section 9.2; and

                        (ii)    All filings, applications and other submissions
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as to which termination has
occurred shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other
Person to which made.

                (b)     (i)     If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(c) or 9.1(f), LIN shall return the Initial
Payment in full to Buyer without limitation of any other remedies available to
Buyer.

                        (ii)    If this Agreement is terminated by LIN pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(i), 9.1(d) or 9.1(g), LIN shall have the right to retain the
Initial Payment as liquidated damages under this Agreement and not as a penalty,
and such right shall be LIN's sole remedy at law or equity for Buyer's breach
hereunder and in respect of termination of this Agreement. LIN and Buyer hereby
agree that actual damages in such circumstances may be difficult to ascertain
and that the Initial Payment is a fair and equitable amount to reimburse LIN for
damages sustained due to Buyer's breach of this Agreement.

                                       29

<PAGE>

                        (iii)   If this Agreement is terminated by either party
pursuant to Section 9.1(a), 9.1(e) or 9.1(h), LIN shall have the right to retain
a portion of the Initial Payment equal to the product of (A) the number of
calendar days from the Commencement Date until the date of such termination and
(B) Three Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($3,300.00) (the "LMA Payment") as
consideration for entering into the Local Marketing Agreement during such
period, and LIN shall return the remaining portion of the Initial Payment to
Buyer; provided, however, that in no circumstances will the LMA Payment exceed
the amount of the Initial Payment.

                (c)     No later than five (5) days following the termination of
this Agreement, LIN shall pay to Buyer all amounts required to be paid to Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i) or 9.2(b)(iii) hereof, if applicable, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for credit to Buyer in accordance with
wire transfer instructions provided by Buyer in writing (or by such other method
of funds transfer as may be agreed upon by Buyer and LIN). With respect to any
amounts owed by LIN pursuant to this Section 9.2(c), Buyer shall have the right
to set-off any amounts it owes to LIN against any amounts owed to it by LIN,
provided, that Buyer provides a reasonably detailed written accounting of any
such offset made in connection with or in lieu of any payment required under
this Section 9.2(c).

                (d)     If LIN fails to pay when due any amount under this
Section 9.2, interest on such amount will accrue from the date payment was due
and be payable until paid at the per annum rate of the "prime rate" as published
in the Money Rates column of the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal (or
the average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated) plus two percent
(2%) and shall be payable upon demand.

        9.3     Attorneys' Fees. In the event of a default by any party that
results in a lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy available under this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
other party or parties of its reasonable legal fees and expenses (whether
incurred in arbitration, at trial or on appeal).

                         INDEMNIFICATION; CERTAIN REMEDIES

        10.1    Survival. The representations and warranties of Buyer and LIN
contained herein shall survive the Closing (regardless of any investigation or
inquiry of any party and even if the damaged party knew or had reason to know of
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty at the time of the Closing) for a
period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and shall terminate on such
date except to the extent that any claims for indemnification in respect of a
breach of any such representation or warranty is made on or before such date, in
which case such representation or warranty shall survive until the resolution of
such claim; provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.3 and 3.14 shall survive in perpetuity. Any claim for
indemnification in respect of a covenant or agreement of Buyer or LIN hereunder
to be performed before the Closing shall be made before the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of LIN
contained herein and to be performed to any extent after the Closing Date shall
survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
and shall terminate on such date and any claims for indemnification in respect
of a breach of such covenants to be performed in any respect after the

                                       30

Closing Date must be made on or before such date. The covenants and agreements
of the parties contained herein shall survive the Closing Date until fully
discharged and performed.

                        (i)     any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of LIN made in this Agreement, the Local Marketing Agreement or any
certificate, document or instrument prepared by LIN and delivered to Buyer
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions hereof or thereof;

                        (ii)    any failure by LIN to carry out, perform or
otherwise fulfill or comply with any covenant, agreement, undertaking or
obligation of LIN under this Agreement;

                        (iii)   the Retained Liabilities; and

                        (iv)    any suit, action or other proceeding brought by
any Governmental Authority or any other Person arising out of, or related to,
any of the matters referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii).

                (b)     LIN's obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section

only with respect to the amount of such Damages in excess of Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00).

                        (iii)   No indemnification shall be required to be made
by LIN to the extent that the aggregate amount of Damages of Buyer under Section
10.2(a)(i) (and Section 10.2(a)(iv) to the extent related to the matters
described in Section 10.2(a)(i)) exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,500,000.00).

                        (iv)    Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for Buyer for any claim (whether such claim is framed in tort, contract
or otherwise) arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement herein or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Assets or the operations of the

                (c)     Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of any

Section 10.2, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of LIN
set forth in this Agreement and the Local Marketing Agreement will be considered

personal obligation to indemnify LIN for any of LIN's claims pursuant to Section

                (c)     Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of any
Damages that are subject to the indemnification obligations of Buyer under this
Section 10.3, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Buyer
set forth in this Agreement and the Local Marketing Agreement will be considered
without regard to any materiality qualification set forth therein.

        10.4    Procedure for Indemnification. The procedure for indemnification
shall be as follows:

                (a)     The party claiming indemnification (the "Claimant")
shall promptly give notice to the party from which indemnification is claimed
(the "Indemnifying Party") of any claim, specifying the claim in reasonable
detail and the amount thereof, estimated in good faith, all with reasonable
particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such claim shall be made. If the claim relates to an action,
suit or proceeding filed by a third party against Claimant (a "Third Party
Claim"), such notice shall be given by Claimant promptly after written notice of
such action, suit or proceeding was given to Claimant; provided that the failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

                (b)     With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right at its own expense, to participate in or assume
control of the defense of such claim, and the Claimant shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party, subject to reimbursement for actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of a request by the Indemnifying
Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to
assume control of a defense if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation against the Claimant, (ii) the Claimant reasonably
concludes in good faith that, in light of any actual or potential conflict of
interest, it would be inappropriate for legal counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party to represent the Claimant, (iii) the Claimant reasonably
believes in good faith that an adverse determination with respect to the action,
lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim for
indemnification would be materially detrimental to or materially injure
Claimant's reputation or future business prospects (or, in the case of a claim
by the Buyer, a Station's or a Seller's reputation or business prospects), or
(iv) upon petition by the Claimant, an appropriate court rules that the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such
claim.

                (c)     If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Claimant shall have the right to
participate in the defense of such claim at its own expense (except that the
reasonable fees and expenses of Claimant incurred prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party effectively assumes control of such defense will be borne by
the Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume
control or otherwise participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, then
the Claimant may defend through counsel of its own choosing and (so long as it
gives the Indemnifying Party at least ten (10) Business Days notice of the terms
of any proposed settlement thereof and permits the Indemnifying Party to then
undertake the defense thereof) may settle such claim, action or suit and may
recover from the Indemnifying Party the amount of such settlement or of any
judgment

                                       33

<PAGE>

and the costs and expenses of such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall not
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Claimant, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

                (d)     Subject to the limitations set forth herein and without
expanding the total liability of Buyer or LIN hereunder, the indemnification
rights provided in Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 shall extend to the Related
Parties of any Claimant, except that for the purpose of the procedures set forth
in this Section 10.4, any indemnification claims by such Related Parties shall
be made by and through the Claimant.

                (e)     Each party will treat all payments made pursuant to
Sections 10.2 and 10.3 as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all purposes to
the extent required by Applicable Law.

        10.5    Remedies Under Local Marketing Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 10 is intended to modify or amend the rights and remedies of the parties
under the Local Marketing Agreement.

                           SECTION 11 - MISCELLANEOUS

                                       35

determination that any term or other provision is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are

or changed except by an agreement in writing that is signed by the parties
hereto.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same document. Each party hereto will
receive by delivery or facsimile or other electronic transmission a duplicate

deemed to be an original of the Agreement so transmitted.
