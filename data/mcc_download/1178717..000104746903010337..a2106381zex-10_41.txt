       Re:  Fiscal Year 2002 Executive Incentive Plan Components

          I am pleased to confirm your participation in the 2002 Executive
          Incentive Plan.

MEMO      The basis on which our plan is measured is proforma EBITDA. For the
          2002 EIP, the Vertis EBITDA component accounts for 100% of the bonus
          calculation. During the year the plan design will be reviewed and may
          be amended. Any resulting changes will be communicated to you at that
          time. Details of the 2002 EIP are outlined below for your reference.

          EIP TARGET - Your EIP target incentive is 75% and is based on your
          base salary as of December 31, 2002. This provides for automatic
          increases to your EIP incentive as your base salary increases during
          the plan year.

          VERTIS EBITDA - measures "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
          Depreciation and Amortization", excluding approved restructuring
          charges
          -    100% of your bonus is based on Vertis EBITDA. The target at 100%
               achievement is $243.9 million.
          -    If Vertis EBITDA calculates at 90% of target or below, there will
               be no Vertis component payout. For every 1% achieved over 90%,
               the plan will pay out 10%, up to 100% at the EBITDA target.
          -    For every 1% achieved above the target and up to 115% of target,
               the plan will pay out an additional 6.67%, with a maximum EBITDA
               payout of 200%.

          As part of the Vertis management team, we have an opportunity to help
          influence and ensure the company's success while, at the same time,
          garnering personal rewards through EIP bonuses.

          We have a lot going for us: an excellent set of Values, a solid
          business plan and a strong team in place to carry it out. I look
          forward to working with you as we focus on our mission and the
          strategic objectives that will lead to our success and, ultimately, to
          the realization of the Vertis vision.
