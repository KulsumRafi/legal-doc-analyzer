Under Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock lapse will be reportable as ordinary income
at that time. For this purpose, "forfeiture restrictions" include surrender to the Company of Restricted Stock as described above. You may elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Stock is awarded to you, rather than when the restrictions lapse
by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Date of Award. The form for making this election is attached as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
hereto. Failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by you (in the event the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock increases after the date of purchase) as the forfeiture
restrictions lapse. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY'S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER CODE SECTION 83(b). YOU ARE RELYING SOLELY ON YOUR OWN ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO
