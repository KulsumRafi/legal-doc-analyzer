and collectively as the "Borrowers"), and Congress Financial Corporation
("Congress").

         WHEREAS, Congress and each of the Borrowers have entered into an
Accounts Financing Agreement [Security Agreement] dated as of January 11, 1990,

Agreements").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

         1.       WAIVER. Subject to paragraph 2 hereof, Congress hereby waives,

Notes due February 1, 2000, and/or (d) the 10-1/2% Senior Note due May 1, 2002,
of LPC and LRG (the indebtedness referred to in clauses (a), (b), and (c) is
referred to herein as the "Other Indebtedness").

         2.       RESCISSION OF WAIVERS. The foregoing waivers shall be
automatically rescinded, without notice to LPC or LRG, in the event that the
holder of any Other Indebtedness or trustee in respect thereof seeks to
accelerate the maturity of any such Other Indebtedness or to enforce or exercise
any remedies in respect thereto.

         3.       EFFECTIVE DATE.

                  This Agreement shall be deemed effective as of January 3,
2003.

Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite action on its part; and (b)

its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
the enforceability of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable
principles.

         5.       NO OTHER AMENDMENTS.

                  Except as set forth herein, all terms and provisions of the
Financing Agreements among Congress, LPC and LRG shall remain in full force and
effect. Except as expressly set forth herein, no other or further amendment,
