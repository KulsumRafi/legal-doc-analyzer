Agreement. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Employee represents that he is not aware of any claim by him other than the claims that are released by (or excluded from)
this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that he has been advised by legal counsel and is familiar with the principle that a general release may not extend to claims which the releasor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the releasee. Employee, being aware of said principle, agrees to expressly waive any rights he may have to that effect, as well as under any other statute
or common law principles of similar effect. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV ALIGN="center">
