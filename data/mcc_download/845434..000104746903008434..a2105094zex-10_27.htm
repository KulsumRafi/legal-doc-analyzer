<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of In Focus Systems,&nbsp;Inc. ("InFocus") considers it essential to the best interests of InFocus and its subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Company") to foster the continued employment of key management personnel; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of InFocus has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the
Company's senior management to their assigned duties without distraction concerning what might happen to their income in the event of a termination of their employment without cause; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
severance pay program will be available as of April&nbsp;10, 1999 (the "Plan Date") for those executives named on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A  </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>attached hereto (each an "Executive"). The date an Executive is eligible
to participate in the Plan ("Eligibility Date") shall be as follows: Executives listed as "InFocus
Executives" will be eligible to participate as of the Plan Date. Executives listed as "Proxima Executives" will be eligible to participate as of the date of completion of the share exchange between
InFocus and Proxima ASA. The InFocus Board of Directors may designate additional executives as eligible to participate in the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will apply to only those Executives whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause and, within 18&nbsp;months of a "Change in Control", those Executives who
resign with "Good Reason" as those terms are defined herein. Notwithstanding, severance pay benefits under the Plan shall not be payable solely as a result of an Executive's transfer of employment to
Company, as a result of the InFocus/Proxima share exchange, and the share exchange shall not be deemed a "Change in Control" for purposes of this Plan. An Executive's "Date of Termination" is the last
day the Executive is designated as an employee. Payment of the severance benefits will be as follows: </FONT></P>

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>(i)</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>For

applicable law, and the terms herein, the Severance Plan or applicable law shall govern, whichever provides the greater benefit. The provisions of this Plan cannot be changed, amended or modified in
any way that would reduce the benefit to an Executive unless the Executive provides his/her written consent. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Executive with a prior written severance agreement may opt not to participate in this Plan. Each Executive will be given 90&nbsp;days from his/her
Eligibility Date to make a written determination of participation (Exhibit&nbsp;C), and absent a determination on or before that date, then Executive will not be covered by this Plan. A written
election to participate in this Plan shall constitute a Proxima Executive's agreement for cancellation of any prior written agreement related to severance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) employees have certain specific rights regarding the severance pay plan. This document constitutes
the official Plan document and summary Plan description. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are eligible for benefits under Company's Corporate Executive Severance Pay Plan ("Plan"), you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. You may examine (without
charge) all Plan documents, including documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor, from the Employee Benefits Manager. You may obtain copies of all Plan documents and other Plan information upon
written request to the Plan Administrator. (The document containing this statement constitutes both the Plan document and the summary plan description.) A reasonable charge may be made for copies. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees
may also obtain a statement telling them whether they have a right to receive severance benefits under the Plan, and if so, what such benefits would be. This statement must be
requested in writing and is not required to be given more than once a year. The statement must be provided free of charge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of this Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called
fiduciaries, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants. No employee may be fired or discriminated against to prevent him or her from obtaining Plan benefits
or from exercising his or her rights under ERISA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, you can take steps to enforce your rights. For instance, if you request materials from the Administrator and do not receive them within 30&nbsp;days, you may file&nbsp;a
suit in federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $100 per day until you receive them, unless the reasons why the materials were
not sent were beyond the control of the Administrator. If your claim is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If you are discriminated against for
asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are
successful, the court may order the person you sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, for example because the courts finds your claim frivolous, you may be ordered to pay these costs and fees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you have any questions about the information presented here, please do not hesitate to contact the nearest Area Office of the U.S. Labor-Management Services Administration, Department
of Labor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
the Plan Administrator is authorized to make administrative interpretations of the provisions of the Plan and will do so only in writing. You should not rely on any representation,
whether oral or in writing, which any other person may make concerning Plan provisions and your entitlement to benefits under them. </FONT></P>
