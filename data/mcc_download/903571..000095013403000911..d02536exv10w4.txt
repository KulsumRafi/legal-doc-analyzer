                       Summary of Severance Arrangements

         Golden Star Resources Ltd. has arrangements with Richard Q. Gray,
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Allan J. Marter, the
Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, regarding severance
to be paid under certain circumstances. Under these arrangements, Mr. Gray's or
Mr. Marter's employment can be terminated by the Company upon three-months
written notice or, at the Company's option, upon payment of a lump sum equal to
three months salary.

         If Mr. Gray's or Mr. Marter's employment is terminated in the event of
a change in control of the Company, he is entitled to payment of a lump sum
equal to three months salary plus one additional month's salary for each full
year of employment by the Company. "Change in control" is defined to include:
(i) the acquisition by any person of a sufficient number of the outstanding
voting securities of the Company to materially affect the control of the
Company; (ii) a majority of the Board of the Company shall be individuals who
are not nominated by the Board of the Company; (iii) merger or consolidation of
the Company with any person (and the Company is not the surviving corporation);
(iv) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are acquired by
another person; or (v) Mr. Gray's or Mr. Marter's respective office, station or
duties are materially reduced or adversely changed as a result of the occurrence
of one of the events mentioned above.
