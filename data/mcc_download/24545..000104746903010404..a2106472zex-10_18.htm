<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

align their interests more closely with the interests of the other shareholders of the Company, to encourage the highest level of Director performance by providing the Directors with a direct interest
in the Company's attainment of its financial goals, and to provide a financial incentive that will help attract and retain the most qualified Directors. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Effective Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The effective date of the Plan is May&nbsp;16, 2002. The Plan and each award granted under the amended
and restated Plan is conditioned on and shall be of no force or effect until approval of the Plan by the holders of a majority of the shares of voting stock of the Company, unless the Company, on the
advice of counsel, determines that shareholder approval is not necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>and
if the Board shall in its discretion determine that the event described in subsection (a), (b), or (c)&nbsp;above equitably requires an adjustment in the number or kind of shares subject to an
Option or other Award, an adjustment in the Option Price or the taking of any other action by the Board, including without limitation, the setting aside of any property for delivery to the Director
upon the exercise of an Option or the full vesting of an Award, then such adjustments shall be made, or other action shall be taken, by the Board and shall be effective for all purposes of the Plan
and on each outstanding Option or Award that involves the particular type of stock for which a change was effected. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;4.4, pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7.4 below, a Director holding Stock received as a Restricted Stock Award shall have the right to receive all amounts, including cash and property of any kind, distributed with respect
to the Stock upon the Director's becoming a holder of record of the Stock. </FONT></P>

limited by deleting any fractional share. In the case of any such substitution or adjustment, the total Option Price for the shares of Stock then subject to the Option shall remain unchanged but the
Option Price per share under each such Option shall be equitably adjusted by the Board to reflect the greater or lesser number of shares of Stock or other securities into which the Stock subject to
the Option may have been changed, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to Restricted Stock Awards to reflect any such substitution or adjustment. </FONT></P>
