                                 FIRST AMENDMENT

     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT (the "Amendment") is made and entered into as of the
5th day of November, 1999, by and between EOP-BUCKHEAD, L.L.C., A DELAWARE
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ("Landlord"), and VIEWLOCITY, INC., A DELAWARE
CORPORATION ("Tenant").

                                    RECITALS

A.   Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain lease dated concurrently as
     of the date hereof (the "Lease") for space currently containing
     approximately 23,827 rentable square feet (the "Premises") described as
     Suite No. 1700 on the 17th floor of the building commonly known as
     Prominence in Buckhead and the address of which is 3475 Piedmont Road, NE,
     Atlanta, Georgia 30305 (the "Building").

B.   Pursuant to the Lease, Tenant was required to obtain a Letter of Credit in
     the amount of $1,212,468.06 that would (i) automatically renew for one year
     periods until 60 days after the Termination Date of the Lease and (i)
     reduce upon each anniversary of the initial expiration date of the Letter
     of Credit, as more fully described in the Lease, and a copy of which
     intended Letter of Credit is attached as Exhibit F of the Lease. At this
     time, Tenant is only able to obtain a Letter of Credit in the amount of
     $1,212,468.06, good for one year and without automatic renewals (the
     "Initial Letter of Credit"). However, Tenant intends to replace the Initial
     Letter of Credit with a Letter of Credit in the form required by the Lease
     prior to expiration of the Initial Letter of Credit.

C.   Tenant and Landlord mutually desire that the Lease be amended on and
     subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant agree as
follows:

I.   AMENDMENT. Landlord and Tenant agree that the Lease shall be amended in
     accordance with the following terms and conditions:

     A.   Effective as of the date of the Lease, Landlord and Tenant agree that,
          notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, the
          Letter of Credit to be delivered by Tenant as the initial Letter of
          Credit required under the Lease shall be in the form of the Letter of
          Credit attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "Initial Letter of Credit").
          However, Landlord is entitled to, and Tenant agrees to provide,
          Landlord with a replacement Letter of Credit substantially in the form
          attached hereto as EXHIBIT B (the "Replacement Letter of Credit"). If
          Tenant fails to deliver the Replacement Letter of Credit to Landlord,
          in form satisfactory to Landlord, on or before 60 days prior to the
          expiration date of the Initial Letter of Credit, then it shall be
          deemed a default of Tenant under the Lease and Landlord, as its sole
          remedy, may immediately draw upon the Initial Letter of Credit in its
          entirety, without notice to Tenant, and apply and/or hold the proceeds
          thereof as a Security Deposit in accordance with Section VI of the
          Lease.

II.  MISCELLANEOUS.

     A.   This Amendment sets forth the entire agreement between the parties
          with respect to the matters set forth herein. There have been no
          additional oral or written representations or agreements. Except as
          herein modified or amended, the provisions, conditions and terms of
          the Lease shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect. In the
          case of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Lease and this
          Amendment, the provisions of this Amendment shall govern and control.

     B.   Submission of this Amendment by Landlord is not an offer to enter into
          this Amendment but rather is a solicitation for such an offer by
          Tenant. Landlord shall not be bound by this Amendment until Landlord
          has executed and delivered the same to Tenant.

     C.   The capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have the same
          definitions as set forth in the Lease to the extent that such
          capitalized terms are defined therein and not redefined in this
          Amendment.

     D.   Tenant hereby represents to Landlord that Tenant has dealt with no
          broker in connection with this Amendment. Tenant agrees to indemnify
          and hold Landlord, its members, principals, beneficiaries, partners,
          officers, directors, employees, mortgagee(s) and agents, and the
          respective principals and members of any such agents (collectively,
          the "Landlord Related Parties") harmless from all claims of any
          brokers claiming to have represented Tenant in connection with this
          Amendment. Landlord hereby represents to Tenant that Landlord has
          dealt with no broker in connection with this Amendment. Landlord
          agrees to indemnify and hold Tenant, its members, principals,
          beneficiaries, partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents,
          and the respective principals and members of any such agents
          (collectively, the "Tenant Related Parties") harmless from all claims
          of any brokers claiming to have represented Landlord in connection
          with this Amendment.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have duly executed this Amendment
as of the day and year first above written.
