noncompliance resulted in material economic harm to the Company, or (b)&nbsp;a final judicial order or determination prohibiting Executive from service as an officer pursuant to the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Executive shall first be provided with written notice of the claim(s) against him under the above provisions and given a reasonable

shall be entitled to participate in the Company's group health insurance plan, as amended from time to time by the Company, after Executive's Separation Date or the end of the Salary Continuation
Period, as applicable, for the remainder of Executive's life ("Life Coverage Period"). During the Life Coverage Period, Executive shall pay twenty percent (20%) of the current premium (revised
annually) on an after-tax basis each quarter, and the Company shall pay eighty percent (80%) of said premium on an after-tax basis, which contribution will be imputed income to
Executive. As soon after the Separation Date as Executive becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, the Company's group health insurance plan shall become secondary to Medicare. </FONT></P>

paragraph&nbsp;10. If, prior to a Change in Control (as defined above), Executive's active employment has been terminated for any reason by either party or this Agreement is not renewed by the
Company, then Executive's Severance Agreement terminates automatically. </FONT></P>

employment or the non-renewal of this Agreement, he will be entitled to apply at his option for the Company's long-term disability benefits. If he is accepted for such
benefits, then the terms and provisions of the Company's benefit plans and the programs (including the Company's Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans) that are applicable in the event of such
disability of an employee shall apply in lieu of the salary and benefits under this Agreement, except that he will be entitled to the lifetime group insurance benefits described in
paragraph&nbsp;10. If Executive is disabled so that he cannot perform his duties (as reasonably determined by the Human Resources Committee (HRC)), then the Company may terminate his duties under
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, disability will be the inability of Executive, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job. In such event,
he will receive eighteen (18)&nbsp;months salary continuation (offset by any long term disability benefits to which he is entitled), together with all other benefits, and during such period of
salary continuation any stock options and restricted stock grants then in existence will continue in force for vesting purposes. Executive, if disabled, shall also be eligible for lifetime health
benefits as if he has completed the eligibility requirements of paragraph&nbsp;10 and at the rates set forth in paragraph&nbsp;10. However, during such period of salary continuation for
disability, Executive will not be eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan, nor will he be eligible to receive stock option or restricted stock grants or any other long-term
incentive awards except to the extent approved by the HRC. After the eighteen (18)&nbsp;months of salary continuation has expired, per plan documents, fifty percent (50%) of any remaining unvested
annual options, if any, will vest and the other fifty percent (50%) of the unvested annual options will terminate. All PTO will also be paid out. </FONT></P>
