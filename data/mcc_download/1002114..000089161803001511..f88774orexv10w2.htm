<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;In the event that any Option granted under the Plan would cause the
number of Shares subject to outstanding Options plus the number of Shares
previously purchased under Options to exceed the Pool, then the remaining
Shares available for Option grant shall be granted under Options to the Outside
Directors on a pro rata basis. No further grants shall be made until such
time, if any, as additional Shares become available for grant under the Plan
through action of the Board or the shareholders to increase the number of
Shares which may be issued under the Plan or through cancellation or expiration
of Options previously granted hereunder.

continuation of service as a Director or nomination to serve as a Director, nor
shall it interfere in any way with any rights which the Director or the Company
may have to terminate the Director&#146;s relationship with the Company at any time.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option granted
hereunder shall be exercisable at such times as are set forth in Section&nbsp;4
hereof; provided, however, that no Options shall be exercisable until

obtained.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such
exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the
Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the
Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the
Company. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment
allowable under Section&nbsp;7 of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the
appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer
agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such Shares, no right
to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist
with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
A share certificate for the number of Shares so acquired shall be issued to
the Optionee as soon as practicable after exercise of the Option. No adjustment
shall be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior
to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section&nbsp;10
of the Plan.

number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the
Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the
Option is exercised.

applicable provisions of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or any
successor thereto and shall contain such additional conditions or restrictions
as may be required thereunder to qualify Plan transactions, and other
transactions by Outside Directors that otherwise could be matched with Plan
transactions, for the maximum exemption from Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act.

bequest or inheritance may exercise the Option, but only within twelve (12)
months following the date of death, and only to the extent that the Optionee

as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the
Optionee, the Option or option shall become fully exercisable, including as to
Shares for which it would not otherwise be exercisable. Thereafter, the Option

assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the Option confers the
right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the
Option immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration
(whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger
or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the
effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of
