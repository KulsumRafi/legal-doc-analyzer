income tax law (the "Excise Tax"), to the end that you shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from the Company to you in
the nature of compensation as you would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. In furtherance of such indemnification, the Company shall pay to you a payment (the "Gross-Up
Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by you of all taxes, including income taxes and Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties (other than
interest and penalties imposed by reason of your failure to file timely tax returns or to pay taxes shown due on such returns and any tax liability, including interest and penalties, unrelated to the
Excise Tax or the Gross-Up Amount), you shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from the Company to you in the
nature of compensation as you would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. At such time or times necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article&nbsp;II in view of the
withholding requirements of Section&nbsp;4999 (c)&nbsp;(1) of the Code, the Company shall pay to you one or more Gross-Up Payments for the Severance Payment and any other payments in
the nature of compensation which the Company determines are "excess parachute payments" under Section&nbsp;280G(b) (1)&nbsp;of the Code ("Excess Parachute Payments"). If, through a local taxing
authority (a "Taxing Authority"), or a judgement of any court, you become liable for an amount of Excise Tax not covered by the Gross-Up Payment payable pursuant to the preceding sentence,
the Company shall pay you an additional Gross-Up Payment to make you whole for such additional Excise Tax; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that, pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.3, the Company shall have the right to require you to protest, contest, or appeal any such determination or

Gross-Up Payment and the Excess Parachute Payments and Excise Tax to which it relates, and setting forth the Company's determination of the amount of gross income you are required to
recognize as a result of such payments and your liability for the Excise Tax. You shall cause your federal, state and local income tax returns for the period in which you receive such
Gross-Up Payment to be prepared and filed in accordance with such statement, and, upon
such fling, you shall certify in writing to the Company that such returns have been so prepared and filed. At your request, the Company shall furnish to you, at no cost to you, assistance in preparing
your federal, state and local income tax returns for the period in which you receive such Gross-Up Payment in accordance with such statement. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section&nbsp;2.1, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify you from and against any tax liability, cost or expenses (including, without limitation, any liability for the Excise Tax or
attorney's fees or costs) to the extent such tax liability, cost or expense is attributable to your failure to comply with the provisions if this Section&nbsp;2.2. </FONT></P>

litigation (a "Controversy"), the Company shall have the right to participate with you in the handling of such Controversy. The Company shall have the right, solely with respect to a Controversy, to
direct you to protest or contest any proposed adjustment or deficiency, initiate an appeals procedure within any Taxing Authority, commence any judicial proceeding, make any settlement agreement, or

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Severance Payment to which you are entitled shall be paid to you, in cash and in full, not later than eight (8)&nbsp;calendar days after the execution and
delivery by you (or your beneficiary or personal representative, if applicable) of the Release Agreement, but in no event before the date on which such Release becomes effective. If you should die

including required employee contributions, if any, as in effect for similarly-situated Executives in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries, for your Severance Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, your right to any particular type of Welfare Benefit shall be subject to cancellation by the Company if you or your dependents obtain alternative coverage of a similar type during the
Severance Period; period, however, that if any such alternative group health coverage excludes any pre-existing condition that you or your dependents may have when coverage under such
group health plan would otherwise begin, coverage under this Section&nbsp;3.5 shall continue (but not beyond the Severance Period) with respect to such pre-existing condition until such
exclusion under such other group health plan lapses or expires. You shall be obligated to notify the Company's Human Resources Department of any such alternative coverage within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days of its first becoming applicable to you or your dependents. In the event you are required to make an election under Sections 601 through 607 of ERISA (commonly known as COBRA) to
qualify for continuing health benefits coverage described in this Section&nbsp;3.5, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section&nbsp;3.5 to continue your health benefits
coverage shall be conditioned upon your timely making such an election. </FONT></P>

acceptance of your Severance Payment under this Plan, you shall be deemed to have acknowledged that the Confidential Material constitutes propriety information of the Company which draws independent
economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who could obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and that the Company has taken efforts

indirectly for any reason whatsoever, disclose or use any such Confidential Material that (i)&nbsp;has been publicly disclosed or was within your possession prior to its being furnished to you by
the Company or becomes available to you on a nonconfidential basis from a third party (in any of such cases, not due to a breach by you or your obligations to the Company or by breach of any other

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for equitable relief as provided in Section&nbsp;6.3, arbitration in accordance with the then most applicable rules of the American Arbitration

Section&nbsp;8.10. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant only such relief as would be available in a court of law. In the event of any conflict between this Plan and the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, the provisions of this Plan shall be determinative. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, they shall select a single arbitrator from a list designated by the
office of the American Arbitrator Association having responsibility for the city in which you primarily performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before your termination of
employment of seven arbitrators, all of whom shall be retired judges who are actively involved in hearing private cases or members of the National Academy of Arbitrators, and who, in either event, are
residents of the area in which you primarily performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before your termination of employment. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
arbitrator from such list, they shall each strike names alternatively from the list, with the first to strike being determined by lot. After each party has used three strikes, the remaining name on
the list shall be the arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall initially be responsible for the fees and expenses of its own representatives and witnesses. Unless mutually agreed
otherwise by the parties, any arbitration shall be conducted at a location within fifty (50)&nbsp;miles from the location in which you primarily performed services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before your termination of employment. If the parties cannot agree upon a location for the arbitration, the arbitrator shall determine the location within such fifty
(50)&nbsp;mile radius. Judgement may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding, as determined by the arbitrator,
and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled to the extent provided by law to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing party's costs (including but not
limited to the arbitrator's compensation), expenses and reasonable attorney's fees. </FONT></P>
