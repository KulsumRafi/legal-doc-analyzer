                           (i) The initial  allocations of the Commitment  among
         the Covered Subsidiaries on Schedule B-1 attached hereto in the amounts
         set forth  thereon.  The allocation of a portion of the Commitment to a
         Covered  Subsidiary  shall not affect the availability to the Borrowers
         of any unused and unallocated portion of the Commitment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           (ii) At any  time  and from  time to time  after  the
         Effective  Date,  BAX and  Brink's  may by  written  notice to the Bank
         request the  amendment of Schedule B-1 to modify the  allocation of the
         Commitment  among the Borrowers and Covered  Subsidiaries,  as Schedule
         B-1 may be amended or  supplemented by the Borrowers from time to time.
         Any such  request  shall  state the name and  address  of the  relevant
         Subsidiary and the country in which a credit extension is contemplated.
         The Bank,  after  consultation  with the relevant  branch or Affiliate,
         shall notify the requesting Borrower as soon as reasonably  practicable
         whether it accepts such re-allocation and shall advise the Borrowers in
         writing  of the  amount of such  re-allocation.  The Bank  shall not be
         obligated in any way to accept any requested amendment to Schedule B-1.
         The  determination by the Bank of the Dollar Equivalent with respect to
         any  credit  extensions  in a currency  other than US Dollars  shall be
         conclusive  and binding upon the  Borrowers;  the Bank may readjust the
         Dollar  Equivalent  periodically  as provided  in Section  2.04 (b) and
         Section  2.06(b)(provided  it agrees not to make any such  readjustment
         unless the Dollar Equivalent of Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and
         allocations exceeds the Commitment by 3% or more and the Bank agrees to
         give the Borrowers prompt written notice of any such readjustment). The
         Bank's relevant branch or Affiliate and the relevant Covered Subsidiary
         shall  be free to  structure  each  individual  credit  transaction  in
         accordance with all relevant law, local custom and practice,  including
         pricing  and  collateral,  provided  the  Guaranties  of  the  relevant
         Guarantors  shall apply to all such

         extensions of credit.  Any portions
         of  the  Commitment   allocated  as   hereinabove   provided  shall  be
         unavailable for use by any of the Borrowers and for further  allocation
         until  such  time as the Bank  notifies  the  Borrowers  of  reinstated
         availability. The Bank shall be entitled to demand cash collateral from
         the relevant Guarantor with respect to the principal of any obligations
         of any Covered Subsidiaries (but not with respect to interest, fees and
         the like with respect to any such  obligations)  incurred in respect to
         credit  extensions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  which  the  Bank
         reasonably determines may be outstanding beyond the Termination Date or
         outstanding  after any such Covered  Subsidiary  ceases to qualify as a
         Subsidiary (in the latter case, the providing of cash collateral  shall
         not be  required  until  30 days  after  the  Bank so  requests).  Cash
         collateral  shall be by means of a  deposit  of  immediately  available
         funds in an amount equal to the aggregate  principal amount of any such
         obligations  in a  non-interest  bearing  account  with the  Bank.  Any
         failure to provide  cash  collateral  in  accordance  with this Section
         2.01(b)(ii)  shall,  upon written  notice from the Bank, be an Event of
         Default hereunder.

         outstanding, second, to LIBOR Rate Loans having Interest Periods ending
         on the date of such  prepayment,  and  third,  to the  extent  that the
         amounts  referred to in clauses "first" and "second" are not sufficient
         to satisfy the entire prepayment requirement under this Section 2.06(b)
         or there are no such  Loans  outstanding  on the date  such  prepayment
         would be required,  then the remaining amount that would be required to
         be prepaid  under this  Section  2.06(b)  shall be  deposited in a cash
         collateral  account  maintained by the Bank, to be held as security for
         the Obligations hereunder pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be
         entered into in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to the Bank
         and the  Borrowers,  and to be applied to the  prepayment of LIBOR Rate
         Loans at the end of the respective Interest Periods therefor and to the
         payment of Reimbursement Obligations as the same become due.

         portion  of  such  Loans  so  prepaid  and  upon   payment   (including

         of  principal,  interest,  fees or any other amount owing  hereunder or
         after acceleration,  each Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as
         before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the
         principal  amount of all  Obligations  of such  Person that are due and
         unpaid,  at a rate per annum  determined  by adding 2% per annum to the
         interest rate then in effect for the applicable type of Loan and in the
         case of Obligations  other than Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the
         Base Rate plus 2%; provided, however, that, on and after the expiration
         of any Interest Period applicable to any LIBOR Rate Loan outstanding on
         the date of  occurrence of such Event of Default or  acceleration,  the
         principal  amount of such Loan shall,  during the  continuation of such
         Event of Default or after  acceleration,  bear  interest  at a rate per
         annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2%.

         obligations  of  the  Borrowers  hereunder  shall  be  subject  to  the
         limitation  that  payments of interest  shall not be required,  for any
         period for which  interest  is computed  hereunder,  to the extent (but
         only to the extent) that  contracting  for or receiving such payment by
         the relevant  Lending Office would be contrary to the provisions of any
         applicable  law  limiting  the highest  rate of  interest  which may be
         lawfully  contracted for,  charged or received by the relevant  Lending
         Office,  and in such event the Borrowers shall pay the relevant Lending
         Office interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law.

                           (ii) In addition to the letter of credit fees due the
                  Bank hereunder,  each Borrower shall pay to any Lending Office
                  issuing a Letter of Credit any standard amendment, negotiation

         applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

                  (a)  Letters  of Credit  denominated  in  Dollars or any other
         Approved  Currency may be issued under the Commitment for the following
         purposes: (i) "Financial Letters of Credit" may be issued to any Person
         other  than an  Affiliate  to secure  the  payment by any Person of its
         financial obligations, or to provide counter or "back-up" guarantees in
         support  of  bank  guarantees,   Letters  of  Credit  or  other  credit
         facilities  afforded  to a  Borrower,  or  to  support  local  currency
         borrowings outside the United States, and (ii) "Performance  Letters of
         Credit"  may be issued to secure the  performance  by any Person of its
         obligations,   or  to  guaranty  or   otherwise   secure  any  Person's

                  (b) The Letter of Credit Obligations set forth on Schedule B-2
         hereto are  outstanding  under the 1999  Revolving  Facility.  All such
         Letter of Credit Obligations shall be deemed outstanding hereunder upon
         the  Effective  Date.  With  respect  to  any  such  Letter  of  Credit
         Obligations  that are not  Letter of Credit  Obligations  of a Borrower
         hereunder, they shall, upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, become
         joint and several  obligations  of BAX or Brink's,  as the case may be,
         upon the terms and conditions  hereof and as particularly  set forth on
         Schedule  B-2. It is  understood  and agreed by the Bank and by Brink's
         and BAX, respectively, that Brink's shall only be jointly and severally
         liable with the entities set opposite its name on Schedule B-2 and that
         BAX shall only be jointly and  severally  liable with the  entities set
         opposite  its name on Schedule  B-2;  Brink's  shall not be jointly and
         severally  liable with any entity set opposite BAX's name and BAX shall
         not be jointly  and  severally  liable  with any  entity  set  opposite
         Brink's  name;  nor shall BAX be  jointly  and  severally  liable  with
         Brink's.

                  (a)  Performance  Letters of Credit issued after the Effective
         Date shall not have a term exceeding one year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (b) No Letter of Credit  may expire  (including  all rights of
         renewal) later than the Termination Date, provided,  however,  that the
         Bank in its  discretion  may elect to,  issue  Letters  of Credit  that
         expire after the Termination Date, upon terms and conditions acceptable
         to the Bank, including without limitation,  cash collateral provisions,
         it being understood and agreed that this Agreement shall remain in full
         force and effect with  respect to all such Letters of Credit until they
         have  expired and all related  Letter of Credit  Obligations  have been
         paid in full.  Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  the
         applicable  Borrower will cash collateralize each Letter of Credit that
         remains  outstanding and undrawn as of the Termination  Date by deposit
         of immediately available funds in an amount equal to the undrawn amount
         of such Letter of Credit in a  non-interest-bearing  account maintained
         with the Bank;  provided,  however,  that  subject  to the  proviso  in
         Section 8.02,  the  obligation to so cash  collateralize  any Letter of
         Credit having a stated expiry date occurring after the Termination Date
         shall arise only upon the Bank's request to the applicable Borrower. If
         any Letter of Credit that is to be cash  collateralized  is denominated
         in an Approved  Currency  other than  Dollars,  the amount so deposited
         shall,  if  requested  by the Bank,  be the  Dollar  Equivalent  of the
         undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit as of the Termination Date. The
         Bank may, at any time and from time to time after the  initial  deposit
         of cash collateral, require that additional cash collateral be provided
         in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations.

         request for an amendment to a  previously-issued  Letter of Credit made
         by fax shall be in the form of the relevant L/C  Application  signed by
         the  relevant  Borrower  and,  unless  otherwise  agreed by the Lending
         Office  which  issued  the  Letter  of Credit  in  accordance  with the
         provisions of Section  3.02(b),  shall not request an extension  beyond

         the  contrary,  in the event of any  conflict  between the terms of any
         such L/C Application and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this
         Agreement shall control with respect to payment obligations,  events of
         default,  representations  and warranties,  and covenants,  except that
         such L/C  Application  may  provide  for  further  warranties  relating

                    TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         4.01  Taxes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (a) Payments made hereunder and under any instrument  executed
         hereunder  shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction for,
         any  and  all  present  or  future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,   duties,
         deductions, withholding and similar charges ("Taxes") excluding, in the
         case  of the  Bank,  each  Lending  Office  and  each  Assignee,  Taxes
         (including franchise or receipts taxes) imposed on or in respect of its
         net income, capital, or receipts, by the jurisdiction (or any political
         subdivision  thereof)  under the laws of which the Bank or such Lending
         Office or Assignee (as the case may be) (A) is  organized,  (B) has its
         principal  place of  business,  or (C) is,  through  an office or other
         fixed place of business,  deemed to be doing  business or maintaining a
         permanent  establishment  under any applicable  income tax treaty (such
         non-excluded Taxes being "Withholding Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be
         required by law to deduct any  Withholding  Taxes from or in respect of
         any sum payable hereunder or under any instrument  executed  hereunder,
         such Borrower:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (i) shall pay to the Bank,  Lending Office or Assignee an additional amount
so that the net amount  received  and  retained by the Bank,  Lending  Office or
Assignee  after taking into account such  Withholding  Taxes (and any additional
Withholding  Taxes payable on account of any  additional  payment  called for by
this  sentence)  will equal the full amount  which would have been  received and
retained by the Bank, Lending Office or Assignee as if no such Withholding Taxes
been paid, deducted, or withheld;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (ii) shall make such deductions; and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (iii) shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant  taxing  authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (b) Each  Borrower  will furnish the Bank,  Lending  Office or
         Assignee  original  Withholding  Tax  receipts,   notarized  copies  of
         Withholding  Tax receipts or such other  appropriate  documentation  as
         will prove payment of tax in a court of law applying U.S. Federal Rules
         of  Evidence  for all Taxes paid by such  Borrower  pursuant to Section
         4.01(a).  The relevant  Borrower  will deliver such  receipts  within a
         reasonable  period after payment of any  Withholding  Taxes,  but in no
         event later than 60 days after the due date for the related Withholding
         Tax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (c) If the Bank,  Lending  Office or Assignee is entitled to a
         refund or credit of Withholding Tax, it shall use reasonable efforts to
         pursue such refund  (and  interest  with  respect  thereto),  and if it
         receives such refund or credit,  shall pay to the relevant Borrower the
         amount of the refund or credit  (and  interest  with  respect  thereto)
         actually received.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (d) The Bank,  Lending Office or Assignee shall use reasonable
         efforts   (consistent  with  its  internal  policies,   and  legal  and
         regulatory  restrictions)  to change the  jurisdiction  of its relevant
         Lending  Office if such change  would  avoid or reduce any  Withholding
         Tax; provided that no such change of jurisdiction  shall be made if, in
         the  reasonable  judgment  of the  Bank,  such  Lending  Office or such
         Assignee,  such  change  would be  disadvantageous  to the  Bank,  such
         Lending Office or such Assignee, as the case may be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (e) The Bank  agrees  that it will  deliver to the  Borrowers,
         within  30  days  after  the  execution  of  this   Agreement   (unless
         theretofore so delivered)  and as may be reasonably  required from time
         to time by applicable law or regulation, United States Internal Revenue
         Service Forms W-8BEN  and/or W-8EC1 (or successor  Forms) or such other
         form,  if  any,  as from  time to time  may  permit  the  Borrowers  to
         demonstrate  that payments made by the Borrowers to the Bank under this
         Agreement  either are exempt from  United  States  Federal  Withholding
         Taxes or are  payable  at a  reduced  rate (if  any)  specified  in any
         applicable tax treaty or convention.

     (a) If the Bank shall determine that the introduction of any Requirement of
Law,  or any  change  in any  Requirement  of  Law or in the  interpretation  or
administration  thereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other
Governmental  Authority  has asserted  that it is unlawful,  for the Bank or any
other  relevant  Lending  Office to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to issue Letters of
Credit, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Borrowers,  the obligation of
the Bank to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to issue Letters of Credit, as the case may
be, shall be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Borrowers that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (b) If the Bank shall  determine  that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBOR
Rate Loan, the affected Borrowers shall prepay in full all LIBOR Rate Loans then
outstanding,  together with interest accrued thereon,  either on the last day of
the Interest  Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully  continue to maintain such
LIBOR  Rate  Loans to such day,  or  immediately,  if the Bank may not  lawfully
continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans,  together with any amounts  required
to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section 4.04.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (c) The Bank shall immediately  notify the Borrowers of any event described
in (a) or (b) above.

Additional Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (a) If the Bank shall  determine  that,  due to either (i) the
         introduction   of  any  Requirement  of  Law,  or  any  change  in  any
         Requirement of Law or in the  interpretation or administration  thereof
         or (ii) the  compliance  with any guideline or request from any central
         bank or other  Governmental  Authority (whether or not having the force
         of law),  there  shall be any  increase  in the cost to the Bank or any
         Lending  Office of agreeing to make or making,  funding or  maintaining
         any LIBOR Rate Loans, then the relevant  Borrowers shall be liable for,
         and shall from time to time, upon written request therefor by the Bank,
         pay to the Bank additional  amounts as are sufficient to compensate the
         Bank or such Lending Office for such increased costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (b)  If  the  Bank   shall  have   determined   that  (i)  the
         introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any
         Capital Adequacy Regulation,  (iii) any change in the interpretation or
         administration  of any Capital Adequacy  Regulation by any central bank
         or other  Governmental  Authority  charged with the  interpretation  or
         administration  thereof,  or (iv)  compliance  by the  Bank  (or  other
         relevant Lending Office) or any corporation  controlling the Bank, with
         any Capital Adequacy  Regulation  affects or would affect the amount of
         capital  required or expected to be maintained by the Bank, any Lending
         Office  or any  corporation  controlling  the  Bank  and  (taking  into
         consideration  the Bank's and such controlling  corporation's  policies
         with  respect to capital  adequacy  and the  Bank's  desired  return on
         capital) and determines that the amount of such capital is increased as
         a consequence  of Advances  under this  Agreement,  then,  upon written
         request of the Bank, the Borrowers shall immediately pay to the Bank or
         the  relevant  Lending  Office,  from time to time as  specified by the
         Bank,  additional  amounts  sufficient to  compensate  the Bank or such
         Lending Office for such increase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (c) Each  Borrower  shall pay to the Bank, as long as the Bank
         shall be required under Federal  Reserve Board  regulations to maintain
         reserves  with  respect  to  liabilities  or  assets  consisting  of or
         including   Eurocurrency   funds  or  deposits   (currently   known  as
         "Eurocurrency  liabilities"),  additional costs on the unpaid principal
         amount of all LIBOR Rate Loans made by the Bank to such Borrower  equal
         to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to each such Loan by the
         Bank (as  determined  by the Bank in good  faith,  which  determination
         shall be conclusive  absent manifest  error),  payable on each Interest
         Payment  Date  with  respect  to each  such  Loan,  provided  that such
         Borrower  shall have received at least 15 days' prior written notice of
         such  additional  costs from the Bank. If the Bank fails to give notice
         15 days prior to the relevant  Interest  Payment Date,  such additional
         interest  shall  accrue  and be  payable  15 days from  receipt of such
         notice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  (d) The Bank will notify each Borrower of any event  occurring
         after the date hereof which will entitle the Bank or any Lending Office
         to  compensation  from such  Borrower  pursuant to this Section 4.03 as
         promptly  as  practicable   after  it  obtains  knowledge  thereof  and
         determines to request such compensation, and will designate a different
         Lending Office if such  designation  will avoid the need for, or reduce
         the amount of, such  compensation.  If the Bank  requests  compensation
         under this Section 4.03,  the relevant  Borrowers may, by notice to the
         Bank,  require that:  (x) the Bank furnish to the relevant  Borrowers a
         statement  setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and
         the method for  determining  the amount thereof or (y) the Loans of the
         type with  respect to which such  compensation  is  requested be either
         prepaid or converted into another type.

relevant  Lending  Office  harmless  from any loss or expense which the Bank may
sustain or incur as a consequence of:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (a) the  failure by such  Borrower  to make any  payment or  prepayment  of
principal  of any LIBOR Rate Loan when due  (including  payments  made after any
acceleration thereof);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (b) the  failure by such  Borrower  to borrow,  continue  or convert a Loan
after such Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a notice of borrowing
or a notice of conversion or continuation;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (c) the failure by such Borrower to make any prepayment after such Borrower
has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.05;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (d) the  prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day
of the Interest Period with respect thereto; or

     (e) the  conversion  pursuant  to Section  2.03 of any LIBOR Rate Loan to a
Base Rate  Loan on a day that is not the last day of the  Interest  Period  with
respect to the LIBOR Rate Loan;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of funds  obtained  by any  Lending  Office to  maintain  its LIBOR  Rate  Loans

were obtained.

have determined  that for any reason adequate and reasonable  means do not exist
for ascertaining  the LIBOR Rate for any requested  Interest Period with respect
to a LIBOR Rate Loan or that the LIBOR Rate for any  requested  Interest  Period
with respect thereto does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Bank
or any relevant  Lending  Office of funding such Loan,  the Bank will  forthwith
give notice of such  determination to the relevant  Borrowers.  Thereafter,  the
obligation of the Bank or any relevant  Lending Office to make or continue LIBOR
Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans  hereunder,  as the
case may be, shall be  suspended  until the Bank revokes such notice in writing.
Upon  receipt of such  notice,  the  relevant  Borrower may revoke any notice of
borrowing or notice of conversion or  continuation  then submitted by it. If the
relevant Borrower does not revoke such notice with respect to a LIBOR Rate Loan,
the Bank shall make, convert or continue the Loan, as proposed by such Borrower,
in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by such Borrower, but
such Loan shall be made, converted or continued as a Base Rate Loan instead of a
LIBOR Rate Loan.

otherwise  disclosed in writing to the Bank,  including  through the delivery to
the  Bank of  copies  of  reports  and  statements  filed by  Pittston  with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission,  there are no material  actions,  suits, or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,  threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or the properties of the Borrower before any Governmental
Authority  or  arbitrator,  and the  Borrower  is not in default (in any respect
which might have a material  adverse  effect on the  ability of the  Borrower to
perform  its  obligations  under the Loan  Documents  to which it is party) with
respect to any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award presently in effect and applicable to the Borrower.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         6.09  Taxes6.09  Taxes.09  Taxes.09  Taxes.  The Borrower has filed all
material tax returns  (federal,  state, and local) required to be filed and paid
all taxes shown thereon to be due, including interest and penalties, or provided
adequate reserves, in accordance with GAAP, for the payment thereof.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         6.10 ERISA6.10 ERISA.10 ERISA.10 ERISA. Each Plan has complied with and
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code.  No Plan has  terminated  under  circumstances
giving rise to  liability  of the  Borrower of any ERISA  Affiliate  to the PBGC
under Section 4062,  4063 or 4064 of ERISA,  which  liability  remains unpaid in
whole or in part, and no lien under Section 4068 of ERISA exists with respect to
the assets of the Borrower. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any
Plan, except for Reportable  Events previously  disclosed in writing to the Bank
that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of Section  302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code  (whether
or not waived)  exists with respect to any Plan, nor does any lien under Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code exist with respect to any Plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  ERISA  Affiliate  has  completely  or
partially withdrawn from any one or more Multiemployer Plans under circumstances
which would give rise to withdrawal  liability  which,  in the aggregate,  could
have a Material  Adverse Effect and which has not been fully paid as of the date
hereof.  Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA  Affiliate has received  notice that
any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization  (within the meaning of Section 4241
of ERISA),  is insolvent  (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA),  or has
terminated under Title IV of ERISA,  nor, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
is any such  reorganization,  insolvency  or  termination  reasonably  likely to
occur, where such reorganization,  insolvency or termination has resulted or can
reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the contributions required to
be made to such  Multiemployer  Plan in an amount  that  would  have a  Material
Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make
any  contribution  to a  Multiemployer  Plan which is required under ERISA or an
applicable collective bargaining agreement in an amount which is material in the
aggregate  (except to the extent there is a good faith dispute as to whether any
contribution  is owed, the amount owed or the existence of facts that would give
rise to a withdrawal).

         6.11 No  Default

     (b) No part of the proceeds of any Advances will be used,  whether directly

purpose  which  entails a  violation  of,  or which is  inconsistent  with,  the
provisions  of  the  Regulations  promulgated  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,
including, without limitation, Regulations G, U or X.

Matters.14  Environmental  Matters.  In the  ordinary  course  of its  business,
Pittston conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws and laws
relating  to  occupational  safety and health on the  business,  operations  and
properties  of  Pittston  and  its  Subsidiaries,  in the  course  of  which  it
identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including any capital
or operating  expenditures  required for  clean-up,  closure or  restoration  of
properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating  expenditures
required to achieve or maintain  compliance  with  environmental  protection and
occupational health and safety standards imposed by law or as a condition of any
license,  permit or contact,  any related  constraints on operating  activities,
including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the
level of or change in the nature of operations  conducted thereat and any actual
or potential liabilities to third parties,  including employees, and any related
costs and expenses).  On the basis of this review,  each Borrower represents and
warrants that  applicable  Environmental  Laws and laws relating to occupational
health  and  safety  do not have a  material  adverse  effect  on its  business,
financial condition or results of operations,  and it has obtained and holds all
material permits, licenses and approvals required under Environmental Laws which
are  necessary  for  the  conduct  of its  business  and  the  operation  of its
facilities,  and it has not received any written  notice of any failure to be in
compliance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such  permits,  licenses  and
approvals, which failure could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on it.

                  (b) The obligations in this Section 9.05 shall survive payment
         of all other Obligations. At the election of the Borrowers, one or more

         "first  currency") in which the same is payable hereunder or thereunder
         or under such order or judgment  into  another  currency  (the  "second
         currency")  for the  purpose  of (i)  making or filing a claim or proof
         against such Borrower with any  Governmental  Authority or in any court
         or tribunal or (ii)  enforcing  any order or judgment  given or made in
         relation  hereto,  such Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each
         of the  Persons  to whom  such  sum is due from  and  against  any loss
         actually  suffered as a result of any discrepancy  between (a) the rate
         of  exchange  used to  convert  the amount in  question  from the first
         currency into the second currency and (b) the rate or rates of exchange
         at which such Person, acting in good faith in a commercially reasonable
         manner,  purchased the first  currency with the second  currency  after
         receipt of a sum paid to it in the second currency in satisfaction,  in
         whole or in part,  of any such  order,  judgment,  claim or proof.  The
         foregoing  indemnity  shall  constitute a separate  obligation  of each
         Borrower  distinct  from its  other  obligations  hereunder  and  shall
         survive  the giving or making of any  judgment  or order in relation to
         all or any of such other obligations.
