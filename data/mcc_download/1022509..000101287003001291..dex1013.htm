STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><U>Salary and Bonus</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your starting salary will be $7,708.33 per semi-monthly pay period, which is equivalent to $185,000.00 on
an annualized basis. You will also be eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to $55,500.00, based on mutually agreed objectives and company performance metrics we will establish after your start date. All salary and bonus payments are
subject to normal withholdings. Tumbleweed will also reimburse you for up to $2,500.00 of attorneys fees you incur personally in connection with legal advice concerning this employment offer. </FONT></P><P

package, you will be granted stock options to purchase 200,000 shares of Tumbleweed common stock. The stock options are subject to a vesting schedule, whereby 25% of the options vest upon completion of one year of employment at Tumbleweed, and the
remaining options vest monthly thereafter over a three-year period, for a total vesting period of four years. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><U>Termination</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Tumbleweed unilaterally terminates your employment for any reason other than Cause, or in the case of a Constructive Termination, (i) Tumbleweed will pay
you as severance payment an amount equal to six months of your base salary, paid in a lump sum within 30 days of such termination, and (ii) Tumbleweed will reimburse you for any out-of-pocket COBRA costs you incur during the first six months after
such termination. In the event of termination for Cause, or if you voluntarily resign, you will not be entitled to such severance payment, or any additional payments, salary, bonus, stock option vesting, or benefits. </FONT></P><P

Ownership Control occurs, followed by your involuntary termination (except for Cause) or Constructive Termination within six months of the Change of Ownership Control, upon such termination, (i) the vesting of one year&#146;s worth of your
outstanding stock options immediately will be accelerated and (ii) you will be entitled to receive as severance the payment of an amount equal to one year of your base salary, paid in a lump sum within 30 days of such termination. For avoidance of
doubt, under no circumstances will you be entitled to receive the lump sum payment described in the preceding sentence in addition to the lump sum payment described in the paragraph above titled &#147;Termination&#148;; either one lump sum payment
provision will apply or the other but not both. &#147;Change of Ownership Control&#148; means any sale of all or substantially all of Tumbleweed&#146;s assets, or any merger, consolidation, or stock sales that results in the holders of
Tumbleweed&#146;s capital stock immediately prior to such transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power of Tumbleweed&#146;s capital stock immediately after such transaction. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
