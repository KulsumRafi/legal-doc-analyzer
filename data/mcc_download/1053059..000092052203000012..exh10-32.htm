into as of the 27th day of March 2003, by and between George M. Marcus

in the Termination Agreement (as defined below)) and Essex Property Trust, Inc.,

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;WHEREAS, Marcus and his Affiliated Companies and Essex and its Affiliated
Companies previously entered into that certain Termination of Non-Compete
Agreement dated as of February 16, 1999 (the &quot;Termination Agreement&quot;),
whereunder Marcus made certain agreements contained in Paragraph 3 therein
regarding Essex's ability to assume certain contracts or agreements for certain
residential rental properties that are entered into by Marcus and/or his
Affiliated Companies; and</P>

<P>&#9;WHEREAS, Essex's review of such contracts and agreements unnecessarily
takes up management time from Essex's executives, as Essex, for various good
business reasons, has never assumed any such contract or agreement; and</P>

<P>&#9;WHEREAS, Marcus is not involved in the day-to-day operations of Essex
making it unlikely that he could use information obtained in his capacity as
Chairman of the Board of Essex for his own or his Affiliated Companies use;
and</P>

<P>&#9;WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in this
Agreement, the parties wish to terminate the provisions of Paragraph 3 of the
Termination Agreement.</P>

to divulge any information regarding property acquisition and/or development

regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a multifamily property
where it appears that there may be an actual conflict of interest with any of
