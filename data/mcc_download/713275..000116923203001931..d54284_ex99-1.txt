Robert Cook
Vice President of Finance/Chief Financial Officer
Pharmos Corporation
99 Wood Avenue South, Suite 301
Iselin, NJ 08830

Dear Mr. Cook:

The purpose of this letter agreement (the "Agreement") is to set forth the terms
and conditions pursuant to which Rodman & Renshaw, Inc. ("R&R") shall serve as
exclusive placement agent in connection with the proposed public offering (the
"Offering") of common stock and/or warrants to purchase common stock (the
"Securities") of Pharmos Corporation (the "Company") pursuant to the Company's
existing effective shelf registration statement, file no. 333-82046 (the
"Registration Statement"). The terms of such Offering and the Securities shall
be as agreed to between the Company and the purchasers thereof from time to
time; provided, that the aggregate public offering price of the Offering shall
not exceed $25,000,000.

      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

      1. Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
hereinafter set forth, the Company hereby retains R&R, and R&R hereby agrees to
act as the Company's exclusive placement agent in connection with the Offering,
effective as of the date this Agreement has been approved by the Corporate
Financing Department of NASD Regulation, Inc. and for a period of two weeks
thereafter, and shall thereafter be non-exclusive. The Company expressly
acknowledges and agrees that R&R's obligations hereunder are on a reasonable
best efforts basis only and that the execution of this Agreement does not
constitute a commitment by R&R to purchase the Securities and does not ensure
the successful placement of the Securities or any portion thereof or the success
of R&R with respect to securing any other financing on behalf of the Company.
R&R shall not commence any selling efforts until the terms of this Agreement has
been approved by the Corporate Financing Department of NASD Regulation, Inc.

      2. Fees and Compensation. In consideration of the services rendered by R&R
in connection with the Offering, the Company agrees to pay R&R the following
fees and other

<PAGE>

compensation:

      (a) a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 2.00% of the gross
      offering proceeds to the Company with an overall limit of $10,000, of
      which such sum an advance of $10,000 shall be paid to R&R upon execution
      hereof. This advance will be returned to the Company to the extent not
      actually earned through placements of Securities or otherwise actually
      incurred on an accountable basis for legal fees and expenses, travel with
      respect to the Offering, production expenses for road show materials, and
      other receipted out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Offering;
      and

      (b) a cash fee payable upon each closing of the sale of securities to
      investors procured by R&R equal to 5% of the gross offering proceeds to
      Company at each such closing.

      (c) A number of Warrants equal to 5% of the number of shares of common
      stock actually sold to the public through R&R. Such Warrants shall have an
      exercise price equal to 120% of the then current market price at the time
      of the offering, and shall otherwise be in the form of Exhibit D hereto.

      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid to R&R out of an attorney escrow
      account at the closing or by such other means acceptable to R&R.

      3. Terms of Retention. (a) Unless extended or terminated in writing by the
parties hereto in accordance with the provisions hereof, this Agreement shall
remain in effect until the Termination Date of August 1, 2003 unless earlier
terminated by either party hereto by 30 days' prior written notice to the other
party.

      (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligation to pay
the Fees and Compensation and Expenses described in Section 2 actually earned by
R&R for closings that occurred prior to expiration or termination of this
Agreement, if any, and the provisions of paragraphs 2, 5, and 8 of Exhibit A and
all of Exhibit B and Exhibit C attached hereto, each of which exhibits is
incorporated herein by reference, shall survive any termination or expiration of
the Agreement.

      4. Not used.

      5. Information. The Company recognizes and confirms that in completing its
engagement hereunder, R&R will be using and relying solely on publicly available
information and on data, material and other information furnished to R&R by the
Company or the Company's affiliates and agents. It is understood and agreed that
in performing under this engagement, R&R will rely upon the accuracy and
completeness of, and is not assuming any responsibility for independent
verification of, such publicly available information and the other information
so furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that R&R will
conduct a due diligence investigation of the Company and the Company will
cooperate in all respects with such investigation as a condition of R&R's
obligations hereunder.

      6. Registration. The Company represents and warrants to R&R that (i) the

<PAGE>

Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, and the Company
has no knowledge of any action or contemplated action by the SEC or any other
regulatory authority with jurisdiction to issue any stop order or otherwise
suspend the effectiveness of such Registration Statement; (ii) the Registration
Statement (including any documents incorporated therein by reference) does not
contain any misstatement of any material fact concerning the Company or omit to
state any material fact which, in light of the circumstances under which it was
made, would cause any of the statements of fact contained therein to be
misleading; (iii) the Registration Statement complies as to form and substance
in all material respects with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. From time
to time in connection with any particular sale of Securities, the Company will,
at its own expense, amend or supplement the Registration Statement in order that
the foregoing representation remain complete and accurate; and obtain any
registration or qualification required to sell any Securities under the Blue Sky
laws of any applicable jurisdictions, as reasonably requested by R&R, and shall
pay any filing fees required by NASD Regulation, Inc. in connection with their
review of the terms of this Agreement, if so required.

      7. No General Solicitation. The Securities will be offered only by
approaching prospective purchasers on an individual basis. No general
solicitation or general advertising in any form will be used in connection with
the offering of the Securities. From and after the execution of this Agreement
until the completion of the Offering, the Company shall pre-clear any proposed
press release which mentions this Agreement or the Offering with R&R.

      8. Closing. The closing of the sale of the Securities shall be subject to
customary closing conditions, including the provision by the Company to R&R of
officers' certificates and opinions of counsel.

      9. Miscellaneous. This Agreement together with the attached Exhibits A
through D constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
with respect to its subject matter and there are no agreements or understandings
with respect to the subject matter hereof which are not contained in this
Agreement. This Agreement may be modified only in writing signed by the party to
be charged hereunder.

      If the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement, please confirm this
by signing and returning to us the duplicate copy of this letter.

      We appreciate this opportunity to be of service and are looking forward to
working with you on this matter.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        RODMAN & RENSHAW, INC.

                                                               EXHIBIT A

                          STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      1. The Company shall promptly provide R&R with all relevant information
about the Company (to the extent available to the Company in the case of parties
other than the Company) that shall be reasonably requested or required by R&R,
which information shall be complete and accurate in all material respects at the
time furnished.

      2. R&R shall keep all information obtained from the Company strictly
confidential except: (a) information which is otherwise publicly available, or
previously known to, or obtained by R&R independently of the Company and without
breach of R&R's agreement with the Company; (b) R&R may disclose such
information to its employees and attorneys, and to its other advisors and
financial sources on a need to know basis only and shall use best efforts to
ensure that all such employees, attorneys, advisors and financial sources will
keep such information strictly confidential; and (c) pursuant to any order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body (including any
subpena) or as may otherwise be required by law.

      3. The Company recognizes that in order for R&R to perform properly its
obligations in a professional manner, it is necessary that R&R be informed of
and, to the extent practicable, participate in meetings and discussions between
the Company and any prospective purchaser of the securities, relating to the
matters covered by the terms of R&R's engagement.

      4. The Company agrees that any report or opinion, oral or written,
delivered to it by R&R is prepared solely for its confidential use and shall not
be reproduced, summarized, or referred to in any public document or given or
otherwise divulged to any other person without R&R's prior written consent,
except as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

      5. No fee payable to R&R pursuant to any other agreement with the Company
or payable by the Company to any agent, lender or investor shall reduce or
otherwise affect any fee payable by the Company to R&R hereunder. If R&R engages
any other broker-dealer or other finder to assist R&R in the placement of the
Offering, then the fees of such other broker-dealer or finder shall be paid by
R&R.

      6. The Company represents and warrants that: (a) it has full right, power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of its obligations
hereunder; (b) this Agreement has been duly authorized and executed by and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in
accordance with its terms; and (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not conflict
with or result in a breach of (i) the Company's certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or (ii) any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which any of
its property or assets is bound.

      7. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to place R&R and
the Company in the relationship of partners or joint venturers. Neither R&R nor
the Company shall

<PAGE>

represent itself as the agent or legal representative of the other for any
purpose whatsoever nor shall either have the power to obligate or bind the other
in any manner whatsoever. R&R, in performing its services hereunder, shall at
all times be an independent contractor.

      8. This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of R&R and
the Company and each of the persons, agents, employees, officers, directors and
controlling persons referred to in Exhibit B and their respective heirs,
executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and nothing
contained in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon, nor shall this
Agreement be construed to create any rights in, any person who is not party to
such Agreement, other than as set forth in this paragraph.

      9. The rights and obligations of either party under this Agreement may not
be assigned without the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any
other purported assignment shall be null and void.

      10. All communications hereunder, except as may be otherwise specifically
provided herein, shall be in writing and shall be mailed, hand delivered, or

                                                               EXHIBIT B

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      The Company agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless, R&R, its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and controlling
persons within the meaning of Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, each as amended (any and all of
whom are referred to as an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses, and all actions in respect
thereof (including, but not limited to, all legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with the investigation,
preparation, defense or settlement of any claim, action or proceeding, whether
or not resulting in any liability), incurred by an Indemnified Party: (a)
arising out of, or in connection with, any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by the Company, its affiliates, employees or agents, or any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the financial or
other information contained in the Registration Statement and/or final
prospectus furnished to R&R by or on behalf of the Company or the omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; or (b) with respect to, caused by, or otherwise
arising out of any transaction contemplated by the Agreement or R&R's performing
the services contemplated hereunder; provided, however, the Company will not be
liable under clause (b) hereof to the extent, and only to the extent, that any
loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is finally judicially determined to
have resulted primarily from R&R's gross negligence or bad faith in performing
such services.

      If the indemnification provided for herein is conclusively determined (by
an entry of final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of the time or denial of the right to appeal) to be unavailable or
insufficient to hold any Indemnified Party harmless in respect to any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the Company
shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in
such proportion as is appropriate and equitable under all circumstances taking
into account the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and
R&R on the other, from the transaction or proposed transaction under the
Agreement or, if allocation on that basis is not permitted under applicable law,
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and R&R on the other, but also the
relative fault of the Company and R&R; provided, however, in no event shall the
aggregate contribution of R&R and/or any Indemnified Party be in excess of the
net compensation actually received by R&R and/or such Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Agreement.

      The Company shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action,
claim, suit or proceeding in which any Indemnified Party is or could be a party
and as to which indemnification or contribution could have been sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder (whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party
thereto), unless such consent or termination includes an express unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to such Indemnified Party, from all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses arising out of

<PAGE>

such action, claim, suit or proceeding.

      In the event any Indemnified Party shall incur any expenses covered by
this Exhibit B, the Company shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for such
covered expenses within ten (10) business days of the Indemnified Party's
delivery to the Company of an invoice therefor, with receipts attached. Such
obligation of the Company to so advance funds may be conditioned upon the
Company's receipt of a written undertaking from the Indemnified Party to repay
such amounts within ten (10) business days after a final, non-appealable
judicial determination that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

      The foregoing indemnification and contribution provisions are not in lieu
of, but in addition to, any rights which any Indemnified Party may have at
common law hereunder or otherwise, and shall remain in full force and effect
following the expiration or termination of R&R's engagement and shall be binding
on any successors or assigns of the Company and successors or assigns to all or
substantially all of the Company's business or assets.

<PAGE>

                                                               EXHIBIT C

                                  JURISDICTION

      The Company and R&R each hereby irrevocably: (a) submits to the
jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York or any federal court sitting
in the State of New York for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of the Agreement between the Company and R&R which is
brought by or against the Company or R&R; (b) agrees that all claims in respect
of any suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court;
and (c) to the extent that the Company or R&R has acquired, or hereafter may
acquire, any immunity from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process therein, the Company and R&R each hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, such immunity. The prevailing party in any litigation
respecting this Agreement shall be entitled to an award of its costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, in connection therewith.

      The Company and R&R each waives, and agrees not to assert in any such
suit, action or proceeding, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any claim that: (a) it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of any such court; (b) it is immune from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in the aid
of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to it or its property; (c)
any such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum; (d) the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding is improper; or (e) this Agreement
may not be enforced in or by any such court.

      Any process against the Company or R&R in, or in connection with, any
suit, action or proceeding filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or any other court of the State of New York,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction or agreement
contemplated hereby, may be served personally, or by first class mail or
overnight courier (with the same effect as though served personally) addressed
to the party being served at the address set forth in the Agreement between the
Company and R&R.

      Nothing in these provisions shall affect any party's right to serve
process in any manner permitted by law or limit its rights to bring a proceeding
in the competent courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions or to enforce in
any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other
jurisdiction.

      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles.

            THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON
      EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
                SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 4 AND 10 OF THIS WARRANT.

Warrant No. 1                                          Number of Shares: _______
(subject to adjustment)
Date of Issuance: ______________, 2003

                               PHARMOS CORPORATION
                          Common Stock Purchase Warrant
                             (Void after five years)

Pharmos Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), for value received,
hereby certifies that Rodman & Renshaw, Inc., or its registered assigns (the
"Registered Holder"), is entitled, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below, to purchase from the Company, at any time or from time to time commencing
one year after the date of issuance and on or before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time)
on________, 200_, _____________________ shares of Common Stock, of the Company,
at a purchase price of $__________ per share. The shares purchasable upon
exercise of this Warrant, and the purchase price per share, each as adjusted
from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Warrant, are hereinafter
referred to as the "Warrant Shares" and the "Purchase Price," respectively.

1. Exercise.

      (a) This Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder, in whole or in
part, by surrendering this Warrant, with the purchase form appended hereto as
Exhibit I duly executed by the Registered Holder or by the Registered Holder's
duly authorized attorney, at the principal office of the Company, or at such
other office or agency as the Company may designate, accompanied by payment in
full, in lawful money of the United States, of the Purchase Price payable in
respect of the number of Warrant Shares purchased upon such exercise.

      (b) The Registered Holder may, at its option, elect to pay some or all of
the Purchase Price payable upon an exercise of this Warrant by canceling all or
a portion of this Warrant. If the Registered Holder wishes to exercise this
Warrant by this method, the number of Warrant Shares purchaseable (which shall
in no event exceed the total number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this
Warrant as set forth above), subject to adjustment under Section 2 of this
Warrant) shall be determined as follows:

      X=Y[(A-B)/A]; where

X= the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder.

Y= the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being
   exercised.

<PAGE>

A= the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock.

B= the Purchase Price of one share of Common Stock.

The Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock shall be determined as follows:

      (i) If the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the
      Nasdaq National Market or another nationally recognized trading system
      (including, without limitation, the OTC Bulletin Board or any successor
      and, if the average daily trading volume for the preceding 10 days has
      been at least 100,000 shares, the Pink Sheets) as of the Exercise Date,
      the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the
      average of the high and low reported sale prices per share of Common Stock
      thereon on the three trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date
      (provided that if no such price is reported on such day, the Fair Market
      Value per share of Common Stock shall be determined pursuant to clause
      (ii)).

      (ii) If the Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange,
      the Nasdaq National Market or another nationally recognized trading system
      as of the Exercise Date, the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock
      shall be deemed to be the amount most recently determined by the Board of
      Directors to represent the fair market value per share of the Common Stock
      (including without limitation a determination for purposes of granting
      Common Stock options or issuing Common Stock under an employee benefit
      plan of the Company); and, upon request of the Registered Holder, the
      Board of Directors (or a representative thereof) shall promptly notify the
      Registered Holder of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors has not made such
      a determination within the three-month period prior to the Exercise Date,
      then (A) the Board of Directors shall make a determination of the Fair
      Market Value per share of the Common Stock within 15 days of a request by
      the Registered Holder that it do so, and (B) the exercise of this Warrant
      pursuant to this subsection 1(b) shall be delayed until such determination
      is made.

      (c) Each exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been effected
immediately prior to the close of business on the day on which this Warrant
shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in subsection 1(a) above
accompanied by payment in full of the Purchase Price (the "Exercise Date"). At
such time, the person or persons in whose name or names any certificates for
Warrant Shares shall be issuable upon such exercise as provided in subsection
1(d) below shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the
Warrant Shares represented by such certificates.

      (d) As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or
in part, and in any event within 5 business days thereafter, the Company, at its
expense, will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the
Registered Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any
applicable transfer taxes) may direct:

      (i) a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares to
      which the Registered Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise plus, in
      lieu of any fractional share

<PAGE>

      to which the Registered Holder would otherwise be entitled, cash in an
      amount determined pursuant to Section 3 hereof; and

      (ii) in case such exercise is in part only, a new warrant or warrants
      (dated the date hereof) of like tenor, calling in the aggregate on the
      face or faces thereof for the number of remaining Warrant Shares.

2. Adjustments.

      (a) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shall at
any time or from time to time after the date on which this Warrant was first
issued (the "Original Issue Date") effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Company shall at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this
paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

      (b) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Company at any time, or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Purchase
Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed,
as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Purchase
Price then in effect by a fraction:

      (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
      Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
      issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

      (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
      Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
      issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of
      shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
      distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend
is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Purchase Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions.

      (c) Adjustment in Number of Warrant Shares. When any adjustment is
required to be made in the Purchase Price pursuant to subsections 2(a) or 2(b),
the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall
be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the
number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to
such adjustment, multiplied by the Purchase Price in effect immediately

<PAGE>

prior to such adjustment, by (ii) the Purchase Price in effect immediately after
such adjustment.

      (d) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
securities of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or
other property (other than cash out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the Registered Holder shall receive upon
exercise hereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder, the kind and amount of securities of the Company and/or cash and
other property which the Registered Holder would have been entitled to receive
had this Warrant been exercised into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had the Registered Holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such
event to and including the Exercise Date, retained any such securities
receivable, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period
under this Section 2 with respect to the rights of the Registered Holder.

      (e) Adjustment for Mergers or Reorganizations, etc. If there shall occur
any reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger involving the
Company in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for securities,
cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by subsections 2(a),
2(b) or 2(d)), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization,
consolidation or merger, the Registered Holder shall receive upon exercise
hereof the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which the
Registered Holder would have been entitled to receive if, immediately prior to
such reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger, the Registered
Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if (x) there shall occur any
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger involving the Company
in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for anything other than
solely equity securities, and (y) the common stock of the acquiring or surviving
company is publicly traded, then, as part of any such reorganization,
recapitalization, consolidation or merger, (i) the Registered Holder shall have
the right thereafter to receive upon the exercise hereof such number of shares
of common stock of the acquiring or surviving company as is determined by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Common Stock then subject to this
Warrant by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Fair Market Value per
share of Common Stock as of the effective date of such transaction, as
determined pursuant to subsection 1(b), and the denominator of which is the fair
market value per share of common stock of the acquiring or surviving company as
of the effective date of such transaction, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Company (using the principles set forth in subsection
1(b) to the extent applicable), and (ii) the exercise price per share of common
stock of the acquiring or surviving company shall be the Purchase Price divided
by the fraction referred to in clause (B) above. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth herein
with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Registered Holder, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions
with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Purchase Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any
securities, cash or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of
this Warrant.

<PAGE>

      (e) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2, the Company at
its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and furnish to the Registered Holder a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property for which this Warrant shall be exercisable
and the Purchase Price) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Registered Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Registered Holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Purchase Price then in
effect and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the
exercise of this Warrant.

3. Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required upon the exercise of
this Warrant to issue any fractional shares, but shall make an adjustment
therefor in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common
Stock, as determined pursuant to subsection 1(b) above.

4. Requirements for Transfer. For a period of one year after the issuance date
of this Warrant (which shall not be earlier than the effective date of the
offering pursuant to which this Warrant is being issued), no sale, transfer
assignment or hypothecation of this Warrant may be made to any person except an
officer or employee (but not a director) of Rodman & Renshaw, Inc. or of another
NASD member firm which is part of the selling group in the aforesaid offering.
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Company agrees to register the shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (but not the Warrant itself) for resale
by the Holder whenever the Company shall next file a registration statement on a
form usable for such purpose, and shall thereafter maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (or another registration statement for such purpose)
until at least two years from the issuance date of this Warrant.

5. No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its charter or through
any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and
in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the rights of the holder of this Warrant against impairment.

6. Notices of Record Date, etc. In the event:

      (a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or
other stock or securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this
Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend
or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other
right; or of any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification of
the Common Stock of the Company, any consolidation or merger of the Company with
or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Company is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into or
exchanged for any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

<PAGE>

      (b) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up
of the Company,

then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the
Registered Holder a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date
for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed,
as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior
to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

7. Reservation of Stock. The Company will at all times reserve and keep
available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the exercise of this Warrant,
such number of Warrant Shares and other securities, cash and/or property, as
from time to time shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant.

8. Exchange of Warrants. Upon the surrender by the Registered Holder, properly
endorsed, to the Company at the principal office of the Company, the Company
will, subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, issue and deliver to or
upon the order of such Holder, at the Company's expense, a new Warrant or
Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Registered Holder or as the
Registered Holder (upon payment by the Registered Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces
thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash
and/or property) then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

9. Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and
(in the case of loss, theft or destruction) upon delivery of an indemnity
agreement (with surety if reasonably required) in an amount reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, or (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and
cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will issue, in lieu thereof, a new
Warrant of like tenor.

10. Transfers, etc.

      (a) The Company will maintain a register containing the name and address
of the Registered Holder of this Warrant. The Registered Holder may change its
or his address as shown on the warrant register by written notice to the Company
requesting such change.

      (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, this Warrant and all
rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of this
Warrant with a properly executed assignment (in the form of Exhibit II hereto)
at the principal office of the Company.

      (c) Until any transfer of this Warrant is made in the warrant register,
the Company may

<PAGE>

treat the Registered Holder as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes;
provided, however, that if and when this Warrant is properly assigned in blank,
the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) treat the bearer hereof as the
absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary.

11. Representations of the Registered Holder. The Registered Holder of this
Warrant represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

      (a) Investment. The Registered Holder is acquiring this Warrant and the
Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, for its own account
for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing or selling
the same, except as otherwise may be permitted under applicable securities laws.

      (b) Authority. The Registered Holder has full power and authority to enter
into and to perform this Warrant in accordance with its terms. The Registered
Holder has not been organized specifically for the purpose of investing in the
Company.

      (c) Accredited Investor. The Registered Holder is an Accredited Investor
within the definition set forth in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities
Act.

12. Mailing of Notices, etc. All notices and other communications from the
Company to the Registered Holder shall be mailed by first-class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, to the address last furnished to the Company
in writing by the Registered Holder. All notices and other communications from
the Registered Holder or in connection herewith to the Company shall be mailed
by first-class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at
its principal office set forth below. If the Company should at any time change
the location of its principal office to a place other than as set forth below,
it shall give prompt written notice to the Registered Holder and thereafter all
references in this Warrant to the location of its principal office at the
particular time shall be as so specified in such notice.

13. No Rights as Stockholder. Until the exercise of this Warrant, the Registered
Holder shall not have or exercise any rights by virtue hereof as a stockholder
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the Company
effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the
Purchase Price of and the number of Warrant Shares are adjusted as of the date
of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such
dividend), and (ii) the Registered Holder exercises this Warrant between the
record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend, the Registered
Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock
dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon such exercise,
notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close
of business on the record date for such stock dividend.

14. Change or Waiver. Any term of this Warrant may be changed or waived only by
an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change or waiver is sought.

<PAGE>

15. Section Headings. The section headings in this Warrant are for the
convenience of the parties and in no way alter, modify, amend, limit or restrict
the contractual obligations of the parties.

with the internal laws of the State of New York (without reference to the
conflicts of law provisions thereof).
