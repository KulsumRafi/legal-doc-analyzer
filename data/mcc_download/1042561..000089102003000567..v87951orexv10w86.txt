                           COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT

      This is an Agreement, effective as of the 1st day of November, 1994 (the
EFFECTIVE DATE), between Coulter Corporation, a corporation incorporated in the
State of Delaware, with offices located at 11800 S.W. 147 Avenue, Miami, Florida
33196 ("COULTER"), and the Regents of the University of Michigan, a
constitutional corporation of the State of Michigan, with offices located at
3003 South State, Room 2071, Ann Arbor 48109-1280 ("MICHIGAN"). COULTER and
MICHIGAN agree as follows:

1.    BACKGROUND.

      1.1 MICHIGAN undertakes biological research in order to understand and
develop strategies to address the pathogenesis of cancer and other human
disease. COULTER utilizes new scientific discoveries to serve humanity by
developing commercial products for use by research scientists and for the
diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

      1.2 Researchers employed by COULTER and those employed by MICHIGAN have
jointly invented LICENSED PATENTS that are identified and defined below. COULTER
desires to commercialize LICENSED PRODUCTS that are identified and defined
below. Both COULTER and MICHIGAN desire to make the benefits of the LICENSED
PRODUCTS available to the public.

      1.3 MICHIGAN and COULTER believe that exclusive rights are an important
factor with regard to the ability to market the LICENSED PRODUCTS, and both
Parties have determined that in order to best effectuate the commercialization
of the LICENSED PRODUCTS, the exclusive right to the LICENSED PATENTS needs to
be held and promoted by COULTER. To this end and for the benefit of both
MICHIGAN and COULTER, MICHIGAN, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and consistent with its mission of education and research, is
agreeing to refrain from exercising its rights to license the LICENSED PRODUCTS
to third parties; and COULTER, in consideration for the benefits thereby gained,
is agreeing to share the benefits and revenues resulting from commercialization
of the LICENSED PRODUCTS.

      27.1 any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to, any
provisions of this agreement or the breach thereof which cannot otherwise be

            A. The number of arbitrators shall be one (1).

                  (1) Each PARTY shall submit a description of the matter to be
arbitrated to the American Arbitration Association at its Regional office in New
York, New York. Said Association shall submit to the PARTIES a list for the
arbitrators available to arbitrate any dispute between them. Thereafter, each
PARTY shall select, in numerical order, those persons on said list acceptable as
arbitrators and return the same to the Association. The first arbitrator
acceptable to both PARTIES shall be deemed the selected arbitrator with respect
to the dispute then at issue under this Agreement. In the event of a failure to
select a mutually agreeable arbitrator, the Association shall be requested to
submit as many subsequent lists of arbitrators as shall be necessary to effect a
mutual selection.

                  (2) If the method of selection set out in paragraph D(1) fails
for any reason, then either PARTY may petition an appropriate state or federal
court for appointment of the arbitrator in accordance with applicable law,
provided that the arbitrator must satisfy the requirements of B and C, above.

            E. The arbitrator shall announce the award in writing accompanied by
written findings explaining the facts determined in support of the award, and
any relevant conclusions of law.

such arbitration may be enforced by either PARTY in the appropriate State or
United States District Court in the State of Michigan.
