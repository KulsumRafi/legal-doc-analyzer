MANAGEMENT PROXY CIRCULAR
as at January 21, 2003 (except as otherwise indicated)

SECTION I - VOTING INFORMATION

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

THIS MANAGEMENT PROXY CIRCULAR (THE "CIRCULAR") IS FURNISHED IN CONNECTION WITH
THE SOLICITATION BY THE MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA (THE "BANK") OF
PROXIES TO BE USED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES OF THE BANK
(THE "MEETING"), FOR THE PURPOSES INDICATED IN THE NOTICE OF MEETING, TO BE HELD
ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 2003, AT 9:30 A.M. (EASTERN TIME), AT THE PALAIS DES
CONGRES DE MONTREAL, ROOM 710, 201 VIGER WEST, MONTREAL, QUEBEC, AND AT ANY
CONTINUATION THEREOF AFTER AN ADJOURNMENT. The solicitation of proxies will be
done by mail, electronically, by telephone or in person. Employees, officers,
directors or agents of the Bank will solicit the proxies. The Bank may also use
the services of an outside agency, Georgeson Shareholder Communications Canada,
to solicit proxies on its behalf. The Bank estimates that the costs which might
be incurred for such solicitation would be approximately $32,000. The costs
incurred in this regard will be borne by the Bank.

VOTING COMMON SHARES
Holders of common shares of the Bank of record at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on
January 21, 2003 or their duly authorized attorneys are entitled to receive the
Notice of Annual Meeting and to vote at the Meeting. Persons who acquire such
shares after that date must request, no later than 10 days before the Meeting,
that their name be included on the list of shareholders to be entitled to vote.
To do so, they must contact the transfer agent by writing to National Bank Trust
Inc., Share Ownership Management, P.O. Box 888, Station B, Montreal, Quebec H3B
9Z9, or by calling one of the following numbers: 1-800-341-1419 or (514)
871-7171.

On January 21, 2003, the date the registers of the Bank were closed, 183,463,975
common shares of the Bank were issued and outstanding.

Each holder of common shares is entitled to cast one vote per share held.
However, the Bank Act (the "Act") contains provisions which specifically prevent
the exercise of voting rights attaching to the common shares of the Bank held by
a government, whether Canadian, provincial or foreign, as well as any agency
thereof.

To the best of the knowledge of the directors and officers of the Bank, no
individual or corporation beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, controls or
directs common shares carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to
the common shares of the Bank.

Holders of common shares of the Bank may vote in person at the Meeting or may
complete, sign and return the enclosed form of proxy. This form of proxy
authorizes a proxyholder to represent and to vote on behalf of the holder of
common shares at the Meeting.

NON-REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS
The names of shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or
another intermediary do not appear on the list of shareholders of the Bank. To
vote, the shareholders must therefore ask the broker or other intermediary to
send them material relating to the Meeting, complete the request for voting
instructions sent by the broker or other intermediary and, if they wish to vote
in person, insert their name as the proxyholder.

APPOINTMENT OF PROXYHOLDERS
THE PROXYHOLDERS DESIGNATED IN THE ENCLOSED FORM OF PROXY ARE DIRECTORS OF THE
BANK. IF A SHAREHOLDER WISHES TO APPOINT AS A PROXYHOLDER A PERSON OTHER THAN
ONE OF THOSE DESIGNATED IN THE FORM OF PROXY, THE SHAREHOLDER MAY DO SO BY
STRIKING OUT THE NAMES APPEARING THEREON AND INSERTING THE NAME OF SUCH PERSON
IN THE BLANK SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE SHAREHOLDER IS A LEGAL ENTITY, AN ESTATE OR
A TRUST, THE FORM OF PROXY MUST BE SIGNED BY A DULY AUTHORIZED OFFICER OR
ATTORNEY. A PROXYHOLDER IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE A SHAREHOLDER OF THE BANK. IN
ORDER TO BE VALID, THE FORM OF PROXY MUST BE RETURNED BY MAIL, IN THE
POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE PROVIDED, TO NATIONAL BANK TRUST INC., SHARE OWNERSHIP
MANAGEMENT, P.O. BOX 888, STATION B, MONTREAL, QUEBEC H3B 9Z9, OR BY FAX TO

OTHER REMUNERATION PAID TO A DIRECTOR
Mr. Berard ceased to be Chief Executive Officer on March 13, 2002. For more
information regarding the remuneration paid to him during the last financial
year, please refer to the "Compensation of the President and Chief Executive
Officer" section in the Circular.

During the past financial year, only one director received from one of the
Bank's subsidiaries remuneration other than that received in his capacity as
director. In accordance with a service contract signed in February 2001 with
National Bank Financial Inc. and renewed in October 2002, Lawrence S. Bloomberg
serves as Advisor to National Bank Financial and, as such, receives an annual
retainer, commissions, an allowance for business development and reimbursement
for various administrative expenses incurred when carrying out his functions.
For the financial year ended October 31, 2002, Mr. Bloomberg received a total
amount of $3,860,939 for services rendered under the terms of this contract.

<PAGE>

The directors of the Bank who are also full-time officers of the Bank or one of
its subsidiaries do not receive any remuneration in their capacity as directors
of the Bank or any of its subsidiaries. However, the Bank and its subsidiaries
reimburse these directors for the expenses they incur to attend meetings.

FORMS OF REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS OF THE BANK
All eligible directors may receive their remuneration for serving on the boards
of directors and, if applicable, any committees of the Bank or its subsidiaries,
in the form of common shares of the Bank, deferred stock units ("DSUs"), cash or
a combination thereof.

A DSU is a right which has a value equal to the market value of a common share
of the Bank on the date it is credited and is credited every quarter to an
account in the director's name. It is paid out, in the form he or she chooses,
as cash, common shares or a combination thereof, at the market value of a common
share of the Bank on the date the director leaves the Board. Additional DSUs are
credited to that account when dividends are paid on common shares of the Bank.
They are calculated based on the amount of the dividend paid.

The directors, with the exception of those who are also officers of the Bank, do
not participate in any stock option plan.

COMPENSATION PAID TO OFFICERS

REPORT OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OFFICERS OF THE
BANK Compensation is one of the ways favoured by the Bank to attract, motivate
and retain competent officers (as defined hereinbelow) who focus on improving
the performance of the Bank and enhancing shareholder value. To that end, the
Board mandates the Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") to review general
compensation policies and to make recommendations with regard to compensation
for the officers of the Bank. These recommendations are supported by the opinion
of external compensation specialists.

In addition to its mandated functions, the Committee this year modified the
components of the compensation of the President and Chief Executive Officer. It
also modified the program of loans to officers and defined the Share Ownership
Guidelines for all the officers of the Bank. Lastly, it reviewed the Stock
Option Plan.

COMPOSITION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE
The Committee is comprised of seven directors who are neither officers nor

former officers of the Bank. The Committee is chaired by Robert Parizeau, with
the other members being Gerard Coulombe, Francois J. Coutu, Shirley A. Dawe,
Marcel Dutil, Jean Gaulin and E.A. (Dee) Parkinson-Marcoux.

ROLE OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE
The Committee submits its recommendations to the Board which makes the final
decisions with regard to changes to the compensation policy and programs and the
total compensation for the Chairman, the Presidents, the Senior Vice-Presidents
and the Vice-Presidents (the "Officers").

The Committee strives to set compensation at a level comparable to that offered
by the Bank's comparison market, which comprises a group of Canadian financial
institutions and selected Canadian companies, while taking into account
Bank-specific factors.

The recommendations of the Committee are based on the following fundamental
principles of the compensation policy:

o    The annual bonus program supports the Bank's strategic objectives and
     offers fully competitive total cash compensation, which may exceed market
     practices if justified by financial results and business development;

o    The long-term variable compensation program aligns Officers' interests with
     the long-term interests of the Bank's shareholders and those of the Bank's
     various other partners;

o    The proportion of variable compensation in relation to base salary
     increases in line with the level of responsibility;

o    Employee benefits and the pension plan are comparable, on the whole, to
     those offered by the comparison market.

NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA



SECTION III - INFORMATION ON COMPENSATION (CONT.)

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPENSATION OF OFFICERS OF THE BANK
The compensation of Officers consists of a cash component (namely, base salary
and an annual bonus), long-term variable compensation and a benefits package.
The target value of each of the components varies in line with the level of
responsibility. Of this compensation, base salary may represent 24% to 58%, the
annual bonus, 18% to 24% and long-term variable compensation, 24% to 52%.

Base Salary The Committee reviews the base salary of each Officer annually
taking into account his or her level of responsibility, experience and
individual performance. To ensure that the base salaries of Officers are
competitive, the Committee uses the median salaries of the Bank's comparison
market, adjusted when necessary, to take into consideration characteristics of
the Bank.

Annual Bonus Program The Bank offers an annual bonus program to all its
employees. Under the terms of this program, the total bonus envelope to be
shared is calculated based, on the one hand, on how well the Bank's overall
financial results and those of its business segments are met versus the
objectives set at the beginning of the year and, on the other hand, on the
Bank's financial performance compared to that of the five major Canadian banks.
The program also considers whether other objectives relating to management
quality and customer satisfaction have been achieved. The annual bonus varies
depending on the percentage of results achieved and position held. The more
influence an employee has on the Bank's ability to reach its objectives, the
greater the amount of the compensation. The actual bonus paid to each Officer,
including the President and Chief Executive Officer, is thus based on the Bank's
results and is established by taking into account the Officer's individual
contribution to his or her financial, client service and management results,
measured using criteria applicable to both management practices and employee
engagement. It is also established taking into account the Officer's individual
performance.

Certain Officers of Financial Markets, Treasury and Investment Banking
participate in an annual bonus program based on the profitability of their
respective groups. One third of the bonus amount is deferred. The deferred
portion for Jean Turmel is converted into deferred stock units for Officers
("DSUs for Officers") with a value equal to the closing market price of the
common shares of the Bank the day preceding the award of the annual bonus.
Additional DSUs for Officers are credited to his account and are calculated
based on the dividends paid. DSUs for Officers may only be cashed when the
Officer retires or leaves the Bank.

In order to maintain total compensation at a competitive level and to
acknowledge Real Raymond's specific contribution to implementing the Bank's
strategy, the Committee decided to include a "medium-term" variable compensation
component in the President's total compensation, which was paid out to him this
year in DSUs for Officers.

Long-Term Variable Compensation Program

Stock Option Plan The purpose of the Stock Option Plan is to encourage Officers
and other designated persons of the Bank or its subsidiaries to contribute to
the growth of shareholders' investments by giving them the opportunity to
benefit from the appreciation in the value of the common shares of the Bank.
Each year, when awarding additional options, the Committee reviews the number
and the expiry dates of options previously awarded. After setting the terms and
conditions, the Committee awards options, on an annual basis, to Officers and
other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Options may be
exercised in whole or in part before the termination date determined by the
Committee at the time they are awarded, without exceeding the legal limit of 10
years. They expire on the termination date or, in the event of certain
circumstances provided for in the Stock Option Plan, expire in a specific
timeframe. No options may be exercised in the first year after they are awarded.

The Stock Option Plan was revised by the Board on October 24, 2002. At that
time, the Bank decided to eliminate the feature of exercising options without
purchasing shares. The Bank received approval from the regulatory authorities
and participants were informed accordingly. The Bank undertook to assume the
brokerage fees related to the exercising of stock options awarded prior to that
date by Plan participants who chose to receive a cash amount representing the
gain on the shares related to the options awarded, had the Stock Option Plan not
been modified.

In order to further align the interests of Officers who sit on the Bank's
Executive Committee with those of shareholders, the Board added a new condition
to the option awards, which will be imposed as of the 2002-2003 financial year.
Thus, each Officer on the Bank's Executive Committee will be required to retain
the shares received further to exercising an option, after tax considerations,
for a minimum of one year.


                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

As at October 31, 2002, 5,692,822 options were outstanding with strike prices
ranging between $11.00 and $28.01 and maturities between December 2005 and
December 2011. During the past financial year, 1,882,840 options were awarded
and 608,818 options were exercised at strike prices ranging from $11.00 to
$25.20. As at October 31, 2002, 2,466,587 options could be exercised at prices
ranging between $11.00 and $25.20. The maximum number of common shares that may
be issued under the Stock Option Plan is 18,930,437. The maximum number of
common shares reserved for a participant may not exceed 5% of the total number
of common shares issued and outstanding.

Stock Appreciation Rights Plan
The Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the "SAR Plan") has the same objectives as
the Stock Option Plan. The Committee awards stock appreciation rights ("SARs")
to Officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. For
their part, participants entitled to SARs may receive, on the exercise date of
the SAR, a cash amount equal to the difference between the market price of a
common share on the exercise date of the SAR and the exercise price of the SAR.

No SARs were awarded to Canadian residents during the financial year ended
October 31, 2002. The SAR Plan was revised by the Board on December 14, 2000.

Employee Share Ownership Plan
Under the Employee Share Ownership Plan in effect at the Bank, employees who
respect the eligibility criteria may contribute up to 8% of their gross salary
per year by way of payroll deductions. The Bank's contribution consists in
paying an amount equal to 25% of the employee's contribution up to $1,500 per
year. After one year of continuous participation, the Bank's contributions are
vested in the employee. Moreover, all subsequent contributions are vested as
soon as they are made.

Share Ownership Guidelines The Board established guidelines for all Officers
which require minimum holdings of Bank common shares, including DSUs for
Officers and vested stock options, proportionate to each Officer's compensation
and position. The value of the minimum stock holdings is a multiple of the
previous three years' average base salary and annual bonus received by a given
Officer. The guidelines are as follows:

i)   2.5 for the President and Chief Executive Officer

ii)  1.0 for the other Executive Committee members

iii) 0.5 for the senior vice-presidents and vice-presidents

The Officers will be given a reasonable period of time to meet these
requirements.

COMPENSATION OF THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The Committee assesses the overall performance of the President and Chief
Executive Officer on the basis of his contribution to:

o    the financial results obtained by the Bank compared, on the one hand, to
     the objectives set at the beginning of the financial year and, on the
     other, to the results obtained by the five major banks;

o    the development of competitive advantages enabling the Bank to consolidate
     its strategic positioning within the financial industry;

o    the continued development of customer service quality;

o    the risk profile and credit quality of the Bank; and

o    the relationships with shareholders, customers, employees, governments and
     communities.

As President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Raymond's annual base salary was
set at $750,000 and is situated at the beginning of the median of the Bank's
reference market, adjusted to take into account the specific characteristics of
the Bank.

Under the annual bonus program, Mr. Raymond received a total bonus of $800,000
as President and Chief Operating Officer and, since March 13, 2002, as President
and Chief Executive Officer. The bonus was awarded to underscore the excellent
work carried out by Mr. Raymond during his first year of heading the Bank. Thus,
in addition to the satisfactory results achieved during a difficult year in the
financial industry, the Committee took into account the exceptional growth in
the price of the Bank's stock, which enabled shareholders to obtain one of the
best returns in the banking industry.

SECTION III - INFORMATION ON COMPENSATION (CONT.)

Moreover, the Committee took into account customers' increased satisfaction with
the Bank, the result, among other things, of the extended business hours at a
number of branches and the improved competence of front-line personnel. As well,
the Bank's efficiency ratio is right on target with the three-year plan.

In addition, the Committee decided to include a medium-term bonus in Mr.
Raymond's compensation in the form of DSUs for Officers representing $450,000 or
14,540 DSUs for Officers at a price of $30.95 per share. This bonus is intended
to recognize Mr. Raymond's contribution in carrying out the Bank's strategic
plan. For the 2001-2002 financial year, Mr. Raymond actively pursued the
strategy of re-centering the Bank's activities in its priority markets,
including expanding its wealth management operations, one of the key areas of
future growth for the Bank. The acquisitions of Altamira and U.S. investment
bank Putnam Lovell, as well as a partnership agreement with three Power
Financial Corporation companies, substantially increased the Bank's market
share, especially outside Quebec. The Committee also took into account the
significant improvement in the quality of the credit portfolio, despite a
difficult market. In fact, gross impaired loans were reduced by almost half,
positioning the Bank as a leader in the banking industry in terms of the ratio
of gross impaired loans to tangible capital and allowances. Lastly, the Bank
maintained a very high capitalization ratio, ranking second among the Canadian
banks in terms of Tier 1 capital.

The Committee also awarded Mr. Raymond 149,940 stock options.

Andre Berard, formerly Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
retired in March 2002 as Chief Executive Officer but remains Chairman of the
Board. His annual base salary during the past financial year was $680,000. He
also received an annual bonus of $600,000 for the five months he served as
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, he was awarded
218,600 stock options.

Furthermore, in recognition of his having contributed to the Bank's development
and consolidated its financial market position, the Committee awarded Mr. Berard
a lump sum of $850,508 and an amount of $314,925 as a retirement allowance.

PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK IN 2002
The 2002 financial year was affected by difficult economic conditions, marked by
reduced demand for commercial credit and upheavals on financial markets, which
slowed retail brokerage activities.

The Bank performed well despite this context. More specifically, the total
return on the Bank's shares (dividends and stock appreciation) was 25% in 2002
compared to a negative return of 0.4% for the five major Canadian banks. Over
five years, the total return obtained by common shareholders of the National
Bank reached 11%, compared to 8% for the S&P/TSX Banks and Trusts subindex.

In addition, the measures adopted in the first quarter helped to reduce gross
impaired loans by nearly 50%. As at October 31, 2002, gross private impaired
loans of $479 million represented 14.1% of tangible capital and allowances
compared to 22.5% a year earlier. At year-end 2002, the same ratio for the five
major Canadian banks averaged 22.8%.

As at October 31, 2002, the Bank had the second best Tier 1 capital ratio of the
six largest Canadian banks, at 9.6%. The Tier 1 capital ratio of the other five
banks averaged 9.0%.

Income before goodwill charges was $429 million or $2.18 per share for fiscal
2002 as against $563 million or $2.88 per share in 2001. However, certain
charges and income for one-time events must be deducted from the 2002 and 2001
results in order to evaluate the Bank's underlying performance. These one-time
items included, for fiscal 2002, discontinued operations with respect to
asset-based lending in the United States, a revision of the estimated allowance
for credit losses, an impairment charge relating to a decline in the value of
investments and the writeoff of fixed assets. For fiscal 2001, one-time items
included discontinued operations and the gain on the sale of merchant payment
solutions. Table 1b on page 55 of the 2001-2002 Annual Report provides details
of these items.


                                    Page 12
<PAGE>
 Adjusted income in 2002 was $555 million or $2.86 per share compared to $580
million or $2.87 per share in 2001. Income was down 4% while earnings per share
remained relatively stable due to the repurchase of 9.5 million common shares
under the Bank's normal course issuer bid. By comparison, the average income of
the five major Canadian banks declined 28% from 2001 to 2002.

Adjusted income for 2002 for Personal Banking and Wealth Management totalled
$253 million, up 4% over 2001. The growth in adjusted income for Personal
Banking was offset by the weaker performance of brokerage activities as a result
of lower transaction volumes.

Income for Commercial Banking totalled $119 million in 2002, unchanged from
2001. The decline in revenues, attributable to reduced loan volumes as a result
of weak credit demand, was offset by a reduction in expected loan losses.

Financial Markets, Treasury and Investment Banking recorded income of $250
million in 2002 for a 23% year-over-year increase. This performance was
primarily attributable to asset and liability matching operations as well as
National Bank Financial's institutional operations.

Overall, the Bank's results compare favourably to those of the other major
Canadian banks. In addition, the Bank began fiscal 2003 on a solid footing,
mainly because of the quality of its credit portfolio and its high capital
ratios.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH FOR COMMON SHARES OF THE BANK
The following performance graph shows the cumulative total return of a $100
investment in common shares of the Bank made on October 31, 1997 compared to the
cumulative total return of the S&P/TSX Banks and Trusts subindex and the S&P/TSX
Composite Index for the five most recently completed financial years, assuming

COMPENSATION OF THE OFFICERS OF NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL
The officers of National Bank Financial receive a base salary, an annual bonus
and long-term variable compensation.

The compensation of the Named Executive Officers is approved by the Human
Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of National Bank Financial & Co.
Inc., which is comprised of a majority of outside directors. These directors
are: Robert Parizeau, Chair, Pierre Ducros, Paul Gobeil and Jean Turmel.

Base Salary
To establish the base salary of its officers, National Bank Financial refers to
the salaries of its comparison market, while taking into consideration the
criteria specific to National Bank Financial.

Annual Bonus Program
To attract and retain high-calibre employees in the highly competitive
securities sector, National Bank Financial offers an annual bonus program which
is an important part of the compensation of officers at National Bank Financial.
Under this program, bonuses are awarded every six months based on the
profitability of securities operations in the sectors under the responsibility
of each officer.

Long-Term Variable Compensation Program
G.F. Kym Anthony and Germain Carriere no longer participate in the long-term
variable compensation program of National Bank Financial. However, information
on their past participation is provided in the "Summary of Total Compensation of
Named Executive Officers" table in the Circular. The long-term variable
compensation program enables certain officers and employees of National Bank
Financial to share in the company's pre-tax profits. It provides for either
bonuses to be granted or deferred stock units to be created.

SECTION III - INFORMATION ON COMPENSATION (CONT.)

Eligible participants can acquire these bonuses over a three-year period as
follows: 50% payable at the end of the reference year, 25% payable at the end of
the second year and 25% payable at the end of the third year.

Since participants are eligible for deferred stock units, they receive phantom
stock units of the Bank at a value equal to the market value, based on the
average closing price of a regular board lot on The Toronto Stock Exchange for
the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the award. The value of
the units varies according to the price of Bank shares. In order to encourage
participants to remain with National Bank Financial, the deferred stock units
vest over a four-year period beginning the year after they are awarded. They may
only be converted to cash at the time of retirement, death or upon termination
of employment.

As indicated in the "Summary of Total Compensation of Named Executive Officers"

Option Plan.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE BANK

PENSION PLAN
With the exception of G.F. Kym Anthony and Germain Carriere, the Named Executive
Officers of the Bank participate in a defined benefit pension plan. This plan is
fully funded according to the most recent actuarial valuation.

For each year of service credited, the plan grants a pension equal to 2% of
average eligible earnings, defined as the average earnings for the 60
highest-paid consecutive months. Compensation consequently varies according to
level. For Officers at the level of President, it is based on the salary and the
annual bonus. For the Senior Vice-President level, the calculation is based on
salary and 25% of the annual bonus (up to a maximum of 20% of salary). This
pension is then reduced by the pension acquired under the Canada or Quebec
pension plans ("CPP/QPP") while the Named Executive Officer participated in the
Bank pension plan, except for the years of participation prior to January 1,
1990 which are reduced by 50%. However, this benefit cannot exceed the maximum
pension prescribed under the Income Tax Act (Canada), currently $1,722 per year
of service credited. The normal retirement age is 60. However, the plan allows
for early retirement, with the employer's consent, as of 55 years of age.
Benefits then payable are reduced by the lesser of 4% for each year of early
retirement prior to age 60 or 2% for each year by which the sum of the
participant's age and years of service falls short of 90.

POST-RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE PROGRAM
With the exception of G.F. Kym Anthony and Germain Carriere, who do not
participate in any pension plan, the Named Executive Officers of the Bank are
also entitled to receive a post-retirement allowance for life.

This program, in which the Named Executive Officers participate, grants an
allowance equal to the difference between the pension which would be payable if
there were no provision for a maximum pension (maximum 35 years) and the pension
actually paid under the pension plan for the years recognized under the
Post-Retirement Allowance Program. In order to calculate this supplemental
pension, the annual bonus recognized is limited to 100% of the salary for the
President and Chief Executive Officer and to $571,000 for the President -
Financial Markets, Treasury and Investment Bank, while for the Senior
Vice-President, average eligible earnings are limited to $250,000. The payment
conditions of the allowance are identical to those of the pension plan.

Further to a decision taken by the Board at its meeting held on June 20, 2002,
the Post-Retirement Allowance Program has been funded since January 1, 2003, in
the form of a retirement agreement.

ESTIMATED ANNUAL BENEFITS PAYABLE AT RETIREMENT
The following tables show the estimated annual benefits payable under the Bank's
pension plan and the Post-Retirement Allowance Program to the Named Executive
Officers of the Bank at the level of President and Senior Vice-President.

(1)  The sum of the amounts in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the "Summary
     of Total Compensation of Named Executive Officers" table in the Circular
     is used to calculate the average eligible earnings.

(2)  Years of service credited on the normal retirement date for the purposes of
     the pension plan have been estimated as follows:
     o Real Raymond: 35 years
     o Jean Turmel:  24 years
     o Louis Vachon: 24 years
     However, the maximum number of years recognized for the purposes of the
     Post-Retirement Allowance Program is 35.

(3)  The pension is payable for life. Upon the participant's death, 60% of the
     pension is payable to the spouse. If there is no spouse, part of the
     pension is payable to the dependent children.


TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT POLICY
On November 30, 2000, the Board adopted a policy whereby certain Executive
Officers, as defined under the heading "Indebtedness of Directors and Executive
Officers", would receive a separation allowance in the event their employment is
terminated by the Bank following a change in control. A change in control
notably means any change in the ownership of Bank shares following the
acquisition of shares, a merger or a business combination, resulting in one
shareholder beneficially owning in excess of 20% of the voting shares of the
Bank. Under the terms of this policy, the President and Chief Executive Officer
as well as the President - Financial Markets, Treasury and Investment Bank would
each be entitled to a separation allowance equal to their base salary and
average annual bonus for the previous three years (or the target annual bonus
for eligible Executive Officers who have been in their positions for less than
three years) for a period of 36 months, up to the normal retirement age. Certain
other Executive Officers of the Bank are also covered by this policy and could
receive a separation allowance equal to their base salary and average annual
bonus for the previous three years (or the target annual bonus for eligible
Executive Officers who have been in their positions for less than three years)
for a period of 18 to 24 months, up to the normal retirement age. In all cases,
the separation allowance would also include an amount equal to the estimated
value of the stock options and SARs that would have been granted to them had
their employment not been terminated. Moreover, all stock options and SARs
already granted would immediately be vested and the Executive Officers would
have up to 12 months in which to exercise the options or SARs.

National Bank Financial Inc. has entered into separate agreements with G.F. Kym
Anthony and Germain Carriere which set out the terms and conditions of their
respective compensation in the event that their employment is terminated either
by National Bank Financial Inc. or following a change in control. The terms and
conditions of these agreements are in line with the policy described above and
would entitle each of them to a separation allowance equal to his base salary
and his average annual bonus for the previous two years for a period of 24
months, up to the normal retirement age.

INDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
In the normal course of its operations, the Bank grants loans to its directors,
officers and employees.

As at January 1, 2003, total loans outstanding (other than routine indebtedness
as defined by Canadian securities legislation) granted notably to directors and
Executive Officers of the Bank, as defined below, amounted to approximately
$249,046,674. This total includes mortgage loans for an aggregate amount of
approximately $226,273,249, personal loans for an aggregate amount of
approximately $21,880,036 and investment loans for the purchase of securities of
the Bank or its subsidiaries for an aggregate amount of approximately $893,389.
None of these loans was granted to a director. For the purposes of this section,
the term "Executive Officers" includes: the President and Chief Executive
Officer, the President - Financial Markets, Treasury and Investment Bank, the
Senior Vice-Presidents, and other officers of the Bank or one of its
subsidiaries who perform a policy-making function in respect of the Bank.

----------

(1)  This amount represents one or more personal leveraged loans (the "Leveraged
     Loans") granted to a director or Executive Officer in order to finance the
     participant's equity commitments under the EdgeStone Affiliate Fund
     co-investment program. All Leveraged Loans bear interest at the federal
     prescribed rate published monthly and are secured by a pledge of the
     participant's interest in the limited partnerships comprising the EdgeStone
     Affiliate Fund co-investment program. This program provides Officers and
     eligible employees of the Bank and of entities affiliated with the Bank the
     opportunity to co-invest with EdgeStone Capital Equity Fund II, L.P.,
     EdgeStone Capital Mezzanine Fund II, L.P. and EdgeStone Capital Venture
     Fund, L.P. (collectively, the "Main Funds") and with the Bank or a company
     in which the Bank holds an indirect interest. Officers and eligible
     employees are offered credit facilities by the Bank or its affiliates in
     particular through limited recourse Leveraged Loans. Leveraged Loans may
     bear interest and will mature on the earliest of: (i) the 10th anniversary
     date of the applicable Main Fund, (ii) the termination of the applicable
     Affiliate Fund limited partnership, (iii) the sale or disposition of the
     applicable Affiliate Fund limited partnership interest held by a
     participant or (iv) the date the principal amount under the Loan otherwise
     becomes due and payable. The lender will have personal recourse against the
     participant equal to 50% of the participant's total commitment (equity and
     leveraged portion). Recourse for the balance of the Leveraged Loan is
     limited to the participant's Affiliate Fund partnership interest and the
     distributions thereon.

(2)  This amount represents a loan or the sum of loans granted to an Executive
     Officer of the Bank, which must be disclosed in accordance with the
     relevant securities legislation. The loan or loans may have been granted in
     the form of either of the following:

     -    A personal loan in excess of $25,000 granted for consumer purchases,
          construction and home improvements and sundry investments, granted
          according to the standards applicable to clients, except for the
          interest rate, which ranges between half of the Bank's prime rate and
          the prime rate, or as a loan granted under a relocation agreement;

     -    A loan secured by a mortgage on the borrower's main residence, which
          exceeds the Executive Officer's annual salary; it is granted according
          to the standards applicable to clients, except for the interest rate,
          which is at one-third of the Bank's client rate on the first $50,000
          and at the Bank's prime rate less 5% on the amount in excess thereof
          but such rate cannot be lower than the rate applied to the first
          $50,000;

     -    A loan secured by a mortgage on the borrower's secondary residence.
          This loan is granted on market terms and conditions.

(3)  On March 4, 2002, the Bank's Corporate Banking operations were transferred
     to National Bank Financial Inc. Further to an agreement between the Bank
     and the Officer, the benefits related to reduced-rate loans are maintained
     until March 31, 2003.

SECTION IV - OTHER INFORMATION

LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
The Bank is covered by a blended risk insurance program, which includes public
liability insurance for directors and Officers of the Bank and its subsidiaries.
This policy provides coverage of $100,000,000 with a deductible of $10,000,000
per claim.

This insurance protects directors and Officers of the Bank from acts, errors or
omissions committed in the course of their duties as directors or Officers.
Illegal acts and those committed for personal gain are excluded from this
coverage. The Bank's insurer estimates that the portion of the annual premium
attributable to the public liability insurance for directors and Officers is
approximately $585,000.

REPURCHASE OF SHARES
The Bank currently has a normal course issuer bid (the "Issuer Bid") in place
under which it intends to repurchase for cancellation, from time to time and
during a given period (hereafter referred to), a given number of common shares
through The Toronto Stock Exchange. The Issuer Bid as filed allows for the
purchase of up to 9,100,000 common shares representing approximately 5% of the
outstanding common shares. In the opinion of the Board, the purchase of common
shares pursuant to the Issuer Bid constitutes an appropriate use of the Bank's
surplus funds.

The Issuer Bid, which commenced on January 20, 2003, will run for a period
ending on the earlier of i) the date on which the Bank repurchases the maximum
number of common shares, i.e., 9,100,000, or ii) the date on which the Bank
otherwise decides not to repurchase further shares, or iii) on January 19, 2004.
The price the Bank pays for any common share which it repurchases shall be the
prevailing market price of a common share on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the
purchase date.

To the knowledge of the Bank, its directors and Officers, after reasonable
verification, as at the date hereof, the Bank repurchased 9,500,000 common
shares as part of its previous normal course issuer bid, representing
approximately 5% of the common shares outstanding at the time the issuer bid was
made on March 5, 2002.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Statement of Corporate Governance Practices of the Bank Incorporating the
Guidelines of The Toronto Stock Exchange is presented in Schedule D of the

Proposals Nos. 1 to 4 inclusively have been submitted to the management of the
Bank by the Association for the Protection of Quebec Savers and Investors, a
shareholder located at 425 de Maisonneuve West, Suite 1002, Montreal, Quebec H3A
3G5.

PROPOSAL NO. 1

PROPOSAL AND STATEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER:
"It is proposed that the company abolish stock option plans as a form of
compensation to executive officers and directors.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, the compensation strategies of North American
companies have tended towards the growing use of stock options as part of the
compensation of their executive officers and directors. This practice has
generally given rise to excessive, illegitimate and indefensible levels of
compensation, in light of the performance of the vast majority of companies and
the stock returns offered to shareholders. These abuses have contributed
significantly to the dramatic loss of confidence in the quality of the
governance of publicly-traded companies and the integrity of financial markets
by investors and the public. Executive officer compensation has become
completely divorced from the long-term objectives set for management and has
been transformed into an incentive to manage companies based on the immediate
stock price. The massive use of stock options in the compensation system is the
main reason for these distortions and, in several cases, the source of numerous
frauds where officers, with the complicity of their auditors, violated rules of
conduct and the law to traffic information on the real financial condition of
their companies. As a growing number of observers and specialists have noted,
assigning to options the objective of aligning the interests of officers with
those of shareholders has manifestly failed. In fact, they encouraged the
devastation of shareholder assets by the executive officers of their companies.
On September 26, 2002, the Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE,
Governance, Values and Competitiveness; A Commitment to Leadership, September
2002, page 16) also came to the same conclusion, stating that it "understood the
frustration felt by investors when senior executives are rewarded handsomely for
past performance that proves to be short-lived." This form of compensation must
be eliminated and alternative solutions found, such as awarding shares with the
requirement that they be held for a minimum period of time, in order to align
officers' interests with those of shareholders. The National Bank is therefore
requested not to extend its stock option plans for executive officers and
directors once the obligations undertaken in the past have been honoured."

POSITION OF THE BANK:
Since Officers have an impact on the Bank's long-term growth, the Bank seeks to
attract and interest high-calibre managers. It is essential that the Bank
recruit, retain and motivate talented and competent managers in order to achieve
its return and performance objectives. To do otherwise would, ultimately, have a
negative impact for our shareholders.

Stock option plans, for which only Officers and certain key Bank employees are
eligible, are a profit-sharing tool aimed at encouraging them to stimulate the
growth of shareholder investments by aligning part of their compensation to the
Bank's performance. Thus, the interests of Officers are directly aligned with
those of the shareholders of the Bank, for the benefit of the shareholders. The
directors of the Bank, with the exception of those who are also Officers of the
Bank, do not participate in any stock option plan.

The Human Resources Committee was mandated by the Board of Directors to review
and approve the Bank's compensation practices and policies, including more
specifically the stock option plans. The awarding of options and the assessment
of Officers' performance is carried out under the control of this Committee,
which is composed exclusively of outside directors.

In recent months, the Committee directed outside consultants to conduct a
comparative study of stock option plans. The results revealed that the plans
currently in place at the Bank reflect general practices in its comparison
market. However, in order to further align executive compensation with
shareholder return, the Board adopted share ownership guidelines for all Bank
Officers. Under these new guidelines, Officers are required to hold a minimum
number of common shares, the value of which is proportional to the compensation
they receive and the position they hold. Moreover, a provision obliges Officers
who are members of the Executive Committee to keep for a one-year period, after
tax considerations, shares acquired through the exercise of options.

Moreover, as of November 1, 2002, the beginning of the financial year, the Bank
has opted to expense the cost of stock options based on the fair market value of
the options as determined by an options valuation model and as recommended under
the accounting standards published by the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants.

The shareholder proposal would eliminate a major compensation tool and an
effective method for fostering the Bank's growth and profitability. The
shareholder proposal is therefore not in the best interest of all shareholders.

For all these reasons, management recommends voting AGAINST this proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
PROPOSAL AND STATEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER: "It is proposed that the Chairman of
the Board, as well as the chairs of Board committees present a verbal report and
answer shareholders' questions at the annual meeting of the company.

A company's business operations and internal affairs must be discussed at annual
shareholder meetings. The quality of governance is an internal issue which
should be at the core of discussions at the annual meeting of shareholders. Poor
corporate governance has caused investors to lose billions of dollars in recent
years as a result of bankruptcy and fraud, which have had direct consequences
not only for the shareholders of those companies, but for the entire financial
community. Corporate governance is not just an ideal, a theoretical concept or a
question of ethics. It is also a matter of return for shareholders. The Board of
Directors is a fundamental component of the governance system of public
companies and plays a key role in decisions in this regard. It is the centre of
a chain of delegation which extends from the shareholders to the executive
officers. The Board's main responsibilities are to oversee the management of the
company on behalf of the shareholders, who have entrusted this mandate to it, to
make certain decisions (for example the hiring and compensation of executive
officers) and, in general, to identify conflicts of interest between executive
officers and shareholders and resolve them to the benefit of the shareholders.
In carrying out its mandate and discharging its responsibilities, the Board of
Directors entrusts some of these major issues to committees. By virtue of this
delegation of responsibility and the governance mandate, the management of the
company must report to the Board. By virtue of this same chain of delegation of
responsibility, the Board of Directors must report to the shareholders on the
way it carried out its duties in their name. The objective of this proposal is,
first, to strengthen the ties between the Board, its committees and the
shareholders and, second, to enable shareholders to judge the quality of
governance in the company. Its adoption would allow for shareholders to obtain
additional information on certain matters with respect to how the Board carries
out its mandate and enhance transparency in their favour."

POSITION OF THE BANK:
At all meetings of shareholders of the Bank, the President and Chief Executive
Officer reviews the previous year in detail and presents the Bank's objectives
and strategies for the future.

During the question period reserved for shareholders, the Chairman of the Board
and the President and Chief Executive Officer answer questions directly.
However, they frequently ask the chairs of Board committees or Officers to
provide information to the shareholders directly. Officers and committee chairs
will continue to answer questions from the shareholders and give them the
information requested. The Bank does not intend to change this practice.

Shareholders may also consult this Circular for information on the role,
responsibilities and activities of each of the Board committees.

For all these reasons, management recommends voting AGAINST this proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 3

PROPOSAL AND STATEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER:
"It is proposed that the company not grant the directors and executive officers
any personal loan other than in the normal course of business and at the regular
rate of interest.

These reduced-rate loans are granted for personal use (consumer purchases,
investments and other) and they are not always repaid. Companies have no reason
to grant such sinecures to executive officers and directors who are already very
highly paid. The practice of using personal loans to speculate on shares of
their own company combined with awards of large quantities of stock options has
encouraged abuse by officers and contributed to the recent financial scandals,
the sharp drop in stock prices as well as the erosion of investor confidence. A
number of companies have already announced that they intend to abolish these
programs, which in no way benefit the interests of shareholders."

POSITION OF THE BANK:
First, it should be noted that the directors do not benefit from reduced-rate
loans.

Reduced-rate loans, which are tools to retain employees, form part of the
benefits offered to all permanent Bank employees and, by the same token, of its
overall compensation policy.

The Bank regularly reviews the benefit programs that it offers to its employees.
A new program was recently introduced. The credit conditions offered to all
employees, including Officers, were standardized. All Bank employees will now be
subject to the same conditions and will benefit from the same rates with respect
to the loans granted, regardless of their position.

Management considers that it is not desirable to eliminate personal loans to
Officers. However, the management of the Bank is closely monitoring changes in
industry practices and regulations, and will obviously ensure that the latter
are respected.

For all these reasons, management recommends voting AGAINST this proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 4

PROPOSAL AND STATEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER:
"It is proposed that the Board of Directors create an ethics committee that is
responsible for ensuring that the company takes all the necessary means to
foster a corporate culture based on the highest ethical standards.

The events of the past few years have drawn attention to the moral decadence of
a sizeable fringe in the business world. Society and shareholders demand that
their companies adhere to ethical principles and demonstrate a high degree of
social conscience. It is not enough for a company to have adopted a code of
business conduct if such a code is not underpinned by mechanisms that encourage
compliance by all the personnel, and by control measures and sanctions for those
who fail to comply with it. Moreover, this code must be reviewed regularly to
reflect the new realities of society and the business world. Shareholders are
sounding the alarm, letting their company know that it must practice zero
tolerance when it comes to the issue of integrity and they want this message to
be clearly heard. To do this, they are asking that the Board of Directors create
a board committee that specifically addresses ethical matters. This committee
would be responsible for ensuring that management adopts measures to strengthen
an ethics-based corporate culture. It would be responsible for ensuring that a
strict code of conduct would be circulated at all levels of the company,
reviewed regularly and that efficient mechanisms would control its application.
Ethics and integrity are not simply theoretical concepts, they are criteria on
which clients, suppliers, creditors and investors increasingly base their
business decisions. Consequently, this proposal relates both to the company's
conduct and shareholder return."

POSITION OF THE BANK:
The Board of Directors and the management of the Bank pay close attention to all
matters related to integrity and ethics. The Conduct Review and Corporate
Governance Committee already assumes the responsibilities of an ethics
committee.

The Board has delegated responsibility for recommending orientations, policies
and practices in this area to this Committee. The Committee reviews and approves
the Code of Professional Conduct applicable to the directors, Officers and
employees of the Bank and its subsidiaries, and is responsible for ensuring that
it is respected.

The Board has also delegated to the Committee specific responsibility for
ensuring that legislation and regulations governing related party transactions
are respected as well as oversight of potential situations of conflict of
interest and the use of confidential information. Shareholders may also consult
this Circular in order to obtain more information about the role,
responsibilities and activities of this Committee.

For all these reasons, management recommends voting AGAINST this proposal.

SCHEDULE C

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The main duty of the Board of Directors ("the Board") is to oversee the
management of the Bank either directly or through its committees. The
responsibility of the Board is to protect the assets of the Bank, and to ensure
its viability, profitability, long-term survival and development. The Board
delegates some of its responsibilities to committees in order to increase its
effectiveness. The Board adopted a structure comprised of three standing
committees, namely, the Audit and Risk Management Committee, the Human Resources
Committee, and the Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee, and
approved the mandates thereof. The committees, through their respective chairs,
