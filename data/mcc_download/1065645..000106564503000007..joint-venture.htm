Each party shall contribute to this joint venture the considerations and contributions as are set forth in this Agreement, and each party shall make the capital contributions to the LLC as are set forth in the Operating Agreement. Promptly following the end of the Study Period, USH agrees to file the Articles of Organization for the LLC with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, at the cost of the LLC. For the considerations and on the terms set forth in this Agreement, SCC shall contribute the Property to this Joint Venture and to the LLC. The LLC will subdivide and develop the Project on the Property and will in turn sell finished lots to USH pursuant to a lot option contract, in form and substance approved by both SCC and USH prior to the end of the Study Period (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the &quot;Lot Contract&quot;). If the parties are unable to agree on the form of the Lot Contract prior to the end of the Study Period, in their reasonable discretion, then either party, by written notice to the other, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, whereupon neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder. If, prior to any such termination by either party' the parties agree on the form of the Lot Contract, this right to terminate shall be of no further force or effect. The parties acknowledge and agree that the purchase price for lots to be set forth in the Lot Contract shall be established at a sum equal to 120% of the LLC's cost of delivering finished lots (including, but not limited to, land costs as determined pursuant to Paragraph 7 (d) below, engineering costs incurred by the LLC and all costs of constructing improvements to the Property by the LLC). The Lot Contract will require that USH begin purchasing lots from the LLC on the date no later than the date that the lots are certified by the LLC to be fully subdivided and ready for the issuance of building permits pursuant to the Lot Contract. Thereafter, USH shall be required to purchase a minimum of sixty (60) lots per year pursuant to the Lot Contract, and the purchase price of the lots pursuant to the Lot Contract shall be subject to an escalator of 6% per annum, commencing on the date of the first lot takedown.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For purposes of the calculation of the purchase price under the Lot Contract, the LLC's costs of delivering finished lots shall also include, but shall not be limited to, all of the costs to: subdivide the Property from the larger parcel owned by SCC, obtain all permits and governmental approvals necessary to subdivide and develop the project, bond the development and construction of the infrastructure for the Project, furnish utilities to the lots in the Project, design and engineer the Project and the Project infrastructure, design and relocate the public right of way known as Demarr Road, design and relocate the private right of way on the Property used by the Demarr family and others, pay all interest carry due to the development loan lender on the Property, pay any applicable association fees or shortfall in the Association budget to the Project neighborhood association, pay the &quot;Assumed Value&quot; of the Property as provided in Section 7(d) herein (plus a 6% per annum escalation from January 1, 2003 until the initial lot purchase take down under the Lot Contract), pay the 3% management fee payable to SCC as provided in the LLC's Operating Agreement, pay a $t,500.00 per lot pump station contribution, pay a $6,000.00 per lot road fee, pay for the development and construction of a community recreation center and related facilities, and pay all and any other costs and expenses necessary for preparation, delivery and/or conveyance of the Lots under the Lot Contract and for all labor and materials for the work required by the Lot Contract. USH shall have the right to terminate this transaction if the total of said costs, plus 20%, would cause the purchase price of the Lots on the date of the initial take down to exceed the amounts set forth in Section 5(e)<I> </I>hereof. Such rights of termination on the part of USH shall be governed by the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Lot Contract shall require USH to place an earnest money deposit thereunder, upon execution of the Lot Contract, in the amount of $1,000,000.00 in good U.S. funds or by way of letter of credit issued by a recognized financial institution.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>DEPOSIT</U>. In the event USH elects not to terminate this Agreement at the conclusion of the Study Period, then within three (3) business days after the expiration of the Study Period, USH shall deliver to Walsh, Colucci, Stackhouse, Emrich &amp; Lubeley, P.C.

During the term of this Agreement, the Deposit, or parts thereof, shall be disbursed to SCC upon application by SCC to the Escrow Agent (the Escrow Agent being irrevocably authorized hereunder to make such disbursements upon application by SCC) to be applied to and to pay the costs and expenses incurred by SCC for the Approvals Costs as defined in Section 5<I> </I>below. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to verify the authenticity of any application made by SCC hereunder for disbursement of all or any part of the Deposit for the payment of any Approvals Costs.</P>

The Deposit and any such sums paid by SCC for the Approvals Costs shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum (which interest shall be paid by the LLC along with the reimbursement of said sums as aforesaid) from the date contributed to thc LLC and/or paid for the Approvals Costs until the date repaid. Such interest carry shall be repaid by the LLC to the respective parties prior to the disbursement of any profits or revenue to the parties by the LLC from the sale of Lots.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Closing, ownership of all such Approvals, and the engineering work related to such Approvals, shall be transferred to and thereafter owned by the LLC.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is understood and agreed that, because the Approvals will impact the Project well after Closing, it is critical to both USH and SCC that USH approve the terms and conditions of such Approvals, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. The process for SCC to obtain approval from USH as set forth above shall be as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;SCC shall provide USH with copies of all plans and documents generated during the Approvals process, prior to submission of such plans and documents to any public agency, body or entity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;USH shall review all such plans and documents and shall have a period of ten (10) days from the date such plans and documents are provided to USH to advise SCC, in writing, of any objections which USH has to such plans and documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;In the event USH does not advise SCC in writing of its objections to such plans and/or documents within such ten (10) day period, time being of the essence, USH shall be deemed to have approved such plans and/or documents in the form provided and SCC shall be entitled to rely upon such approval and proceed in accordance therewith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;In the event USH objects to such plans and/or documents, USH shall timely advise SCC of such objections, in writing and with specificity, and shall diligently work with SCC to resolve such objections in an expeditious manner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;Once such plans and/or documents have been approved for the Project, SCC and USH shall abide by, and shall cause the LLC to abide by, the terms and conditions of such Approvals, and shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any loss or damage the other shall experience due to its failure to do so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event that the Preliminary Plan approval for the Project yields fewer than 350 home sites, then in such event, either USH or SCC may terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15)<I> </I>days following such Preliminary Plan approval, and in such event the parties shall have no further rights and obligations hereunder and the Deposit, or any remaining part thereof, less any amount of the Deposit yet to be disbursed for any of the Approval Costs then unpaid, shall be returned to USH. SCC agrees to use its good faith best efforts to attempt to obtain Preliminary Plan approval for a minimum of 350 home sites within the Project.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event, following the preparation and approval of the final engineering for the first phase of development of the Project, the initial lot purchase price for the first phase of lots (the first approximately 100 Lots in the Project) pursuant to the Lot Contract based upon the Budget prepared by the LLC as set forth in the Operating Agreement, and based upon the purchase price parameters set forth in Section 1 above, is in excess of $67,000 per single family detached home site or $50,000 per single family attached home site, USH shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to SCC, and in such event the parties shall have no further rights and obligations hereunder and the Deposit, or any remaining part thereof, less any amount of the Deposit yet to be disbursed for any of the Approval Costs then unpaid, shall be returned to USH. To exercise this right of termination, USH shall provide written notice to SCC within ten (10) days following the date that the final engineering for the first phase of development of the Project has been agreed upon by SCC and USH as provided in this Section 5 and the engineer retained by SCC to prepare the same has given notice of its projected budget for the costs and expenses to complete the improvements so engineered.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>TITLE</U>. Prior to the expiration of the Study Period, USH may procure a commitment for title insurance in the name of the LLC covering the Property, issued by Stewart Title Insurance Company (the &quot;Title Company&quot;), together with legible copies of all recorded documents referenced therein and a special tax search (the &quot;Commitment&quot;), by which Commitment the Title Company shall agree to issue to the LLC, upon the Closing, a standard owner's ALTA policy in the amount of the value of the Property, as determined pursuant to Paragraph 7 below, without exception for any matters other than (i) current taxes; (ii) applicable zoning and governmental regulations; and (iii) easements and restrictions of record expressly approved by USH as a &quot;Permitted Exception&quot; hereunder, if any. USH shall have until the end of the Study Period to examine the Commitment and survey and to give written notice to SCC, or SCC's attorney, of its approval or disapproval in USH's sole discretion of any matter contained therein. 8CC shall have fifteen (15) days from the actual receipt of such notice of disapproval to elect whether it will cure the objections or defects so specified, and if SCC elects to cure the same, SCC will have a reasonable time and shall use reasonable diligence to cure same. If SCC elects not to cure the same, or if SCC elects to cure but after the exercise of reasonable diligence, SCC is unable to correct such objections or defects to USH's satisfaction in USH's sole discretion, USH shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to receive the return of the Deposit, or the remaining balance thereof (less any portion of the Approvals Costs then remaining unpaid), or to waive such objections or defects in writing. Any such defect or objection waived in writing shall become a &quot;Permitted Exception&quot; to title. The Commitment shall be updated by the Title Company, at USH's expense, prior to the Closing Date. Any title exception, other than a prior Permitted Exception hereunder shall be treated as a title defect hereunder, except those placed on the Property in connection with the Project.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;A copy of the Operating Agreement, executed by USH;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>USH'S DEFAULT</U>.

If any such failure continues beyond such cure period, the sole and exclusive remedy of SCC shall be to terminate this Agreement thereby extinguishing USH's rights hereunder and USH shall forfeit the Deposit (or the remaining balance thereof) as the agreed upon liquidated damages. SCC expressly waives any other remedy at law or in equity against USH.

It is acknowledged that USE shall have no personal liability of any kind or nature hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;To seek specific performance of SCC's obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USH expressly waives any other remedies at law or in equity against SCC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Encumbrance of Property</U>. SCC shall not cause or permit any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, encumbrance, covenant, condition, restriction, assessment, easement, right-of-way, obligation, encroachment or liability (&quot;title defect&quot;) whatsoever, to be placed of record, affect the title insurance to be given to the LLC pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise exist, from the Effective Date to the date of termination of this Agreement, excepting, however, such title exceptions as are specifically permitted under this Agreement and those which have been specifically approved in writing by USH. If any title defects are so placed of record, or otherwise exist contrary to the provisions hereof, the effect of which can be removed and/or eliminated by the payment of money, Settlement Agent is hereby expressly authorized, directed and instructed to pay such monies at close of escrow from the monies otherwise payable to SCC at Closing and the net proceeds available to SCC at Closing shall be reduced accordingly. To the extent that monies available to SCC at Closing are insufficient to cause said title exception(s) to be removed, SCC shall immediately cause sufficient additional monies to be deposited with Settlement Agent so as to enable Settlement Agent to cause said title exception(s) to be eliminated and/or removed of record.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Natural Amenities</U>. SCC acknowledges that the natural amenities of the Property constitute a material inducement to USE for entering into this Agreement and, therefore, SCC agrees to maintain the natural amenities, specifically, the tree canopy and rolling contour of the land, and soil, in its natural condition prior to Closing. SCC further agrees not to cut, clear, excavate, fill, dump or dispose of any materials, or engage in any development activity of any kind on the Property (except as specifically required hereunder and necessary and/or appropriate for the Project) during the pendency of this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Further Assurances</U>. Upon request by USH, SCC shall provide reasonable assurances as necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of SCC's affirmative covenants herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Assessments</U>. Any assessment, special or otherwise, imposed on the Property prior to the date of Closing shall be the obligation of SCC and shall be paid in full on or before Closing, except any assessment associated with the Project and any matter set forth in a Permitted Exception. Notwithstanding the above, the LLC shall be liable for any fees for water and sewer allocations, user fees, and impact fees for the Property.</P>
