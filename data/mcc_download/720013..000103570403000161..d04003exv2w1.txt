                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger is entered into on March 12, 2003, by
and among Colorado MEDtech, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the "COMPANY"), CIVCO
Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BUYER"), and CMT Mergerco, Inc., a
Colorado corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("BUYER SUBSIDIARY"
and, together with the Company, sometimes referred to as the "CONSTITUENT
CORPORATION").

                                    RECITALS

         Buyer desires to acquire the Company by effecting a merger (the
"MERGER") of Buyer Subsidiary with and into the Company under the terms hereof,
whereby each Company shareholder ("COMPANY SHAREHOLDER") will receive cash for
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company owned by such
shareholder.

         The Board of Directors of each of the Constituent Corporations deems
the Merger desirable and in the best interests of the shareholders of the
respective Constituent Corporations.

                                    AGREEMENT

         Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

         1.01 MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Colorado Business
Corporation Act (the "COLORADO ACT"), Buyer Subsidiary shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Buyer Subsidiary shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). At the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the other effects provided in the applicable
provisions of the Colorado Act.

         1.02 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to, and promptly following
(but not more than one business day after (unless the Company and Buyer shall
otherwise mutually agree)), the receipt of the vote of the shareholders of the
Company approving this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article V of this
Agreement, the Company and Buyer Subsidiary shall execute in the manner required
by the Colorado Act and deliver for filing to the Secretary of State of the
State of Colorado articles of merger with respect to the Merger ("ARTICLES OF
MERGER"). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Colorado Secretary of State in accordance with Section 7-111-105
of the Colorado Act. The term "EFFECTIVE TIME" means the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective.


<PAGE>

         1.03 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION. The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer Subsidiary in effect
immediately before the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the laws of the
State of Colorado and such Articles of Incorporation. The By-Laws of Buyer
Subsidiary in effect immediately before the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the laws
of the State of Colorado, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and such By-Laws.

         1.04 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The
directors of Buyer Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of such directors to hold office,
subject to the applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, until the expiration of the term for which
such director was elected and until his or her successor is elected and has
qualified or as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Buyer Subsidiary immediately
before the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are chosen and have qualified or as otherwise
provided in the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.05 CONVERSION OF SHARES. The manner and basis of converting or
canceling the shares of stock of each of the Constituent Corporations shall be
as follows:

                  (a) The aggregate purchase price ("PURCHASE PRICE") to be paid
         by Buyer as consideration for consummation of the Merger shall equal
         (i) $62,500,000, plus (ii) an amount equal to the cash on hand at the
         Company and at CIVCO (as defined in Section 3.01(a)) as of the
         Effective Time, less (iii) the "Agreed Liabilities" (as defined in (b)
         below).

                  (b) As used in this Section 1.05, "Agreed Liabilities" means
         the aggregate of (i) all existing obligations and contingent
         obligations of the Company and CIVCO as of the Effective Time other
         than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of CIVCO's business
         under the following five (5) categories: accounts payable, accrued
         expenses, accrued warranty, accrued salaries and wages (including
         obligations of CIVCO under the "CIVCO Incentive Compensation Program FY
         2003") and any payments due under that certain Stock Purchase Agreement
         dated February 7, 2002 by and among CIVCO Medical Instruments, Co.,
         Inc., the Company, Winston E. Barzell and Willet F. Whitmore III, and
         (ii) the amount by which the working capital balance of CIVCO (defined
         for purposes of this Section 1.05(b) as accounts receivable (net), plus
         inventory and prepaid expenses (other), less accounts payable, accrued
         expenses, accrued warranty and accrued salaries and wages) as of the
         Effective Time is less than $4,200,000.

                  (c) The Company and Buyer agree that they shall jointly
         determine the amount of cash on hand for purposes of Section 1.05(a)
         and the aggregate Agreed Liabilities no later than one business day
         prior to the Effective Time. The methodology for calculating the Agreed
         Liabilities shall be substantially the same as used for calculating the
         pro forma balance sheet of the Company acknowledged by each of the
         Company and Buyer and delivered by the Company and Buyer to each other
         as of the date hereof, which



                                       2
<PAGE>


         acknowledgments reference this Section 5.01(c), it being understood
         that such pro forma balance sheet is for providing an example of such
         methodology only and does not include all liabilities, including
         contingent liabilities, that may be included in the Agreed Liabilities
         as of the Effective Time. If the Company and Buyer are unable to agree
         prior to the day of the Effective Time on the Agreed Liabilities that
         would be required to be accrued as of the Effective Time in accordance
         with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP Agreed
         Liabilities"), the Company and Buyer agree that (i) the Effective Time
         shall be delayed for a period of ten (10) business days; (ii) the
         Company and Buyer shall engage KPMG LLP to determine the GAAP Agreed
         Liabilities. In such event, the Company and Buyer shall require KPMG
         LLP to finally determine the GAAP Agreed Liabilities within the
         foregoing ten-business day period, which determination shall be final
         and binding on the parties hereto for all purposes of this Agreement.

                  (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of the
         Company, no par value per share ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), issued and
         outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than (i)
         Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and (ii) shares of Company Common
         Stock held of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct
         or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or the Company immediately
         before the Effective Time) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
         any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
         represent the right to receive a per share amount in cash determined by
         dividing (i) the Purchase Price by (ii) the number of shares of Company
         Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (the "MERGER
         CONSIDERATION"), without interest.

                  (e) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Buyer
         Subsidiary, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding
         immediately before the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
         and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
         into and exchanged for one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
         Stock of the Surviving Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON
         STOCK"), which shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares
         of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
         Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding
         certificate theretofore representing shares of Common Stock of Buyer
         Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership and
         to represent the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
         Stock.

                  (f) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
         held of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct or
         indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or the Company immediately
         before the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
         any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and cease to
         exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

         1.06 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

                  (a) Notwithstanding Section 1.05 hereof, shares of Company
         Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
         Time, if any, that are held of record or beneficially owned by a person
         who has properly exercised and preserved and



                                       3
<PAGE>

         perfected dissenters' rights with respect to such shares under Sections
         7-113-202 and 7-113-204 of the Colorado Act and has not withdrawn or
         lost such rights ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or
         represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
         shares, but instead shall be treated in accordance with Section
         7-113-206 of the Colorado Act unless and until such person effectively
         withdraws or loses such person's right to payment under Article 113 of
         the Colorado Act (through failure to preserve or protect such right or
         otherwise). If, after the Effective Time, any such person shall
         effectively withdraw or lose such right, then each such Dissenting
         Share held of record or beneficially owned by such person will
         thereupon be treated as if it had been converted into, at the Effective
         Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

                  (b) Each person holding of record or beneficially owning
         Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, under the provisions of
         Sections 7-113-202 and 7-113-204 of the Colorado Act, to payment of the
         fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor
         (plus interest determined in accordance with Section 7-113-101(5) of
         the Colorado Act) from the Surviving Corporation and/or from the
         Disbursing Agent referred to below on behalf of the Surviving
         Corporation under such provisions.

                  (c) The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice upon receipt by
         the Company at any time before the Effective Time of any notice of
         intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock
         under Section 7-113-202 of the Colorado Act and any withdrawal of any
         such notice. The Company will not, except with the prior written
         consent of Buyer, negotiate, voluntarily make any payment with respect
         to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand at any time before
         the Effective Time.

         1.07 STOCK OPTIONS. Immediately before the Effective Time, each holder
of a then-outstanding option or warrant (collectively, the "OPTIONS" and
individually, an "OPTION") to purchase shares of Company Common Stock heretofore
granted under any employee stock option or compensation plan of, or other
arrangement with, the Company shall be entitled (whether or not such Option is
then exercisable) to receive in cancellation of such Option, a cash payment from
the Company in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the per-share exercise price of such Option, multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Option (the
"OPTION SETTLEMENT AMOUNT"), without interest, but subject to all required tax
withholdings by the Company. All Options shall terminate as of the Effective
Time.

         1.08 PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

                  (a) Immediately before the Effective Time, Buyer or Buyer
         Subsidiary shall deposit or cause to be deposited in immediately
         available funds with Key Bank (acting with Corporate Stock Transfer) as
         disbursing agent or any other disbursing agent having capital, surplus
         and undivided profits exceeding $500 million that is selected by Buyer
         and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "DISBURSING AGENT"),
         cash in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (such amount being
         referred to as the "FUND").



                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (b)

                          (i) At or before the Effective Time, Buyer shall
                  deliver irrevocable written instructions to the Disbursing
                  Agent in form and in substance reasonably satisfactory to the
                  Company to make, out of the Fund, the payments referred to in
                  Section 1.05(a) in accordance with Section 1.08(c). The Fund
                  shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in
                  this Agreement.

                          (ii) In addition, if, after the Effective Time, any
                  person holding of record or beneficially owning Dissenting
                  Shares shall become entitled to receive payment for such
                  Dissenting Shares under Sections 7-113-202 and 7-113-204 of
                  the Colorado Act, Buyer shall deliver irrevocable written
                  instructions to the Disbursing Agent to pay either to such
                  person or to the Surviving Corporation the amount to which
                  such person is entitled, provided that the payment from the
                  Fund with respect to any Dissenting Share shall not exceed the
                  Merger Consideration, and provided further that such
                  instructions shall, if sums are to be paid to the Surviving
                  Corporation, be accompanied by a certificate of the Surviving
                  Corporation that any sums so paid shall be remitted by the
                  Surviving Corporation to the shareholder or beneficial owner
                  entitled thereto in accordance with Section 7-113-206 of the
                  Colorado Act.

                          (iii) Any amount remaining in the Fund one year after
                  the Closing Date (as defined below) may be refunded to the
                  Surviving Corporation, at its option; provided, however, that
                  the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be liable for any
                  payments required to be made thereafter under Section 1.05(a)
                  hereof or Section 7-113-206 of the Colorado Act.

                  (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
         Disbursing Agent shall mail to each holder of record (other than Buyer
         or Buyer Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
         subsidiary of Buyer or the Company) of a certificate or certificates
         that, immediately before the Effective Time, represented issued and
         outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
         Shares) a letter of transmittal for return to the Disbursing Agent, and
         instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such certificate or
         certificates and the receipt of cash for each of such holder's shares
         of Company Common Stock under Section 1.05(a). The Disbursing Agent, as
         soon as practicable following receipt of any such certificate or
         certificates together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
         any other items specified in the letter of transmittal, shall pay by

         (subject to any required withholding of taxes by the Surviving
         Corporation) the amount (rounded up or down to the nearest $0.01)
         determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
         represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered by the
         Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
         payable upon the surrender or any such certificate or certificates.

                  (d) If any such certificate or certificates shall have been
         lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
         by the person claiming such

         certificate or certificates to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
         amount to which such person would have been entitled upon presentation
         of such certificate or certificates.

Section 1.06 hereof if such holder has validly exercised and not withdrawn or
lost such right, and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         3.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as otherwise
set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Buyer
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE") or as otherwise described



                                       6
<PAGE>

in the SEC Reports (as defined below) filed before the date of this Agreement,
the Company represents and warrants to Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary as follows:

                  (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING, QUALIFICATION. The Company and
         each of the corporations listed in the Disclosure Schedule under the
         heading "Subsidiaries" (collectively, the "SUBSIDIARIES" and
         individually, a "SUBSIDIARY") is a corporation duly incorporated,
         validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
         jurisdiction of its incorporation (as identified in Schedule 3.01(a) of
         the Disclosure Schedule) and has the requisite corporate power and
         corporate authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets
         and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
         corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
         jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or
         leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such qualification
         or licensing necessary, except such jurisdictions where failure to be
         so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not have, individually
         or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the business,
         operations, properties or financial condition of the Company or of
         CIVCO Medical Instruments Co., Inc., an Iowa corporation, and its
         subsidiary Barzell Whitmore Maroon Bells, Inc., a Florida corporation
         (together, "CIVCO") (a "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"). The copies of the
         Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws or similar
         organizational documents of the Company and each Subsidiary provided to
         Buyer are complete and correct as of the date of this Agreement.

                  (b) CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the
         Company consists of Twenty-Five Million (25,000,000) shares of Company
         Common Stock, no par value, of which, as of the date of this Agreement,
         13,256,959 shares are issued and outstanding, and Five Million
         (5,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, no par value, none of which, as
         of the date of this Agreement is issued and outstanding. All of the
         issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and of
         each Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
         paid and nonassessable and were not granted in violation of any
         statutory or contractual preemptive rights. There are no outstanding
         subscriptions, options, warrants, calls or other agreements or
         commitments under which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become
         obligated to issue, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or
         purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of,
         or other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary, and there
         are no outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
         such capital stock or other equity interests, except for (i) Options to
         purchase up to 1,654,660 shares of Company Common Stock (as of the date
         of this Agreement) at the exercise prices set forth in Schedule 3.01(b)
         of the Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) the Rights Agreement dated as of
         January 14, 1999, as amended, between the Company and American Stock
         Transfer and Trust Inc. (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") under which each
         outstanding share of Company Common Stock has attached to it certain
         rights (the "RIGHTS"), including rights under certain circumstances to
         purchase a fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating
         Preferred Stock at $55 per right, subject to adjustment. The Company
         owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares
         of capital stock of every class of each Subsidiary, free and clear of
         all liens, security interests, pledges, charges and other encumbrances.
         Schedule 3.01(b) of



                                       7
<PAGE>

         the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list of each
         corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture or
         other business association in which the Company has any direct or
         indirect equity ownership interest.

                  (c) AUTHORIZATION AND EXECUTION. The Company has the corporate
         power and corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
         and, subject to approval by the holders of the Company Common Stock at
         the special meeting of shareholders referred to in Section 4.02, to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
         delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company have been
         duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no
         further corporate action of the Company, other than the approval of its
         shareholders, is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
         hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
         Company and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
         warranties set forth in Section 3.02, constitutes the legal, valid and
         binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
         accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may
         be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
         affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and subject,
         as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of
         whether enforcement is sought in a court of law or equity).

                  (d) NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the Company of the
         transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) conflict with or result in a
         breach of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws or
         similar organizational documents, as currently in effect, of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) except for the requirements
         under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
         amended (the "HSR ACT"), compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of
         1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT") and the filing of the Articles of
         Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado, require
         any filing with, or consent or approval of, any governmental authority
         having jurisdiction over any of the business or assets of the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate any statute, law, ordinance,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         or any injunction, judgment, order, writ or decree to which the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries has been specifically identified as subject,
         or (iv) result in a breach of, or constitute a default or an event
         that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
         constitute a default, give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
         or acceleration, create any entitlement of any third party to any
         material payment or benefit, require the consent of any third party, or
         result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or
         encumbrance on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
         under any Material Contract (as defined below), except, in the case of
         clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), where such violation, breach, default,
         termination, cancellation, acceleration, payment, benefit or lien, or
         the failure to make such filing or obtain such consent or approval,
         would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the
         ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement or have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) SEC REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO UNDISCLOSED
         LIABILITIES.

                           (i) The Company has made available to Buyer or its
                  counsel, in the form filed with the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission (the "SEC"), all reports, registration statements,
                  and other filings (including amendments to previously filed
                  documents) filed by the Company with the SEC since July 1,
                  1999 (all such reports, proxy statements, registration
                  statements and filings, other than the Proxy Statement (as
                  defined below), are collectively called the "SEC REPORTS" and
                  individually called an "SEC REPORT"). No SEC Report, as of its
                  filing date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
                  or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
                  therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
                  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
                  were made, not misleading, and each SEC Report at the time of
                  its filing complied in all material respects with all
                  applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
                  amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), the Exchange Act, and the
                  rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Since
                  July 1, 1999, the Company has filed all reports that it was
                  required to file with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the
                  rules and regulations of the SEC.

                           (ii) The consolidated financial statements contained
                  in the SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with generally
                  accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
                  throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
                  the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated
                  financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at
                  the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
                  operations and consolidated cash flows of the Company and its
                  Subsidiaries for the periods indicated, subject, in the case
                  of interim financial statements, to normal year-end
                  adjustments, and except that the interim financial statements
                  do not contain all of the footnote disclosures required by
                  generally accepted accounting principles.

                           (iii) Except as and to the extent reflected or
                  reserved against on the most recent balance sheet contained in
                  the SEC Reports (the "BALANCE SHEET"), neither the Company nor
                  any of its Subsidiaries or as otherwise disclosed on Schedule
                  3.01(e) of the Disclosure Schedule have any material
                  obligations or liabilities of any nature that would have been
                  required to be included on a balance sheet prepared in
                  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in
                  effect on such date; other than current liabilities incurred
                  in the ordinary course of business.

                           (iv) The Company has also made available to Buyer the
                  unaudited balance sheet, income statement and statement of
                  cash flows of CIVCO (the "CIVCO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") as of
                  January 31, 2003. The CIVCO Financial Statements were prepared
                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
                  applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
                  (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
                  present the financial condition of CIVCO at the date thereof
                  and the results of operations and cash flows of CIVCO

<PAGE>

                  for the periods indicated, except that interim financial
                  statements do not contain all of the footnote disclosures
                  required by generally accepted accounting principles.

                  (f) PROXY STATEMENT. The Proxy Statement will not, at the time
         the Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of the Company,
         contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
         make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
         they were made, not misleading, and will not, at the time of the
         meeting of shareholders to which the Proxy Statement relates or at the
         Effective Time, as then amended or supplemented, omit to state any
         material fact necessary to correct any statement which has become false
         or misleading in any earlier communication with respect to the
         solicitation of any proxy for such meeting (except that no
         representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made
         in, or incorporated by reference into, the Proxy Statement based on
         information furnished by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary for inclusion in the
         Proxy Statement).

                  (g) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since December 31,
         2002, and except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 3.01(g) of the
         Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
         their respective businesses and operations in the ordinary course and
         neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) split, combined
         or reclassified any shares of its capital stock or made any other
         changes in its equity capital structure; (ii) purchased, redeemed or
         otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, any shares of its capital
         stock or any options, rights or warrants to purchase any such capital
         stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such
         capital stock; (iii) declared, set aside or paid any dividend or made
         any other distribution in respect of shares of its capital stock,
         except for dividends or distributions by any Subsidiary to the Company
         or another Subsidiary; (iv) issued any shares of its capital stock or
         granted any options, rights or warrants to purchase any such capital
         stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such

         upon the exercise of Options; (v) purchased any business, purchased any
         stock of any corporation other than the Company, or merged or
         consolidated with any person; (vi) sold, leased or otherwise disposed

         satisfied any liability or obligation other than the payment,

         and payable or liabilities and obligations in the ordinary course of
         business consistent with past practice; (xi) made any change in the
         compensation payable or to become payable to any of the Company's or
         its Subsidiaries' officers, employees, agents or consultants, other

         or (xiv) suffered any business interruption, damage to or destruction
         of its properties or other incident, occurrence or event (other than

         economic and market conditions) that has had or would reasonably be
         expected to have (after giving effect to insurance coverage) a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  (h) TAX MATTERS.

                           (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely
                  filed (or received appropriate extensions of time to file) all
                  federal, state, local and foreign tax returns (collectively,
                  "TAX RETURNS") required to be filed by them with respect to
                  income, gross receipts, withholding, social security,
                  unemployment, payroll, franchise, property, excise, sales, use
                  and other taxes of whatever kind (collectively, "TAXES"). All
                  such Tax Returns were and will through the Effective Time be
                  prepared in compliance with applicable law and all Taxes due,
                  or claimed to be due by any taxing authority, pursuant thereto
                  (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Return) have been or
                  will be paid. In addition, all Taxes due or claimed to be due
                  by any taxing authority (whether or not shown on any Tax
                  Return), prior to or at the Effective Time for which the
                  Company may be liable in its own right or as a transferee of
                  the assets of, or successor to, any corporation, person,
                  association, partnership, joint venture or other entity, have
                  been, or will be, paid on a timely basis, or an adequate
                  reserve has been, or will be, established therefor. Neither
                  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the
                  beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
                  Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a
                  jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries do
                  not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that
                  jurisdiction. There are no security interests on any of the
                  assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose in
                  connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any
                  Tax.

                           (ii) No Tax Returns filed by the Company or any of
                  its Subsidiaries are the subject of pending audits as of the
                  date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
                  Subsidiaries has received, before the date of this Agreement,
                  a notice of deficiency or assessment of additional Taxes which
                  notice or assessment remains unresolved, and to the knowledge
                  of the Company, there is no basis for any such deficiency or
                  assessment. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has extended the period for assessment or payment of any Tax,
                  which has not since expired.

                           (iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have withheld
                  and paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities all
                  Taxes required by law to have been withheld and paid in
                  connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, except
                  for any such Taxes that are immaterial in amount and except
                  for self-reported employee tips.

                           (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has been a member of an affiliated group (as such term is
                  defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue

                  Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE")) or any combined,
                  consolidated or similar group under any state, local, or
                  foreign Tax law, filing a consolidated federal income tax
                  return for any tax year since January 1, 1996 other than a
                  group the common parent of which was the Company.

                           (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has been a United States real property holding corporation
                  within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the
                  applicable period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

                           (vi) The Company has disclosed on its respective
                  income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give
                  rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax
                  within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. The Company is
                  not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.
                  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, (i) is or has
                  ever been a partner in a partnership or an owner of an
                  interest in an entity treated as a partnership for federal
                  income tax purposes, (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of
                  any Person under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
                  provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
                  successor, by contract or otherwise, or (iii) made an election
                  or filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed
                  to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition
                  of a Section 341(f) asset (as such term is defined in Section
                  341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by any Company.

                           (vii) The unpaid Taxes of the Company (i) did not, as
                  of December 31, 2002, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
                  (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes, established to
                  reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
                  forth on the face of the balance sheets in the financial
                  statements of the Company (rather than in any notes thereto),
                  and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
                  passage of time through the Effective Time in accordance with
                  the past custom and practice of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in filing their respective Tax Returns.

                           (viii) Neither the Company nor any of its
                  Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
                  agreement other than between the Company and the Subsidiaries.

                           (ix) The Company has delivered or made available to
                  the Buyer true and complete copies of all requested federal,
                  state, local and foreign income tax returns with respect to
                  the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

                           (x) There is no contract, agreement, plan or
                  arrangement covering any employee or former employee of the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or
                  collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
                  that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

                           (xi) The Company realized an ordinary loss of
                  $9,700,000 on the sale of certain assets to HEI, Inc. that
                  occurred on January 24, 2003. The net operating loss
                  carryforward for federal income tax purposes under Section 172
                  of the Code that will be available as a carryforward from the
                  period ending June 30, 2003 to future taxable periods will be
                  no less than $6 million.

                          (i) Schedule 3.01(i) of the Disclosure Schedule lists
                  all real property owned in fee by the Company or any
                  Subsidiary ("OWNED PROPERTY") and all real property leased or
                  subleased to the Company or any Subsidiary ("LEASED PROPERTY,"
                  and, together with the Owned Property, the "REAL PROPERTY").

                          (ii) One or more of the Company and its Subsidiaries
                  has good and valid title to all such Owned Property, free and
                  clear of all mortgages, liens, security interests, charges and
                  encumbrances, except (a) liens for taxes, assessments and
                  other governmental charges that are not due and payable or
                  that are being contested in good faith and in respect of which
                  adequate reserves have been established, (b) mechanics',
                  materialmen's, carriers', workmen's, warehousemen's,
                  repairmen's, landlord's or other similar liens securing
                  obligations that are not due and payable or that are being
                  contested in good faith and in respect of adequate reserves
                  have been established, (c) mortgages, liens, security
                  interests, charges and encumbrances evidenced by any lease,

                  Schedule or in the SEC Reports filed before the date of this
                  Agreement, (d) imperfections of title and liens, charges and
                  encumbrances that do not materially detract from the value or
                  materially interfere with the present use of the properties
                  subject thereto or affected thereby, (e) in the case of any

                  encumbrances described in the Disclosure Schedule or in the

                  right to use, all of their other tangible properties and
                  assets necessary to conduct their respective businesses as

                  of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not received
                  notice of an existing zoning violation or of any pending or
                  threatened condemnation proceeding or of any sale or other
                  disposition in lieu of condemnation, affecting any of the
                  Owned Property.

                          (iii) With respect to Leased Property, Schedule

                  rental rate, lease term, expiration date and existence of a
                  renewal option. The Company has made available to Buyer prior
                  to the date of the Agreement correct and complete copies of
                  the leases and subleases listed in Schedule 3.01(i) of the
                  Disclosure Schedule, as such leases or subleases have been
                  amended to date. With respect to each lease and sublease
                  listed, except as otherwise indicated in Schedule 3.01(i) of
                  the Disclosure Schedule, (w) the lease or sublease is in full

                  Company nor its Subsidiaries have received written notice of
                  acceleration,



                                       13

                  modification, breach or default, and, to the knowledge of the
                  Company, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of
                  time, would constitute a material breach or default or permit
                  termination, modification or acceleration under such lease or
                  subleased; (z) to the knowledge of the Company, all such
                  facilities leased or subleased have all requisite permits to
                  allow the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to operate its
                  business thereon as presently conducted.

                  (j) MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Except as set forth in Schedule
         3.01(j) of the Disclosure Schedule or in the SEC Reports filed before
         the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any:

                           (ii) lease, whether as lessor or lessee, with respect
                  to any real property;

                           (iii) contract, whether as licensor or licensee, for
                  the license of any patent, know-how, trademark, trade name,

                  non-negotiated licenses of commercially available computer
                  software);

                           (iv) loan or guaranty agreement, indenture or other
                  instrument, contract or agreement under which any money has
                  been borrowed or loaned or any note, bond or other evidence of
                  indebtedness has been issued;

                           (v) mortgage, security agreement, conditional sales
                  contract, capital lease or similar agreement which effectively
                  creates a lien on any assets of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries (other than any conditional sales contract,
                  capital lease or similar agreement which creates a lien only
                  on tangible personal property);

                           (vi) contract restricting the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in any material respect from engaging in business
                  or from competing with any other parties;

                           (vii) plan of reorganization;

                           (viii) partnership or joint venture agreement;

                           (ix) collective bargaining agreement; or

                           (x) any purchase, sale, or supply contract for goods
                  or services with a value of 10% or more of the Company's or
                  any of its Subsidiaries' revenues.

         All of the foregoing are collectively called "MATERIAL CONTRACTS." To
         the extent Material Contracts are evidenced by documents, true and
         complete copies thereof have been delivered or made available to Buyer
         or Buyer's counsel. Each Material Contract is in full force and effect.
         Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge
         of the Company, any other party is in breach of or in default under any
         of the Material Contracts, except for



                                       14
<PAGE>

         breaches or defaults which have not had and would not reasonably be
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                  (k) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" shall mean
         all intellectual property rights, including all patents and patent
         applications, together with all reissuances, continuations,

                  contains a complete and correct list of all material patents

                  and service marks (collectively, "PROPRIETARY RIGHTS"), held
                  by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

                          (ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.01(k) of the
                  Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries

                  material to the conduct of its business as conducted as of the
                  Effective Time. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.01(k) of the

                  Subsidiaries is currently listed in the records of the
                  appropriate federal, state or local agency as the sole owner

                  to which the Company and its Subsidiaries have any right,
                  title or interest.

                          (iv) Schedule 3.01(k) of the Disclosure Schedule sets

                  off-the-shelf applications or software licensed pursuant to a
                  "shrink-wrap" license. The Licenses are valid and binding
                  obligations of the Company party thereto and to the knowledge
                  of the Company, the other parties thereto, enforceable against
                  the Company or Subsidiary party thereto and, to the knowledge
                  of the Company, the other parties thereto, in accordance with
                  their terms, and there are no breaches or defaults under any
                  License by the Company party thereto, or, to the knowledge of
                  the Company, by the other party thereto, nor has any event
                  occurred which with notice or lapse of time would constitute a
                  breach or default by the Company or Subsidiary party thereto,

                  force and effect on identical terms following the consummation
                  of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its
                  Subsidiaries have not granted any sublicense or similar right
                  with respect to any License.

                  which is material to the business of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries as currently operated has been disclosed or
                  authorized to be disclosed to any third party, other than
                  pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement that protects the
                  Company and each of its Subsidiaries' proprietary interests in
                  and to such trade secrets and confidential know-how.

                          (vi) The conduct of the business of the Company and
                  each of its Subsidiaries does not interfere with, infringe
                  upon or misappropriate any intellectual property right owned
                  or controlled by any third party, nor, to the knowledge of the

                  with, infringe upon or misappropriate any intellectual
                  property right owned or controlled by any third party as a
                  result of the continued operation of their respective
                  businesses as conducted as of the Effective Time. To the
                  knowledge of the Company, no third party is interfering with,

                  owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no such
                  claims have been made against a third party by the Company or
                  any of its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on Schedule
                  3.01(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no claims or
                  suits pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
                  and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has not received
                  any written notice of a third party demand, claim or suit (a)
                  alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries'
                  activities or the conduct of their respective businesses
                  infringe or infringed upon or constitutes or constituted the
                  unauthorized use of the proprietary rights of any third party
                  or (b) Intellectual Property rights used in the business of
                  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the
                  Effective Time, or in or to which the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries have any right, title or interest.

                          (vii) It is the Company's policy to have all employees
                  and consultants of the Company who are at any time involved in

                  agreement assigning to the Company or its Subsidiaries their

                  arising from services performed for the Company or its
                  Subsidiaries by such persons. To the knowledge of the Company,
                  all present and former employees and consultants have executed
                  and delivered such agreements to the Company. No present or
                  former officer, director, employee or consultant of the
                  Company or of any of its Subsidiaries has any right, title or
                  interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or
                  to any material Intellectual Property used in the business of
                  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the
                  Effective Time, or in or to which the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries has any right, title or interest.

                   (l) LITIGATION. Except as described in Schedule 3.01(l) of
         the Disclosure Schedule or in the SEC Reports filed before the date of
         this Agreement, no claim, demand, order, notice of potential
         responsibility, government information request, litigation, arbitration
         or administrative proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the
         Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or that seeks
         to enjoin or otherwise challenges the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
         neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is specifically
         identified as a party subject to any material restrictions or
         limitations under any injunction, writ, judgment, order or decree of
         any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
         authority.

                  (m) PERMITS, LICENSES, AUTHORIZATIONS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
         Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all licenses, franchises,
         permits and other governmental authorizations ("PERMITS") necessary to
         conduct its business, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
         violation of or has violated or has any liability pursuant to any
         Permit, except where the failure to have any such Permits, or the
         existence or past occurrence of any such violation, has not had and
         would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule
         3.01(m) of the Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries is, and has been at all times since January 1, 1998, in

         business or the ownership or use of any of its assets (each, a "LEGAL
         REQUIREMENT"). Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.01(m) of the
         Disclosure Schedule, no event has occurred or circumstances exist that
         (with or without the lapse of time) may constitute or result in a
         violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, or a failure on
         the part the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with, any
         Legal Requirement. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.01(m) of the
         Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
         has received, at any time since January 1, 1998, any written notice
         regarding any actual, alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or
         failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement. A true and complete list
         of all Permits is set out on Schedule 3.01(m) of the Disclosure
         Schedule. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice
         that any Permit will be suspended or revoked or will not be renewed.

                  (n) NO BROKERS OR FINDERS. Except for Tri-Artisan, LLC, the
         Company has not engaged any investment banker, broker or finder in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving
         Corporation shall be liable for all obligations of the Company under
         its engagement letter with Tri-Artisan, LLC.

                  any Subsidiary currently contributes or is under any current
                  obligation to contribute, or under which the Company or any
                  Subsidiary has any current liability (collectively, the

                  by it under the terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code
                  or other applicable laws, unless such contributions or
                  payments that have not been made are immaterial in amount and
                  the failure to make such payments or contributions will not
                  materially and adversely affect the Employee Plans.

                  governmental agency with respect to each Employee Plan have
                  been timely filed.

                           (iv) There is no material litigation, arbitration or
                  administrative proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
                  Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or,

                  liability with respect to any plan, program or arrangement
                  maintained or contributed to by any ERISA Affiliate that would
                  be an Employee Plan if it were maintained by the Company.

                           (vii) For purposes of this Section 3.01(o), "ERISA

                  Buyer is accurate and complete.

                          (iv) None of the real property currently owned,
                  operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
                  contains any underground improvements used currently or in the
                  past for the management of Hazardous Substances, and no
                  portion of such property is or has been used as a dump or
                  landfill or consists of or contains filled in land or
                  wetlands. With respect to any real property formerly owned,
                  operated, or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries, during
                  the period

                  of such ownership, operation or tenancy, no portion of such
                  property was used as a dump or landfill, and the Company is
                  not aware of any such use at any time prior to its ownership,
                  operation, or tenancy of such real property. Neither PCBs, nor
                  "toxic mold," nor asbestos-containing materials are present on
                  or in the real property currently owned, operated or leased by
                  the Company or its Subsidiaries.

                  (q) INSURANCE. Schedule 3.01(q) of the Disclosure Schedule
         contains a list of all insurance policies maintained by the Company and
         its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, together with a
         brief description of the coverages afforded thereby. All of such
         insurance policies are in full force and effect as of the date of this
         Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
         default of any payment owing thereunder.

                  (r) BOOKS AND RECORDS. The books of account, minute books,
         stock record books, and other records of the Company and each of its
         Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to Buyer, are
         complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained
         in accordance with sound business practices and the requirements of
         Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act (regardless of whether or not the
         Company or its Subsidiaries are subject to that Section), including the
         maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls. The minute
         books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries contain accurate and
         complete records of all meetings held of, and corporate action taken
         by, the stockholders, the Boards of Directors, and committees of the
         Boards of Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and no
         meeting of any such stockholders, Board of Directors, or committee has
         been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are not
         contained in such minute books. At the Effective Time, all of those
         books and records will be delivered to Buyer.

                  (s) PRODUCT WARRANTY AND LIABILITY. Each of the Company's and
         its Subsidiaries' standard practice is to sell each product sold by it
         in conformity with all applicable contractual commitments, if any, and
         all express and implied warranties of the manufacturer, if any. Except
         as set forth in Schedule 3.01(s) of the Disclosure Schedule, no product
         sold by either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
         other guaranty, warranty or other indemnity beyond the applicable
         standard terms and conditions of sale. Schedule 3.01(s) of the
         Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all product liability claims
         raised or asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since
         January 1, 1998. Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, no
         third party has advised the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it
         has any liability arising out of any injury to individuals or property
         as a result of the ownership, possession or use of any product sold by
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

                  (t) RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS. Schedule
         3.01(t) of the Disclosure Schedule lists the ten (10) largest (in terms
         of dollar volume) customers and suppliers of CIVCO (each a "SIGNIFICANT
         CUSTOMER" or "SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIER", as the case may be) during each of
         the two (2) immediately preceding fiscal years of CIVCO and describes
         for the period beginning December 31, 2000 through the date of this
         Agreement all pricing concessions or pricing changes requested by any
         Significant Customers and all



                                       21
<PAGE>

         pricing concessions or pricing changes made by CIVCO for any of their
         Significant Customers. CIVCO currently has good relationships with each
         of its Significant Suppliers and Significant Customers. Except as set
         forth in Schedule 3.01(t) of the Disclosure Schedule, CIVCO is not
         currently in dispute under any contract or agreement for the delivery
         of goods or services with any Significant Supplier or Significant
         Customer, and, since December 31, 2002, no Significant Supplier to or
         Significant Customer has notified the Company or CIVCO that it will
         stop doing business, or reduce its business, with the Company or CIVCO,
         the cessation or reduction of which business would have a Material
         Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
         circumstances related to any Significant Customer's business (other
         than general economic events affecting the medical device manufacturing
         industry generally that do not affect CIVCO disproportionately relative
         to other similarly situated participants in the medical equipment
         manufacturing industry) that would cause a material reduction or
         cessation of any such Significant Customer's business with CIVCO.

                  (u) OPINION OF TRI-ARTISAN, LLC. The Company has received the
         opinion of Tri-Artisan, LLC, dated the date of this Agreement, to the
         effect that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid by Buyer
         pursuant to the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to the
         shareholders of the Company, a signed copy of which opinion has been
         delivered to the Company. The Company hereby represents and warrants
         that it has been authorized by Tri-Artisan, LLC to permit the inclusion
         of such Tri-Artisan, LLC opinion and references thereto in the Proxy
         Statement. Other than the fee payable to Tri-Artisan, LLC in connection
         with the Tri-Artisan, LLC opinion, the Closing of the Merger and the
         reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Company to
         Tri-Artisan, LLC related to the Tri-Artisan, LLC opinion, neither the
         Company nor the Company's affiliates or associates has any continuing
         obligation to Tri-Artisan, LLC with respect to the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

                  (v) HEI, INC. TRANSACTION. There are no claims pending, and no
         event has occurred or circumstances exist that (with or without the
         lapse of time) may constitute or result in a material violation by the
         Company that could give rise to a claim, under that certain Purchase
         Agreement dated January 24, 2003 by and between HEI, Inc. and the
         Company.

         3.02 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND BUYER SUBSIDIARY.

         stock of Buyer Subsidiary. The copies of the Articles or Certificate of
         Incorporation and By-Laws of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary provided to the

         Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
         operations other than in connection with the Merger.

         and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set

         obligation of each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, enforceable against
         Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except to the
         extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
         rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
         court of law or equity).

                  (c) NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement by Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, nor the consummation by Buyer
         and Buyer Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby, will (i)
         conflict with or result in a breach of the Articles or Certificate of
         Incorporation or By-Laws, as currently in effect, of Buyer or Buyer
         Subsidiary, (ii) except for the requirements under the HSR Act,

         or constitute a default or an event which, with the passage of time or
         the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under, or
         require the consent of any third party under, any instrument, contract
         or agreement to which Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is a party or by which
         Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is bound, except, in the case of clauses
         (ii), (iii) and (iv), where such violation, breach or default, or the
         failure to make such filing or obtain such consent or approval, would
         not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of
         Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement.

                  (d) PROXY STATEMENT. None of the information furnished or to
         be furnished by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary for inclusion in the Proxy
         Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed, contain any
         untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
         made, not misleading, or will, at the time of the meeting of

         clearance is required, and (iii) as soon as reasonably practicable
         thereafter, shall cause copies of such Proxy Statement and



                                       26

         form of proxy to be mailed to its shareholders in accordance with the
         provisions of the Colorado Act (unless a bona fide Third-Party
         Acquisition Offer that would, if consummated, represent a Third-Party
         Transaction is received by the Company or its shareholders, which the
         Board of Directors of the Company determines, in the good-faith
         exercise of its fiduciary duties, to accept, approve or recommend).
         Before the filing of the Proxy Statement and form of proxy with the
         SEC, the Company shall provide reasonable opportunity for Buyer to
         review and comment upon the contents of the Proxy Statement and form of
         proxy. The Proxy Statement and form of proxy shall comply as to form in
         all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
         Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
         After the delivery to the Company's shareholders of copies of the Proxy
         Statement and form of proxy, the Company shall use reasonable efforts
         to solicit proxies in connection with such shareholders meeting in
         favor of approval of this Agreement and the related Plan of Merger,
         unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine, in the
         good-faith exercise of its fiduciary duties, that such solicitation
         should not be made.

         4.03 NO SHOPPING. From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will
not, and will use reasonable efforts not to permit any officer, director,
financial adviser or other agent or representative of the Company, directly or
indirectly, to (a) take any action to seek, initiate or solicit any offer from
any person or group to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary, to merge or consolidate with the Company or any Subsidiary, or to
otherwise acquire, except to the extent not prohibited by Section 4.01(d)(iv),
any significant portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as whole (a "THIRD-PARTY ACQUISITION OFFER"), or (b) except to the extent the
Board of Directors of the Company shall otherwise determine in the good-faith
exercise of its fiduciary duties, in order to obtain a Third-Party Transaction,
engage in negotiations concerning a Third-Party Acquisition Offer with any
person or group, or disclose financial information relating to the Company or
any Subsidiary or any confidential or proprietary trade or business information
relating to the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, or afford access to
the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary, to any person
or group that the Company has reason to believe may be considering a Third-Party
Acquisition Offer.

         4.04 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company will give Buyer and its counsel, financial advisers, auditors and other
authorized representatives and its financing sources reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary at all
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, and will instruct the employees,
counsel, financial advisers and auditors of the Company and each Subsidiary to
cooperate with Buyer and each such representative and financing source in all
reasonable respects in its investigation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Buyer and each such representative and financing source will
conduct such investigation in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will take all necessary
precautions (including obtaining the written agreement of its respective
employees or representatives involved in such investigation) to protect the
confidentiality of any information of the Company and its Subsidiaries disclosed
to such persons during such investigation.

         4.05 AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE PLANS. The Company will,
effective at or immediately before the Effective Time, cause any Employee Plans

Buyer, for the purpose of permitting such Employee Plan to continue to operate
in conformity with ERISA and the Code following the Merger.

         4.06 HSR ACT. If necessary, each of the Company, Buyer and Buyer
Subsidiary will file all Notification and Report Forms and related material that
it may be required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act, will

waiting period, and will make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be
necessary or advisable.

         4.07 CERTAIN RESIGNATIONS. The Company will use its reasonable efforts
to assist Buyer in procuring the resignations, effective as of the Effective

the Company and Buyer dated October 2, 2002 shall remain in full force and
effect until the Effective Time. Until the Effective Time, or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and Buyer shall comply
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

         4.09 OPTIONS. The Company will take such actions as are necessary to
cause each Option outstanding at the Effective Time (whether or not such Option
is then exercisable) to be canceled at the Effective Time in consideration for a
cash payment by the Company equal to the Option Settlement Amount for such
Option, subject to all applicable tax withholding. The Company shall comply with
all applicable requirements regarding income tax withholding in connection with
the foregoing.

         4.10 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Before the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions
providing that (a) neither Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary will become an "Acquiring
Person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) as a result of the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (b) no "Shares Acquisition
Date," "Distribution Date," "Section 11(a)(ii) Event," or "Section 13 Event" (as
such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) will occur as a result of the
consummation of the Merger, and (c) all outstanding Rights issued under the
Rights Agreement will expire immediately before the Effective Time. Anything in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have the right
at any time after the date of this Agreement and before the Effective Time to
amend, or take any other action with respect to, the Rights Agreement as deemed
necessary by the Company; provided, however, that any such further action or
amendment shall not contravene the resolutions referred to in this Section 4.10.

                                       28
<PAGE>

addition, the Company covenants to cooperate with Buyer to obtain and pay for
the insurance described on the attached Schedule 1, in substantially the terms
indicated thereon and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. The Company
shall also use all reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining insurance in
such coverage amounts and on such terms as Buyer reasonably determines to insure
against losses resulting from the failure of any representation or warranty made
by the Company in this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects
(the "INSURANCE POLICY").

         4.12 OTHER ACTIONS. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on
the other hand, shall, or shall permit any of their respective subsidiaries to,
take any action that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in
(i) any of the representations and warranties of such party set forth in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such
representations and warranties that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material respect or (iii) any condition to the Merger set forth in Article V not
being satisfied. The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any
person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, with respect to any acquisition of the capital
stock or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement.

         4.13 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from governmental
entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with governmental entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any governmental entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other governmental entity
vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings,
including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and Buyer
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to
the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including all information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any
such representation or warranty



                                       29
<PAGE>

that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

                  (a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
         termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall
         deliver to Buyer, within two business days of their filing with the
         SEC, any new SEC Reports filed by the Company. The Company agrees that
         with each such delivery either the President or Chief Financial Officer
         of the Company shall execute a certification representing and
         warranting that the SEC Report so delivered (and, if applicable, any
         consolidated financial statements contained in such SEC Report)
         complies with the representations and warranties given in Sections
         3.01(e)(i) and (ii) of this Agreement as if such representations and
         warranties had been given at the time such SEC Report was filed, and
         further agrees that, for all purposes of this Agreement, the
         representation and warranty contained in such certification shall be
         deemed to constitute a representation and warranty set forth in Article
         III hereof.

                  (b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
         termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
         agrees to deliver to Buyer CIVCO Financial Statements as of the end of
         each calendar month within 12 business days after the end of each such
         calendar month. The Company agrees that with each such delivery either
         the President or Chief Financial Officer of the Company and either the
         President or Vice President of Finance of CIVCO Medical Instruments,
         Co., Inc. shall execute a certification representing and warranting
         that such CIVCO Financial Statements comply with the representations
         and warranties given in Section 3.01(e)(iv) of this Agreement as if

         such CIVCO Financial Statements, and further agrees that, for all
         purposes of this Agreement, the representation and warranty contained
         in such certification shall be deemed to constitute a representation
         and warranty set forth in Article III hereof.

         in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement, except to
         the extent any inaccuracy in any such representation or warranty,
         individually or in the aggregate, does not materially impair the
         ability of the

<PAGE>

         Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and has not
         had and is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
         (provided that, solely for purposes of this Section 5.01(a), any
         representation or warranty in Section 3.01 that is qualified by
         Material Adverse Effect language shall be read as if such language were
         not present); the Company shall have performed and complied in all

         the date of this Agreement, suffered any business interruption, damage

         event (other than incidents, occurrences or events generally applicable
         to the industry in the Company and the Subsidiaries operate or changes
         in general economic or market conditions) that has had or would
         reasonably be expected to have (after giving effect to any insurance
         coverage) a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that none of
         the items set forth in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have
         had a Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Section 5.01(c).

                  (d) There shall not be pending in any litigation or
         administrative proceeding brought by any governmental or other
         regulatory or administrative agency or commission requesting or looking
         toward an injunction, writ, order, judgment or decree that, in the
         reasonable judgment of Buyer, is reasonably likely, if issued, to
         restrain or prohibit the consummation of any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby or require rescission of this Agreement or any such
         transactions or result in material damages to Buyer, Buyer Subsidiary
         or the Surviving Corporation or their respective officers or directors
         if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, nor shall
         there be in effect any injunction, writ, judgment, preliminary
         restraining order or other order or decree of any nature issued by a
         court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction directing that

         Agreement a material adverse change in the business, operations,
         condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets or liabilities
         of the Company or CIVCO (regardless of whether or not such events or



                                       31
<PAGE>

         changes are consistent with the representations and warranties given

                  (c) The opinion of Tri-Artisan, LLC, delivered to the Board of
         Directors of the Company on the date hereof, that the Merger
         Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the

                CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME

         6.01 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a) For a period of at least two years after the Effective
         Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, a
         Subsidiary or any other affiliate of Buyer to maintain welfare and
         pension benefit plans, programs and arrangements (other than the
         Company's Stock Purchase Plan, Stock Option Plan and any other plans
         related to the company's stock, all of which shall be terminated at or
         prior to the Effective Time) that are, in the aggregate, for the
         employees as a whole who were active full-time employees of CIVCO
         immediately before the Effective Time and continue to be active
         full-time employees of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary
         or any other affiliate of Buyer, no less favorable in the aggregate
         than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
         before the Effective Time (provided that nothing herein shall obligate
         Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or any other affiliate
         of Buyer to provide such employees with any stock-based compensation).

                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, for purposes of
         determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation and
         severance benefits for employees actively employed full-time by the
         Company or any Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time under
         any compensation, severance, welfare, pension, benefit or savings plan
         of Buyer or any of its affiliates in which active full-time employees
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate
         (whether under Section 6.01(a) above or otherwise), service with the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether before or after the
         Effective Time) shall be credited as if such service had been rendered
         to Buyer or such affiliate.

                  (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries,
         or any of their respective successors or assigns, transfers all or
         substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or persons
         (other than Buyer or an affiliate of Buyer), then, and in each such
         case, proper provision shall be made so that the transferee assumes
         (and if more than one, the transferees assume, jointly and severally)
         the obligations set forth in this Section 6.01.

         6.02 INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. All
rights to indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation existing in favor
of any present or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as provided in the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation,
By-Laws or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by law as in effect on the date hereof shall survive the Merger
for a period of at least six years after the Effective Time (or, in the event
any relevant claim is asserted



                                       33
<PAGE>

or made within such six-year period, until final disposition of such claim) with
respect to matters occurring at or before the Effective Time, and no action
taken during such period shall be deemed to diminish the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.02. Buyer hereby guarantees, effective at the Effective Time,
all obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries in respect of
such indemnification and expense advancement. The Company and Buyer agree that
the indemnification and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.02 shall
first be fulfilled pursuant to claims made against the insurance referred to in
Section 6.03 below, subject to any deductible required to be paid by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or CIVCO thereunder.

         6.03 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE. For a period of at
least six years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect either (i) the current policy of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous in any material respect to the insured parties thereunder, in which
case Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deliver a copy of such
policy to each individual that was covered by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Effective Time (including consummation of the Merger), or (ii) a
run-off (i.e., "tail") policy or endorsement with respect to the current policy
of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering claims asserted within
six years after the Effective Time arising from facts or events that occurred at
or before the Effective Time (including consummation of the Merger), in which
case Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deliver a copy of such
run-off policy to each individual who was covered by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and such policies or endorsements shall name as insureds
thereunder all present and former directors and officers of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. If the Surviving Corporation transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person or persons (other than Buyer or
an affiliate of Buyer), then proper provision shall be made so that the
transferee assumes (and if more than one, the transferees assume, jointly and
severally) the obligations set forth in this Section 6.03.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         7.01 GENERALLY. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any
time before the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company:

                  (a) by mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Buyer and
         the Company;

                  (b) by Buyer or the Company if the transactions contemplated
         hereby shall not have been consummated on or before June 30, 2003
         (which date may be extended by mutual agreement of Buyer and the
         Company), provided that such failure is not due to the failure of the
         party seeking to terminate this Agreement (or, in the event Buyer is
         seeking to terminate this Agreement, of Buyer Subsidiary) to comply in
         all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement;

                  (c) by Buyer, if (i) there occurs a failure of any of the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.01 other than for reasons within the
         control of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary and such condition shall not have
         been waived under Section 8.03, or (ii) the shareholders of the Company
         shall fail to approve this Agreement by the vote required by the
         Colorado Act and the Company's Articles of Incorporation at the first
         shareholders meeting called for that purpose or any adjournment
         thereof;

                  (d) by the Company, if (i) there occurs a failure of any of
         the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 other than for reasons within
         the control of the Company or its Subsidiaries and such condition shall
         not have been waived under Section 8.03, or (ii) the shareholders of
         the Company shall fail to approve this Agreement by the vote required
         by the Colorado Act and the Company's Articles of Incorporation at the
         first shareholders meeting called for that purpose or any adjournment
         thereof; or

                  (e) by the Company, if a bona fide Third-Party Acquisition
         Offer that would, if consummated, represent a Third-Party Transaction
         is received by the Company or its shareholders, which the Board of
         Directors of the Company determines, in the good-faith exercise of its
         fiduciary duties, to accept, approve or recommend.

         7.02 PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. In the event
of termination of this Agreement by the Company or Buyer under Section 7.01,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and this
Agreement shall terminate and the Merger shall be abandoned without further
action by any of the parties. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein, no party hereto shall have any liability or further obligation to any
other party to this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04 or
to the extent that the termination is a direct result of a willful and material
breach or violation by such party of a representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         8.01 TERMINATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations
and warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement (including those set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate furnished under this
Agreement shall not survive the Effective Time.

         8.02 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by written
agreement of the parties hereto at any time before the Effective Time with
respect to any of the terms contained herein, except that after the meeting of
the shareholders contemplated by Section 4.02, the amount of the Merger
Consideration shall not be decreased and the form of the Merger Consideration
shall not be altered without the approval of the shareholders.

         8.03 WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE; CONSENTS. Any failure of Buyer or Buyer
Subsidiary, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein (except the conditions
in Sections 5.01(b) and (e) and 5.02(b) and



                                       35
<PAGE>

(e) of this Agreement) may be waived in writing by the Company or by Buyer and
Buyer Subsidiary, respectively, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of
any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent
with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section
8.03.

         8.04 EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEE.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(b), (c) and
         (d), all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
         the party incurring such expenses. Any such expenses incurred by the
         Company and not paid before the Effective Time shall be liabilities of
         the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated under Section 7.01 and if
         Buyer is entitled to a Termination Fee (as defined below) under
         paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 8.04, then the Company shall, at
         the same time as the Termination Fee is required to be paid under
         paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 8.04, pay Buyer an amount equal to
         all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by or on
         behalf of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary in connection with the negotiation,
         preparation, financing, execution or consummation of this Agreement and
         the transactions contemplated hereby, including reasonable legal,
         accounting, travel, filing, printing, financing commitment and other
         out-of-pocket expenses; provided, however, that the aggregate expenses
         payable by the Company to Buyer under this Section 8.04(b) shall not
         exceed $100,000.

                  (c) The Company shall, within five business days after
         consummation of a Third-Party Transaction referenced in (iii) below,
         pay Buyer a fee of $2,000,000 (a "TERMINATION FEE"), in addition to the
         expenses set forth in Section 8.04(b), if each of the following occurs:

                           (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Buyer under
                  Section 7.01(b) or (c)(i) and the condition giving rise to
                  Buyer's right of termination resulted from a breach by the
                  Company of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
                  contained in this Agreement, (B) by Buyer under Section
                  7.01(c)(ii), or (C) by the Company under Section 7.01(d)(ii);
                  and

                           (ii) before such breach (in the case of termination
                  under Section 7.01(b) or (c)(i)) or the first meeting of the
                  shareholders of the Company called for purposes of approving
                  this Agreement (in the case of termination under Section
                  7.01(c)(ii) or (d)(ii)) (A) any person or group shall have
                  informed the Company that such person or group proposes,
                  intends to propose, is considering proposing, or will or may,
                  if the Merger is delayed, abandoned or not approved by the
                  Company's shareholders, propose, a Third-Party Transaction (as
                  defined below), or (B) any such person or group or the Company
                  publicly announces (including any filing with any federal or
                  state office or agency) that such person or



                                       36
<PAGE>

                  group has proposed, intends to propose, is considering
                  proposing, or will or may, if the Merger is delayed, abandoned
                  or not approved by the Company's shareholders, propose, a
                  transaction which, if consummated, would constitute a
                  Third-Party Transaction; and

                           (iii) within six months after such termination a
                  Third-Party Transaction with such person or group is
                  consummated.

                  (d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company under
         Section 7.01(e), the Company shall, within five business days after
         termination, pay Buyer a Termination Fee of $2,000,000, in addition to
         the expenses set forth in Section 8.04(b).

                  (e) As used herein, "THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION" means the
         occurrence of any of the following events:

                           (i) the acquisition of the Company by merger,
                  consolidation, statutory share exchange or other business
                  combination transaction by any person other than Buyer, Buyer
                  Subsidiary or any affiliate thereof (a "THIRD PARTY"), in
                  which transaction the holders of shares of Company Common
                  Stock immediately before the transaction receive a per-share
                  consideration in excess of the Merger Consideration;

                           (ii) the acquisition by any Third Party of 50% or
                  more (in book value or market value) of the total assets of
                  the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
                  consideration that indicates a total value for the Company and
                  its Subsidiaries in excess of the sum of (A) product of the
                  number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
                  date of this Agreement multiplied by the Merger Consideration,
                  plus (B) the aggregate of the Option Settlement Amounts for
                  all Options outstanding on the date of this Agreement; or

                           (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of 50% or more
                  of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, whether by
                  tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise, for a per-share
                  consideration in excess of the Merger Consideration.

                  (f) In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable
         under this Section 8.04. The right to receive a Termination Fee shall
         be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary against
         the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
         officers, employees, attorneys, agents, advisors or other
         representatives with respect to the occurrences giving rise to such
         payment.

         8.05 INDEMNIFICATION. After the Effective Time, the Company's liability
to Buyer, Buyer Subsidiary, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents or advisors, or any of their respective successors or assigns

accountants, financial advisors and other expert, and other expenses of
litigation) incurred or suffered by them resulting from, relating to, arising
out of or constituting any breach of representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement shall be limited to the amount(s) determined by the
issuer of the Insurance Policy to be payable to such Buyer Indemnitees under the
Insurance Policy following a claim by such Buyer Indemnitees in accordance with
the Insurance Policy.

Agreement shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement without prior written approval of the
other parties; provided, however, that each of the Company and Buyer may make
any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or
any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the disclosing party will advise the other parties to this Agreement
before making the disclosure).

         8.07 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take or

Company, respectively, in the good-faith exercise of its fiduciary duties,
determines should not be taken or done). If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each corporation that is a
party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.
