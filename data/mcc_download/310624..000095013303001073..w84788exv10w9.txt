                                 DEED OF LEASE

         IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

1.       DEMISE.

         Upon and subject to the terms hereof, Landlord does hereby lease to
         Tenant and Tenant does hereby  lease from Landlord the premises (the
         "Premises") consisting of all of the rentable area of the building

         which Premises the Landlord and Tenant agree contains approximately
         two hundred fourteen thousand two hundred fourteen (214,214) square
         feet of rentable area.  For purposes of this Lease, (i) the portion of

         thousand four hundred seventy-nine (119,479) square feet of rentable
         area, is referred to as the "Phase I Premises", and (ii) the portion
         of the Premises consisting of the entire rentable areas of the lower
         level, the first (1st), third (3rd), fourth (4th), fifth (5th) and
         sixth (6th) floors of the Property, which the Landlord and Tenant

         December 15, 1996, to alter the floors designated as the Phase I
         Premises and the Phase II Premises, so long as (i) the Phase I
         Premises shall consist of not less than one hundred eighteen thousand
         two hundred eighty-five (118,285) square feet, and (ii) the Phase I
         Premises and the Phase II Premises shall comprise the entire rentable

         The Premises does not include the roof or exterior surfaces of the
         walls of the Premises or the Property, or any improvements or areas
         outside of such walls.

2.       TERM.

         (A)     Initial Term.

                 Subject to the terms hereof, the term of this Lease (the
                 "Lease Term") shall be for a period (the "Initial Term") of
                 thirteen (13) years, commencing on the first (1st) day of
                 January, 1997 (the "Commencement Date") and ending at 11:59
                 p.m. on the thirty-first (31st) day of December, 2009 (the
                 "Expiration Date").  If Landlord fails to tender possession of
                 the Premises to the Tenant on or before the Commencement Date
                 stated in the preceding sentence, Landlord shall not be liable
                 for any damage caused by any such delay in the Commencement
                 Date or failure to tender possession of the Premises, nor
                 shall this Lease be void or voidable; provided that, to the
                 extent such failure in tendering possession is not caused by
                 or reasonably attributable to Tenant or Tenant's agents,
                 contractors, subtenants, assignees, employees, officers,
                 directors, shareholders, partners, licensees and/or others for
                 whose actions Tenant is responsible or over whose actions
                 Tenant can reasonably be expected to exercise control
                 (collectively, "Tenant's Agents"), the Commencement Date shall
                 be extended to that date on which Landlord tenders possession
                 of the





                                       1
<PAGE>
                 Premises to Tenant, and the Expiration Date shall be extended
                 by an equal amount so that the Initial Term remains thirteen
                 (13) years.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
                 Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease (and shall
                 have no further liability hereunder) if Landlord fails to
                 tender possession of the Premises to Tenant on or before
                 January 31, 1997 (such date to be subject to a day-for-day
                 extension for each day of delay in tendering possession which
                 is caused by or reasonably attributable to Tenant or Tenant's
                 Agents).  Tenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i)
                 Landlord shall be entitled to tender possession of the
                 Premises subject to the continued occupancy by the existing
                 tenant of the Premises, Collins International Service Company
                 ("Collins") and Collins shall be deemed to be a permitted
                 subtenant of Tenant, and (ii) no such continued occupancy by
                 Collins of any portion of the Premises after December 31, 1996
                 shall constitute a failure by Landlord to tender possession of
                 the Premises, so long as (i) Landlord shall have elected to
                 treat such continued occupancy as a direct sublease between
                 Tenant and Collins, and (ii) Collins shall have agreed in
                 writing to execute and deliver to Tenant such form of sublease
                 with respect to Collins' continued occupancy of the Premises
                 as Tenant may reasonably request (Tenant hereby acknowledging
                 that Collins shall in no event be required to execute and
                 deliver any such sublease which provides (on a per rentable
                 square foot basis) for a higher base rent than the Base Rent
                 under the Lease Agreement dated March 5, 1993, between
                 Landlord and Collins (the "Collins Lease")).  Such sublease
                 shall contain Collins' agreement that (i) Collins shall not be
                 permitted to control access to any portion of the Building by
                 means of previously-existing security systems or practices,
                 and (ii) Collins shall have no right to object to any
                 construction activities taking place in or around the
                 Building.  At the request of Landlord, Tenant hereby agrees to
                 execute a declaration in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
                 (the "Declaration") as incorporated herein by reference.
                 Tenant's failure to execute the Declaration shall not affect
                 the Commencement Date or the Lease Term, as same are
                 determined by the terms of this Lease.

         (B)     Extension Period.

                          (i)     Provided Tenant is not in default beyond the
                 expiration of any applicable notice and cure period at the
                 time of the exercise of the applicable Extension Option or
                 thereafter (through and including the commencement date of the
                 applicable Extension Period as herein defined), and provided
                 that this Lease shall not theretofore have been terminated,
                 Tenant shall have two (2) options (the "Extension Options") to
                 extend the Expiration Date of the Lease Term, each for a
                 period of five (5) consecutive years (individually, the "First
                 Extension Period" and the "Second Extension Period", and
                 collectively the "Extension Periods"), the First Extension
                 Period  commencing on the thirteenth (13th) anniversary of the
                 Commencement Date and ending on the day preceding the
                 eighteenth (18th) anniversary of the Commencement Date, and
                 the Second Extension Period commencing on the eighteenth
                 (18th) anniversary of the Commencement Date and ending on the
                 day preceding the twenty-third (23rd) anniversary of the
                 Commencement Date, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms
                 hereof.  The Extension Periods shall be upon the same terms
                 and conditions contained herein except that (A) the Rent
                 payable in the Extension Periods shall be adjusted to equal
                 one hundred percent (100%) of the then-prevailing fair market
                 rental rate for the Premises (the "New Rental Rate"), and
                 shall thereafter be subject to adjustment as provided in
                 Section 3(B) hereof, (B) Tenant shall have the right to adjust
                 the size of the Premises in accordance with Section 2(B)(ix)
                 hereof, (C) Tenant shall have no option to extend the
                 Expiration Date of the Lease Term beyond the last day of the
                 Second Extension Period, and (D) Tenant shall have no right to
                 exercise the Extension Option for the Second Extension Period
                 unless Tenant has properly exercised the Extension Option for
                 the First Extension Period.

                          (ii)    Tenant may exercise an Extension Option only
                 by delivering binding written notice (the "Extension Option
                 Notice") to Landlord of Tenant's election to exercise such
                 Extension Option not later than twelve (12) months prior to
                 the commencement of the applicable Extension Period.  Landlord
                 and Tenant agree to negotiate in good faith for a period of
                 thirty (30) days to attempt to reach agreement on the New
                 Rental Rate, promptly following delivery of Tenant's Extension
                 Option Notice.  In the event the parties are unable to agree
                 on such New Rental Rate





                                       2
<PAGE>
                 within said thirty (30) day period, then Tenant's Extension
                 Option Notice shall be deemed null and void, unless within ten
                 (10) business days after the expiration of such thirty (30)
                 day period Tenant agrees, by means of giving the Landlord
                 written notice thereof (which notice shall name the Tenant's
                 selected broker), to submit the determination of the fair
                 market rental rate for the Premises to arbitration by brokers
                 as set forth below.  In the event Tenant shall agree to submit
                 such determination to arbitration in the manner aforesaid,
                 Landlord shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt of
                 Tenant's written notice to submit such determination to
                 arbitration, designate the broker appointed by it.

                          (iii)   Each broker shall render a separate written
                 report, within thirty (30) days after appointment of
                 Landlord's broker, of such broker's estimate of the
                 then-prevailing fair market rental rate for the Premises as of
                 the commencement of such Extension Period.  If the values
                 contained in the written reports differ by five percent (5%)
                 or less of the greater of such values, the New Rental Rate
                 shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the arithmetic average
                 of such values.  If the values contained in the written
                 reports differ to a greater extent than set forth above, the
                 brokers shall, within five (5) days after rendering their
                 reports, promptly jointly appoint a third broker.  If the two
                 brokers so designated shall fail to agree upon the selection
                 of a third broker within ten (10) days after the expiration of
                 such 30-day period, then either party, upon written notice to
                 the other, may request such appointment by the American
                 Arbitration Association (or any organization successor
                 thereto).  The parties shall cooperate to expedite such
                 appointment.  Within twenty (20) days of his appointment, the
                 third broker shall render a written report of his opinion of
                 the value of the then-prevailing fair market rental rate for
                 the Premises as of the commencement of the applicable
                 Extension Period.  One hundred percent (100%) of the
                 arithmetic average of the values in the three (3) evaluation
                 reports shall then be the New Rental Rate for the Extension
                 Period; provided, however, that if the lowest or highest of
                 the three (3) evaluations, or both, varies by more than ten
                 (10%) from the middle evaluation, such evaluation or
                 evaluations so varying shall be disregarded in computing said
                 average.

                          (iv)    In the event the New Rental Rate has not been
                 determined on or before the commencement of an Extension
                 Period, the Rent payable by Tenant until such determination
                 shall be deemed equal to the Rent payable by Tenant pursuant
                 to Section 3(A) immediately prior to the commencement of such
                 Extension Period (as the same may be adjusted hereunder);
                 provided, however, within fifteen (15) days of such
                 determination, Tenant shall pay Landlord the excess of (i) the
                 initial monthly installments of monthly Rent calculated for
                 such Extension Period, above (ii) the monthly installments of
                 Rent actually paid by the Tenant, in respect of each month
                 commencing on or after the commencement of such Extension
                 Period but prior to such determination, or Landlord shall
                 credit Tenant for any excess rent paid by Tenant if the rental
                 rate has declined, and Tenant shall thereafter pay Rent for
                 the Extension Period at the New Rental Rate (as the same may
                 be increased in accordance with the terms hereof).

                          (v)     All valuations of the fair market rental rate
                 of the Premises shall be in writing and shall be expressed in
                 terms of an annual rent.  Each broker's determination shall be
                 based on all relevant factors affecting fair market rental
                 rate, including, but not limited to, other terms of this Lease
                 (excluding tenant concessions and/or construction allowances,
                 but including the provision of free parking and the roof and
                 signage rights granted hereunder), the fact that the
                 determination is for a renewal, and the fact that the
                 determination is for a renewal as of a future date.  Each
                 broker shall use as a basis for comparison the base and
                 additional rent, abatements, construction allowances and other
                 tenant concessions for lease renewals entered into for
                 comparable space in the Fair Oaks/Fair Lakes submarket of
                 Fairfax County, Virginia, within the period which commences
                 twelve (12) months prior to the date of such determination,
                 which leases shall commence at approximately the same time as
                 the applicable Extension Period.

                          (vi)    Each broker appointed hereunder shall be a
                 licensed commercial real estate broker in the Commonwealth of
                 Virginia, and shall be qualified by experience and ability to
                 appraise the fair market rental for the Premises.  The party
                 appointing each broker shall be obligated, promptly after
                 receipt of the valuation report prepared by the broker
                 appointed by such party, to deliver a copy of





                                       3
<PAGE>
                 such valuation report to the other party in the manner
                 provided elsewhere in this Lease for the delivery of notices.
                 If a third broker is appointed, the third broker shall be
                 directed, at the time of his appointment, to deliver copies of
                 his valuation report, promptly upon its completion, to
                 Landlord and Tenant in the manner provided elsewhere in this
                 Lease for the delivery of notices.  The fees and other costs
                 of each of the first two brokers shall be borne by the party
                 appointing each such broker, with the fees and other costs of
                 the third broker being shared equally by Landlord and Tenant;
                 provided that, each broker shall (i) acknowledge that such
                 broker's participation in the determination of the New Rental
                 Rate shall not entitle such broker to a brokerage commission
                 for the applicable Extension Period, and (ii) waive any lien
                 rights it may have or claim against the Property in respect of
                 the fees to be paid in connection with the determination of
                 the New Rental Rate.

                          (vii)   It is understood that the New Rental Rate
                 shall be the initial Rent for the applicable Extension Period
                 (such Rent being subject thereafter to then-current market
                 escalations and adjustments as determined pursuant to Section
                 3(B)), and that Tenant shall continue to pay all Additional
                 Rent reserved under the Lease.

                          (viii)  Tenant's failure to timely deliver Tenant's
                 Extension Option Notice with regard to an Extension Option
                 shall render such Extension Option null and void, and of no
                 further force or effect.

                          (ix)    Tenant shall have the right to delete from
                 the Premises one (1) or more full floors of the Building, for
                 either the Second Extension Period or the First and Second
                 Extension Periods, subject to the following terms and
                 conditions:

                                  (1)      Tenant shall notify Landlord of its
                 election to decrease the Premises within the Tenant's
                 Extension Option Notice for the applicable Extension Period,
                 and shall designate in such notice the number of floors which
                 Tenant desires to delete from the Premises;

                                  (2)      Tenant may not decrease the size of
                 the Premises in either the First or Second Extension Period to
                 less than one hundred sixty thousand six hundred sixty-one
                 (160,661) rentable square feet;

                                  (3)      Landlord shall designate the floors
                 to be surrendered by Tenant pursuant to this Section 2(B)(ix)
                 (the "Early Surrender Space"); provided that, the Early
                 Surrender Space designated by Landlord shall result in the
                 remaining Premises constituting a single contiguous space;

                                  (4)      Landlord shall have no obligation to
                 restore, nor shall Tenant have any right to regain, possession
                 of any portion of the Early Surrender Space;

                                  (5)      Tenant shall surrender possession of
                 the Early Surrender Space not later than the last day of the
                 Initial Term or First Extension Period, as the case may be,
                 free and clear of all tenancies and occupancies, broom-clean
                 and otherwise in accordance with all terms and conditions of
                 this Lease applicable to the surrender of the Premises, as if
                 such day were the Expiration Date (Tenant hereby acknowledging
                 that such terms and conditions shall be independently applied
                 to the Early Surrender Space);

                                  (6)      Upon the surrender of the Early
                 Surrender Space, the Rent and the Tenant's Proportionate Share
                 (as herein defined) shall be recalculated to reflect the
                 deletion of the Early Surrender Space; and

                                  (7)      From and after the designation of
                 the Early Surrender Space, Tenant shall have no right, power
                 or authority to (i) assign any of the Tenant's interest in the
                 Lease with respect to any portion of the Early Surrender
                 Space, or to enter into any sublease or to permit any
                 occupancy of all or any portion of the Early Surrender Space
                 by any person or entity not





                                       4
<PAGE>
                 then in possession of all or a portion of the Early Surrender
                 Space (other than the Tenant's employees), or (ii) to make or
                 perform, or cause to be made or performed, any alteration,
                 addition, improvement or modification in or to such Early
                 Surrender Space.  The Tenant further acknowledges and agrees
                 that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the
                 contrary, from and after the date of such designation, the
                 Landlord shall have no obligation to rebuild or undertake
                 major repairs of such Early Surrender Space in the event of
                 any condemnation, fire or other casualty.

3.       RENT.

         (A)     Base Rent.

                 Tenant shall pay for the use and occupancy of the Premises a
                 base rental ("Rent") equal to the sum of the Phase I Rent and
                 the Phase II Rent.  The "Phase I Rent" shall mean the product
                 of (i) the rentable area of the Phase I Premises multiplied by
                 (ii) Fourteen Dollars ($14.00) per rentable square foot per
                 year, payable in equal monthly installments.  The "Phase II
                 Rent" shall mean the product of (i) the rentable area of the
                 Phase II Premises, multiplied by (ii) Fourteen Dollars
                 ($14.00) per rentable square foot per year, payable in equal
                 monthly installments.  Rent shall be paid on the first day of
                 each month in advance without demand, notice, deduction,
                 offset, or counterclaim (except as may be otherwise expressly
                 provided herein) during the Lease Term; provided that, (i)
                 Phase I Rent shall commence to accrue on that date (the "Phase
                 I Rent Commencement Date") which is the later of April 1, 1997
                 or the date which is the ninetieth (90th) day following the
                 Commencement Date, and (ii) Phase II Rent shall commence to
                 accrue on January 1, 1998 (the "Phase II Rent Commencement
                 Date").  Rent for any period during the Lease Term which is
                 less than one month shall be prorated on a daily basis, based
                 on the monthly installment, and shall be payable in advance.
                 Rent shall be payable in lawful money of the United States to
                 Landlord at the address stated herein or to such other persons
                 or at such other places as Landlord may designate in writing.
                 If Tenant occupies the Premises prior to the Commencement
                 Date, such occupancy shall be subject to all provisions hereof
                 and shall not advance the last day of the Lease Term.  Tenant
                 and Tenant's Agents may enter upon the Premises at any time
                 after Landlord tenders possession thereof to complete the
                 Building Fit-Out (as defined in Exhibit B and including, but
                 not limited to, the installation of telephone equipment and
                 communications wiring and cabling, the placement of furniture
                 and equipment and other work in preparation for occupancy),
                 without advancing the Phase I or Phase II Rent Commencement
                 Dates or otherwise triggering any obligation to pay Rent
                 pursuant to this Section 3(A) or Additional Rent pursuant to
                 Section 6(A).

         (B)     Rent Schedule.

                 Effective January 1, 1998, the Rent payable pursuant to
                 Section 3(A) shall be increased to equal Three Million Five
                 Hundred Four Thousand Five Hundred Forty-One Dollars
                 ($3,504,541.00) per annum.  On each anniversary of the Phase I
                 Rent Commencement Date occurring after January 1, 1998 and
                 prior to the end of the Initial Term (each an "Adjustment
                 Date"), the Rent set forth in the preceding sentence shall be
                 increased to reflect increases in the cost of living in
                 accordance with the following procedure:

                 (1)      The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
                          Clerical Workers (CPI-W), U.S. City Average, All
                          Items (1982-84=100) (herein referred to as the
                          "Index"), as published by the U.S. Department of
                          Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is published
                          for the bimonthly reporting period ending most
                          recently prior to the Adjustment Date (herein
                          referred to as the "Adjustment Index"), shall be
                          compared with the Index published for the same
                          reporting period twelve (12) months prior thereto
                          (herein referred to as the "Beginning Index").  If
                          the Adjustment Index has changed from the Beginning
                          Index, the percentage change between the Beginning
                          Index and the Adjustment Index shall be determined.
                          There shall be added to such percentage change





                                       5
<PAGE>
                          five (5) percentage points, and the resulting sum
                          shall be referred to herein as the "Escalation
                          Factor".  For example, if the Adjustment Index is two
                          percent (2%) higher than the Beginning Index, then
                          the Escalation Factor for such adjustment shall equal
                          seven percent (7%), and if the Adjustment Index is
                          one percent (1%) lower than the Beginning Index, then
                          the Escalation Factor for such adjustment shall equal
                          four percent (4%).

                 (2)      The Escalation Factor determined in Section 3(B)(1)
                          shall be multiplied by the Rent in effect immediately
                          prior to such Adjustment Date (as such rent may have
                          been escalated pursuant to the terms hereof) to
                          arrive at the amount (the "Escalation Amount") of the
                          increase in the Rent pursuant to this Section 3(B)
                          for the period commencing with such Adjustment Date
                          and ending on the day preceding the next Adjustment
                          Date (each an "Adjustment Year").  In no event,
                          however, shall any Escalation Amount for any
                          Adjustment Year exceed two and six/tenths percent
                          (2.6%) of the Rent in effect immediately prior to
                          such Adjustment Date.

                 (3)      The Escalation Amount determined in Section 3(B)(2)
                          shall, subject to the limitation set forth in the
                          last sentence thereof, be added to the Rent in effect
                          immediately prior to such Adjustment Date to arrive
                          at the Rent payable for such newly commencing
                          Adjustment Year.

                 (4)      In no event shall the Rent payable during any
                          Adjustment Year be less than the Rent in effect
                          immediately prior to the commencement of such
                          Adjustment Year.

                 (5)      If the Index is changed so that a base year other
                          than 1982-84 is used, the Index used herein shall be
                          converted in accordance with the conversion factor
                          published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of
                          Labor Statistics.  If the Index is discontinued or
                          otherwise revised during the Lease Term, such other
                          government index or computation with which the Index
                          is replaced shall be used in order to obtain
                          substantially the same result as would be obtained if
                          the Index had not been discontinued or revised.

                 (6)      Promptly after the adjustment of the Rent is
                          determined for each Adjustment Year, Landlord shall
                          submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the
                          Escalation Amount for such Adjustment Year and the
                          computations by which it was determined.  Since the
                          actual increase in the Rent may not be determined
                          until after the start of a new Adjustment Year, until
                          the actual Escalation Amount is determined the Tenant
                          shall continue to make monthly payments of Rent in
                          the amount in effect immediately prior to the
                          Adjustment Date.  In such event, Landlord's statement
                          shall, in addition to the actual Escalation Amount
                          for such Adjustment Year and the computations by
                          which it was determined, set forth the difference
                          between the monthly Rent payments theretofore paid by
                          Tenant for such Adjustment Year and the actual amount
                          of Rent determined to be owing for the period for
                          which such Rent has been paid (inclusive of the
                          Escalation Amount).  If the actual amount determined
                          to be owing is greater than Tenant's payments for the
                          same period, the deficiency shall be paid by Tenant
                          together with the next monthly installment of Rent
                          due at least fifteen (15) days after the amount of
                          the deficiency is determined (but in all events not
                          later than forty-five (45) days after the amount of
                          such deficiency is determined).

                 The Rent payable for the First and Second Extension Periods
                 shall escalate on each anniversary of the Phase I Rent
                 Commencement Date occurring during such Extension Periods in
                 accordance with the then-current market escalation formula
                 (such current market escalation formula to be determined by
                 the brokers establishing the New Rental Rate, in accordance
                 with the procedure set forth in Section 2(B) (except that the
                 determination of the third broker, if any, shall be
                 controlling as to the constituent components of such current
                 market escalation formula, if the

<PAGE>
                 brokers appointed by the parties shall fail to agree on such
                 components), at the time the New Rental Rate is determined).

     (C)         Place of Payment.

                 Rent, Additional Rent and other sums owed by Tenant shall be
                 paid to Landlord at the offices of Landlord's property manager
                 at 1115 30th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20007, or at such
                 place as Landlord may designate from time to time in writing.

     (D)         Late Charge.

                 Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant of
                 Rent, Additional  Rent or other sums due hereunder will cause
                 Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease.
                 Therefore, if any installment of Rent, Additional Rent or any
                 other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord
                 when such amount is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late
                 charge of four percent (4%) of such overdue amount.
                 Additionally, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Default Rate
                 (as set forth in Section 29) on all sums in default.
                 Acceptance of such late charge and/or the Default Rate by
                 Landlord shall in no event constitute a waiver of Tenant's
                 default with respect to such overdue amount, or prevent
                 Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy available
                 to Landlord.  Landlord agrees to waive the imposition of such
                 late charge and interest on one (1) occasion in any  twelve
                 (12) month period provided that no such late charge waiver has
                 been granted or exercised in the preceding twelve (12) months,
                 and the overdue payment is paid within five (5) business days
                 after notice from Landlord that the payment was not paid when
                 due.

         (E)     Receipt.

                 The Phase I Rent for the first month of the Lease Term will be
                 paid by Tenant on the Commencement Date.

         (F)     Intentionally Omitted.

4.       PERMITTED USE.

         Tenant covenants that the Premises will be used solely for general and
         executive office purposes in accordance with the terms hereof (the
         "Permitted Use") and for no other purpose whatsoever.  "General and
         executive office purposes" shall be deemed to be limited to general
         office use (which shall be deemed to include (a) laser and other types
         of printing customarily employed in first-class business offices; (b)
         data processing and word processing services; (c) telephone,
         telecopier and other business communications systems; (d) storage of
         files, papers, microfilm and other storage media as customarily
         performed in first-class business offices; (e) video display,
         screening and media rooms; (f) conference rooms; (g) classrooms for
         training and presentations; (h) executive placement and travel agency
         services; and (i) a messenger service), and the following incidental
         and ancillary uses (each an "Ancillary Use" and collectively,
         "Ancillary Uses"): (i) one or more cafeterias, dining rooms and
         warming pantries (each of which may include facilities for the
         refrigeration, preparation, cooking and service of food); (ii) the
         sale, by vending machines, of items commonly sold in office vending
         machines, including soft drinks, food, candy and cigarettes; (iii) an
         exercise facility; (iv) shower and locker room facilities; and (v) in
         portions of the Premises situated on the ground floor and/or lower
         level of the Building, food service operations and other retail uses
         approved by Landlord (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
         delayed, but such consent may be made subject to Tenant's agreement to
         such reasonable conditions and restrictions as Landlord may require
         (including, but not limited to, those set forth on the attached
         Exhibit H) .  All such Ancillary Uses shall be subject to the terms of
         this Lease and the applicable terms of the attached Exhibit H. Nothing
         herein contained shall be deemed to grant Tenant the exclusive right
         to engage in such Ancillary Uses at any time when Tenant leases less
         than all of the Building and Tenant acknowledges that it has received
         no written or oral inducements from Landlord or any of Landlord's





                                       7
<PAGE>
         representatives that Tenant will be granted any such exclusive rights.
         Tenant shall not use, store or dispose of any materials posing a
         health or environmental hazard in or about the Building or the
         Property; provided that, the foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit
         the storage and use of normal and reasonable quantities (not for
         resale) of ordinary and customary office and cleaning supplies
         utilized in first-class offices (collectively, "Permitted Materials").
         All such storage and use covered by the preceding sentence shall be
         made in accordance with all applicable Federal, state and local laws,
         ordinances, rules and regulations, as the same may be amended from
         time to time (Tenant hereby expressly agreeing to obtain all required
         permits and pay any and all fees and provide any testing required by
         any governmental agency in connection therewith), and shall be subject
         to the following further conditions:

         (i)     in all events Tenant shall, upon the expiration or sooner
                 termination of this Lease, promptly remove all hazardous,
                 toxic, radioactive and/or carcinogenic substances, pollutants,
                 contaminants and/or materials (including, but not limited to,
                 any storage tanks or containers for the same) brought into or
                 upon the Property (including , but not limited to, the
                 Premises) by Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents or any third
                 party for or on behalf of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents;
                 and

         (ii)    notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, in the
                 event that any applicable Federal, state or local law,
                 ordinance, order, rule, regulation or other restriction shall,
                 at any time during the Term of this Lease or any renewal or
                 extension hereof, (a) require that Tenant discontinue the use
                 or storage, or otherwise restrict or regulate the use, of any
                 hazardous, toxic, radioactive and/or carcinogenic substances,
                 pollutants, contaminants and/or materials (including, but not
                 limited to, any storage tanks or containers for the same)
                 brought upon the Property (including, but not limited to, the
                 Premises) by or on behalf of Tenant or Tenant's Agents, or (b)
                 shall require that Landlord or Tenant or any of Tenant's
                 Agents remediate, clean-up or abate the effects of past use,
                 storage or disposal of substances brought into or upon the
                 Property (including, but not limited to, the Premises) by
                 Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents or any third party for or on
                 behalf of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents, Tenant shall, at
                 Tenant's sole expense,

                 (1)      where required, immediately remove such substances
                          (to the extent brought into or upon the Property
                          (including, but not limited to, the Premises) by
                          Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents or any third party
                          for or on behalf of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents)
                          from the Property (including, but not limited to, the
                          Premises);

                 (2)      promptly comply with all applicable laws, ordinances,
                          order, rules, regulations and restrictions; and

                 (3)      promptly remediate, clean-up and abate the effects of
                          past use, storage and/or disposal by Tenant or any of
                          Tenant's Agents by any third party on behalf of
                          Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents as required by
                          applicable laws, ordinances, orders, rules,
                          regulations and restrictions.




         (iii)   Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold Landlord and the
                 Property harmless from and against any claims, costs, damage,
                 expense and liability which may be asserted against Landlord
                 and/or the Property on account of such storage, use, disposal,
                 remediation, clean-up and/or abatement by Tenant or any of
                 Tenant's Agents or by any third party on behalf of Tenant or
                 any of Tenant's Agents.

         Landlord shall bear the cost of removing from the Property any
         hazardous materials that were not introduced by Tenant or any of
         Tenant's Agents and that are hereafter reasonably required to be
         removed to avoid a health or environmental hazard.  Tenant further
         covenants that the Premises will not be used or occupied for any
         unlawful purposes.  Tenant agrees to and shall use the Premises solely
         for the purpose of conducting the Permitted Use and for no other
         business or purpose. Tenant shall not commit or allow to be committed
         any waste upon the Premises, or any public or private nuisance, or, at
         any time when Tenant leases less than the entire Building, any other
         act or thing which disturbs the quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in
         the Property.

         (A)     Taxes.

                 Landlord shall pay all taxes applicable to the Property which
                 are payable during the Lease Term.  As used herein, the term
                 "taxes" shall mean real estate taxes, assessments (whether
                 general or special), sewer rents, rates and charges, transit
                 and other special taxing district taxes, taxes based upon the
                 receipt of Rent or other payments hereunder which are in
                 substitution for, or in addition to, real estates taxes, and
                 any other federal, state or local governmental charge,
                 general, special, ordinary or extraordinary (but not including
                 income or franchise taxes, inheritance, estate or gift taxes,
                 net profit taxes or any other taxes imposed upon or measured
                 by Landlord's net income or profits), which may now or
                 hereafter be levied, assessed or imposed against the Property
                 or Premises (collectively, "Taxes").  Additionally, Landlord
                 shall have no obligation to protest Taxes, but if Landlord
                 does protest Taxes, the reasonable cost of such protest shall
                 also be deemed Taxes.  In the event that Landlord elects not
                 to protest Taxes, Tenant shall have the right to challenge or
                 appeal such assessment in Landlord's name but at Tenant's sole
                 expense, and Landlord shall cooperate in such challenge or
                 appeal (including executing such forms as may be reasonably
                 necessary to institute and prosecute such action); provided
                 that, (i) Tenant shall have no right to challenge or appeal
                 any Tax assessment during the last two (2) years of the Lease
                 Term, and (ii) in the event Tenant then leases less than all
                 of the Building, Tenant shall pay one hundred percent (100%)
                 of any increase in Taxes resulting from any challenge or
                 appeal of Taxes filed by Tenant.

     (B)         Insurance.

                 Landlord shall provide insurance for the Property as set forth
                 in Section 9(A) ("Insurance").  So long as Principal Mutual
                 Life Insurance Company ("PMLIC") or another entity owned or
                 controlled by PMLIC or under common control with PMLIC, in
                 whole or part, is the Landlord hereunder, Landlord shall have
                 the right to self-insure (in which event, Operating Expenses
                 shall include the reasonable costs which would have been
                 incurred if Landlord had obtained the insurance set forth in
                 Section 9(A) from a third party, subject to the limitation set
                 forth in Section 5(G)).

     (C)         Services.

                 (1)      Subject to the terms hereof, continually through the
                 Lease Term, Landlord will furnish to the Premises heating,
                 air-conditioning and ventilation during the seasons in which
                 they are required, in accordance with the standards set forth
                 in Exhibit F attached hereto.  Continually through the Lease
                 Term, Landlord will provide: electricity; water; elevator
                 service; exterior and interior window-cleaning service; and,
                 in accordance with the standards set forth in Exhibit G
                 attached hereto, janitorial service after 6:00 p.m. on Monday
                 through Friday only (excluding holidays).  Upon Tenant's
                 request, Landlord agrees to amend Exhibit G from time to time
                 to incorporate services which are commensurate with services
                 furnished in other first-class office buildings in the Fair
                 Oaks/Fair Lakes submarket of Fairfax County, Virginia.  The
                 hours of operation of the Building will be 8:00 a.m. to 7:00
                 p.m.  on Monday through Friday (except holidays) and 9:00 a.m.
                 to 2:00 p.m. on Saturday (except holidays) and such additional
                 hours, if any, as Landlord and Tenant from time to time
                 determine; provided that, at any time Tenant does not lease
                 the entire Building, Tenant's consent shall not be required
                 for any expansion of the hours of operation of the Building
                 which is consistent with the hours of operation for other
                 first-class office buildings in the Fair Oaks/Fair Lakes
                 submarket of Fairfax County, Virginia.  Tenant shall pay for
                 after-hours HVAC service a reasonable charge reasonably
                 established by Landlord from time to time to compensate
                 Landlord for the reasonably estimated incremental wear on the
                 Building's HVAC system resulting from such after-hours usage
                 (it being understood that all personnel, electricity, water
                 and maintenance costs relating to both scheduled and
                 after-hours HVAC service are being included in the Operating
                 Expenses of the Building); provided that, for any period in
                 which Tenant does not lease the entire Building, such charge
                 shall also include the





                                       9
<PAGE>
                 reasonable cost of personnel, electricity, water and
                 maintenance charges incurred as a result of such after-hours
                 HVAC service (and such cost shall be excluded from Operating
                 Expenses of the Building).  Additionally, at such times as
                 Tenant does not lease the entire Building, Landlord shall also
                 have the right to require a separate meter be installed to
                 meter Tenant's utility usage within the Premises, with the
                 cost of such meter to be borne by Landlord.  In such event,
                 Tenant shall pay for such utility usage in a timely manner to
                 either Landlord or directly to the utility if required by
                 Landlord, and there shall be an equitable adjustment of
                 Operating Expenses to reflect such separate metering.  As used
                 in this Section, the term "holidays" shall mean New Year's
                 Day, Presidents Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday (in
                 even-numbered years only), Memorial Day, Independence Day,
                 Labor Day, Columbus Day (in odd-numbered years only),
                 Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas,
                 as such list of holidays may be modified by Tenant from time
                 to time; provided that, at such time as Tenant leases less
                 than all of the Building, Tenant shall have no further right
                 to modify such list of holidays, and Landlord shall have the
                 right to modify such list of holidays to conform to the
                 building holidays generally recognized by first-class
                 buildings in the Fair Oaks/Fair Lakes submarket of Fairfax
                 County, Virginia.  Subject to the terms hereof, at least two
                 (2) elevators in the Building shall be in service at all
                 times.

                 (2)      In the event of (i) any interruption of essential
                 utilities or services due to Landlord's gross negligence or
                 willful misconduct or a failure of the base Building HVAC
                 System to meet the HVAC specifications set forth on Exhibit F,
                 which interruption or failure continues for more than two (2)
                 consecutive business days, or (ii) any interruption of
                 essential utilities or services not due to Landlord's gross
                 negligence or willful misconduct which continues for more than
                 five (5) consecutive business days, then, provided such
                 interruption or failure shall render a material portion of the
                 Premises untenantable, all Rent and Additional Rent payable
                 hereunder with respect to such portion of the Premises shall
                 thereafter be abated until such portion of the Premises is
                 tenantable.  Landlord shall proceed with due diligence to
                 remedy any such interruption as promptly as reasonably
                 feasible.

                 (3)      Throughout the Lease Term, the Building shall be
                 managed and operated in a manner commensurate with the
                 standards prevailing for other first-class office buildings of
                 comparable age, equipment and facilities in the Fair Oaks/Fair
                 Lakes sub-market of Fairfax County, Virginia (such standard
                 being referred to herein as "first-class").

                 (4)      Landlord shall not employ any cleaning contractor for
                 the Building without Tenant's prior written approval (Tenant
                 hereby agreeing not to unreasonably withhold, condition or
                 delay such consent).  In the event Tenant determines that the
                 janitorial services being furnished by Landlord are
                 unsatisfactory, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, Tenant shall
                 deliver written notice to Landlord specifying the manner in
                 which the services are deemed by Tenant to be deficient.  If
                 the deficiencies are not, in Tenant's reasonable judgment,
                 substantially corrected during the next succeeding thirty (30)
                 days after delivery of such deficiency notice, then Tenant may
                 deliver a further notice to Landlord advising Landlord of such
                 fact and Landlord shall terminate the contract for janitorial
                 services to the Building.  Promptly thereafter, Landlord shall
                 enter into a new contract for janitorial services to the
                 Building with a contractor approved by Tenant (Tenant hereby
                 agreeing not to unreasonably withhold, condition or delay such
                 approval).

                 (5)      It is acknowledged that the initial management agent
                 for the Building will be Trammell Crow Real Estate Services,
                 Inc. ("TC").  Landlord shall not employ any other management
                 agent for the Building who is not, in Landlord's reasonable
                 discretion, a first-class property management agent.  In the
                 event Tenant determines that the manager of the Building
                 (whether TC or any other manager) is not operating the
                 Building in a first class manner, in Tenant's reasonable
                 judgment, then Tenant may deliver written notice to Landlord
                 specifying the manner in which the operation of the Building
                 is deemed deficient.  Landlord agrees to consider, in good
                 faith, any bona fide complaint Tenant may have with regard to
                 the managing agent of the Property and, to the extent Landlord
                 in its reasonable business judgment agrees with Tenant's
                 complaint, Landlord





                                       10

                 shall institute reasonable measures to cure such complaint.

                 (6)      Landlord shall not adopt or materially modify an
                 annual operating budget for the Building without first
                 reviewing said budget with Tenant.  Landlord agrees to consult
                 with Tenant at Tenant's request from time to time about the
                 services being furnished hereunder to the Building.  In the
                 event Tenant at any time requests that Landlord adjust (either
                 to increase or to decrease) the level of services being
                 furnished to the Property, Landlord agrees to confer with
                 Tenant about such request and to make any reasonable
                 adjustment requested by Tenant that (i) does not materially
                 impair the overall operation of the Building, (ii) does not
                 prohibit Landlord from carrying out sound maintenance
                 practices in keeping with industry standards for comparable
                 properties, and (iii) does not otherwise adversely affect the
                 Building or Property or the value thereof; provided that, (x)
                 Tenant shall have no right to decrease the level of services
                 to be provided to the portions of the Property excluding the
                 Premises if Tenant is then leasing less than all of the
                 Building, and (y) if Tenant is leasing less than all of the
                 Building, Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses associated
                 with any increase in services (whether by addition of new
                 services or increase in the level of existing services, any
                 capital improvement costs associated therewith being amortized
                 over the shorter of the useful life of such capital
                 improvement(s) or the period constituting the remainder of the
                 Lease Term for which Tenant is obligated, with interest
                 thereon at the Prime Rate immediately prior to such costs
                 being incurred), if and then only to the extent, Landlord
                 reasonably determines (and so informs Tenant prior to
                 implementing the new or increased level of service) that the
                 level of services requested by Tenant exceeds the level of
                 services commonly provided in other first-class office
                 buildings in the Fair Oaks/Fair Lakes submarket of Fairfax
                 County, Virginia.

                 (7)      Tenant shall have the right to participate in any
                 discussions or communications between Landlord and the local
                 electric power company concerning the designation of an
                 electricity rate schedule for the Building, and Landlord
                 agrees to use reasonable efforts to provide Tenant reasonable
                 prior notice of any planned meeting between Landlord and power
                 company representatives to discuss such issue.

         (D)     Utilities.  Except for utilities for which Tenant contracts
                 directly, Landlord shall pay all utility bills incurred for
                 water, gas, electricity, fuel, light, heat and power.  Except
                 as otherwise set forth in Section 5(C)(2), Landlord shall not
                 be liable for any failure to furnish, or for any loss, injury
                 or damage caused by or resulting from any variation,
                 interruption or failure of utilities or services.

         (E)     Compliance with Laws.

                      (1)         Tenant, at Tenant's sole expense, shall
                 comply with all laws, rules, orders, ordinances, directions,
                 regulations and requirements of federal, state, county, and
                 municipal authorities now in force or which may hereafter be
                 in force, which shall impose any duty upon Landlord or Tenant
                 with respect to Tenant's particular use, occupancy or
                 alteration of the Premises (as distinct from office use
                 generally).  Without limiting the foregoing, and
                 notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary,
                 Tenant shall be solely responsible for obtaining and
                 maintaining all necessary governmental and quasi-governmental
                 approvals, consents, licenses and permits  (Tenant hereby
                 agreeing to provide copies thereof to Landlord upon receipt)
                 for all Ancillary Uses, and conducting such Ancillary Uses  in
                 full compliance with all applicable laws, codes and
                 regulations at all times (including, but not limited to, the
                 requirements of any board of fire underwriters or other
                 similar body now or hereafter constituted, and health and
                 safety codes).

                      (2)         Landlord agrees to comply with all laws,
                 rules, orders, ordinances, directions, regulations and
                 requirements of federal, state, county, and municipal
                 authorities now in force or which may hereafter be in force
                 and applicable to the Property, excluding, however, any such
                 law, rule, order, ordinance, direction, regulation or
                 requirement which shall impose any duty

                 upon Landlord or Tenant with respect to Tenant's particular
                 use, occupancy or alteration of the Premises (as distinct from
                 office use generally); provided that, (i) Landlord shall be
                 entitled to utilize any "grandfathering" or other exclusion or
                 exception from compliance which may be lawfully available,
                 (ii) Landlord shall have no obligation to cause any area of or
                 equipment in the Premises (or portion of either), which Tenant
                 intends to alter, modify, improve, demolish or remove as part
                 of the Building Fit-Out, to comply with such laws, rules,
                 orders, ordinances, directions, regulations or requirements,
                 and (iii) Tenant shall be solely responsible for compliance
                 with all laws, rules, orders, ordinances, directions,
                 regulations and requirements pertaining to the Ancillary Uses.
                 Except to the extent incurred in connection with the
                 performance of the Landlord's Work or incurred in order to
                 cure a violation of law  which is required to be corrected
                 prior to the Commencement Date, all costs, expenses and fees
                 (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' and
                 consultants' fees) incurred in connection with the performance
                 of Landlord's obligations pursuant to this Section 5(E)(2)
                 shall be included in Operating Expenses.

         (F)     Condition of Premises.

                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
                 Tenant shall keep, maintain and preserve the Premises in a
                 first class condition at all times except for ordinary wear
                 and  tear, and except for damage or destruction due to
                 casualty or condemnation which Landlord is required to repair;
                 provided that, this sentence shall not be deemed to require or
                 authorize Tenant to perform any repairs or alterations which
                 are Landlord's obligation hereunder.  Except as otherwise set
                 forth herein, Landlord agrees to maintain and repair the
                 Building in accordance with Section 13 hereof.

         (G)     Operating Expenses Defined.

                 Operating Expenses shall mean all costs and expenses incurred
                 by Landlord in connection with the maintenance, repair,

                 provided by Landlord hereunder), determined in accordance with
                 sound accounting principles prevailing in the insurance and

                 three (3) years of the Initial Term, not to exceed two percent
                 (2%) of gross aggregate Rent and Additional Rent due

                 over the useful life of the improvement, with interest at the
                 Prime Rate immediately prior to Landlord incurring such
                 capital expenditures) for capital expenditures made by
                 Landlord that are (i) required in order to comply with changes
                 in laws (exclusive of capital improvements to be performed by
                 Landlord pursuant to Exhibits B-2 and/or B-3), or (ii)
                 reasonably expected to result in a net decrease in Operating
                 Expenses; (g) salaries, wages, benefits and other expenses of
                 Building personnel (except as excluded below); (h) legal fees

                 service not provided to the Property on the Commencement Date
                 but thereafter provided by Landlord in the prudent management
                 of the Property; (j) charges for janitorial, char and cleaning

                 lenders or ground lessors, or in connection with the sale or

                 interest therein; (f) salaries, wages, fringe benefits or
                 other compensation paid or provided to executives of Landlord

                 to the extent of their direct involvement in the management of
                 the Building, Landlord and Tenant hereby confirming their
                 intent that Operating Expenses shall exclude all salaries,
                 wages and fringe benefits or other compensation paid to
                 executives or other personnel to the extent attributable to
                 the performance of duties above the level of building
                 manager); (g) the cost of any goods or services purchased from
                 an individual or entity which is a parent, subsidiary or
                 affiliate which controls, is controlled by, or is under common
                 control with, Landlord to the extent such cost exceeds the
                 cost that would be incurred in an arm's-length transaction
                 with an unrelated party; (h) any cost to the extent reimbursed
                 by the proceeds of insurance, condemnation award, refund,
                 credit or warranty; (i) legal and other costs (including the
                 prepayment of any indebtedness) incurred in connection with

                 original construction costs for the Property; (k) payments for
                 equipment rented under long-term leases which would constitute
                 capital expenditures if such equipment were purchased (except
                 to the extent the same would constitute a capital expenditure
                 permitted to be included in Operating Expenses pursuant to
                 this Section 5); (l) any fines or penalties incurred as a
                 result of a violation by Landlord of any legal requirements or
                 any of its obligations and duties hereunder (except to the
                 extent caused by Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents); (m)
                 interest or penalties arising by reason of Landlord's failure
                 to pay any Operating Expenses when due (except to the extent
                 caused by Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents); (n) reserves for
                 replacements or repairs; (o) accounting fees not incurred in
                 connection with the operation and management of the Property
                 or the preparation of any statements required under this
                 Lease; (p) the cost of any personnel, materials or services
                 shared by the Building and any other buildings owned or
                 operated by Landlord, to the extent reasonably allocable to
                 such other buildings; (q) any cost, expense or fee incurred
                 for any item included in Operating Expenses (other than
                 insurance premiums, utility charges, and goods and services
                 specifically purchased at Tenant's request), to the extent
                 such cost, expense or fee exceeds the range of fair market
                 value for the goods or services in question; and (r) at any
                 time that Tenant is not leasing the entire Building, the cost

                 than is furnished to the Premises.

     (H)         Tenant's Audit Right.

                 (1)      In the event Tenant desires to review or audit any
                 annual statement of actual Operating Expenses and/or Taxes,
                 Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing within one hundred
                 eighty (180) days of receiving such statement (failing which,
                 such statement shall be deemed conclusive).  Not earlier than
                 twenty (20) days, nor later than one hundred twenty (120) days
                 after such notice is delivered to Landlord, Tenant shall have
                 the right to inspect and review, or to cause an independent,
                 certified public accountant employed by Tenant to inspect and
                 audit Landlord's books and records relating to the calendar
                 year to which the statement relates, at the Washington, D.C.
                 metropolitan area office of Landlord's managing agent during
                 regular business hours.  In the event Tenant elects to employ
                 a certified public accountant for purposes of conducting such
                 inspection and review, such certified public account shall
                 have at least five (5) years experience as a certified public
                 accountant; provided that, no such certified public accountant
                 shall be compensated on a contingency fee basis.

                 (2)      Tenant shall provide Landlord not less than twenty
                 (20) days notice of the date on which Tenant or Tenant's
                 accountant desires to examine Landlord's books and records
                 during regular business hours.  Prior to the performance of
                 such examination, Tenant and, if applicable, Tenant's
                 certified public accountant each shall execute a reasonable
                 form of non-disclosure agreement providing that the
                 information disclosed in connection with such examination be
                 kept confidential.  Tenant shall cause the results of such
                 examination to be communicated in writing to Landlord.





                                       13
<PAGE>
                 (3)      If Landlord does not agree with the examination
                 results submitted by Tenant, Landlord's accountant and Tenant
                 (or, if applicable, Tenant's certified public accountant)
                 shall endeavor to resolve any differences.  If such parties
                 are unable to resolve all differences within sixty (60) days,
                 Landlord and Tenant shall select an independent, certified
                 public accountant who satisfies the criteria set forth above
                 (but failing agreement, either party may request such
                 appointment be made by the American Arbitration Association or
                 any recognized successor thereto) to resolve the same.  Such
                 jointly selected accountant, after executing a reasonable form
                 of non-disclosure agreement, shall make an independent audit
                 of the unresolved issue(s), the results of which shall be
                 binding on Landlord and Tenant.

                 (4)      If such independent audit shows that the amounts paid
                 by Tenant to Landlord on account of Operating Expenses and/or
                 Taxes exceeded the amounts to which Landlord was entitled
                 hereunder, Landlord shall promptly credit the amount of such
                 excess against Tenant's next due Rent payment.  If such audit
                 shows that the amounts paid by Tenant to Landlord on account
                 of Operating Expenses and/or Taxes were less than the amounts
                 to which Landlord was entitled hereunder, Tenant shall pay to
                 Landlord the amount of such shortfall within thirty (30) days
                 of the date Tenant is notified of the error.  Except as
                 otherwise expressly provided below, all costs and expenses of
                 Tenant's audit (including, without limitation, reasonable
                 copying charges) shall be paid by Tenant.  In addition, Tenant
                 shall be responsible for the costs incurred in connection with
                 the third accountant (including, without limitation,
                 reasonable copying charges) unless such audit discloses that
                 the amounts paid by Tenant to Landlord for the year in
                 question exceeded the amounts to which Landlord was entitled
                 by more than three percent (3%), in which event Landlord shall
                 promptly reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs and
                 expenses incurred in connection with Tenant's audit and such
                 third accountant.  Landlord shall pay any accountant employed
                 by it to act as Landlord's accountant.

6.       ADDITIONAL RENT.

         (A)     It is understood that the Rent set forth in Section 3(A) (as
                 adjusted pursuant to Section 3(B)) was negotiated with the
                 agreement that Tenant will pay, in addition to the Rent
                 specified in Section 3(A) (as adjusted pursuant to Section
                 3(B)), Tenant's Proportionate Share (as herein defined) of all
                 Taxes and Operating Expenses pertaining to the Property from
                 and after the Phase II Rent Commencement Date.  As used
                 herein, the term "Tenant's Proportionate Share" shall mean the
                 ratio of the total rentable square footage of Premises (as the
                 same may be decreased pursuant to Section 2(B)(ix)) to the
                 total rentable square footage of the Building (as such amounts
                 are calculated pursuant to the attached Exhibit A-14) (the
                 parties hereby acknowledging that, until an adjustment to the
                 rentable area of the Premises pursuant to Section 2(B)(ix),
                 Tenant's Proportionate Share shall mean one hundred percent
                 (100%)).  On or before January 1st of each calendar year
                 commencing during the Lease Term or as soon as practicable
                 thereafter, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a reasonable
                 estimate of the Taxes and Operating Expenses for the calendar
                 year in question.  The estimate, and each annual statement of
                 Taxes and Operating Expenses, shall include a line item
                 expense for each category of Operating Expenses and Taxes.
                 Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Tenant's Proportionate Share
                 of the estimate of such Taxes and Operating Expenses in equal
                 monthly installments at the same time and place as Rent is to
                 be paid.  Landlord will furnish a statement of the actual
                 Taxes and Operating Expenses for each year during the Lease
                 Term no later than April 1st of the following year.  In the
                 event that Landlord is, for any reason, unable to furnish the
                 statement of the actual Taxes and Operating Expenses within
                 the time specified above, Landlord will furnish such statement
                 as soon thereafter as practicable (but no later than May 1st
                 of each year) and such statement shall have the same force and
                 effect as if delivered within the time specified above.
                 Tenant will pay to Landlord any excess of the Tenant's
                 Proportionate Share of the total amount of Taxes and Operating
                 Expenses for each year above the estimated payments made by
                 Tenant with respect thereto, as shown by such statement,
                 within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement.
                 Landlord shall refund to Tenant any excess (as shown by such
                 statement) of the estimated





                                       14
<PAGE>
                 payments by Tenant above the Tenant's Proportionate Share of
                 the total Taxes and Operating Expenses within thirty (30) days
                 of the date of the statement; provided that, Landlord's
                 obligation to refund any such excess shall be suspended for
                 the duration of any default by Tenant hereunder.  Landlord
                 will keep books and records showing the Taxes and Operating
                 Expenses in accordance with sound accounting principles
                 prevailing in the real estate and insurance industries,
                 consistently applied.

         (B)     For the period commencing on the Phase I Rent Commencement
                 Date, or any earlier date (the "Phase I Early Operation Date")
                 on which Tenant commences to operate its business in the
                 Premises, or subleases or otherwise utilizes all or a portion
                 of the Phase I Premises for purposes other than the Building
                 Fit-Out, and ending on December 31st of the calendar year in
                 which the Phase I Rent Commencement Date shall occur, Tenant
                 shall pay to Landlord the product (the "1997 Phase I Tax and
                 Operating Expense Payment") of (i) the rentable area of the
                 Phase I Premises, multiplied by (ii) Six and fifty/one
                 hundredths Dollars ($6.50) per annum (pro-rated on a daily
                 basis according to the number of days in such calendar year
                 which are included in the Lease Term), in equal monthly
                 installments; provided that, in the event the Phase I Early
                 Operation Date shall occur prior to the Phase I Rent
                 Commencement Date, the 1997 Phase I Tax and Operating Expense
                 Payment allocable to the period commencing on such Phase I
                 Early Operation Date and ending on the day preceding the Phase
                 I Rent Commencement Date shall be calculated (subject to daily
                 pro-ration as aforesaid, if applicable) by multiplying (i) the
                 sum of the entire rentable area of each floor of the Phase I
                 Premises on which Tenant has commenced to operate its
                 business, or has subleased or otherwise utilized all or a
                 portion of the floor for purposes other than the Building
                 Fit-Out (whether or not such entire floor is so utilized), by
                 (ii) Six and fifty/one hundredths Dollars ($6.50). Landlord
                 and Tenant hereby acknowledge that the foregoing amounts are
                 based on the parties' agreed estimate that the Taxes and
                 Operating Expenses for said calendar year will be
                 approximately Six and fifty/one hundred Dollars ($6.50) per
                 rentable square foot.

         (C)     In the event Tenant shall, prior to January 1, 1998, commence
                 to operate its business in the Phase II Premises or shall
                 sublease or otherwise utilize all or a portion of the Phase II
                 Premises for purposes other than the Building Fit-Out ("Early
                 Use"), Tenant shall, in addition to the 1997 Phase I Tax and
                 Operating Expense Payment, pay to Landlord, with respect to
                 the period commencing on the first (1st) day of such Early Use
                 and ending on December 31, 1997, the product (the "1997 Phase
                 II Tax and Operating Expense Payment") equal (subject to daily
                 pro-ration as aforesaid, if applicable) to (i) the sum of the
                 entire rentable area of each floor of the Phase II Premises on
                 which Tenant has commenced such Early Use (whether or not such
                 entire floor is being utilized for such Early Use), multiplied
                 by (ii) Six and fifty/one hundredths Dollars ($6.50) per
                 annum.  Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that the
                 foregoing amount is based on the parties' agreed estimate that
                 the Taxes and Operating Expenses for said calendar year will
                 be approximately Six and fifty/one hundred Dollars ($6.50) per
                 rentable square foot.

         (D)     Actual Taxes and Operating Expenses for calendar year 1997
                 shall be reconciled against estimated payment(s) pursuant to
                 the foregoing Section 6(B) and/or 6(C) in accordance with the
                 procedure set forth in Section 6(A).

         (E)     In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord
                 upon demand for all reasonable costs, expenses and fees
                 incurred by or on behalf of Landlord as a result of the
                 Building Fit-Out during any period commencing after the Phase
                 I Rent Commencement Date (including, but not limited to, any
                 increase in Building utility costs).

         (F)     Any and all payments (other than Rent) required to be made by
                 Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be deemed additional Rent
                 ("Additional Rent").  Landlord shall have the same rights and
                 remedies for said payments as for Rent.





                                       15
<PAGE>
         (G)     In the event that, at any time when Tenant is leasing less
                 than the entire Building, Landlord furnishes any utility or
                 service which is included in Operating Expenses to less than
                 ninety-five percent (95%) of the rentable area of the Property
                 because (i) the average occupancy of the Property for the year
                 in question was not equal to or greater than ninety-five
                 percent (95%), (ii) such utility or service is not required by
                 or provided to one or more of the tenants of the Property, or
                 (iii) any tenant occupant is itself obtaining or providing any
                 such utility or services, then Operating Expenses for such
                 year shall be adjusted to include all additional costs,
                 expenses and disbursements that Landlord reasonably determines
                 would have been incurred if Landlord had provided such
                 utilities and services to all rentable areas of the Property.
                 The intent of this section is to ensure that the reimbursement
                 of Operating Expenses is fairly and equitably allocated among
                 the tenants receiving the utilities and services in question.

7.       SORTING AND SEPARATION OF REFUSE AND TRASH.

         (A)     Tenant covenants and agrees, at Tenant's sole cost and
                 expense, to comply with all applicable present and future
                 laws, orders and regulations of all state, federal, municipal
                 and local governments, departments, commissions and boards
                 regarding the collection, sorting, separation and recycling of
                 waste products, garbage, refuse and trash.  Without limiting
                 the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall prepare and
                 submit for Landlord's approval (not to be unreasonably
                 withheld, conditioned or delayed) a recycling plan for the
                 Building which complies with applicable law, and Tenant shall
                 comply with the approved recycling plan.  Neither Landlord's
                 review of the Tenant's recycling plan nor any coordination
                 therewith by Landlord shall constitute a warranty by Landlord
                 regarding the compliance of such recycling plan with
                 applicable laws, regulations, codes or governmental or
                 quasi-governmental requirements, nor shall Landlord have any
                 liability with regard to such recycling plan.  Tenant shall
                 sort and separate waste products, garbage, refuge and trash
                 into such categories as provided by law.  Each separately
                 sorted category of waste products, garbage, refuse and trash
                 shall be placed in separate receptacles provided by Tenant and
                 reasonably approved by the Landlord.  Such separate
                 receptacles may, at Landlord's option, be removed from the
                 Premises in accordance with a collection schedule prescribed
                 by law or by Landlord.

         (B)     Landlord reserves the right to refuse to collect or accept
                 from Tenant any waste products, garbage, refuse or trash that
                 is not separated and sorted as required by law, and to require
                 Tenant to arrange for such collection at Tenant's sole cost
                 and expense, utilizing a contractor satisfactory to Landlord.
                 Tenant shall pay all costs, expenses, fines, penalties or
                 damages that may be imposed on Landlord or Tenant by reason of
                 Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Section
                 7.  Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall
                 indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless (including
                 reasonable legal fees and expenses) from and against any
                 actions, claims and suits arising from such noncompliance,
                 utilizing counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.

8.       HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.

         (A)     The term "Hazardous Substances" shall mean pollutants,
                 contaminants, toxic or hazardous wastes, chemicals or
                 materials, or any other substances, the use, storage,
                 manufacture, disposal and/or the removal of which is required
                 or the use of which is restricted, prohibited or penalized by
                 any "Environmental Law", which term shall mean any federal,
                 state or local law, regulation, order, ordinance or other
                 statute of a governmental or quasi-governmental authority
                 relating to pollution or protection of the environment.
                 Tenant hereby agrees that:  (A) no activity will be conducted
                 by Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents on the Property or
                 Premises that will produce, utilize or otherwise involve the
                 manufacture, use, storage or disposal of any Hazardous
                 Substances, except for those Permitted Materials permitted
                 pursuant to Section 4 hereof; (B) no portion of the Property
                 or the Premises will be used by Tenant or any of Tenant's
                 Agents as a landfill or a dump; (C) neither Tenant nor any of
                 Tenant's Agents will install any underground tanks of any
                 type; (D) neither Tenant nor any of Tenant's Agents will cause
                 or authorize any





                                       16

                 surface or subsurface conditions to exist or come into
                 existence that constitute, or with the passage of time may
                 constitute a public or private nuisance; and (E) neither
                 Tenant nor any of Tenant's Agents will cause or authorize any
                 Hazardous Substances to be brought onto the Property or
                 Premises, except for the Permitted Materials described above,
                 and if so brought or found located thereon, the same shall be
                 immediately removed, with proper disposal, and all required
                 cleanup procedures shall be diligently undertaken by Tenant
                 pursuant to all Environmental Laws.  Landlord or Landlord's
                 representatives shall have the right (after reasonable advance
                 notice except in the event of an emergency (in which event no
                 notice shall be required)), but not the obligation, to enter
                 the Premises for the purpose of inspecting the storage, use
                 and disposal of Permitted Materials to verify compliance with
                 all Environmental Laws.  Should it be determined, in
                 Landlord's reasonable opinion, that Permitted Materials are
                 being improperly stored, used, or disposed of, then Tenant
                 shall immediately take such corrective action as is reasonably
                 requested by Landlord.  Should Tenant fail to commence to take
                 such corrective action within 24 hours, Landlord shall have
                 the right (but not the obligation) to perform such work and
                 Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for any and all
                 reasonable costs associated with said work.  If at any time
                 during or after the Lease Term, the Property is found to be
                 contaminated or subject to such surface or subsurface
                 conditions then, to the extent caused by the acts or omissions
                 of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents or any third party on
                 behalf of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents, Tenant shall
                 diligently institute proper and thorough cleanup procedures at
                 Tenant's sole cost.  Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and
                 hold harmless Landlord, its lenders, any managing agents and
                 leasing agents of the Property, and their respective agents,
                 partners, officers, directors and employees, from all claims,
                 demands, actions, liabilities, reasonable costs, reasonable
                 expenses, penalties (whether civil or criminal), damages
                 (actual or punitive) and obligations of any nature to the
                 extent arising from or as a result of any violation of this
                 Section 8(A).  The foregoing indemnification and the
                 responsibilities of Tenant shall survive the termination or
                 expiration of this Lease.

         (B)     Except with regard to the use, storage and disposal of
                 Hazardous Substances utilized in the ordinary course of the
                 maintenance, repair and/or operation of the Property
                 ("Landlord's Permitted Substances"), Landlord agrees that it
                 will be fully responsible for all costs, expenses, damages or
                 liabilities which may occur from the use, storage, disposal,
                 release, spill or discharge of Hazardous Substances by
                 Landlord or its agents, representatives, employees or
                 contractors and it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
                 Tenant and its agents, partners, officers, directors,
                 employees and contractors from all claims, demands, actions,
                 liabilities, reasonable costs, reasonable expenses, penalties
                 (whether civil or criminal), damages (actual or punitive) and
                 obligations of any nature to the extent arising from or as a
                 result of any violation of this Section 8(B). The foregoing
                 indemnification and the responsibilities of Landlord shall
                 survive the termination or expiration of this Lease.

         (C)     During and after the Lease Term, Tenant and Landlord shall
                 each promptly provide the other with copies of all summons,
                 citations, directives, information inquiries or requests,
                 notices of potential responsibility, notices of violation or
                 deficiency, orders or decrees, claims, complaints,
                 investigations, judgments, letters, notices of environmental
                 liens, and other communications, issued or threatened in
                 writing, from the United States Environmental Protection
                 Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
                 Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Environmental Quality,
                 or other federal, state or local agency or authority, or any
                 other entity or individual, whether public or private,
                 concerning (i) any Hazardous Substance regarding the Property
                 or the Premises; (ii) the imposition of any environmental lien
                 on the Property or the Premises; or (iii) any alleged

                 coverage for flood, earthquake and boiler and machinery (if
                 applicable).  Such coverage (except for flood and earthquake)
                 shall be written on a replacement cost basis equal to ninety
                 percent (90%) of the full insurable replacement value of the
                 foregoing and shall not cover Tenant's equipment, trade
                 fixtures, inventory, fixtures, alterations or personal
                 property located on or in the Premises.

                          (2)     Commercial general liability insurance
                 against any and all claims for bodily injury and property

                 insurance shall have the combined single limit of not less
                 than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence per
                 location with a Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate
                 limit.

                          (3)     Such other insurance as Landlord deems
                 necessary and prudent, or as required by Landlord's
                 beneficiaries or mortgagees of any deed of trust or mortgage
                 encumbering the Property.

         (B)     INSURANCE BY TENANT.  Tenant shall, during the Lease Term,
                 procure and keep in force the following insurance:

                          (1)     Commercial general liability insurance,
                 naming Landlord and Landlord's managing agent for the Property
                 as additional insureds against any and all claims for bodily
                 injury and property damage occurring in, or about the Property

                 umbrella liability insurance in the amount of Ten Million
                 Dollars ($10,000,000).  Such liability insurance shall be
                 primary and not contributing to any insurance available to
                 Landlord and Landlord's insurance shall be in excess thereto.
                 In no event shall the limits of such insurance be considered
                 as limiting the liability of Tenant under this lease.

                          (2)     Personal property insurance insuring all
                 equipment, trade fixtures, inventory, fixtures and personal

                 the cause of loss - special form (all risk) and in addition,
                 coverage for flood, earthquake and boiler and machinery (if
                 applicable).  Such insurance shall be written on a replacement
                 cost basis in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
                 the full replacement value of the aggregate of the foregoing.

                          (3)     Workers' compensation insurance in accordance
                 with statutory law and employers' liability insurance with a

                 employee.

                          (4)     Such other insurance as Landlord deems
                 necessary and prudent, or as required by Landlord's
                 beneficiaries or mortgagees of any deed of trust or mortgage
                 encumbering the Property, and customarily maintained by
                 comparable tenants engaged in comparable uses.

                          The policies required to be maintained by Tenant
                 shall be issued by companies rated AX or better (or
                 equivalent, from time to time) in the most current issue of
                 Best's Insurance Reports (or any recognized successor
                 thereto), and licensed to do business in the state in which
                 the Property is located and domiciled in the USA.  Deductible
                 amounts under Tenant's insurance policies shall not exceed
                 Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00).  Certificates of
                 insurance (certified copies of the policies may be required)
                 shall be delivered to Landlord prior to the Commencement Date
                 and annually thereafter at least thirty (30) days prior to the
                 expiration date





                                       18
<PAGE>
                 of the old policy.  Tenant shall have the right to provide
                 insurance coverage which it is obligated to carry pursuant to
                 the terms hereof in a blanket policy, provided such blanket
                 policy expressly affords coverage to the Property, the
                 Premises, and to Landlord as required by this Lease.  Each
                 policy of insurance shall provide notification to Landlord at
                 least thirty (30) days prior to any cancellation or
                 modification to reduce the insurance coverage.  Tenant hereby
                 agrees to pay to Landlord as liquidated damages an amount
                 equal to Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day for each
                 day on which Tenant fails to deliver to Landlord a current
                 certificate(s) evidencing that the insurance required pursuant
                 to this Section is being maintained, after not less than
                 forty-eight (48) hours notice from Landlord that it has not
                 been provided a current certificate of insurance.

                          In the event Tenant does not purchase the insurance
                 required by this Lease or keep the same in full force and
                 effect, Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to) purchase
                 the required insurance and pay the premium.  The Tenant shall
                 repay to Landlord promptly upon demand as Additional Rent, the
                 amount so paid.  In addition, Landlord may recover from Tenant
                 and Tenant agrees to pay, as Additional Rent, any and all
                 reasonable expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable
                 attorneys' fee) and damages which Landlord may sustain by
                 reason of the failure of Tenant to obtain and maintain such
                 insurance.

         (C)     SUBROGATION.  Landlord and Tenant mutually waive their
                 respective rights of recovery against each other for any loss
                 of, or damage to, their respective property, to the extent
                 that such loss or damage is (or is required hereby to be)
                 insured against by an insurance policy at the time of such
                 loss or damage or, with respect to Landlord, is self-insured.
                 Each party shall obtain any special endorsements (if required
                 by its insurance policy) whereby the insurer waives its rights
                 of subrogation against the other party.  This clause shall not
                 apply in those cases where waiver of subrogation would cause
                 either parties' insurance to be voided or otherwise made
                 uncollectible.

10.      DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.

         If the Premises shall be (i) materially damaged or destroyed during
         the last year of the Lease Term (inclusive of any Extension Period for
         which an Extension Option was exercised prior to such damage or
         destruction), or (ii) damaged or destroyed to such extent that the
         damage or destruction cannot be repaired within a period of three
         hundred sixty-five (365) days of the date of such damage or
         destruction, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by
         written notice delivered to the other within sixty (60) days of the
         date of such damage or destruction (and in such event this Lease shall
         terminate as of date of such damage or destruction as if such date
         were the Expiration Date hereof).  In addition, Landlord, at its sole
         option, shall have the right to cancel and terminate this Lease, by
         written notice delivered to Tenant not later than sixty (60) days
         after the date of damage or destruction, in the event the Premises is
         damaged or destroyed during the last five (5) years of the Lease Term
         (inclusive of any Extension Period for which an Extension Option was
         exercised prior to such damage or destruction) and Tenant shall fail
         to execute and deliver to Landlord upon request an extension of the
         Lease Term equal to the amount of time by which the remaining Lease
         Term (exclusive of any Extension Period for which the applicable
         Extension Option was not exercised prior to such damage or
         destruction, and further excluding the estimated time to rebuild or
         restore the Premises)  is less than five (5) years, upon the same
         terms and conditions set forth herein except that the Rent for the
         period of such extension shall equal the then-escalated Rent in effect
         immediately prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, subject to
         escalation in the same manner in effect immediately prior to the
         expiration of the Lease Term.  If this Lease is not terminated, then
         Landlord shall repair and restore the Premises (exclusive of Tenant's
         equipment, trade fixtures, inventory, fixtures and personal property)
         with all reasonable speed to substantially the same condition as
         immediately prior to such damage or destruction, and the Rent or a
         just and proportionate part thereof, according to Tenant's ability to
         utilize the Premises in its damaged condition, shall be abated until
         the Premises shall have been repaired and restored by Landlord.

11.      INDEMNIFICATION.





                                       19
<PAGE>
         Tenant shall defend, and hereby does indemnify and hold Landlord
         harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages,
         expenses, fees, liabilities, losses or suits arising from or out of,
         or in connection with (i)  injury or death to any person in, on or
         about the Premises, (ii) damage to or loss of use of any property
         arising out of any occurrence in, on or about the Premises, (iii) the
         use, condition, occupational safety or occupancy of the Property or
         Premises, to the extent attributable to the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents, and/or (iv)
         any default by Tenant in the performance of its obligations under this
         Lease (including, but not limited to Exhibit H); provided that, Tenant
         shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold Landlord
         harmless with regard to any matter to the extent caused by the
         negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents or
         employees.  Such indemnifications shall, among other things, include
         and apply to reasonable attorneys' fees, investigation costs, and
         other costs actually incurred by or on behalf of Landlord.  The
         provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the expiration or
         termination of this Lease with respect to any matter, circumstance or
         event which occurred or relates to any period ending prior to such
         expiration or termination.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth
         herein to the contrary, this Lease is made on the express conditions
         that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Landlord
         shall not be liable for, or suffer loss by reason of, injury to person
         or property, from whatever cause, in any way connected with the
         condition, use, occupational safety or occupancy of the Premises,
         specifically including, without limitation, any liability for injury
         to the person or property of Tenant or Tenant's Agents.  Landlord
         shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant from and against all
         costs, damages, injury, claims, liabilities, expenses (including
         reasonable attorneys' fees), losses and court costs arising from or as
         a result of any breach of Landlord's duties or obligations hereunder
         or of any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its
         agents, representatives employees or contractors acting within the
         scope of their employment or engagement.

12.      ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

         (A)     Tenant shall not assign this Lease, or sublet all or any
                 portion of  the Premises, or permit the use or occupancy of
                 the Premises by any party other than Tenant, without the prior
                 written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be
                 unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Tenant shall
                 not encumber, mortgage, pledge, license, hypothecate or
                 otherwise transfer the Premises or this Lease (except as set
                 forth in the preceding sentence) without the prior written
                 consent of Landlord, which may be granted or withheld in
                 Landlord's sole discretion.

         (B)     Tenant must request Landlord's consent to an assignment or
                 sublease in writing at least twenty (20) days prior to the
                 commencement date of the proposed sublease or assignment,
                 which request must include (a) the name and address of the
                 proposed assignee or subtenant, (b) the nature and character
                 of the business of the proposed assignee or subtenant, (c)
                 financial information (including financial statements, if
                 available) of the proposed assignee or subtenant, and (d) a
                 copy of the proposed sublet or assignment agreement, which
                 must be in substance and form reasonably acceptable to
                 Landlord.  Tenant shall also provide any additional
                 information Landlord reasonably requests regarding such
                 proposed assignment or subletting.  Within seven (7) business
                 days after Landlord receives Tenant's request (with all
                 required information included), Landlord shall notify Tenant
                 if it wishes to deny its consent to such proposed assignment
                 or subletting.  In the event Landlord shall fail to respond to
                 Tenant within such period of time, Tenant may deliver to
                 Landlord a second (2nd) request for such consent, which notice
                 shall specifically state that the failure by Landlord to
                 respond within five (5) business days shall be deemed
                 Landlord's election to grant its consent thereto, and in the
                 absence of a response to such second (2nd) notice, Landlord
                 shall be deemed to have granted its consent thereto.

         (C)     Each sublease and/or assignment is also subject to all of the
                 following terms and conditions:

                                  (1)      If Landlord approves an assignment
                          or sublease as herein provided, Tenant shall pay to
                          Landlord as Additional Rent fifty percent (50%) of
                          the amount, if any, by which the rent, any additional
                          rent and any other sums paid by the assignee or
                          subtenant to Tenant under





                                       20
<PAGE>
                          such assignment or sublease (after deducting
                          therefrom the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
                          by Tenant in the subject transaction, including, but
                          not limited to, brokerage commissions, hard and soft
                          construction expenses, tenant concessions (exclusive
                          of non-cash concessions, such as free rent), and
                          reasonable legal fees) exceeds the total of the Rent
                          plus any Additional Rent payable by Tenant hereunder
                          which is allocable to the portion of the Premises
                          which is the subject of such assignment or sublease.
                          The foregoing payments shall be made on not less than
                          a monthly basis by Tenant.  The foregoing provisions
                          of this Section 12(C)(1) shall be inapplicable to any
                          subletting of the Phase II Premises prior to January
                          1, 1998, but shall apply to any continuation thereof
                          beyond January 1, 1998.

                                  (2)      No consent to any assignment or
                          sublease shall constitute a further waiver of the
                          provisions of this section, and all subsequent
                          assignments or subleases may be made only upon the
                          terms and conditions of this Section 12 and with the
                          prior written consent of Landlord in accordance
                          herewith.  In no event shall any consent by Landlord
                          be construed to permit reassignment or resubletting
                          by a permitted assignee or sublessee.

                                  (3)      No sublease or assignment by Tenant
                          shall relieve Tenant of any liability hereunder.

                                  (4)      Any assignment or sublease without
                          Landlord's prior written consent shall be void, and
                          shall, at the option of the Landlord, constitute an
                          Event of Default under this Lease.

                                  (5)      No assignment or sublease shall be
                          granted for any term which extends beyond the Lease
                          Term, as it may have been theretofore renewed
                          hereunder, unless the portion of the term which
                          extends beyond the Lease Term shall be subject to
                          Tenant's exercise of the applicable Extension
                          Option(s).

                                  (6)      Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon
                          demand for all reasonable costs, expenses and fees
                          incurred by or on behalf of Landlord in connection
                          with any proposed assignment or sublease by Tenant
                          (including, but not limited to, Landlord's reasonable
                          attorneys fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
                          connection with Landlord's review of such sublease or
                          assignment (if any)).

         (D)     The following events shall constitute an "Assignment" which is
                 subject to the terms of this section and for which Landlord's
                 prior written consent is required:  (i) if Tenant is a
                 corporation and any part or all of Tenant's shares of stock,
                 or the shares of stock or other ownership interests of any
                 corporation or other entity owning shares of Tenant's stock,
                 shall in any one or more instances be issued, or transferred
                 by sale, assignment, conveyance, operation of law (including,
                 but not limited to, transfer as a result of or in conjunction
                 with any merger, reorganization or recapitalization) or other
                 disposition, or otherwise changed, so as to result in less
                 than fifty-one (51%) of such shares, or other ownership
                 interests, or less than fifty-one percent (51%) of any class
                 of such shares or other ownership interests, being owned by
                 the present (i.e., as of the date hereof) owners thereof; (ii)
                 if Tenant is a partnership and any general partnership
                 interest(s), or the stock or other ownership interests of any
                 corporation or other entity owning any such general
                 partnership interests(s), in the partnership shall in any one
                 or more instances be issued, or transferred by sale,
                 assignment, conveyance, operation of law (including, but not
                 limited to, transfer as a result of or in conjunction with any
                 merger, reorganization or recapitalization) or other
                 disposition, or otherwise changed, so as to result in less
                 than fifty-one percent (51%) of such general partnership
                 interests(s), stock (or any class of such stock) or other
                 ownership interests being owned by the present (i.e., as of
                 the date hereof) owners thereof; (iii) if Tenant is a limited
                 liability company or any other type of entity, and any
                 interest(s) of any member or other equity owner, or the
                 ownership interests of any entity owning any membership
                 interest(s) or other equity interest in the Tenant, shall in
                 any one or more instances be issued, or transferred by sale,
                 assignment, conveyance, operation of law (including, but not
                 limited to, transfer as a result of or in conjunction with any
                 merger, reorganization or recapitalization) or other
                 disposition, or otherwise changed, so as to result in less

                 percent (51%) of such membership interests or other such
                 equity and/or ownership interests being owned by the present
                 (i.e., as of the date hereof) owners thereof; or (iv) if
                 effective control of the corporation, partnership, limited
                 liability company or other form of Tenant shall be taken from
                 those exercising such control as of the date hereof; provided
                 that, this Section 12(D) shall not be deemed to apply to any
                 corporation the shares of which are traded on a
                 nationally-recognized exchange and which is required to make
                 public disclosures regarding ownership and financial
                 condition.

         (E)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the
                 contrary, American Management Systems, Inc. ("AMS") shall have
                 the right to (1) assign this Lease or to sublet all or any
                 portion of the Premises, in either case without the consent of
                 Landlord, to any affiliate that is wholly-owned by or under
                 common ownership with AMS (as part of a single group of
                 interlocking companies), or to any wholly-owned and controlled
                 division or sub-entity of AMS, or (2) sublease up to one (1)
                 full floor of the Premises to any entity or user that is
                 partially-owned by AMS and in which AMS is an active
                 participant in management and operations, all subject to the
                 following conditions: (a) the proposed assignee or sublessee
                 (the "Transferee") and its business shall be of a type and
                 quality suitable for a first-class office building, (b) the
                 proposed Transferee shall not be a governmental or
                 quasi-governmental authority, a foreign government or
                 international agency or other organization entitled to
                 sovereign or other immunity, (c) neither the proposed
                 assignment or subtenancy, nor the proposed assignee or
                 subtenant, will impose an additional, material burden upon
                 Landlord in its operation of the Property which exceeds the
                 additional burden which Landlord would reasonably suffer if
                 the Building were multi-tenanted, (d) AMS shall notify
                 Landlord not less than ten (10) days in advance of the
                 effective date of such assignment or sublease of AMS' intent
                 to enter into such assignment or sublease (failing which,
                 Landlord shall be entitled (as Landlord's sole remedy for AMS'
                 failure to deliver such notice), and AMS shall pay to Landlord
                 as liquidated damages, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars
                 ($500.00) for each failure to so notify Landlord), (e) such
                 Transferee is lawfully qualified to occupy the Premises, (f)
                 there will be no use of the Premises in violation of the terms
                 hereof, (g) with respect to an assignment, such Transferee
                 shall expressly assume all of the obligations of the Tenant
                 hereunder on a form acceptable to Landlord, and (h) no such
                 assignment or subletting shall relieve AMS of any agreement,
                 covenant, duty, liability or obligation hereunder.

         (F)     Tenant hereby assigns to the Landlord absolutely the rent due
                 from each assignee and subtenant and Tenant hereby authorizes
                 each such assignee and subtenant to pay said rent directly to
                 Landlord for credit, as and when collected by the Landlord
                 (and net of the Landlord's reasonable collection costs),
                 against the Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder;
                 provided that, for all periods in which no Event of Default
                 shall be in existence hereunder, Landlord shall permit Tenant
                 to continue to collect the rent from such assignees and
                 subtenants.

13.      CARE OF PREMISES.

         (A)     Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein to the
                 contrary, Tenant covenants and agrees that during the Lease
                 Term it will keep the Premises and every part thereof in
                 first-class order, condition and repair except for ordinary
                 wear and tear and casualty and condemnation damage which
                 Landlord is required to repair, and that it will in all
                 respects and at all times duly comply with all  applicable
                 laws, and all covenants, conditions and restrictions
                 applicable to the Property.

         (B)     Subject to ordinary wear and tear and subject to Tenant's
                 obligation to pay Operating Expenses pursuant to Sections 5
                 and 6, Landlord shall keep the Property and the Building in a
                 first-class condition, and shall replace, repair and maintain
                 as and when necessary in Landlord's reasonable business
                 judgment:  (A) the roof, exterior and core walls, floor slabs
                 and other structural components of the Building; (B) all
                 systems required for the elevator, plumbing, electrical, HVAC,
                 mechanical and other services of Landlord required hereunder;
                 (C) all exterior areas of the Building; (D) all common areas
                 of the Property; and (E) all exterior improvements and areas
                 of the Property (including, but not limited to, driveways,
                 parking areas and facilities, curbs, sidewalks, lighting,
                 landscaping and fencing).  In furtherance of the foregoing,
                 Landlord shall





                                       22
<PAGE>
                 agree to maintain in stock one (1) compressor and one (1) fan
                 motor for the base Building HVAC System (as herein defined).
                 Landlord further agrees to utilize prudent management
                 practices in determining when an item is at the end of its
                 useful operating life and should be replaced rather than
                 repaired.

14.      ALTERATION BY TENANT.

         (A)     Tenant is hereby given the right, at its sole cost and
                 expense, at any time during the Lease Term, to make
                 non-structural or cosmetic alterations or improvements to the
                 interior of the Premises which Tenant deems necessary or
                 desirable for its purposes; provided, however, that no
                 addition, alteration, improvement or modification which (i) is
                 not considered normal office build-out for office tenants of
                 all sizes, (ii) affects the structure or systems of the
                 Building or any other tenant of the Building (if any), (iii)
                 requires a permit or other governmental or quasi-governmental
                 approval, consent or license, or (iv) costs in excess of Ten
                 Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), shall be made without the prior
                 written approval of Landlord (which written approval shall not
                 be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except with
                 regard to work covered by clause (ii) which will or is likely
                 to materially and adversely affect any other occupant of the
                 Property).  Landlord's approval of any plans, specifications
                 or work drawings shall create no responsibility or liability
                 on the part of the Landlord for their completeness, design
                 sufficiency or compliance with any laws, rules and regulations
                 of governmental agencies or authorities.

         (B)     All work by or for Tenant herein permitted shall be done and
                 completed by the Tenant in a good and workmanlike manner and
                 in compliance with all requirements of law and of governmental
                 rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the
                 Americans with Disabilities Act).  Tenant agrees to indemnify
                 the Landlord against all mechanics' or other liens arising out
                 of any of such work, and also against any and all claims for
                 damages or injury which may occur during the course of any
                 such work.  Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing not less
                 than ten (10) days in advance of all work  to be performed in
                 or on the Property by or on behalf of Tenant or any of
                 Tenant's Agents, for which Landlord's consent is required. For
                 the further security of Landlord, Tenant covenants and agrees
                 to give actual notice of the first (1st) two (2) sentences of
                 Section 20 in advance to each project manager, contractor and
                 subcontractor with whom Tenant contracts directly for the
                 performance of any addition, alteration, improvement or
                 modification in or to the Premises; provided that, Landlord
                 hereby acknowledges that Tenant's failure to give the notice
                 specified in this sentence shall not constitute an Event of
                 Default hereunder (whether or not notice of such failure is
                 delivered by Landlord to Tenant).

         (C)     Upon written notice to Tenant (not later than thirty (30) days
                 after expiration of the Lease Term), Landlord may require that
                 Tenant remove, after the expiration or sooner termination of
                 the Lease Term and at Tenant's sole cost and expense, any
                 and/or all alterations, improvements or additions to the
                 Premises, and restore the Premises to their prior condition;
                 provided that, Landlord shall have no right to require the
                 removal of (i) any additions, alterations or improvements that
                 are customarily considered normal office improvements for
                 office tenants of all sizes (including, but not limited to,
                 wiring or cabling which is customarily considered part of
                 normal office improvements for first-class office tenants of
                 all sizes), or (ii) any alterations, improvements or additions
                 to the Premises to which Landlord has consented, unless at the
                 time such consent was granted Landlord reserved the right to
                 require such removal. Tenant shall also repair any damage to
                 the Premises caused by the installation or removal of Tenant's
                 trade fixtures, furnishings and equipment, or any alterations
                 or other improvements made to the Premises by Tenant.

15.      CONDEMNATION.

         (A)     If the Premises shall be wholly taken by exercise of right of
                 eminent domain, then this Lease shall terminate from the day
                 the possession of the whole of the Premises shall be required
                 under the exercise of such power of eminent domain.





                                       23
<PAGE>
         (B)     If a part of the Premises shall be condemned, then the Rent
                 payable hereunder shall be reduced in the proportion that the
                 remaining area of the Premises bears to the original area of
                 the Premises.

         (C)     Any award for the taking of all or part of the Premises
                 (including, but not limited to, the Tenant's leasehold
                 interest) under the power of eminent domain or any payment
                 made under threat of the exercise of such power shall be the
                 property of the Landlord.  Tenant reserves such separate
                 rights as it may have against the condemning authority to
                 claim damages for loss of its trade fixtures and the cost of
                 removal and relocation expense, provided such Tenant rights do
                 not, in any way, diminish the award to which Landlord would
                 otherwise be entitled or reduce the amounts payable to
                 Landlord pursuant to this subsection.

16.      SUBORDINATION.

         This Lease is and shall at all times be and remain subject and
         subordinate to the lien of any future mortgage (and to any and all
         advances made thereunder) upon the Property or Premises, unless
         Landlord requires this Lease to be superior to any such mortgage.
         Tenant shall execute and return to Landlord any and all documentation
         reasonably required by Landlord to evidence the subordination (or
         superiority) of this Lease to any such mortgage.  Tenant hereby agrees
         to pay to Landlord as liquidated damages an amount equal to Two
         Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day for each day on which Tenant
         fails to return any such documentation requested pursuant to the
         preceding sentence, after not less than forty-eight (48) hours notice
         from Landlord that Tenant has failed to return any such documentation
         within ten (10) days after Landlord's written request therefor.  In
         the event of subordination of this Lease, Landlord will obtain a
         written non-disturbance agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to
         Tenant and such lender, providing, without limitation, that (A) in the
         event of a foreclosure or other action taken under the mortgage by the
         holder thereof, this Lease and the rights of Tenant hereunder shall
         not be disturbed but shall continue in full force and effect so long
         as there shall not be an Event of Default in existence hereunder, and
         (B) such holder will agree that in the event it shall be in possession
         of the Premises, that so long as Tenant shall observe and perform all
         of the obligations of Tenant to be performed pursuant to this Lease,
         such Mortgagee will perform all obligations of Landlord required to be
         performed under this Lease.  So long as such non-disturbance agreement
         was delivered to Tenant, in the event any proceedings are brought for
         foreclosure, or in the event of the exercise of the power of sale
         under any mortgage made by the Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant
         shall attorn to the purchaser at any such foreclosure, or to the
         grantee of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and recognize such purchaser
         or grantee as the Landlord under this Lease.  Tenant hereby agrees
         that no mortgagee or its successor shall be (i) bound by any payment
         of Rent or Additional Rent for more than one (1) month in advance,
         (ii) bound by any amendment or modification of this Lease made without
         the consent of Landlord's mortgagee or its successor, (iii) liable for
         damages for any breach, act or omission of any prior landlord, (iv)
         bound to effect or pay for any construction for Tenant's occupancy, or
         (v) subject to any claim of offset or defenses that Tenant may have
         against any prior landlord.  The word "mortgage" as used herein
         includes mortgages, deeds of trust and any sale-leaseback
         transactions, or other similar instruments, and modifications,
         extensions, renewals, and replacements thereof, and any and all
         advances thereunder.

17.      ACCESS TO PREMISES

         Landlord and its authorized agents shall, upon reasonable prior verbal
         or written notice (except in the event of an emergency, in which event
         no notice shall be required), have free access to the Premises at any
         and all reasonable times to inspect the same, to make any repair or
         alteration to the Premises, to place and maintain a "For Rent" sign
         thereon at any time within twelve (12) months prior to expiration of
         the Lease Term and/or termination of this Lease and to exhibit and
         show the Premises to prospective tenants during such time period, and
         for other reasonable purposes pertaining to the rights of the Landlord
         hereunder.

18.      RULES AND REGULATIONS.

         Tenant agrees to comply with all existing rules and regulations of the
         Building, and all future rules and regulations reasonably promulgated
         by Landlord concerning the Property and the Premises and made known to
         Tenant in writing. The existing rules and regulations are set forth in

19.      COVENANTS OF RIGHT TO LEASE.

         Landlord covenants that it is the fee simple owner of the Property and
         has good and sufficient right to enter into this Lease and that
         Landlord alone has the right to lease the Premises for the Lease Term.
         Landlord further covenants that upon Tenant performing the terms and
         obligations of Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall be entitled to
         peaceably and quietly possess the Premises throughout the Lease Term
         and any renewal or extension thereof, subject to the terms of this
         Lease.

20.      MECHANICS LIENS.

         Neither Tenant nor anyone claiming by, through, or under Tenant or
         this Lease, shall have the right to file or place any mechanics lien
         or other lien of any kind or character whatsoever upon the Property or
         Premises or upon any improvement thereon, or upon the leasehold
         interest of Tenant therein.  Notice is hereby given that no
         contractor, subcontractor, or anyone else who may furnish any
         material, service or labor for any Property improvements, alteration,
         repairs or any part thereof, shall at any time be or become entitled
         to any lien thereon. Tenant shall cause any such lien imposed to be
         released of record by payment or posting of the proper bond acceptable
         to Landlord within ten (10) business days after the earlier of  Tenant
         acquiring knowledge of such lien or written request by Landlord.  If
         Tenant fails to remove any lien within said ten (10) business day
         period, then Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to) do so at
         Tenant's expense, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for
         such amount, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees
         and costs, as Additional Rent.

21.      EXPIRATION OF LEASE AND SURRENDER OF POSSESSION.

         (A)     Holding Over.  Tenant will, at the expiration or termination
                 of this Lease by lapse of time or otherwise, yield up
                 immediate possession of the Premises to Landlord, free of all
                 tenancies and occupancies and otherwise in the condition
                 required under this Lease.  If Tenant retains possession of
                 the Premises or any part thereof after such expiration or
                 termination, then Landlord may, at its option, serve written
                 notice upon Tenant that such holding over constitutes either
                 of (i) creation of a month-to-month tenancy, upon the terms
                 and conditions set forth in this Lease, or (ii) creation of a
                 tenancy at sufferance, in any case upon the terms and
                 conditions set forth in this Lease; provided, however, that
                 the monthly Rent (or daily Rent under (ii)) shall, in addition
                 to all other sums which are to be paid by Tenant hereunder,
                 whether or not as Additional Rent, be equal to the greater of
                 (x) the fair market rent for the Premises, or (y) one hundred
                 fifty percent (150%) of the sum of Rent plus Additional Rent
                 owed monthly to Landlord under this Lease immediately prior to
                 such expiration or termination (prorated in the case of (ii)
                 on the basis of a 365 day year for each day Tenant remains in
                 possession); provided that, with respect to the first (1st)
                 ninety (90) days of any such holdover, the amount calculated
                 under the foregoing clause (y) shall be based on one hundred
                 twenty-five percent (125%), rather than one hundred fifty
                 percent (150%).  If no such notice is served, then a tenancy
                 at sufferance shall be deemed to be created at the Rent in the
                 preceding sentence.  Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as
                 Additional Rent all damages sustained by Landlord resulting
                 from retention of possession by Tenant, including, but not
                 limited to, all brokerage commissions and reasonable legal
                 fees incurred in connection with any lease for all or a part
                 of the Premises to a replacement tenant which is canceled or
                 terminated as a result of such holdover, plus a reasonable
                 vacancy allowance equal to the period reasonably estimated by
                 Landlord to be necessary to identify another replacement
                 tenant, negotiate a lease with such replacement tenant, and
                 build-out the Premises (or such portion thereof  as shall be
                 leased) for such replacement tenant;





                                       25

                 provided that, except to the extent expressly enumerated in
                 the foregoing provisions of this sentence, Tenant shall not be
                 liable for any indirect, consequential or punitive damages as
                 a consequence of any holdover.  The provisions of this section
                 shall not constitute a waiver by Landlord of any right of
                 re-entry as herein set forth; nor shall receipt of any Rent or
                 any other act in apparent affirmance of the tenancy operate as
                 a waiver of Landlord's right to terminate this Lease for a
                 breach of any of the terms, covenants, or obligations herein
                 on Tenant's part to be performed.

         (B)     Subject to Landlord's right to require their removal in
                 writing as hereinabove provided, all alterations, additions
                 and improvements which may be made in, on or to the Premises
                 shall become the property of Landlord upon their installation
                 in the Premises and shall remain upon and be surrendered with
                 the Premises.  Subject to Section 14, upon the expiration of
                 this Lease, by lapse of time or otherwise, Tenant shall
                 surrender the Premises, together with any and all alterations,
                 improvements or additions erected in, on or to the Property or
                 Premises by Tenant (excluding Tenant's personalty), ordinary
                 wear and tear and casualty and condemnation damage which
                 Landlord is required to repair excepted.

         (C)     Tenant may install adequate equipment, fixtures, wiring,
                 cabling and machinery for the operation of its business and,
                 upon the expiration or termination of this Lease by lapse of
                 time or otherwise, Tenant shall remove such equipment,
                 fixtures, wiring and cabling (subject to the limitation set
                 forth in Section 14(C)), and machinery installed by it at
                 Tenant's sole cost.  Upon removal of such equipment, fixtures,
                 wiring and cabling (subject to the limitation set forth in
                 Section 14(C)), and machinery, Tenant shall repair any damage
                 to the Property or Premises caused by such removal or
                 installation at Tenant's sole cost.

22.      DEFAULT-REMEDIES.

         (A)     The occurrence of one or more of the following events shall
                 constitute a material default and breach of this Lease by

                          notice, to make any payment when and as due shall be
                          deemed an Event of Default;

                          Laws");

                          not satisfied or released or the enforcement thereof
                          superseded by an appropriate proceeding within sixty
                          (60) days thereafter;

                          Premises; provided that, vacating the Premises shall
                          not be deemed an Event of Default if (i) Tenant shall
                          notify Landlord in writing (or Landlord's building
                          manager shall otherwise acquire actual knowledge) of
                          Tenant's intent to vacate not less than sixty (60)
                          days in advance, (ii) Tenant shall obtain and provide

                          in full force and effect notwithstanding such
                          vacancy, and (iii) Tenant shall take all commercially
                          reasonable steps to secure the Premises against

                          insurance at least thirty (30) days prior to the

                               (10)        An assignment, subletting, pledge,
                          mortgage, or other transfer of this Lease or the
                          Premises by Tenant, or any transfer of any interest
                          in the Tenant, in violation of Section 12 of this
                          Lease; or

                          which failure shall continue for more than fifteen
                          (15) days after written notice thereof from Landlord
                          (or such longer time as may be reasonably required to
                          cure such failure through the exercise of due
                          diligence, provided that (i) such failure is not a
                          willful repudiation of the Lease authorized by
                          Tenant's Board of Directors, (ii) such failure is
                          susceptible of cure, (iii) such failure does not
                          relate to the existence of a Hazardous Substance on

                          such failure does not subject Landlord to prosecution
                          or substantial civil or criminal fine or penalty, and
                          (v) Tenant promptly commences to cure such failure
                          within the aforesaid fifteen (15) day period and
                          thereafter diligently pursues the cure of such
                          failure to completion).

         (B)     If an Event of Default shall have occurred, Landlord shall
                 have (in addition to all other rights and remedies provided at
                 law or in equity or otherwise provided by this Lease) the
                 right, at the option of the Landlord, then or at any time
                 thereafter while such Event of Default  shall continue, to
                 elect any one or more of the following:

                               (1)         To continue this Lease in full force
                          and effect (so long as Landlord does not terminate
                          this Lease), and Landlord shall have the right to
                          collect Rent, Additional Rent and other charges when
                          due for the remainder of the Lease Term; and/or

                               (2)         To cure such default or defaults,
                          upon ten (10) days' notice of Landlord's intention to
                          cure (but without notice in the event of an
                          emergency), at Tenant's expense and without prejudice
                          to any other remedies which Landlord might otherwise
                          have; and any reasonable payment made or reasonable
                          expenses incurred by Landlord in curing such default,

                          with interest thereon at the Default Rate (as herein
                          defined), shall be Additional Rent to be paid by
                          Tenant with the next installment of Rent falling due
                          thereafter; and/or

                               (3)         To either (a) declare this Lease
                          terminated and the Lease Term ended, or (b) elect to
                          continue this Lease in full force and effect (but
                          with the right at any time thereafter to declare this
                          Lease terminated and the Lease Term ended), and in
                          either such event to re-enter the Premises, with or
                          without notice, and dispossess Tenant and anyone
                          claiming through or under Tenant by summary
                          proceedings or otherwise, and remove their effects,
                          and take complete possession of the Premises.  In
                          such re-entry, Landlord may, with or without process
                          of law, remove all persons from the Premises, and
                          Tenant hereby covenants in such event, for itself and
                          all others occupying the Premises under Tenant, to
                          peacefully yield up and surrender the Premises to
                          Landlord.  If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease
                          and/or elects to terminate Tenant's right of
                          possession, every obligation of Landlord contained in
                          this Lease shall cease without prejudice to Tenant's
                          liability for all Rent, Additional Rent, and other
                          sums owed by Tenant herein.

                 In the event Landlord declares this Lease terminated and the
                 Lease Term ended (pursuant to Section 22(B)(3)(a) above), the
                 Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant the Rent,
                 Additional Rent, and all other sums due and owing by Tenant to
                 the date of termination, plus the reasonable costs of curing
                 all Tenant's defaults existing at or prior to the date of
                 termination, plus the reasonable costs of recovering
                 possession of the Premises, plus the reasonable costs of
                 reletting the Premises (including, but not limited to repairs
                 to the Premises, reasonable costs to prepare and refinish the
                 Premises for reletting, leasing commissions, rental
                 concessions, and reasonable legal fees and costs), plus other
                 actual damages suffered or incurred by Landlord due to all
                 Events of Default (including, without limitation, late fees or
                 other charges incurred by Landlord under any mortgage, but
                 excluding any indirect, consequential or punitive damages
                 arising from an Event of Default other than those expressly
                 enumerated in this sentence), plus the excess, if any, of the
                 Tenant's Rent and Additional Rent for the balance of the Lease
                 Term above the rent (if any) collected by Landlord during the
                 remainder of the scheduled Lease Term, net of Landlord's costs
                 to collect the same.  Landlord agrees to exercise reasonable
                 efforts to relet the Premises in the event this Lease is
                 terminated, but Landlord shall have no obligation to give any
                 preference to leasing the Premises over leasing any other
                 space Landlord may have available.

                 Should Landlord elect to continue this Lease (pursuant to
                 Section 22(B)(3)(b) above), Landlord shall be entitled to
                 recover from Tenant the Rent, Additional Rent and all other
                 sums due and owing by Tenant up to the date of dispossession,
                 plus the reasonable costs of curing all Events of Default
                 existing at or prior to the date of dispossession, plus the
                 Rent, Additional Rent and all other sums owed by Tenant on a
                 continuing basis as said amounts accrue to the end of the
                 Lease Term, less the rental which Landlord receives during
                 such period, if any, with respect to the Premises, plus the
                 cost of recovering possession of the Premises, plus the costs
                 of reletting (including, but not limited to, repairs to the
                 Premises, costs to prepare and refinish the Premises for
                 reletting, leasing commissions, rental concessions, and
                 reasonable legal fees and costs).   Any suit brought by
                 Landlord to enforce collection of such deficiency for any one
                 month shall not prejudice Landlord's right to enforce the
                 collection of any deficiency for any subsequent month in
                 subsequent separate actions, or Landlord may defer initiating
                 any such suit until after the expiration of the Lease Term (in
                 which event such deferral shall not be construed as a waiver
                 of Landlord's rights as set forth herein and Landlord's cause
                 of action shall be deemed not to have accrued until the
                 expiration of the Lease Term), and it being further understood
                 that if Landlord elects to bring suits from time to time prior
                 to reletting the Premises, Landlord shall be entitled to its
                 full damages through the date of the award of damages without
                 regard to any rent, additional rent or other sums that are or
                 may be projected to be received by Landlord upon a subsequent
                 reletting of the Premises.  In the event that Landlord relets
                 the Premises together with other premises or for a term
                 extending beyond the scheduled expiration of the Lease Term,
                 it is understood that Tenant will not be entitled to apply
                 against Landlord's damages any rent, additional rent or other
                 sums generated or projected to be generated by either such
                 other premises or the period extending beyond the scheduled
                 expiration of





                                       28
<PAGE>
                 the Lease Term.  Landlord shall use commercially reasonable
                 efforts to relet and rent the Premises with or without
                 advertising for the remainder of the Lease Term, or for such
                 longer or shorter period as Landlord shall deem advisable.

                 In lieu of the amounts recoverable by Landlord pursuant to the
                 two immediately preceding paragraphs, but in addition to other
                 remedies and amounts otherwise recoverable by Landlord in this
                 Lease, Landlord may, in its sole election, (i) terminate this
                 Lease, (ii) collect all Rent, Additional Rent, and other sums
                 due and owing by Tenant up to the date of termination, and
                 (iii) collect, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to (a)
                 the present value (as of the date of termination) of the Rent
                 and Additional Rent which would have been paid by Tenant for
                 the remaining balance of the Lease Term (if this Lease were
                 not terminated), minus (b) the present value (as of the date
                 of termination) of the net revenue stream (e.g., after
                 deducting reasonable allowances for periods of vacancy and
                 anticipated legal fees, brokerage commissions, tenant
                 improvement allowances and other concessions required to relet
                 the Premises) Landlord reasonably expects to receive over the
                 remainder of the Lease Term (if this Lease were not
                 terminated) as a result of the reletting of the Premises.  For
                 purposes of determining present value under the foregoing
                 clause (iii), the indicated amounts shall be discounted to
                 present value using an interest rate equal to five percent
                 (5.0%) per annum.  In no event shall Landlord be liable for,
                 nor shall Tenant's obligations hereunder be diminished by
                 reason of, any failure by Landlord to relet all or any portion
                 of the Premises or to collect any rent due upon such
                 reletting, nor shall Tenant be entitled to share in, or to any
                 off-set against its liability under the foregoing clause
                 (iii), any proceeds from any reletting of the Premises.
                 Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that no election by
                 Landlord to seek liquidated damages pursuant to this paragraph
                 shall relieve Tenant of any liability for damages for any
                 failure by Tenant to surrender the Premises to Landlord in
                 accordance with the terms hereof.

         (C)     TENANT, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS
                 CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER TENANT, INCLUDING ALL CREDITORS,
                 DOES HEREBY SPECIFICALLY WAIVE AND SURRENDER ANY AND ALL
                 RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES, SO FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, WHICH
                 TENANT AND ALL SUCH PERSONS MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE UNDER ANY
                 PRESENT OR FUTURE LAW (1) TO THE SERVICE OF ANY NOTICE TO QUIT
                 OR OF LANDLORD'S INTENTION TO RE-ENTER OR TO INSTITUTE LEGAL
                 PROCEEDINGS, WHICH NOTICE MAY OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED TO BE
                 GIVEN, (2) TO REDEEM THE PREMISES, (3) TO RE-ENTER OR
                 REPOSSESS THE PREMISES, (4) TO RESTORE THE OPERATION OF THIS
                 LEASE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPOSSESSION OF TENANT BY JUDGMENT
                 OR WARRANT OF ANY COURT OR JUDGE, OR ANY RE-ENTRY BY LANDLORD,
                 OR ANY EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS LEASE, WHETHER SUCH
                 DISPOSSESSION, RE-ENTRY, EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION SHALL BE BY
                 OPERATION OF LAW OR PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LEASE,
                 OR (5) WHICH EXEMPTS PROPERTY FROM LIABILITY FOR DEBT OR FOR
                 DISTRESS FOR RENT.  TENANT HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE EXERCISE OF
                 PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER IT BY ANY FEDERAL OR LOCAL COURT IN
                 THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE PREMISES IS LOCATED.

23.      RE-ENTRY BY LANDLORD

         No re-entry by Landlord or any action brought by Landlord to remove
         Tenant from the Premises shall operate to terminate this Lease unless
         Landlord shall have given written notice of termination to Tenant, in
         which event Tenant's liability shall be as above provided.  No right
         or remedy granted to Landlord herein is intended to be exclusive of
         any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy herein
         provided shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or
         remedy hereunder or now or hereafter existing in law or equity or by
         statute.  In the event of termination of this Lease, Tenant waives any
         and all rights to redeem the Premises given by any statute now or
         hereafter enacted.

24.      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS TO LANDLORD.

         (A)     In addition to any and all other remedies, Landlord may
                 restrain any threatened breach of any covenant, condition or
                 agreement herein contained, but the mention herein of any
                 particular remedy or right shall not preclude the Landlord
                 from any other remedy or right it may have either at law or
                 equity, or by virtue of some other provision of this Lease;
                 nor shall the consent to one act, which would otherwise be a
                 violation hereof, nor the waiver of redress for one violation
                 of a covenant, promise, agreement, undertaking or condition,
                 constitute Landlord's consent to, or waiver of redress for,
                 any subsequent act in violation hereof.

         (B)     Receipt by Landlord of Rent or other payments from the Tenant
                 shall not be deemed to operate as a waiver of any rights of
                 the Landlord to enforce payment of any Rent, Additional Rent,
                 or other payments previously due or which may thereafter
                 become due, or of any rights of the Landlord to terminate this
                 Lease or to exercise any remedy or right which otherwise might
                 be available to the Landlord.  The right of Landlord to
                 declare a forfeiture for each and every breach of this Lease
                 is a continuing one for the life of this Lease; provided that
                 Landlord shall have no right to declare a forfeiture of this
                 Lease with regard to any one instance of an Event of Default
                 after such Event of Default is cured.

25.      SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS AND LIABILITY.

         The terms, covenants, conditions and agreements herein contained and
         as the same may from time to time hereafter be supplemented, modified
         or amended, shall apply to, bind, and inure to the benefit of the
         parties hereto and their legal representatives, successors and
         assigns, respectively, subject to Section 12 hereof.  In the event
         either party now or hereafter shall consist of more than one person,
         firm or corporation, then and in such event all such persons, firms
         and/or corporations shall be jointly and severally liable as parties
         hereunder.

26.      NOTICES.

         All notices and demands required to be given to either party hereunder
         shall be in writing and shall be sent by certified United States mail,
         postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery, or
         by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, delivery
         prepaid, addressed to the party to whom directed at the address set
         forth below or at such other address as may be from time to time
         designated in writing by the party changing such address.  All such
         notices and demands shall be deemed to have been received on the date
         of delivery or the date of refusal of delivery (or inability to

27.      MORTGAGEE'S APPROVAL.

         Tenant hereby agrees that, if Landlord's mortgagee shall require
         modifications of the terms and provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall
         not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its execution and
         delivery of the agreements required to effect such Lease modification
         (it being understood that any such reasonable modification(s) shall be
         executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after Landlord's
         request therefor).  In no event, however, shall Tenant be required to
         agree to modify any provision of this Lease relating to the amount of
         Rent, Additional Rent or other charges reserved herein, the size
         and/or general location of the Premises, or the Lease Term, nor shall
         any such modification diminish Landlord's obligations or Tenant's
         rights hereunder.

28.      ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.

         Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a written request from the
         other party hereto (the "Requesting Party"), the party receiving such
         request (the "Receiving Party") agrees to execute, acknowledge and
         deliver to the Requesting Party (or, if Landlord is the Requesting
         Party, any proposed mortgagee or purchaser) a statement in writing, in
         form reasonably satisfactory to the Requesting Party, certifying
         whether this Lease is in full force and effect and, if it is in full
         force and effect, what modifications (if any) have been made to this
         Lease to the date of the certification, whether or not any defaults or
         offsets exist with respect to this Lease and, if there are, what they
         are claimed to be, and setting forth the date(s) to which Rent or
         other charges have been paid in advance, if any.  The failure of
         Tenant to execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord a statement as
         above shall constitute an acknowledgment by Tenant that this Lease is
         unmodified and in full force and effect and that the Rent and other
         charges have been duly and fully paid to and including the respective
         due dates immediately preceding the date of Landlord's notice to
         Tenant and shall constitute as to any person, a waiver of any defaults
         which may exist prior to such notice.

29.      DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST.

         All amounts owed by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to any provision of
         this Lease shall bear interest from the date due until paid at three
         percent (3%) per annum above the Prime Rate reported immediately prior
         to the due date for such amount(s), unless a lesser rate shall then be
         the maximum rate permissible by law, in which event said lesser rate
         shall be charged ("Default Rate").

30.      EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

         (A)     It is expressly understood and agreed by and between the
                 parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
                 notwithstanding, that each and all of the representations,
                 warranties, covenants, undertakings, indemnities and
                 agreements herein made on the part of Landlord, while in form
                 purporting to be the representations, warranties, covenants,
                 undertakings, indemnities and agreements of Landlord, are
                 nevertheless each and every one of them made and intended, not
                 as personal representations, warranties, covenants,
                 undertakings, indemnities and agreements by Landlord or for
                 the purpose or with the intention of binding Landlord
                 personally, but are made and intended for the purpose only of
                 subjecting Landlord's interest in the Property to the terms of
                 this Lease and for no other purpose whatsoever, and in case of
                 default hereunder by Landlord, Tenant shall look solely to the
                 interests of Landlord in the Property; provided that, subject
                 to the rights of Landlord's mortgagee(s) (if any), (i) in the
                 event of a sale of the Building, Tenant's recourse against the
                 assets of the selling Landlord to satisfy any claim by Tenant
                 which has been identified in writing to the selling Landlord
                 with particularity by Tenant prior to such sale shall be
                 deemed to extend to the Landlord's net proceeds from the sale
                 of the Building, and (ii) in the event of a condemnation or
                 casualty, Tenant's recourse against the assets of the Landlord
                 to satisfy any claim by Tenant which has been identified in
                 writing to Landlord with particularity by Tenant prior to such
                 casualty or condemnation shall be deemed to extend to
                 Landlord's net proceeds of the insurance settlement or
                 condemnation award, as applicable, to the extent that such net
                 proceeds exceed the cost of repairs and restoration incurred
                 by or on behalf of Landlord with respect to such casualty or
                 condemnation.  Landlord shall not have any personal

<PAGE>
                 liability to pay any indebtedness accruing hereunder or to
                 perform any covenant, either express or implied, herein
                 contained.  All such personal liability of Landlord, if any,
                 is expressly waived and released by Tenant and by all persons
                 claiming by, through or under Tenant.  Nothing herein
                 contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right
                 Tenant may have to seek injunctive relief (other than for the
                 payment of money) with regard to any default by Landlord
                 hereunder which is not cured within fifteen (15) days (or such
                 longer period as is reasonably required to cure such default
                 through the exercise of due diligence) after written notice
                 from Tenant specifying such default with particularity.

         (B)     Except with regard to repairs (which shall be governed by the
                 provisions of the following Section 30(C)), Tenant may,
                 following a default by Landlord which is not cured within
                 fifteen (15) days after delivery of written notice from Tenant
                 specifying the nature of such default in detail (or such
                 longer time as may be reasonably required to cure such failure
                 through the exercise of due diligence, provided that (i) such
                 failure is not a willful repudiation of the Lease authorized
                 by Landlord's Board of Directors, (ii) such failure is
                 susceptible of cure, (iii) such failure does not relate to the
                 existence of a Hazardous Substance on the Premises in
                 violation of Section 8 hereof, (iv) such failure does not
                 subject Tenant to prosecution or substantial civil or criminal
                 fine or penalty, and (v) Landlord promptly commences to cure
                 such failure within the aforesaid fifteen (15) day period and
                 thereafter diligently pursues the cure of such failure to
                 completion), make any payment or perform any act required of
                 Landlord, whereupon all reasonable costs and expenses
                 reasonably incurred by Tenant, plus interest at the Default
                 Rate from the date incurred until payment in full by Landlord,
                 shall be promptly reimbursed by Landlord (or, in the event
                 Tenant shall obtain a final, unappealable judgment therefor
                 which shall not be satisfied for more than thirty (30) days
                 after such judgment shall become final and unappealable,
                 offset by Tenant against future Rent due hereunder).

         (C)     In the event that at any time during the Term the Tenant
                 determines that repairs which are the responsibility of
                 Landlord as provided herein are required, Tenant shall
                 promptly so notify Landlord and Landlord's managing agent for
                 the Property.  In the event that Tenant reasonably determines
                 that the existing situation constitutes an emergency which
                 either threatens imminent injury to persons or material damage
                 to property or materially impairs Tenant's then-current use of
                 the Premises or a material portion thereof, Tenant may give
                 such notice by any means including, without limitation, by
                 telephone.  If initial notice is given by telephone
                 (hereinafter "Initial Notice"), such notice must be followed
                 immediately with written notice to Landlord and Landlord's
                 managing agent for the Property (hereinafter "Written
                 Notice").  If Tenant so notifies Landlord and Landlord's
                 managing agent of an emergency situation, Landlord or
                 Landlord's managing agent shall use reasonable efforts to
                 respond within three (3) hours of receipt of the Initial
                 Notice.  Tenant shall have the right to immediately eliminate
                 the threat of imminent personal injury or property damage, but
                 Tenant shall not make any repairs except for those necessary
                 to eliminate the threat of imminent personal injury or
                 property damage. If the situation of which Tenant notifies
                 Landlord and Landlord's managing agent is not an emergency, or
                 if the threat of imminent personal injury or property damage
                 is eliminated as aforesaid, Landlord shall thereafter use
                 reasonable means to commence such repairs within ten (10)
                 business days of receipt of Tenant's Written Notice.  If
                 Landlord fails to commence the repair within ten (10) business
                 days after receipt of Written Notice from Tenant, Tenant shall
                 have the right, but not the obligation, to commence such
                 repairs.  In doing so, Tenant may hire repairman, purchase
                 materials, and generally perform any other act which would be
                 reasonably required of Landlord in making such repair.  If the
                 repairs are deemed to be necessary, as well as the
                 responsibility of the Landlord, all reasonable costs incurred
                 by Tenant in effectuating such repairs shall be promptly
                 reimbursed by Landlord after Tenant has submitted to Landlord
                 reasonable documentation evidencing the costs of repair,
                 together with interest at the Default Rate from the date
                 incurred until payment in full by Landlord (failing which, in
                 the event Tenant shall obtain a final, unappealable judgment
                 therefor which shall remain unpaid for thirty (30) days after
                 such judgment shall become final and unappealable, such sums
                 may be offset by Tenant against future Rent due hereunder).

         failed to cure any such default within twenty (20) days after such
         notice to Landlord (or if such default cannot be cured or corrected
         within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if
         Landlord has commenced within such twenty (20) days and is diligently
         pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to cure or correct such
         default), then the holder of the First Mortgage shall have an
         additional twenty (20) days within which to cure or correct such
         default (or if such default cannot be cured or corrected within that
         time, then such additional time as may be necessary if such holder of
         the First Mortgage has commenced with such twenty (20) days and is
         diligently pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to cure or correct
         such default, including the time necessary to obtain possession if
         possession is necessary to cure or correct such default).

32.      RECIPROCAL COVENANT ON NOTIFICATION OF ADA VIOLATIONS.

         Within ten (10) days after receipt, Landlord and Tenant shall advise
         the other party in writing, and provide the other with copies of (as

         portion of the Property or the Premises; any claims made or threatened
         in writing regarding noncompliance with the ADA and relating to any

         regulatory actions or investigations instituted or threatened
         regarding noncompliance with the ADA and relating to any portion of
         the Property or the Premises.  Nothing in this Section 32 shall be
         deemed to alter the allocation of responsibility for ADA compliance
         set forth elsewhere in this Lease.

         financial statements for the two (2) years prior to the current year.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 34 shall

         Tenant shall have the right to utilize Tenant's Proportionate Share of

         Landlord from granting another occupant of the Building the right to
         have monument signage or Building directory listings.  All signs

         the construction, installation, operation, existence, maintenance or
         removal of such signs.  Upon vacating the Premises, Tenant shall

         affected or impaired because the Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) is
         unable to fulfill any of its obligations hereunder or is delayed in
         doing so, to the extent such inability or delay is caused by reason of
         war, civil unrest, strike, labor troubles, unusually inclement
         weather, governmental delays, inability to procure services or
         materials despite reasonable efforts, third party delays, acts of God,
         or any other cause(s) beyond the reasonable control of the Landlord or
         Tenant (as applicable) (which causes are referred to collectively
         herein as "Force Majeure").  The time specified for the performance of
         an obligation of Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) in this Lease
         shall be extended one day for each day of delay suffered by Landlord
         or Tenant (as applicable) in the performance of such obligation as a
         result of any Force Majeure cause.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         this Section 38 shall have no application to, nor shall the time for
         the performance of Landlord's or Tenant's obligations hereunder be
         extended with respect to, any obligation for the payment of money or
         the surrender of the Premises upon the expiration of the Lease Term.

40.      BROKERS.

         Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants to the other that

         and CUSHMAN & WAKEFIELD in the negotiating or making of this Lease,
         and Landlord and Tenant each agrees to indemnify and hold the other

         independent contractors) harmless from all liabilities, costs,
         demands, judgments, settlements, claims and losses, including
         reasonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred in conjunction with any
         such claim or claims of any other broker or brokers with whom the

         this Lease upon written notice to the other, in which event this Lease
         shall be null and void as if this Lease were never executed.  Landlord
         and Tenant each expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither party
         shall have any liability to the other for the failure of any of the
         conditions set forth in the preceding sentence for any reason
         whatsoever.

42.      LEASE/DEED OF LEASE.

         To the extent required under applicable law to make this Lease legally

                 such obligations to pay run to the Landlord or to other
                 parties.

         (C)     In any litigation between the parties arising out of this
                 Lease, or in connection with any consultations with counsel
                 and other actions taken or notices delivered in relation to a
                 default by any party to this Lease, the non-prevailing party

                 if applicable) ("Legal Costs").  The Legal Costs shall be

                 contained in this Lease.  Any modification to this Lease must

         terms and conditions hereby granted in favor of Tenant, in the event
         this Lease shall expire or be terminated for any reason whatsoever
         (whether due to fire, casualty, condemnation, default by Landlord or
         Tenant or any other reason or cause, and regardless of whether due to
         the fault of Landlord or Tenant or arising without fault on the part
         of either) prior to the day preceding the thirteenth (13th)
         anniversary of the Commencement Date, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord
         the sum (the "Termination Payment") equal to the Termination Payment
         set forth on the attached Exhibit I which corresponds to the month of
         the Initial Term in which such expiration or termination shall occur.
         By way of example of the foregoing, but not in limitation thereof, in
         the event the Lease were terminated for any reason in the seventieth
         (70th) month of the Initial Term, Tenant would pay to Landlord a
         Termination Payment in the sum of $704,844.22.  The Termination
         Payment shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord not less than sixty (60)
         days following the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.

                                 WORK AGREEMENT

         A.      Subject to the terms hereof, Landlord shall be responsible, at
                 its cost and expense, for ensuring that the Landlord's Work
                 referenced on the attached Exhibit B-1 is substantially
                 completed in the Building prior to the Landlord's General Work
                 Deadline (as herein defined); provided that, Landlord shall be
                 responsible, at its cost and expense, for ensuring that the
                 Landlords' Critical HVAC Work and (provided that Tenant shall
                 advise Landlord, not later than December 13, 1996, of the
                 number of ADA strobes to be installed by Tenant on each floor
                 of the Premises) Landlord's Critical Fire/Life Safety Work are
                 substantially completed in the Building on or before the
                 Critical Path Deadline (as herein defined).  Subject only to
                 the foregoing, Tenant shall be solely responsible for
                 compliance of the Premises with all applicable requirements
                 under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations
                 and Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities
                 promulgated pursuant thereto (collectively, the "ADA"),
                 including, but not limited to, ADA compliance with regard to
                 the Building Fit-Out (as defined below) and any subsequent
                 changes to the Premises made by or on behalf of Tenant.

         B.      Tenant shall cause the work (the "Building Fit-Out") defined
                 and described in the Approved Plans (as hereinafter defined)
                 to be performed by a general contractor (the "General
                 Contractor") reasonably approved by Landlord (and it shall not
                 be unreasonable for Landlord to deny its approval to any
                 general contractor which:  (i) lacks demonstrable experience
                 in commercial construction, (ii) is not bonded or not
                 bondable; (iii) is not fully licensed under all applicable
                 laws; (iv) is not enjoying good labor relations as of the date
                 Landlord's approval is sought; or (v) lacks the ability to
                 perform, consistently, quality workmanship (as reasonably
                 evidenced by Landlord)).  Landlord hereby approves Davis
                 Construction to act as the General Contractor.

         C.      Promptly after execution of this Lease, Tenant will cause to
                 be prepared and shall submit to Landlord for Landlord's
                 approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
                 conditioned or delayed) construction drawings for the proposed
                 Building Fit-Out.  Such construction drawings shall be
                 prepared by an architect ("Tenant's Architect") licensed in
                 the Commonwealth of Virginia, selected by Tenant and approved
                 by Landlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably
                 withheld).  Landlord hereby approves Greenwell-Goetz
                 Architects to act as Tenant's Architect. Tenant shall, after
                 receipt of Landlord's approval, submit such construction
                 drawings for permitting with Fairfax County, Virginia.  Within
                 ten (10) business days after Tenant's submission of
                 construction drawings to Landlord, Landlord will indicate to
                 Tenant in writing whether it approves such drawings, or if
                 not, specifying what aspects of such drawings are not
                 approved.  If Landlord fails to notify Tenant of any
                 objections within the required time period, Landlord will be
                 deemed to have approved Tenant's submission. Grounds for
                 disapproval by Landlord shall include, but not be limited to,
                 the failure of such drawings to adhere to applicable laws,
                 codes or ADA requirements, or to integrate appropriately with
                 base Building structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing,
                 and/or heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC")
                 systems (hereinafter "Systems"), and the inclusion of work
                 which may invalidate any existing warranty.  If Landlord
                 disapproves any part of the drawings submitted by Tenant,
                 Landlord and Tenant will meet promptly to discuss the
                 objectionable items and will use commercially reasonable
                 efforts to resolve all objections promptly.  Once approved by
                 Landlord, the final construction drawings, as revised to
                 reflect the resolution of all objections, shall constitute the
                 "Approved Plans" for all purposes of this Lease.  Neither
                 Landlord's review of the proposed construction drawings or the
                 Approved Plans, nor any review or oversight of the Building
                 Fit-Out by Landlord's construction manager, shall constitute a
                 warranty by Landlord regarding the fitness of the Premises or
                 the Approved Plans for the Permitted Use of the Premises by
                 Tenant, the proper integration of the Building Fit-Out with
                 the Systems, nor of the compliance of the Approved Plans with
                 applicable codes or governmental or quasi-governmental
                 requirements, nor shall Landlord have any liability with
                 regard to such approval, review or oversight but, subject to
                 the foregoing, Landlord agrees to use reasonable efforts to
                 notify Tenant of any failure to comply with applicable laws of
                 which Landlord acquires actual knowledge.





<PAGE>
         D.      Tenant shall promptly cause the General Contractor to commence
                 and diligently prosecute to completion the Building Fit-Out
                 upon receiving the necessary permits from Fairfax County,
                 Virginia.  Subject to the terms hereof, Tenant will pay the
                 full cost associated with the preparation of the Approved
                 Plans and the construction of the Building Fit-Out.  The
                 Building Fit-Out shall be completed by Tenant substantially in
                 accordance with the Approved Plans (and any Approved Change
                 Orders, as defined below).  Tenant shall be solely responsible
                 for all matters necessary to commence, perform and complete
                 the Building Fit-Out, including, but not limited to, filing
                 plans and other required documentation with the proper
                 governmental authorities, securing all necessary permits for
                 the performance of any and all work required to be performed
                 under the Approved Plans (all of which will be deemed part of
                 the Building Fit-Out), and filing for and obtaining all
                 approvals and permits necessary for Tenant to occupy the
                 Premises (including, but not limited to, all final inspections
                 for issuance of Tenant's final non-residential use permit, or
                 its equivalent).

         E.      Tenant shall have the right, at its sole expense, to make
                 changes to the Approved Plans provided the same are approved
                 by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably
                 withheld, conditioned or delayed.  No such Landlord approval
                 shall be required for any change having a cost of less than
                 Ten Thousand Dollars($10,000.00), provided such change neither
                 requires a permit, permit modification or other governmental
                 or quasi-governmental approval, consent or license, nor
                 affects the structure or systems of or serving the Building.
                 Tenant assumes full responsibility for all additional costs
                 and delays in completion of the Building Fit-Out due to any
                 such change orders.  Any change order approved by Landlord and
                 Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provision is referred to
                 herein as an "Approved Change Order".

         F.      Tenant agrees that the Building Fit-Out will be performed in a
                 good and workmanlike manner. The General Contractor and any
                 contractors of Landlord shall keep all construction areas
                 reasonably clean and free of trash and debris, and shall
                 police the activities of its contractors, subcontractors and
                 their respective employees with regard to keeping the Building
                 and Property clean.

         G.      The General Contractor(s) and any contractors of Landlord
                 shall be adequately insured, and shall carry worker's
                 compensation, liability and other insurance (including, but
                 not limited to, Builder's Risk Insurance) naming Landlord or
                 Tenant (as applicable) as an additional insured and loss payee
                 (as to Builder's Risk coverage) in amounts and in form and
                 substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.  Tenant shall
                 provide Landlord and Landlord shall provide Tenant with
                 evidence that the requisite insurance has been obtained prior
                 to the commencement of any work by any contractor acting on
                 behalf of such party.  Tenant's construction contract shall
                 indemnify Tenant and Landlord from damages, losses and
                 expenses associated with the acts and omissions of the General
                 Contractor, its agents, employees, contractors and
                 subcontractors.

         H.      Landlord and Tenant shall each provide to the other copies of
                 all applications for permits, copies of all governmental
                 inspection reports and/or certificates, and any and all
                 notices or violations communicated to them or their respective
                 contractors by applicable governmental authorities, promptly
                 upon receipt and/or submission thereof, as the case may be.
                 Each party agrees to comply (and to cause its contractor(s) to
                 comply) with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
                 regulations and ordinances in the performance of the Landlord
                 Work or the Building Fit-Out (as applicable), and to promptly
                 cause to be rectified any violations of such laws caused by
                 the acts or omission of the applicable party or its
                 contractor(s), or their respective employees, agents,
                 contractors and/or subcontractors, and each shall be
                 responsible for any non-compliance by them or their respective
                 contractor(s), or their respective employees, agents,
                 contractors and/or subcontractors.

         I.      The performance of Tenant's Work and Landlord's Work shall be
                 lien free.  Except as specifically set forth herein, Tenant
                 shall be responsible for the payment of, and shall pay when
                 due, all hard and soft costs (collectively referred to herein
                 as the "Costs") associated with the design, permitting and
                 construction of the Building Fit-Out (such as, but not limited
                 to, design

                 and engineering costs, permitting costs, inspection fees,
                 demolition costs, and costs incurred to procure labor and
                 materials, and any other costs associated with modifications
                 needed to be made to the "as-is" condition of the existing
                 improvements within the Building to the extent the same are
                 not specifically required to be performed at Landlord's
                 expense as part of the Landlord's Work).  Tenant shall pay all
                 Costs on a timely basis so as to avoid the assertion of any
                 statutory and/or common law lien against the Premises, the
                 Land or the Building, in whole or part.   Landlord shall not
                 be entitled to any fee or mark-up with respect to the Building
                 Fit-Out performed by Tenant and its contractors (but this
                 sentence shall not be deemed to prohibit Landlord from
                 recovering any sums to which Landlord is entitled pursuant to
                 Section 6(E) hereof).

         J.      In consideration of Tenant's fulfillment of all of its
                 obligations under this Exhibit B, Landlord agrees to provide
                 Tenant with the following allowances (collectively, the
                 "Allowances"):

                 1.       An allowance (the "Construction Allowance") equal to
                 Six Million Four Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand Four Hundred
                 Twenty Dollars ($6,426,420.00) ($30.00 per square foot of
                 rentable area in the Premises).  Tenant agrees that the
                 Construction Allowance shall be applied solely to pay Costs of
                 design and construction of the Building Fit-Out pursuant to
                 the Approved Plans (including, but not limited to, all hard
                 and soft costs associated with the Build-Out, including space
                 planning, interior design, construction drawings for both the
                 permit and bid set, permits, and mechanical, electrical and
                 plumbing drawings); provided that, upon completion of the
                 Building Fit-Out and payment of all costs, expenses and fees
                 associated therewith, Landlord agrees to allow Tenant to
                 utilize the unpaid portion of the Construction Allowance, up
                 to a maximum of One Million Seventy-One Thousand Seventy
                 Dollars ($1,071,070.00), for data wiring, cabling expenses,
                 relocation costs and other move-related expenses, subject to
                 the terms hereof; and

                 2.       An allowance (the "Capital Improvement Allowance")
                 equal to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00).  Tenant
                 agrees that the Capital Improvement Allowance shall be applied
                 solely to pay Costs of design and construction of elevator
                 lobby renovations and other improvements to the common areas
                 of the Building mutually agreed by Landlord and Tenant (the
                 "Common Area Renovations").  The Common Area Renovations shall
                 be included as a part of the Building Fit-Out on all of the
                 terms and conditions applicable to the Building Fit-Out.

                 3.       The Allowances shall be payable by Landlord to Tenant
                 on a percentage of completion basis, with draws to be payable
                 not more than once per month commencing at any time after the
                 Phase I Commencement Date, within fifteen (15) business days
                 after (1) the applicable percentage of construction of the
                 Premises has been substantially completed, (and subject to not
                 less than a ten percent (10%) holdback requirement on the
                 first (1st) fifty percent (50%) of the Building Fit-Out, which
                 holdback amount shall not be payable prior to final completion
                 of the Building Fit-Out and the tender of all required
                 deliveries by the General Contractor to Tenant and Landlord
                 under the terms of the general construction contract) and (2)
                 Tenant has provided Landlord with a written payment request
                 for the applicable portion of the Allowance, accompanied by
                 all of the following items:

                 a.       A certificate from Tenant's Architect to Landlord
                          certifying that the Building Fit-Out (or the
                          applicable percentage thereof) has been substantially
                          completed in accordance with the Approved Plans, and
                          that the sums being requested by Tenant to be paid
                          out of the Allowance in such payment request have
                          been expended by Tenant for actual costs of the
                          construction of Tenant's Work;

                 b.       A true and correct copy of the final non-residential
                          use permit (or its equivalent) issued to Tenant by
                          the applicable governmental authority (final payment
                          only);

                 c.       A copy of as-built plans and specifications for the
                          Building Fit-Out incorporating all Approved Change
                          Orders (if any) (final payment only); and

                 d.       A duly executed interim release of liens (for interim
                          payments) and a duly executed final release of liens
                          (for the final payment) executed (for all payments)
                          by Tenant's General Contractor and (for the final
                          payment only) by any and all subcontractors and/or
                          materialmen supplying labor and/or materials in
                          connection with the Building Fit-Out, in form and
                          substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord,
                          acknowledging (as to the final payment) payment of in
                          full for all labor and/or materials associated with
                          the Building Fit-Out, and (as to interim payments)
                          acknowledging partial payment of the applicable
                          percentage of the Allowance plus any other sums
                          otherwise disbursed by Landlord and/or Tenant to the
                          General Contractor, as of the date of, and including,
                          such draw request, and fully and forever waiving any
                          and all statutory and/or common law liens which might
                          otherwise be asserted by them against the Property in
                          connection with the performance of the Building
                          Fit-Out (except, as to interim payments only, such
                          waiver may be limited by its terms to the disbursed
                          amounts); provided that, with respect to any
                          subcontractor and/or materialman supplying labor
                          and/or materials in connection with the Building
                          Fit-Out, who refuses to execute and deliver a duly
                          executed final release of liens, Landlord shall be
                          entitled to deduct from the final payment the full
                          amount of the contract price for such subcontractor
                          or materialman (net of any amounts for which partial
                          lien releases have previously been obtained from such
                          contractor or materialman with respect to the
                          Building Fit-Out) and hold the same as additional
                          retainage until such time as (i) such subcontractor
                          or materialman shall have executed and delivered to
                          Landlord such final release of liens, or (ii) the
                          applicable period within which such subcontractor or
                          materialman may assert a lien against the Property
                          shall have expired, and Landlord shall disburse the
                          remainder of the final payment to Tenant.

                 Landlord shall not be obligated to pay the Allowance (or any
                 portion thereof) to Tenant unless (and not until fifteen (15)
                 business days after) Landlord has received a payment request
                 with all required attachments properly supplied, and such
                 payment shall be (until the final payment) net of the holdback
                 requirement set forth above, and shall be utilized to
                 reimburse Tenant for (or, with respect to any work for which a
                 mechanics lien might be asserted against the Property, and
                 with respect to which work Tenant has not delivered evidence
                 of prior payment, to pay directly to the General Contractor)
                 the actual Costs of performing the Building Fit-Out or such
                 other costs for which such Allowance may be used in accordance
                 with the terms hereof.  At Landlord's option, disbursements
                 with respect to any work for which a mechanics lien might be
                 asserted against the Property, and with respect to which
                 Tenant has not delivered evidence of prior payment, may be
                 made directly to the General Contractor, or jointly to the
                 Tenant and the General Contractor.

         K.      Tenant acknowledges that Landlord is delivering the Premises
                 and Building in "as-is" condition, except for the performance
                 of the Landlord's Work and as may otherwise be expressly set
                 forth herein.  Tenant shall be solely responsible for ensuring
                 that the design and construction of the Building Fit-Out is in
                 compliance with ADA and with all other applicable laws,
                 building codes, ordinances and regulations applicable to the
                 construction of the Premises.  Tenant shall also be solely
                 responsible for compliance of its operations and employment
                 practices with all applicable laws, including but not limited
                 to the ADA.

         L.      Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that timely,
                 concurrent completion of the Building Fit-Out and the
                 Landlord's Work will require reasonable cooperation during the
                 plan preparation, permitting and construction process.
                 Accordingly, Landlord and Tenant agree to use commercially
                 reasonable efforts and due diligence to cooperate with each
                 other, to accommodate each other's interests as the
                 construction process progresses, and otherwise to expedite the
                 resolution of any disputes, problems or unforeseen
                 circumstances.  Upon delivery of the final construction
                 drawings to Landlord for the Building Fit-Out, Tenant shall
                 also deliver to Landlord a construction schedule for the
                 performance of the Building Fit-Out, which construction
                 schedule shall provide for a reasonable phasing of the
                 Landlord's Work with the Building Fit-Out, and for reasonable
                 periods of time for completion of each portion of the
                 Landlord's Work.  Such construction schedule shall be subject
                 to Landlord's review, comment





<PAGE>
                 and approval, and revision by Tenant, in accordance with the
                 applicable provisions of Section (C) of this Exhibit B.
                 Landlord and Tenant each agree to negotiate with regard to
                 such construction schedule in good faith.  After commencing
                 the Building Fit-Out, the Tenant shall not modify such
                 construction schedule in any respect which will alter the
                 agreed phasing of the Landlord's Work with the Building
                 Fit-Out or the agreed-upon times for the performance of the
                 Landlord's Work.  In the event of any delay claimed to have
                 been occasioned by the other party (the "delaying party"), the
                 injured party shall deliver written notice of the claim of
                 delay within two (2) business days after the occurrence
                 thereof, and the delaying party shall have two (2) business
                 days to cure the cause of such delay.  Failure to provide such
                 notice shall be deemed conclusive evidence that no such delay
                 has occurred.

         M.      Without limiting the generality or applicability of the other
                 provisions governing the Building Fit-Out under this Exhibit
                 B, or of any other applicable provision of this Lease, Tenant
                 agrees that the following provisions shall apply to the
                 performance of Building Fit-Out:

                 1.       In conducting any portion of the Building Fit-Out
                 which involves construction work upon the exterior portions of
                 the Building, Tenant agrees that it shall, at Tenant's sole
                 expense, restore all areas of the Building's exterior,
                 including, without limitation, all adjacent planting areas,
                 sidewalks and parking areas affected by the execution of the
                 Building Fit-Out, to their condition immediately prior to
                 commencement of such portion of the Building Fit-Out.

                 2.       Tenant shall protect and restore all work areas of
                 the Building (including without limitation any portions of the
                 common areas of the Building) required for access to the
                 Premises as part of the Tenant's Work, or otherwise utilized
                 or affected in performing the Building Fit-Out, including, but
                 not limited to, the Building HVAC System, Building roof,
                 common corridor floors, walls, and ceilings, second floor
                 penetrations and chase wall penetrations.  Tenant shall
                 further ensure that all floor penetrations are properly
                 fire-stopped, in accordance with applicable building and fire
                 codes and prudent construction practices.  Tenant's
                 construction schedule shall be updated promptly by Tenant to
                 reflect any material changes therein, and Tenant shall
                 promptly notify Landlord of any such change in Tenant's
                 construction schedule.  Tenant shall notify Landlord at the
                 time Tenant commences any portion of the Building Fit-Out
                 involving the exterior of the Building, the Building roof, the
                 common corridors, and all floor to floor penetrations (which
                 notification shall be deemed given as to all such matters
                 reviewed at a regularly scheduled meeting with the General
                 Contractor if Landlord's representative is in attendance.  All
                 Building Fit-Out shall be subject to the inspection and
                 approval of Landlord.  In regard to the foregoing right of
                 inspection and approval, Tenant and its contractor shall
                 permit such construction manager and/or representatives
                 reasonable and timely notice of all meetings with the General
                 Contractor, and access to all affected areas of the Premises
                 and Building necessary for Landlord to conduct inspections
                 and/or supervision.  Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord's
                 managing agent copies of all documents and document revisions
                 issued or received by Tenant pertaining to the payment, scope,
                 plans, permits, changes or schedule of, to or for the Building
                 Fit-Out sent by Tenant, Tenant's architect, the General
                 Contractor or any governmental agency which regulates the
                 Building Fit-Out in whole or part (collectively, the "Key
                 Parties") to another of the Key Parties.

                 3.       Tenant and the General Contractor shall provide
                 copies of warranties for the Building Fit-Out and the
                 materials and equipment which are incorporated into the
                 Building and Premises in connection therewith, as well as
                 provide to Landlord copies of all operating and maintenance
                 manuals for all equipment and materials incorporated into the
                 Building and/or Premises as part of the Building Fit-Out.
                 Tenant shall either assign to Landlord, or enforce on
                 Landlord's behalf, all such warranties to the extent repairs
                 and/or maintenance on warranted items which are otherwise
                 Landlord's responsibility under this Lease would be covered by
                 such warranties.  Without limitation, all aspects of the
                 Building Fit-Out in each of the Phase I Premises and the Phase
                 II Premises shall be warranted to be free from defects in
                 design and workmanship for a period of not less than one (1)
                 year from substantial completion of construction in such phase
                 (i.e., the Phase I Premises or the Phase II Premises, as the
                 case may be).





<PAGE>
         N.      In the event that Tenant is unable to occupy or use the
                 Premises for its intended purpose on or before the Phase I
                 Rent Commencement Date (with regard to the Phase I Premises)
                 or the Phase II Rent Commencement Date (with regard to the
                 Phase II Premises) due to the failure to complete the Building
                 Fit-Out or other matters for which Tenant is responsible, Rent
                 shall, nonetheless, commence on the Phase I Rent Commencement
                 Date and Phase II Rent Commencement Date, respectively.
                 Notwithstanding the foregoing:

                      (1)         To the extent substantial completion of the
                 Building Fit-Out is delayed due to the wrongful acts or
                 omissions of Landlord or its agents, employees,
                 representatives or contractors in violation of the terms
                 hereof which are not cured within twenty-four (24) hours after
                 notice thereof from Tenant to Landlord, or any failure to
                 substantially complete any of Landlord's Work by the
                 applicable deadline set forth in paragraph N(2) with respect
                 to the incomplete item(s) of Landlord's Work (without regard
                 to any extension available pursuant to paragraph N(2) for
                 delays occasioned by Force Majeure events or circumstances)
                 (collectively, "Landlord's Wrongful Acts"), and, as a result
                 of such delay, Tenant is unable to lawfully occupy the
                 Premises and in fact does not commence operation of its
                 business in the Premises on or before April 11, 1997 or such
                 later date on which the Building Fit-Out would have been
                 substantially completed and the Premises capable of lawful
                 occupancy by Tenant, but for Landlord's Wrongful Acts (as the
                 same may be extended as aforesaid, the "Target Completion
                 Date"), the Phase I Rent Commencement Date shall be extended
                 one (1) day for each day after the Target Completion Date on
                 which the Building Fit-Out is not substantially completed due
                 to Landlord's Wrongful Acts (but in no event beyond the date
                 on which Tenant is able to lawfully occupy any portion of the
                 Premises or in fact commences operation of its (or allows any
                 sublessee, licensee or other person or entity to commence
                 operation of their) business in any portion of the Premises).
                 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph
                 N(1), in the event of any failure, which is not due to Force
                 Majeure events or circumstances, by Landlord to substantially
                 complete any of Landlord's Work by the applicable deadline set
                 forth in paragraph N(2) with respect to the incomplete item(s)
                 of Landlord's Work, the Phase I Rent Commencement Date shall
                 be extended one (1) day for each day after the Target
                 Completion Date on which such Landlord's Work is not
                 substantially completed, regardless of whether Tenant is or
                 lawfully may occupy the Premises;

                      (2)         In the event that (i) any portion of the
                 Landlord's Critical Fire/Life Safety Work or the Landlord's
                 Critical HVAC Work is not substantially completed in the
                 Building on or before March 7, 1997 (the "Critical Path
                 Deadline"), or (ii) any other portion of the Landlord's Work
                 is not substantially completed in the Building on or before
                 April 11, 1997 (the "Landlord's General Work Deadline"), each
                 of the Critical Path Deadline and the Landlord's General Work
                 Deadline being subject to a day-for-day extension for each day
                 of delay in the substantial completion of the Landlord's Work
                 which is reasonably attributable to Force Majeure events or
                 circumstances or to the wrongful acts or omissions of Tenant
                 or Tenant's Agents in violation of the terms hereof which are
                 not cured within twenty-four (24) hours after notice thereof
                 from Landlord to Tenant, then in order to compensate Tenant
                 for costs and expenses that will likely be incurred by Tenant
                 on account of such delay, Landlord shall be obligated to pay
                 Tenant as liquidated damages the amount of Four Thousand Five
                 Hundred Eighty-Two and seventy-five/one hundredths Dollars
                 ($4,582.75) per day for each day after the Critical Path
                 Deadline or the Landlord's General Work Deadline, as
                 applicable (or such later date on which Tenant would have been
                 able to lawfully occupy any portion of the Premises or in fact
                 commence operation of its business in any portion of the
                 Premises, but for the delay in the





<PAGE>
                 substantial completion of the Landlord's Work), on which
                 Tenant is unable to lawfully occupy the Premises and in fact
                 does not commence operation of its (or allows any sublessee,
                 licensee or other person or entity to commence operation of
                 their) business in the Premises, together with any reasonable
                 increased cost of the Building Fit-Out proximately resulting
                 from such delay;

                      (3)         To the extent Tenant is unable to obtain a
                 non-residential use permit due to the failure of the base
                 Building structure, systems or core facilities or any of the
                 Landlord's Work to comply with any applicable legal
                 requirements, then any delay in the issuance of such
                 non-residential permit beyond the date on which Tenant would
                 have been able to obtain such non-residential use permit, but
                 for such failure, shall be treated pursuant to paragraph
                 (N)(1) as a delay in the substantial completion of the
                 Building Fit-Out caused by Landlord's Wrongful Acts;

                      (4)         In the event the Phase I Rent Commencement
                 Date shall be extended as a consequence of the failure by
                 Landlord to substantially complete any portion of the
                 Landlord's Work due to a Force Majeure event or circumstance,
                 the Expiration Date shall also be extended by a like amount;
                 and

                      (5)         Tenant acknowledges and agrees that:

                                  (i)      nothing herein contained shall be
                 deemed to extend the Phase I Rent Commencement Date by more
                 than one (1) day for any one (1) day of delay for which
                 Landlord is responsible pursuant to paragraph N(1),
                 notwithstanding that more than one (1) provision of said
                 paragraph N(1) may apply to such one (1) day of delay;

                                  (ii)     nothing herein contained shall be
                 deemed to obligate Landlord to pay Tenant more than one (1)
                 days' liquidated damages pursuant to paragraph N(2) for any
                 one (1) day of delay in Tenant's ability to lawfully occupy
                 the Premises, notwithstanding that more than one (1) failure
                 to meet the Critical Path Deadline or the Landlord's General
                 Work Deadline has contributed to such day of delay;

                                  (iii)    nothing herein contained shall be
                 deemed to extend the Phase I Rent Commencement Date, or to
                 obligate Landlord to pay Tenant liquidated damages, with
                 respect to any delay in Tenant's ability to lawfully occupy
                 the Premises or obtain a non-residential use permit therefor
                 that does not extend beyond April 11, 1997; and

                                  (iv)     the remedies set forth in this
                 paragraph N shall be Tenant's exclusive monetary remedies
                 against Landlord in respect of any delay in the substantial
                 completion of the Landlord's Work or the Building Fit-Out, and
                 any delay in Tenant's ability to lawfully occupy the Premises
                 or obtain a non-residential use permit therefor, and Tenant
                 further waives any right of rescission with respect to any
                 such delays.

         O.      Landlord and Tenant shall, and shall each cause its respective
                 contractor(s) to, work in harmony with the other party hereto
                 and its contractor(s), and neither party shall, or shall
                 knowingly permit its contractor(s) to, interfere with the
                 performance of the other party's work hereunder (i.e., the
                 Building Fit-Out or the Landlord's Work, as applicable).  Each
                 party's contractor(s) shall be permitted reasonable access to
                 the site, the loading docks, the elevators, any construction
                 lift or trash chute, and any other existing Building
                 facilities which are reasonably and customarily required in
                 the performance of their respective work (without damage
                 thereto).  Tenant shall not be charged for the use of
                 elevators, loading docks, and similar facilities in the
                 construction of the Building Fit-Out.

         P.      On or about January 1, 1997, or any earlier date after the
                 existing tenant of the Building vacates the Building to which
                 Landlord and Tenant agree, Landlord and Tenant shall cause
                 their respective designated agents to conduct a joint
                 inspection of the Building HVAC System to determine the
                 condition thereof and to jointly prepare a report regarding
                 the condition of said Building HVAC System and a list of
                 reasonable steps to be taken by Tenant to safeguard the
                 Building HVAC System against damage thereto (including, but
                 not limited to, physical damage





<PAGE>
                 to equipment, decreased operating efficiency due to abnormal
                 levels of dust or particulates, or improper balancing) arising
                 from or out of, or in connection with, the Building Fit-Out
                 (such list to include, but shall not necessarily be limited
                 to, Tenant's obligation to replace Building HVAC System
                 filters not less than once each ten (10) days).  Promptly
                 following the substantial completion of any portion of the
                 Landlord's Work affecting the Building HVAC System, prior to
                 the completion of the Building Fit-Out, Landlord and Tenant
                 shall cause their respective designated agents to mutually
                 update such report and list (each agreeing to act reasonably)
                 to reflect any change to the Building HVAC System or the
                 condition thereof as a result of the completion of such
                 portion of the Landlord's Work.  Each party agrees to act in
                 good faith in the preparation of such report and list (and any
                 supplement(s) thereto).  Tenant agrees to comply (and to cause
                 its General Contractor, contractors and subcontractors to
                 comply) with the mutually agreed steps identified to safeguard
                 the Building HVAC System against such damage.  Notwithstanding
                 anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, (i) Tenant
                 shall be solely liable for, and shall be responsible for the
                 correction of, any damage to the Building HVAC System
                 occasioned by the Building Fit-Out, and (ii) to the extent
                 reasonably attributable to any such damage, Landlord shall not
                 be liable for or obligated to grant (nor shall Tenant be
                 entitled to) any abatement of rent or liquidated damages
                 pursuant to paragraph N of this Exhibit B with regard to (a)
                 any failure to complete the Landlord's Work, (b) delay in the
                 substantial completion of the Building Fit-Out, or (c) failure
                 of the Building HVAC System to comply with any applicable
                 legal requirements.

                                  EXHIBIT B-1

                                LANDLORD'S WORK

1.       Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense, cause the work set forth
         on the attached Exhibits B-2 and B-3 (collectively, the "Landlord's
         Work") to be substantially completed in the Building in a good and
         workmanlike manner.  All of the Landlord's Work shall be performed
         utilizing Building standard materials; provided that, Landlord shall
         have the right to make reasonable and comparable substitutions.  No
         allowance or credit shall be granted in connection with any unused
         materials or any portion of the Landlord's Work which is waived by
         Tenant.   Except as expressly set forth in the Lease to the contrary
         (including, but not limited to, Exhibits B-2 and B-3, and this Exhibit
         B-1), Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Tenant will accept
         possession of the Premises in its "as is" condition as of January 1,
         1997, and (ii) Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, improve or
         modify the Premises.

2.       To the extent that any delay in the performance of the Landlord's Work
         is occasioned by the acts or omissions of Tenant or any of Tenant's
         Agents and such delay shall result in any increase in the cost of the
         performance of any portion of the Landlord's Work, Tenant shall
         reimburse Landlord upon demand for such increased cost(s).  Tenant
         shall bear all costs of design and construction of all improvements
         and alterations in excess of the Landlord's Work.  No such delay in
         the performance of the Landlord's Work  occasioned by Tenant or any of
         Tenant's Agents (nor any delay in the performance of the Landlord's
         Work which does not result in a delay in the substantial completion of
         the Building Fit-Out) shall defer or extend the Phase I Rent
         Commencement Date or the Phase II Rent Commencement Date.

3.       Landlord and Tenant shall examine the Landlord's Work upon substantial
         completion thereof, and shall prepare a list of mutually-agreed
         punch-list work.  Preparation of such list shall be conclusive
         evidence that the Landlord's Work has been completed in accordance
         with the terms hereof, subject to the cure of the identified
         "punch-list" items of the Landlord's Work, and further subject to the
         cure of latent defects in the Landlord's Work identified by Tenant in
         writing within one hundred eighty (180) days of the preparation of
         said punch-list.  Landlord shall exercise reasonable efforts to
         complete all punch-list items of Landlord's Work within thirty (30)
         days after preparation of said punch-list.

                                  EXHIBIT B-2

                          LANDLORD'S ADA and BOCA WORK

         Subject to the terms of Exhibit B-1, Landlord agrees to perform the
following work in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA")
and the 1993 BOCA Code:

1.       Landlord shall, at its own expense and not as an Operating Expense,

         warm-up and cool-down periods; and

         (f)     ensure that, subject to the qualifications and limitations set
         forth in Exhibit F, the existing base Building HVAC System meets the

         Exhibit F, of providing conditioned air at a ratio of not less than
         one (1) ton of air conditioning per three hundred twenty-five (325)
         usable square feet in the Building.

2.       With respect to the areas (the "common areas") comprising the main
         lobby, elevators and elevator lobbies, fire stairwells and rest rooms

                 2(n) being referred to as the "Landlord's Critical Fire/Life
                 Safety Work").

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord hereby reserves the right to
         add, delete, modify or replace all or any portion of the Landlord's
         ADA Work provided that Landlord complies with the requirements of ADA
         as enforced by Fairfax County, Virginia.

3.       The foregoing is not intended, and shall not be construed, to impose
         on Landlord any obligation to or liability for assuring that the
         Building Fit-Out is in compliance with any applicable law, rule,
         regulation or standard as set forth above, all of which are the sole
         and absolute responsibility of Tenant, or to rectify or remedy any
         such violation caused by the Building Fit-Out or any other acts,
         omissions, use or occupancy of Tenant.  Tenant further acknowledges
         and agrees that, (i) Tenant shall be solely responsible for
         installation and/or modification of any distribution ductwork or other
         equipment required to distribute HVAC service throughout any floor of
         the Premises, and for any balancing or rebalancing of the HVAC System
         occasioned by the Building Fit-Out, and (ii) Landlord shall have no
         obligation to perform any of Landlord's ADA Work in, for or to any
         addition, alteration or improvement in the Premises, or to any area of
         the Premises (or portion of either), which Tenant intends to demolish
         or remove as part of the Building Fit-Out.

                                   EXHIBIT D

                             RULES AND REGULATIONS


1.       The sidewalks, halls, passages, courts, exits, vestibules, entrances,
         public areas, elevators, escalators and stairways of the Property
         shall not be obstructed by Tenant or used for any purpose other than
         ingress to and egress from their respective Premises.  The halls,
         passages, exits, entrances, elevators, escalators and stairways are
         not for the general public, and Landlord shall, in all cases, retain
         the right, but not the obligation, to control and prevent access
         thereto by all persons whose presence in the reasonable judgment of
         Landlord would be prejudicial to the safety, character, reputation and
         interests of the Property, provided that nothing herein contained
         shall be construed to prevent such access to persons with whom any
         Tenant normally deals in the ordinary course of its business, unless
         such persons are engaged in illegal activities.  Neither Tenant, nor
         any of Tenant's Agents, shall enter or install equipment in mechanical
         rooms, air conditioning rooms, electrical closets, janitorial closets
         or similar areas without the prior written consent of Landlord (which
         consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

2.       The Premises shall not be used for the storage of merchandise held for
         sale to the general public or for lodging.  Except as may otherwise be
         expressly set forth in the Lease to which this Exhibit D is attached
         (if at all), no cooking shall be done or permitted by any Tenant on
         the Premises except that the use by Tenant of Underwriter's
         Laboratory-approved equipment for brewing coffee, tea, hot chocolate
         and similar beverages, and the use by Tenant of underwriter's
         laboratory approved microwave ovens for reheating food for on-premises
         consumption by Tenant's employees, shall be permitted provided that
         such use is in accordance with all applicable federal and State and
         county laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations.

3.       Tenant shall not employ any person or entity to provide services to
         the Premises (whether janitorial service, towel service, water service
         or other service), unless otherwise agreed to by Landlord in writing
         (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).  Tenant shall not
         cause any unnecessary labor by reason of such Tenant's carelessness or
         indifference in the preservation of good order and cleanliness.
         Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Lease, Landlord shall
         not be responsible to Tenant for any loss of property on the Premises,
         however occurring, or for any damage done to the effects of Tenant by
         the cleaning service or any other employee or any other person.

4.       Tenant shall not alter any lock or install a new or additional lock or
         bolts on any door of its Premises unless Tenant shall also provide
         Landlord with keys (or other means of access) for each such lock.
         Tenant, upon the termination of its tenancy, shall deliver to Landlord
         all keys which are in Tenant's possession to doors, safes, vaults and
         other locks in the Premises and the Building.

5.       Landlord shall have the right to prescribe the weight, size and
         position of all equipment, materials, furniture or other property
         brought into the Property to the extent necessary to protect the
         Property.  Heavy objects, if considered necessary by Landlord, shall
         stand on wood strips of such thickness as is necessary to properly
         distribute the weight.  Landlord will not be responsible for loss of
         or damage to any such property from any cause and all damage done to
         the Property by moving or maintaining such property shall be repaired
         at the expense of Tenant.  Business machines and other equipment shall
         be placed and maintained by Tenant at Tenant's expense in setting
         sufficient, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, to absorb and prevent
         unreasonable vibration.

6.       Subject to any contrary provisions of Section 8 of the Lease, neither
         Tenant nor any of Tenant's Agents shall use or keep in the Premises or
         the Property any kerosene, gasoline or flammable or combustible fluid
         or material other than limited quantities thereof reasonably necessary
         for the operation or maintenance of office equipment, or, without
         Landlord's prior written approval, use any method of heating or air
         conditioning other than that supplied by Landlord. Neither Tenant nor
         any of Tenant's Agents shall use or keep or permit to be used or kept
         any hazardous or toxic materials or any foul or





<PAGE>

         Premises to be occupied or used in a manner offensive or objectionable
         to Landlord in Landlord's reasonable discretion

8.       Landlord reserves the right to exclude from the Property, between the
         hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. and at all hours on Saturdays,
         Sundays, and legal holidays all persons who do not present a pass to
         the Building signed by Tenant or other evidence of authorization to
         enter reasonably designated by Tenant. Tenant shall be responsible for
         all persons for whom it authorizes entry to the Building and shall be
         liable to Landlord for all acts of such persons.  Landlord shall, in
         no case, be liable for damages for any error with regard to the
         admission to or exclusion from the Property of any person.  In the
         case of invasion, mob, riot, public excitement or other circumstances
         rendering such action advisable in Landlord's opinion Landlord
         reserves the right to prevent access to the Property during the
         continuance of the same by such action as Landlord may deem
         appropriate including closing doors.

9.       In the event Tenant no longer leases the entire Building, no curtains,
         draperies, blinds, shutters, shades, screens or other coverings,
         hangings or decorations shall be attached to, hung or placed in, or
         used in connection with any window of the Building without the prior
         written consent of Landlord (such consent not to be unreasonably
         withheld, conditioned or delayed).  No files, cabinets, boxes,
         containers or similar items shall be placed in, against or adjacent to
         any window of the Building so as to create an unsightly condition
         visible from the outside of the Building.  No bottles, parcels or
         other articles may be placed in the halls or in any other part of the
         Property, nor shall any article be thrown out of the doors or windows
         of the Premises.

10.      Tenant shall ensure that the doors of its Premises are closed and
         locked, that all water faucets, water apparatus and utilities are shut
         off before Tenant or Tenant's employees leave the Premises, so as to
         prevent waste or damage.

11.      The lavatory rooms, toilets, urinals, wash bowls and other apparatus
         shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which they were
         constructed, no foreign substance of any kind whatsoever shall be
         thrown therein and the expense of any breakage, stoppage or damage
         resulting from the violation of this rule shall be borne by Tenant.
         The Premises shall not be used for manufacturing of any kind, or any
         business or activity other than that specifically permitted pursuant
         to the Lease to which this Exhibit D is attached.

12.      No air conditioning units or other projections shall be attached to
         the outside walls or window sills of the Building or otherwise project
         from the Building, without the prior written consent of Landlord.
         Tenant shall not install or permit the installation of any awnings,
         shades, mylar films or sun-filters on windows.  Tenant shall cooperate
         with Landlord in obtaining maximum effectiveness of the cooling system
         of the Building by closing drapes and other window coverings when the
         sun's rays fall upon windows of the Premises.  Tenant shall not
         obstruct, alter or in any way impair the efficient operation of
         Landlord's heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical, fire,
         safety or light systems, nor shall Tenant tamper with or change the
         setting of any thermostat or temperature control valves in the
         Building.  Tenant shall cooperate with energy conservation by limiting
         use of lights to areas occupied during non-business hours.

13.      There shall not be used in any space or public halls of the Building,
         either by any Tenant or any others, any hand trucks except those
         equipped with rubber tires and side guards or such other material
         handling equipment as Landlord may approve.

14.      No material shall be placed in the trash boxes or receptacles if such
         material is of such nature that it may not be disposed of in the
         ordinary and customary manner of removing and disposing of trash and
         garbage in the jurisdiction where the Property is located without
         being in violation of any law or ordinance governing such disposal.

15.      Intentionally Omitted.

16.      No cutting or boring for wires shall be allowed without Landlord's
         consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

17.      Tenant shall not lay linoleum, tile, carpet or floor covering so that
         it is affixed to the floor of the Premises by the use of cement or
         other similar adhesive material.  Electric and telephone floor
         distribution boxes must remain accessible at all times.

18.      The requirements of Tenant will be attended to only upon written
         request to the Landlord's managing agent at the Washington, D.C.
         metropolitan area office of said managing agent.  Employees of
         Landlord shall not perform any work or do anything outside of their
         regular duties unless under special instructions from Landlord.

19.      These rules and regulations are in addition to the terms, covenants,
         agreements and conditions of the Lease to which they are attached, but
         in the event of a conflict between the express terms of the Lease to
         which this Exhibit D is attached (exclusive of these rules and
         regulations), and the terms of these rules and regulations, such other
         terms of the Lease shall control.

20.      Landlord reserves the right to make such other rules and regulations
         as Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable discretion, may deem necessary
         from time to time.

21.      Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant or to any other person for
         the non-observance or violation of these rules and regulations by any
         person.  Tenant shall be deemed to have read these rules and to have
         agreed to abide by them as a condition to its occupancy of the space
         leased.

                                   EXHIBIT E

                                ROOF-TOP RIGHTS


1.       License.  Subject to the terms hereof, Landlord hereby grants to
         Tenant an exclusive license (the "License") to enter onto and utilize
         the roof of the Building (the "License Area"), solely for the use
         permitted pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof; provided that, such license
         is subject to Landlord's right to enter (and to permit its
         contractor(s) to enter) onto the roof and perform additions,
         alterations, improvements, maintenance, modification and repairs in
         connection with the operation of the Building.

2.       Term.  The License granted hereby shall commence upon January 1, 1997,
         and shall, subject to the terms hereof, continue in full force and
         effect until the expiration or sooner termination of the lease (the
         "Lease") to which this Exhibit E is attached (the "License Term"), as
         such lease may be renewed.  Notwithstanding anything herein contained
         to the contrary, (i) Landlord may revoke this License at any time
         during the continuance of any default or breach of the terms of this
         License or the Lease which remains uncured beyond the applicable
         notice and cure period (if any), and (ii) in the event Tenant shall at
         any time lease less than all of the Building, this License shall be
         deemed a non-exclusive license and Landlord shall have the right to
         grant to other tenants of the Building the right to use reasonable
         quantities of space upon the roof provided that such use does not
         interfere with Tenant's ability to utilize its Equipment.  Upon the
         expiration or sooner termination of the License, Tenant shall have no
         right, title or interest with respect to the License Area.

3.       Permitted Use:  Subject to (i) Tenant's receipt of all applicable
         governmental approvals and permits (the same to be obtained by the
         Tenant and a copy thereof provided to Landlord, all at the Tenant's
         sole expense), (ii) Landlord's structural and roofing requirements
         (consistent with the structural limitations of the Building as
         reasonably determined by the Landlord's structural engineer), and
         (iii) the provisions of paragraph 4 hereof, Landlord agrees to permit
         Tenant to utilize, for the purposes provided herein, suitable space on
         the roof for installation and operation of radio, microwave and
         satellite transmission and reception equipment and HVAC equipment
         (collectively referred to as the "Equipment"), subject to all of the
         terms of this License.  Use of the Equipment shall be solely for the
         convenience of Tenant in the normal conduct of Tenant's business.  In
         no event shall the Equipment be used for a commercial purpose separate
         from Tenant's normal business as an independent means of producing
         income separate from the Tenant's normal business.  Without limiting
         the preceding sentence, Tenant shall have no right to assign or
         sublease any rights to utilize the License Area other than as part of
         an assignment of the entire Lease.

4.       Landlord's Prior Approval:

         (a)     The nature, type, weight and location of the Equipment and
         plans and specifications for the installation thereof shall be subject
         to the Landlord's prior written approval (which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided Tenant is not
         proposing to exceed the load bearing capacity of the affected
         portion(s) of the roof or proposing any penetration of the roof
         membrane or other alteration, addition, improvement or modification
         which will void any existing roof warranty).

         (b)     Tenant agrees not to install or modify any of the Equipment in
         any manner which will or may interfere with the operation of any
         existing equipment installed on the roof from time to time by any
         other person or entity.  Tenant shall take all steps necessary to
         ensure that the installation and operation of the Equipment does not
         adversely affect the operation of the Building or its basic systems.
         If the operation of any portion of the Equipment causes any such
         adverse effect, Tenant, at its sole expense, shall immediately take
         all steps necessary to eliminate such adverse effect(s).  If such
         adverse effect(s) cannot be eliminated by Tenant, Tenant shall, upon
         Landlord's request and at Tenant's sole expense, remove the Equipment
         in accordance with the terms hereof.

         (c)     After initial installation of the Equipment, Landlord may
         require Tenant to relocate the Equipment, on reasonable Notice to
         Tenant; provided, however, that no relocation shall be required to a





<PAGE>


         location which will not permit the Equipment to function properly or
         which would not allow for necessary transmission paths.  Landlord
         shall bear the cost of any relocation of the Tenant's Equipment
         required by Landlord, other than any relocation(s) required in order
         to effect additions, alterations, improvements, maintenance,
         modifications repairs or replacements to the roof or other portions of
         the Building or the equipment serving the same or any of the
         components of any of the foregoing (collectively, "Roof Alterations")
         (in which event Landlord and Tenant shall each bear one-half (1/2) of
         the reasonable cost of such relocation).  To the extent the
         installation, operation or relocation of the Tenant's Equipment shall
         increase the cost of any such Roof Alterations, Tenant shall reimburse
         Landlord upon demand for the amount of such increase.  In no event
         shall Landlord be liable for any loss, damage or injury to Tenant's
         business occasioned by any required relocation of Tenant's Equipment.

5.       Installation of Equipment:

         (a)     The Equipment shall be installed by a properly licensed and
         insured contractor reasonably approved by Landlord, at Tenant's sole
         expense, in compliance with all applicable codes, law and regulations.
         Neither the aggregate live or dead load associated with the Equipment
         (inclusive of all mounting structures) shall exceed the load bearing
         capacity of the roof.

         (b)     No penetration of the roof surface of the Building will be
         allowed except upon the prior written consent of the Landlord and the
         written agreement of the entity (or, if more than one (1), all
         entities) providing a warranty on the roof of the Building, that such
         penetration will not invalidate, in whole or part, the warranty(ies)
         provided by such entity(ies).  The Equipment shall, to the extent
         required by applicable law, be shielded from public view in a manner
         acceptable to the Landlord.  In no event shall Tenant permit the
         Equipment to be visible from surrounding locations on the ground.

6.       Assignment:  Except as expressly permitted hereby, Tenant shall not
         assign or otherwise transfer this License Agreement, or any of
         Tenant's rights hereunder, nor permit the use or occupancy of the
         License Area by any person or entity other than Tenant.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to assign
         its rights under this License to any assignee of all of Tenant's
         right, title and interest in and to the Lease.

7.       Condition and Suitability of the Property:  Landlord makes no
         representations or warranties regarding the suitability or condition
         of the roof for installation or operation of the Equipment, and
         Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant on account thereof.  The
         installation and operation of the Equipment on the roof by Tenant
         shall be at the Tenant's sole risk.


8.       Repairs and Maintenance:  Tenant shall repair and maintain the
         Equipment throughout the Term in compliance with all applicable codes,
         laws and regulations.  Tenant and/or its contractor shall bear all
         expenses in connection with the installation, operation, maintenance
         and repair of the Equipment and the removal thereof.  Tenant
         acknowledges and agrees that all risk of loss or damage to the
         Equipment, from any cause whatsoever, shall be borne solely by Tenant,
         and Tenant undertakes to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless
         therefrom.

9.       Compliance with Laws.

                 (a)      Tenant shall, at the Tenant's expense, comply with
         all governmental laws, regulations or requirements and obtain and
         maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term all permits and
         other governmental approvals as may be required in connection with the
         Equipment. Prior to installation of the Equipment, Tenant shall
         provide Landlord with evidence that all such necessary permits and
         approvals have been obtained.   In addition, Tenant agrees that Tenant
         shall, at Tenant's sole expense, comply with all other laws, statutes,
         ordinances, and governmental rules, regulations and requirements now
         in force or which may hereafter be in force, and with the requirements
         of any board of fire underwriters or other similar body now or
         hereafter constituted, relating to or affecting the Tenant's
         Equipment, access to the roof, and/or the activities of Tenant or
         Tenant's Agents in, on or upon the roof.





<PAGE>



                 (b)      Tenant acknowledges that, depending on the location,
         nature and size of the Equipment, review by local planning or zoning
         authorities may be required.  In the event any review by or proceeding
         before local planning or zoning authorities is required in order to
         obtain approval for installation of the Equipment, the Landlord agrees
         to cooperate in connection therewith, provided that the same is at no
         cost, expense or risk to the Landlord.  Upon installation of the
         Equipment, the Tenant shall provide the Landlord with such evidence as
         the Landlord may reasonably require of compliance with laws, including
         (where applicable) regulations of the Federal Communications
         Commission and Federal Aviation Administration.

10.      Access to the License Area: Tenant and its contractors shall have
         reasonable access during normal working hours (and, in the event of an
         emergency, after normal working hours) to the License Area to
         facilitate the installation, operation and maintenance of the
         Equipment and the removal thereof. Access to and activities in, on or
         upon the roof by Tenant and/or Tenant's Agents shall be subject to
         such reasonable rules and regulations as Landlord may promulgate in
         connection with such access and/or activities.

         fifteen (15) days after written notice to comply with, fulfill or
         observe any of the covenants, conditions, or obligations made by or
         imposed on the Tenant pursuant to the terms of this License or, with
         respect to the Equipment or the Licensed Area (or such longer time as
         may be reasonably required to cure such failure through the exercise
         of due diligence, provided that (i) such failure is not a willful
         repudiation of the License authorized by Tenant's Board of Directors,
         (ii) such failure is susceptible of cure, (iii) such failure does not
         relate to the existence of a Hazardous Substance on the roof in
         violation of Section 8 of the Lease, (iv) such failure does not
         subject Landlord to prosecution or substantial civil or criminal fine
         or penalty, and (v) Tenant promptly commences to cure such failure
         within the aforesaid fifteen (15) day period and thereafter diligently
         pursues the cure of such failure to completion) (each of the foregoing
         being herein referred to as an "Roof-Top Breach"), or (ii) removal of
         the Equipment shall be required by any governmental authority, this
         License may, without demand or notice, be terminated by the Landlord
         without payment of penalty or compensation to Tenant, and Tenant shall
         promptly (immediately, if so required by a governmental authority)
         remove the Equipment from the Building at the Tenant's expense;
         provided that, Tenant shall not be required to remove its Equipment
         from the roof pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 11 so long as

         against, Landlord and/or the Property as a result of the continued
         existence of Tenant's Equipment on the roof or such contest; and
         provided further that, in the event that a final, unappealable
         decision in any such contest shall require the removal of Tenant's
         Equipment, Tenant shall promptly comply with such decision.  In all
         events, Tenant shall at its sole cost and expense remove the Equipment
         and all screening therefor upon the expiration or sooner termination
         of the License and restore the area affected by the installation,

         hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord and Landlord's agents,
         contractors and employees (collectively, the "Indemnitees") harmless
         from and against any and all costs, damages, claims, expenses, fees,
         suits, awards and liabilities incurred or suffered by or claimed
         against any Indemnitee (including, but not limited to, court costs and

         Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall be
         responsible for, and shall defend, indemnify and hold Landlord

                           ANCILLARY USE RESTRICTIONS

1.       Ancillary Uses:  Each of the Ancillary Uses set forth in the Lease are
         subject to the applicable provisions of this Exhibit H.

2.       General Conditions:

                 (a)      In no event shall any Ancillary Use (other than any
         food service operation on the first (1st) floor of the Building) be
         used for a commercial purpose separate from Tenant's normal business
         as an independent means of producing income separate from the Tenant's
         normal business.  Without limiting the preceding sentence, Tenant
         shall have no right to assign or sublease any rights to engage in any
         of the Ancillary Uses on any floor above the ground level of the
         Building, other than by the assignment of the entire Lease. In no
         event shall any such Ancillary Uses be open to, or made available to,
         the general public.

                 (b)      The nature, type, weight, location and method of
         installation of all equipment utilized in the Ancillary Uses or
         required in connection with the Ancillary Uses (collectively,
         "Ancillary Use Equipment") shall be subject to the Landlord's prior
         written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
         conditioned or delayed, provided Tenant is not proposing to exceed the
         load bearing capacity of the affected portion(s) of the Premises or
         the electrical capacity of the circuits to be so utilized, and further
         provided that such Ancillary Use Equipment is installed in such manner
         as will not materially interfere with the operation of the Building as
         a multi-tenant building in the future.  All Ancillary Use Equipment
         installed in the Premises shall be Underwriters' Laboratory approved.
         Tenant agrees not to install or modify any Ancillary Use Equipment in
         any manner which will or may interfere with the operation of any
         existing equipment installed in or on the Property.  Tenant shall take
         all steps necessary to ensure that the installation and operation of
         the Ancillary Use Equipment does not adversely affect the operation of
         the Building or its basic systems.  If the operation of any portion of
         the Ancillary Use Equipment causes any such adverse effect, Tenant, at
         its sole expense, shall immediately take all steps necessary to
         eliminate such adverse effect(s).  If such adverse effect(s) cannot be
         eliminated by Tenant, Tenant shall, upon Landlord's request and at
         Tenant's sole expense, remove the Ancillary Use Equipment in
         accordance with the terms hereof.  Tenant shall be solely responsible
         for the maintenance, repair and replacement of the Ancillary Use
         Equipment, and Tenant agrees to maintain all Ancillary Use Equipment
         in good working order and in compliance with all applicable laws at
         all times.

                 (c)      Landlord makes no representations or warranties
         regarding the suitability or condition of the Premises for
         installation of the Ancillary Use Equipment or operation of the
         Ancillary Uses, and Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant on
         account thereof.  The installation of the Ancillary Use Equipment and
         operation of the Ancillary Uses by Tenant shall be at the Tenant's
         sole risk.

                 (d)      Tenant shall be solely responsible for, and shall
         promptly pay when due, all costs, expenses and fees arising from or
         out of, or in connection with, the installation or operation of any
         Ancillary Use or any Ancillary Use Equipment.  It is the intent of the
         parties hereto that Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses relating
         to the Ancillary Uses, and that any amount or obligation relating to
         the Ancillary Uses which is not expressly declared to be that of
         Landlord shall be deemed to be any obligation of Tenant to be
         performed by Tenant at Tenant's sole expense.  Without limiting the
         foregoing, Tenant shall be solely responsible for all cleaning,
         security, utilities and increased insurance premiums arising from or
         out of, or in connection with, the Ancillary Uses or the Ancillary Use
         Equipment.

                 (e)      Tenant shall be responsible at its sole expense for
         providing and installing all furniture, trade fixtures and equipment
         desired by the Tenant or otherwise required in connection with any
         Ancillary Use.  Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall be solely
         responsible for the installation, operating, maintenance, repair,
         replacement and removal of any and all HVAC and fire suppression

         equipment in excess of the equipment being furnished by Landlord
         pursuant to Exhibit B (including, but not limited to, additional
         sprinkler heads or runs, fire suppression equipment, venting and
         exhaust ductwork and equipment) required by this Lease or applicable
         law, or desired by Tenant, in connection with any Ancillary Use.
         Tenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have no,
         and is hereby relieved of, liability for any failure or inadequacy of
         the base Building HVAC or fire suppression System to the extent such
         failure or inadequacy is attributable to any Ancillary Use or any
         Ancillary Use Equipment.

                 (f)      The Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall be
         responsible for maintaining all areas of the Premises utilized for
         Ancillary Uses, and all Ancillary Use Equipment, in a clean, safe and
         sanitary condition, and in compliance with all applicable laws,
         ordinances, regulations, rules and other restrictions imposed by any
         governmental or quasi-governmental agency or authority, at all times.
         Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the Tenant shall be required
         to regularly maintain and promptly repair when necessary all Ancillary
         Use Equipment.

                 (g)      The provisions set forth in this Exhibit "H" are in
         addition to all other provisions of the Lease imposing a covenant,
         duty, obligation or restriction upon the Tenant.  Without limiting the
         foregoing, nothing in this Exhibit "H" shall be deemed to authorize
         the storage or use of any Hazardous Substance on the Premises other
         than Permitted Materials.

3.       Food Service Operations.  In addition to the foregoing:

                 (a)      In no event shall Tenant sell, or suffer or permit
         any other person or entity to sell from the Premises any alcoholic
         beverages for either on-Premises or off-Premises consumption.

                 (b)      All garbage and refuse shall be removed from any food
         service operation within the Premises prior to the close of business
         each day.  Tenant shall keep all garbage, refuse and trash from food
         service operations in pest-safe closed containers, with appropriate
         odor-eliminators, until removal.  All garbage and refuse removal shall
         be made through the loading dock of the Building without use of the
         lobby area or common corridors of the Building, and, during such times
         as Tenant leases less than the entire Building, no removal will be
         made between the hours of 7:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

                 (c)      Tenant shall at its expense have all areas utilized
         for food service operations, and all adjacent areas of the Premises,
         regularly treated (not less than once each thirty (30) days throughout
         the Lease Term) by a licensed and reputable pest control contractor or
         exterminator for rats, mice, insects and other pests and vermin.  The
         Tenant's schedule for such treatment and the contractor providing the
         treatment shall be reasonably acceptable to the Landlord.

                 (d)      Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole expense:

                          (i)     install, maintain and clean, on a regular
                 schedule (but not less often than once each thirty (30) days
                 throughout the Lease Term), and replace as necessary, all
                 exhaust ductwork and such grease traps as shall be required by
                 the Landlord to prevent the accumulation of grease or other
                 waste in the plumbing or venting facilities servicing food
                 service operation areas of the Premises;

                          (ii)    prevent any obnoxious or objectionable odors
                 (as reasonably determined by the Landlord) from emanating from
                 the Premises, either from food preparation or garbage or
                 otherwise, and install, maintain and clean, on a regular
                 schedule, and replace as necessary, vents and exhausts or
                 other suitable devices to prevent the same, as reasonably
                 required by the Landlord or any legal authorities having
                 jurisdiction thereof, including, but not limited to, the
                 installation and/or replacement of filters and other devices
                 designed to control odors;





<PAGE>


                          (iii)   observe any reasonable rules or regulations
                 promulgated by the Landlord at any time and from time to time
                 relating to delivery vehicles and the delivery of food,
                 beverages or merchandise and the storage and removal of trash
                 and garbage; and not permit any deliveries to be made between
                 the hours of 7:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m.  and 4:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.;

                          (iv)    not dispose of any foreign substances in the
                 plumbing facilities other than through utilization of
                 appropriate garbage disposal units; and

                          (v)     carry products liability insurance with
                 respect to any food service operation of not less than One

                 (e)      Tenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that
         Landlord shall have no liability for, and Tenant hereby expressly
         relieves Landlord of all liability for, damages caused by spoilage of

         Equipment from the Property at Tenant's expense; provided that, Tenant
         shall not be required to cease any Ancillary Use or remove any
         Ancillary Use Equipment from the Property pursuant to the foregoing
         provision of this sentence, so long as (x) Tenant promptly, diligently
         and in good faith contests the cessation and/or removal requirement
         (as the case may be) by the applicable governmental authority, and (y)
         Tenant indemnifies and holds Landlord and the Property

         decision in any such contest shall require the cessation of such
         Ancillary Use and/or removal of Tenant's Equipment, Tenant shall
         promptly comply with such decision.
