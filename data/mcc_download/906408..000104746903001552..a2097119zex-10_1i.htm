<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each

of the Board of Directors of RFS, as general partner of Borrower, authorizing the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by Borrower; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolutions

those certain organizational documents of Borrower as set forth and described in Schedule&nbsp;A attached hereto, and such other documents and items
[including but not limited to, such certificates and permits from governmental officials and agencies, and such certificates and/or statements made by the officers and/or partners (as the

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
documents identified in items 6 through 11 above are herein collectively referred to as the "Organizational Documents." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the purpose of rendering this Opinion, we have examined such questions of law as we have deemed appropriate. As to certain questions of fact, we have relied without independent
investigation (unless expressly otherwise indicated herein) on, and we have assumed the accuracy and validity of (however, nothing has come to our attention which would lead us to doubt the accuracy
and validity of), the certificates of the Secretary of the Guarantors with respect to corporate and partnership matters of the Guarantors and Borrower (Exhibit "C"), corporate/partnership records of
the Borrower and Guarantors supplied to us by the Borrower and Guarantors and certificates of certain public officials. However, except for the Documents described above we have not, unless expressly
otherwise indicated herein, reviewed any other documents or conducted any other examination of any public records, and the opinions rendered herein are limited accordingly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Opinion, we have assumed that Recipient has the corporate power and authority to enter into and perform all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, and the due
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by, and valid and binding effect of the Loan Documents upon, Recipient. We also have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, the genuineness of all signatures, other than those signing on behalf of Borrower and Guarantors, the legal capacity of natural persons, and the conformity to originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed all charges under the Loan Documents for costs of late payments, pre-payments, commitments, defaults, and the like to be fair and reasonable
as a matter of fact. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Borrower is a limited partnership, duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Tennessee. Each Guarantor is a corporation, duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Tennessee. The Borrower has not filed a certificate of cancellation of limited partnership, and Guarantors have paid all fees,
taxes and penalties owed to the State of Tennessee which affect their existence as corporations, have filed with the Secretary of State of Tennessee their most recent annual report required by the
Tennessee Business Corporation Act, and have not filed articles of termination of corporate existence or articles of dissolution. Pursuant to the certificates of the respective secretaries of states
offices, the Borrower and the Guarantors are qualified to do business in the states as set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto. The Borrower and
the Guarantors and each of their Subsidiaries and each Qualified Borrower have all requisite limited partnership or corporate, as applicable, authority and power to own and/or lease their properties,
to conduct their businesses, and to enter into, execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform their obligations under the Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower, Guarantors, and the Subsidiaries and the performance by them of their respective obligations under the
Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary partnership and corporate, as applicable, action and/or proceedings on their part and will not: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;&nbsp;require

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower, Guarantors and the Subsidiaries and constitute their legal, valid and binding obligations
enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms (except that no opinion is made with respect to Modification Agreements which by their terms are governed by laws other than the laws of the State of Tennessee). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
our knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no litigation or proceeding against Borrower or Guarantors which, if adversely determined, could have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in the Loan Document). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of, or registration or filing with, any governmental authority, which has not been obtained or made by the
Borrower or the Guarantors, is required to be obtained or made by the Borrower or the Guarantors in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under the Loan
Agreement or in connection with the payment or performance by the Borrower or the Guarantors of their obligations under the Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
provisions of the Loan Documents with respect to the payment of interest, loan fees, default premiums, late fees, prepayment premiums, default rate of interest, and
all other payments or charges thereunder (however designated) calculated, with respect to varying rates, as of the date hereof, do not violate the usury laws or laws regulating use or forbearance of
money of Tennessee and the operation of such provisions shall not render the Loan Documents unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission, set off, counterclaim or defense
under such Tennessee laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
foregoing opinions are subject to and expressly limited by the following assumptions, qualifications and limitations, in addition to those previously set forth, none
of which assumptions, qualifications and limitations will interfere materially with the practical realization by Recipient of the benefits, remedies and security intended to be afforded by the Loan
Documents: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
opinion concerning enforceability of the Loan Documents in Paragraph&nbsp;3 above is subject to [i] all applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyancing, preferential transfer, moratorium or similar laws of general application and court decisions affecting the rights of creditors; and
[ii] general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), including concepts of good faith, fair dealing,
commercial reasonableness and unconscionability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
rights, remedies and other provisions in the Loan Documents may be limited or rendered unenforceable by applicable Tennessee laws or judicial decisions governing
such provisions, but in our opinion such laws and judicial decisions do not, subject to the other qualifications and limitations in this opinion, render the Loan Documents invalid as a whole, and
there exist, in the Loan Documents or pursuant to applicable law, adequate rights, remedies and provisions for the practical realization of the benefits intended to be provided by </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
qualification "to our knowledge", whenever used in this Opinion, means that during the course of our representation of the Borrower and the Guarantors pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, no information has come to the attention of the lawyers in our firm who have had active involvement in negotiating the transaction, preparing the Loan
Documents or preparing this Opinion contrary to the opinions so qualified. However, except for the Organizational Documents which we have obtained from the Borrower and the Guarantors concerning the
