               liability to Cytyc for violating any intellectual property rights

               to its business, unless such violation has an impact on Cytyc.

          year, whichever is the higher, in the year 2001. In each subsequent
          year of the Term, the minimum aggregate invoice price of US$***
          million will be adjusted upward in proportion to any price increase
          implemented pursuant to this Agreement.

     3.2  Stock of Irradiated Membrane

          (a.) Whatman shall manufacture and hold as safety stock *** membrane
               conforming to Appendix 1, in an amount sufficient, for eventual
               processing into Whatman Product ("the Stock") which is equivalent
               to Cytyc's requirement for the second 12 months of Cytyc's 24
               month forecasts provided pursuant to Clause 2.4 hereof. Whatman
               shall provide Cytyc on a quarterly basis in January et. seq. of a
               certificate showing the amount of the Stock.

          (b.) Whatman shall not charge Cytyc for the Stock held by it other
               than a storage charge which is included in the price in Clause
               4.1 (a) below in an amount of ***% of that price, provided
               however that Whatman shall be entitled, on any occasion that
               prices may be increased pursuant to Clause 4.1 (c) or (d), to
               increase the price of the Whatman Product to Cytyc in respect of
               the storage cost according to the following formula:

          (    B    x ***%    )    X    Current Price
               -
          (    A              )

<PAGE>

          Where in the year in respect of which stock is held

               A    =    Actual amount ordered by Cytyc

               B    =    Forecast amount by Cytyc

          Which formula shall only be applied where B results in a factor of
          more than ***.                            -
                                                    A

          An example of this calculation is annexed hereto as Appendix 4.

          (c.) Cytyc shall be unconditionally liable to purchase the Stock at a
               price of ***% of the then current price of Whatman Product,
               immediately upon termination of this Agreement for any reason but
               only providing it conforms to the specification in respect of
               *** in Appendix 1.

          "Cyclopore" or "Whatman" trademark in any way whatsoever with or in
          connection with the Whatman Product purchased by Cytyc hereunder
          without the written permission of Whatman. Cytyc agrees that it shall

          Whatman Product infringes a United States patent, Whatman agrees to
          use reasonable efforts to defend the suit, pay reasonable litigation
          costs, indemnify Cytyc for any actual damages awarded or any
          settlement approved by Whatman, provided Cytyc: gives Whatman (i)
          timely written notice of such suit; (ii) continuous cooperation in the
          defense of the suit; and (iii) control over the defense of any such

          endeavors (i) procure for Cytyc the right to continue using the
          Whatman Product or, (ii) replace or modify the Whatman Product to
          avoid infringement. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
          Whatman shall have no obligation to defend, and shall not be liable
          for any costs or damages awarded in, any suit for infringement
          concerning (i) the Whatman Product if made to specifications supplied

          methods of manufacture, processes and quality control of the Parties'
          respective products and processes, or other proprietary or
          confidential information relating to their respective customers,
          finances and business plans which is valuable and confidential (the
          "Confidential Information").

     8.4  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations set forth in this
          Article 8 shall not apply to any information which:

          (a)  at the time of its disclosure is already in the public domain or
               subsequently comes into the public domain otherwise than by

          (b)  the recipient of such disclosure (the "Receiving Party")
               demonstrates to the Party disclosing information (the "Disclosing
               Party") was, immediately prior to its disclosure, already in the
               possession of the Receiving Party, but not already published;

          (c)  the Disclosing Party authorises to the Receiving Party in writing
               to be disclosed;

          (d)  the Receiving Party receives from a third party which such third
               party did not itself obtain it in confidence directly or
               indirectly from the Disclosing Party;

          (e)  is disclosed in response to a valid order by a court or other
               governmental body, which was otherwise required be law, or any
               disclosure necessary to establish the rights of either Cytyc or
               Whatman under this Agreement; provided, however, that

               required disclosure to the Disclosing Party; or
