                         (F)  the conditions specified in Section 6.3(b) of this
                              Agreement have been fulfilled or waived;

                    (ii) Debt pay-off letter(s) with agreements by the lien
                         holder(s) to release all liens;

                    (iii) Certificate(s) from each Shareholder representing 100%

                    (iv) An executed IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form(s)

                         Closing.

     Section 2.9    Closing Net Worth Adjustment and Estimated Closing Net
Worth Adjustment.

               (a) The "Closing Net Worth Adjustment" shall be the positive or
negative amount by which the Closing Net Worth (as defined below) differs from
$2,800,000 (the "Pro Forma Closing Net Worth"). If the Closing Net Worth exceeds
the Pro Forma Closing Net Worth, then the Closing Net Worth Adjustment shall be
positive; and if the Closing Net Worth is less than the Pro Forma Closing Net
Worth, then the Closing Net Worth Adjustment shall be negative. The Company
shall estimate in good faith the Closing Net Worth, as of Closing, and deliver
such estimate (including (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of a
date within three (3) days of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP,
applied in a manner consistent with and using all of the same accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies (including, in the case of
judgments, judgments consistent with the applicable judgment made with respect
to the Company Balance Sheet) used in the preparation of the Company Balance
Sheet (the "Accounting Principles") and fully annotated in accordance with
Company's past practices to Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days before
the Closing Date (the difference between such estimate and the Pro Forma Closing
Net Worth being the "Estimated Net Worth Adjustment"). The Initial Purchase
Price shall be adjusted for the Estimated Net Worth Adjustment. The Closing Net
Worth shall be finally determined in accordance with Section 2.9(b) and Section
2.10.

               (b) Promptly after the Closing, Company's independent accountants
shall, at Buyer's expense (i) audit the books of account of the Company as of
the Closing Date, and (ii) prepare an audited balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and shall
be accompanied by an unqualified report of Company's independent accountants on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet certifying that the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and any related notes thereto were prepared in accordance with the Accounting

                                      -15-

Principles. The Merger Parties acknowledge that (A) the sole purpose of the
determination of Closing Net Worth is to adjust the Initial Purchase Price so as
to reflect the change in net worth of the Company from the Pro Forma Closing Net
Worth to the Closing Date and (B) such change is to be measured on a totally
consistent basis so that the calculation is to be done using the same Accounting
Principles at both dates. For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing Net Worth"
shall mean (i) the Company's assets as of the Closing, less (ii) the Company's
liabilities as of Closing, in each case as reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet.

     Section 2.10 Post-Closing Adjustment Payment.

               (a) Buyer, based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall provide
to the Shareholder Representative, within sixty (60) days after Closing, (i) a
copy of the Closing Date Balance Sheet accompanied by the unqualified report of
Company's accountant as provided in Section 2.9(b), and (ii) a copy of Company's
independent accountants' calculation of (A) the actual Closing Net Worth
Adjustment ("Actual Net Worth Adjustment"); (B) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Net Worth Adjustment is less than the Actual Net Worth Adjustment (an
"Adjustment in Favor of Shareholders"); and (C) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Net Worth Adjustment is greater than the Actual Net Worth Adjustment
(an "Adjustment in Favor of Buyer") (such materials, the "Buyer Adjustment
Notice").

               (b) Buyer, at the Shareholder Representative's request, shall
allow the Shareholder Representative and his or her representatives access at
all reasonable times to the Surviving Corporation's and Company's accountants,
personnel, properties, books and records, work papers, schedules and
calculations relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Actual Net Worth
Adjustment for the purpose of reviewing the Buyer Adjustment Notice and the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and confirming the accuracy of the preparation
thereof. In the event that the Shareholder Representative provides notice
("Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice") to Buyer no later
than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Buyer Adjustment Notice that the
Shareholders dispute the Company's Accountants' determination of the Actual Net
Worth Adjustment, the Adjustment in Favor of Shareholders or the Adjustment in
Favor of Buyer determined in accordance with Section 2.10(a), the Shareholder
Representative and Buyer shall then meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute, such negotiation to begin as soon as practicable (but in any case,
no later than thirty (30) days) after Buyer's receipt of the Shareholder
Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice; provided, that, any amounts not then
in dispute shall be paid promptly by the owing party hereto.

               (c) In the event that Buyer and the Shareholder Representative
are not able to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date on
which the Shareholder Representative provides Buyer with the Shareholder
Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice, then either the Shareholder
Representative or Buyer may refer the issues in dispute to a neutral mutually
acceptable independent accounting firm of national reputation with which no
party hereto has had a preexisting relationship for resolution (the "Purchase
Price Adjustment Referee"). The decision of such issues by the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee shall be final and binding on all Merger Parties. The Merger
Parties shall submit their positions on the dispute to the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee within thirty (30) days after referral, and shall direct the
Purchase Price Adjustment Referee to decide the dispute within

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

fifteen (15) days after submission to it. The Purchase Price Adjustment Referee
shall also decide the allocation of fees and expenses of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee between the Merger Parties with any amounts due from the
Shareholders being paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds. Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative shall direct the Purchase Price Adjustment Referee to
promptly provide invoices of all such fees and expenses directly to the
Shareholder Representative, the Escrow Agent and Buyer. In the event the
Shareholders are required to pay any fees and expenses for the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee, as soon as possible following Escrow Agent's receipt of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Referee's invoice, Escrow Agent shall be instructed to
distribute the portion of the invoice amount to be paid by the Shareholders from
the funds on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with
the wire transfer instructions set forth in such invoice. The Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility to verify the accuracy of any information contained in
such invoice, nor shall the Escrow Agent incur any liability for acting in
accordance with such invoice. Any other costs incurred by either party
including, but not limited to, experts, attorneys or financial advisors shall be
at the sole cost of the party incurring such cost regardless of the
determination.

               (d) On the applicable date referred to in this Section 2.10,
either (i) Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders (pro rata in accordance with
their respective ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time) the amount of any Adjustment in Favor
of Shareholders, or (ii) Shareholder Representative shall cause any Adjustment
in Favor of Buyer to be distributed to Buyer from the funds on deposit in the
Indemnification Escrow Account. Any such payment is hereinafter referred to as
the "Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payment".

               (e) Any Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds after its final determination in
accordance with this Section 2.10 to account(s) specified by Buyer and
Shareholder Representative to receive the Purchase Price Adjustment Final
Payment.

     Section 2.11 Earnout Payment(s).

               (a) Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders Earnout Payment(s) in
amounts equal to thirty-six percent (36%) of the EBITDA of the Surviving
Corporation's Business for calendar year 2003 and thirty percent (30%) of the
EBITDA of the Surviving Corporation's Business for calendar year 2004, provided,
however, for calendar year 2003, the Earnout Payment shall only accrue and be
paid on that portion of the calendar year following the Effective Date ("Earnout
Payment(s)"). For each calendar year, or portion thereof the Earnout Payments
are to be made, Buyer shall provide the Shareholders with written notice (in
accordance with the Notice provisions hereof) of its determination of the
Earnout Payment ("Earnout Payment Buyer Determination") for such calendar year
within 10 days following the earlier of (i) Buyer's filing of its annual report
covering such calendar year with the SEC, or (ii) 100 days following any such
calendar year.

               (b) For a period of thirty (30) days following Shareholder
Representative's receipt of the Earnout Payment Buyer Determination, at the
Shareholder Representative's request, Buyer shall allow the Shareholder
Representative and his or her representatives access

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

at all reasonable times to the Surviving Corporation's and Company's
accountants, personnel, properties, books and records, work papers, schedules
and calculations relating to the determination of the Earnout Payment and
confirming the accuracy of the preparation thereof. In the event the Shareholder
Representative provides notice ("Earnout Payment Shareholder Objection Notice")
to Buyer no later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Earnout Payment
Buyer Determination that the Shareholders dispute the amount of the Earnout
Payment, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall then meet and negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute, such negotiation to begin as soon as
practicable (but in any case, no later than fifteen (15) days) after Buyer's
receipt of the Earnout Payment Shareholder Objection Notice.

               (c) In the event that Buyer and the Shareholder Representative
are not able to resolve such dispute within forty-five (45) days after the date
on which the Shareholder Representative provides Buyer with the Earnout Payment
Shareholder Objection Notice, then either the Shareholder Representative or
Buyer may refer the issues in dispute to a neutral mutually acceptable
independent accounting firm of national reputation with which no party hereto
has had a preexisting relationship for resolution for resolution (the "Earnout
Payment Referee"). The decision of such issues by the Earnout Payment Referee
shall be final and binding on all Merger Parties. The Merger Parties shall
submit their positions on the dispute to the Earnout Payment Referee within
thirty (30) days after referral, and shall direct the Earnout Payment Referee to
decide the dispute within Fifteen (15) days after submission to it. The Earnout
Payment Referee shall also decide the allocation of fees and expenses of the
Earnout Payment Referee between the Merger Parties with any amounts due from the
Shareholders being paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds. Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative shall direct the Earnout Payment Referee to promptly
provide invoices of all such fees and expenses directly to the Shareholder
Representative, the Escrow Agent and Buyer. In the event the Shareholders are
required to pay any fees and expenses for the Earnout Payment Referee, as soon
as possible following Escrow Agent's receipt of the Earnout Payment Referee's
invoice, Escrow Agent shall be instructed to distribute the portion of the
invoice amount to be paid by the Shareholders from the funds on deposit in the
Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
set forth in such invoice. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to
verify the accuracy of any information contained in such invoice, nor shall the
Escrow Agent incur any liability for acting in accordance with such invoice. Any
other costs incurred by either party including, but not limited to, experts,
attorneys or financial advisors shall be at the sole cost of the party incurring
such cost regardless of the determination.

               (d) On the applicable date referred to in Section 2.11(e), Buyer
shall pay to the Shareholders (pro rata in accordance with their respective
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time) the amount of any Earnout Payment, if any. Any such payment is
herein after referred to as the "2003 Final Earnout Payment and 2004 Final
Earnout Payment".

               (e) Any 2003 Final Earnout Payment and 2004 Final Earnout Payment
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5)
Business Days after its final determination in accordance with this Section 2.11
to account(s) specified by Buyer and Shareholder Representative to receive the
Earnout Payment Final Payment.

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

          (f) The parties agree that any and all Earnout Payments, if any, paid
to the Shareholders by Buyer hereunder shall be considered "goodwill" for
accounting and tax purposes. More specifically, to the extent such payments are
accounted for on Form 8883 in connection with the Election, they shall be
considered Class VII goodwill in their entirety.

     Section 2.12  Section 338(h)(10) Election.

     (a) Each Shareholder shall join with Buyer in making an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and, at the request of Buyer, any analogous
provision of state or local law (each such election, a "Section 338 Election")
with respect to the purchase of the stock of the Company. At or prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a separate IRS Form 8023
executed by each Shareholder (collectively referred to as "Forms 8023") and each
Shareholder shall cooperate with Buyer to take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including filing such additional forms, returns, elections
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a
timely election, in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)(1).

     (b) In connection with the Section 338 Election, with the cooperation of
Seller, Buyer shall prepare a draft Form 8883 (or successor form) with any
attachments, and any comparable forms required by provisions of state or local
law. Buyer shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative an initial draft of
the Form 8883 (together with any successor form(s) thereto, the "Draft Form
8883") within ninety (90) days after the Closing. In the event that the
Shareholder Representative shall disagree with the Draft Form 8883, the
Shareholder Representative shall so notify Buyer in writing within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of the Draft Form 8883. The Shareholder Representative
and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed aspects of the
Draft Form 8883. If the Shareholder Representative and Buyer are unable to agree
upon the allocation within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of the notice of
the Shareholder Representative, Buyer and each Shareholder may file their own
version of Form 8883 as an attachment to their respective tax forms
understanding that submission of differing Form 8883's may subject the entire
Section 338 Election to scrutiny an audit by the IRS.

     (c) Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall each file all tax returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a
manner consistent with the Form 8883.

     (d) The Shareholders shall include their pro rata share of any income,
gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Section 338 Election
on their tax returns to the extent required by applicable law.

     (e) Buyer and the Shareholders shall mutually prepare any forms or
schedules similar to Forms 8023 and 8883 that are required for provisions of
state or local law that are comparable to Treasury Regulation Section
1.338(h)(10)(1) in a manner similar to the above procedure. In the event that
the Final Forms 8023 and 8883 (or similar forms or schedules required for
provisions of state or local law) is disputed by any taxing authority, the party
receiving written notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party
hereto concerning such dispute.

respective ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time) the Tax Benefit Amount, if any, relating to any
distributions from the Bonus Retention Escrow Account during 2003 simultaneously
with the payment of the 2003 Final Earnout Payment and the Tax Benefit Amount
relating to any distributions from the Bonus Retention Escrow Account during
2004 simultaneously with the payment of the 2004 Final Earnout Payment.

     Section 5.5  No Solicitation.

     Neither the Company, the Shareholders, nor any agent, officer, director or

the foregoing, either Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may notify the
Shareholder Representative of its desire to discontinue retention of specified
documents or other materials in accordance with applicable record retention
requirements during such period upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice. The
Shareholder Representative may, by written notice delivered to Buyer within 30
days of the date of the aforesaid notice, elect to assume custody thereof. In
the absence of such notice from the Shareholder Representative, the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may destroy the documents or other
materials referenced in its original notice to the Shareholder Representative.
In the event the Shareholders need access to such Books and Records for purposes
of verifying any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement,
responding to inquiries or audits from Governmental Entities, indemnifying,
defending and holding harmless Buyer or Merger Sub in accordance with applicable
provisions of this Agreement, or any other legitimate business purpose, Buyer
and Merger Sub shall allow the Shareholder Representative and his or her
advisors access to such Books and Records upon reasonable notice during regular

<PAGE>

Governmental Entities as are necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Regulatory Approvals") and shall take all
other actions as may be necessary to obtain Required Consents. Each party agrees
to use its best efforts to obtain the Regulatory Approvals and Required Consents
and the parties agree to cooperate fully with each other and with all
Governmental Entities and other Persons to obtain the Regulatory Approvals and
Required Consents at the earliest practicable date. Buyer shall pay any
applicable filing fee required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

     Section 5.8  Employee Relations and Benefits.

          (a) Employees of the Company immediately before the Effective Time
shall become employees of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time
("Transferred Employees"). Each plan, program, policy, and arrangement covering
employees of the Surviving Corporation shall credit each Transferred Employee's
length of service with the Company for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefits accrual). To the extent any
Transferred Employee has satisfied any deductible or co-payments under a Benefit
Plan for the current plan year, such Transferred Employee shall be credited for
such payment under the employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, if any, that most closely resembles the
Benefit Plan under which the deductible or co-payment was paid.

          (b) Buyer shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation shall recognize
vested but unused paid vacation accrued by a Transferred Employee as of the
Effective Time in accordance with the Company's current policies. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall confirm in writing to Buyer the amount of
accrued and unpaid days of vacation applicable to such Transferred Employee.

          (c) Buyer, Merger Sub, and the Company do not intend this Agreement to
create any rights or interests, except as among Buyer, Merger Sub, and the
Company, and no present, former or future employee of Buyer, Merger Sub, or the
Company shall be treated as a third party beneficiary by, in or under this
Agreement or any related document.

     Section 5.9  Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree that press
releases and other public communications of any sort relating to this Agreement

parties hereto, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     Section 5.10 Certain Additional Covenants

          (a) Buyer shall cause the Business of the Surviving Corporation to be
operated as a separately reporting business unit until December 31, 2004. Buyer
agrees that from and after the Closing Date until December 31, 2004, Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation's Business to maintain a financial reporting
system that will be sufficient to permit a firm of independent accountants to
determine the Business' EBITDA, and consequently, the amount of the Earnout
Payments for 2003 and 2004, if any, pursuant to Section 2.11. If after the
Closing Date until December 31, 2004, any contracts of the Surviving
Corporation's Business are transferred, assigned, or otherwise allocated or
attributed, for financial reporting purposes, to

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

Buyer or any of its other subsidiaries (other than the Company), then equitable
and reasonable adjustments will be made in calculating the Business' EBITDA, and
consequently, the amount of Earnout Payments, if any, to eliminate the effect of
any transfer, assignment, allocation or attribution, and no such transfer,
assignment, allocation or attribution shall be made unless the financial
reporting system referred to in the immediately preceding sentence is capable of
tracking the performance of distinct contracts in a manner that will permit such
determination of the Business' EBITDA, and consequently, of the amount of the
Earnout Payments payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If after the
Closing Date until December 31, 2004, any contracts of the Buyer or its
subsidiaries (other than the Company) are transferred, assigned, or otherwise
allocated or attributed, for financial reporting purposes, to the Surviving
Corporation's Business, then equitable and reasonable adjustments shall be made
in calculating the Business' EBITDA, and consequently, the amount of the Earnout
Payments, if any, to eliminate the effect of any transfer, assignment,
allocation or attribution and no such transfer, assignment, allocation or
attribution shall be made unless the financial reporting system referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence is capable of tracking the performance of
distinct contracts in a manner that will permit such determination of the
Business' EBITDA, and consequently, of the amount of Earnout Payments pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. All actions taken by Buyer during the period
covered by this Section 5.11(a) shall be in good faith and not for the purpose
of reducing the amount of Earnout Payments pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the
Effective Time and continuing through December 31, 2004, the Surviving
Corporation, at the discretion of the Shareholder Representative, shall be
permitted to initially continue, in accordance with the Company's past
practices, (i) its employee vacation policy, (ii) its employee Bonus Plan and
(iii) profit sharing distributions pursuant to its Profit Sharing Plan, with the
understanding that each of the foregoing benefits may be revised in the future,
on a mutually agreeable basis, with the understanding that there will be no
adverse effect to the employees' compensation on an overall basis.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the Effective Time and
continuing through December 31, 2004, the Surviving Corporation shall be
permitted to continue its overtime pay policy for direct billable employees.

          (c) The Merger Parties agree to use their best efforts to work
together to limit any adverse effects of allocations of overhead and general and
administrative expenses with respect to the Surviving Corporation's competitive
position.

          (d) The Bonus Retention Escrow Amount shall be held in the Bonus
Retention Escrow Account in order to compensate certain employees of the Company
who continue their employment with the Surviving Corporation for a certain
period of time after the Closing Date in accordance with certain retention
agreements by and between such employees and the Company ("Retention
Agreements"). Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with the
terms of the Retention Agreements entered into by such employees to effect
proper distributions from the Retention Bonus Escrow Account.

          (e) Bonus Retention Escrow Period; Final Distribution From the Bonus
Retention Escrow Account. The Bonus Retention Escrow Account shall be in
existence just prior to the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
Washington, D.C. time, on the

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

fifth (5/th/) day following the Bonus Retention Escrow Termination Date.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit into the
Bonus Retention Escrow Account the Bonus Retention Escrow Amount. The Bonus
Retention Escrow Agent shall be instructed to distribute the Bonus Retention
Escrow Amount, plus any interest or other income earned thereon, if any, on or
before the Bonus Retention Escrow Termination Date by the Shareholder
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Retention Agreements. The
parties agree that in the event the Bonus Retention Escrow Amount earns any
income while in the Bonus Retention Escrow Account, it shall belong to the
Surviving Corporation and shall be treated for accounting and tax purposes as
the income of the Surviving Corporation and not the Company or the Shareholders.

the Shareholders, on a pro rata basis, shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer,
Merger Sub and Buyer's Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities, losses, damages (excluding, however, any claims for diminution in
value where such base claim is initially unrelated to the

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

multiple of the amount of any actual damages and subsequently claimed as a
diminution in value based on the multiple of the amount of any actual damages),
costs and expenses (collectively, "Losses") asserted against, imposed on, or
incurred or suffered by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation as a result of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or the
breach of any warranty set forth in Article III, any Exhibit or Schedule thereto
or in any agreement or certificate executed and delivered by the Company or any
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement; or (b) the non-fulfillment of any
unwaived covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or any Shareholder set
forth in this Agreement or in any agreement or certificate executed and
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

     Section 7.2    Indemnification by Buyer and Merger Sub. Subject to Section

or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement; or (b) the non-fulfillment of any
material unwaived covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set

     Section 7.3    Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitations on
Indemnification.

          (a) Survival. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and
the indemnification provisions in this Agreement with respect thereto shall
survive the Closing for a period of fifteen (15) months following the Closing
Date, at which time they shall terminate and no claim shall thereafter be
brought in respect of them; provided, however, that such termination shall not
affect any claim for breach of any representation or warranty if written notice
thereof, in reasonable detail, has been given to the breaching party prior to
such termination date (in such case, the survival period for the representation
and warranty shall continue until the claim is fully resolved). The covenants of
the parties set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall

          (b) Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything else in

Company, shall in neither event exceed ten percent (10%) of the Initial Purchase
Price.

          (c) Insurance Proceeds. The amount payable by an indemnifying party to
an indemnified party with respect to a Loss pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement shall be

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds received by the indemnified
party with respect to such Loss.

     Section 7.4    Escrow Accounts.

          (a) Deposit of Funds into Escrow Accounts. As security for the
indemnity provided for in Section 7.1, at the Effective Time, Buyer shall
deposit into the Indemnification Escrow Account, on behalf of the Shareholders,
the Indemnification Escrow Amount, as contemplated by Section 2.7(e)(i). The
parties agree that in the event the Indemnification Escrow Amount earns any
income while in the Indemnification Escrow Account, it shall belong to the
Shareholders and shall be treated for accounting and tax purposes as the income
of the Shareholders and not Buyer or Merger Sub.

          (b) Indemnification Escrow Period; Final Distribution From the

provided that the Indemnification Escrow Account shall not terminate on such
date with respect to such remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(or some portion thereof) that in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, subject to
the objection of the Shareholder Representative and the subsequent arbitration
of the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.5, is necessary to satisfy (i)
any then pending unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent by Buyer prior to the Indemnification Escrow
Termination Date, and (ii) any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent by Buyer prior to the Indemnification
Escrow Termination Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior
to the Indemnification Escrow Termination Date. The Escrow Agent shall be
instructed to promptly distribute any portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, plus interest or other income earned thereon, if any, that is not then
in dispute, first using the cash funds of Indemnification Escrow Account, then
using the stock funds of the Indemnification Escrow Account. As soon as all such
claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall distribute funds from the
Indemnification Escrow Account sufficient to satisfy the expenses of the
Shareholder Representative in connection with the Indemnification Escrow Account
and shall thereafter deliver to the Shareholders ratably in accordance with
their ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Account, plus interest or other income earned thereon, if any, not required to
satisfy such claims and expenses.

     Section 7.5    Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification
by a party entitled to be indemnified hereunder shall be asserted and resolved
as follows:

          (a) Claims Upon Indemnification Escrow Account. Upon receipt by the
Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of the Indemnification Escrow
Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Buyer (an "Officer's
Certificate"): (i) stating that Buyer has paid or properly accrued or reasonably
anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for
such anticipated

                                      -48-

liability, and the nature of the misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such items is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.5(b), be directed to distribute to Buyer from the
Indemnification Escrow Account as promptly as practicable, funds in an amount
equal to such Losses.

          (b) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be
delivered by Buyer to the Shareholder Representative and for a period of thirty
(30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no distribution to
Buyer of any funds contained in the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to
Section 7.5(a) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
from the Shareholder Representative to make such distribution. After the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall be directed to
distribute funds from the Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with
Section 7.5(a), provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if the
Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made
in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to
the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.

          (c) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

               (i)  In case the Shareholder Representative shall so object in
                    writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's
                    Certificate, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall
                    attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
                    respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If
                    the Shareholder Representative and Buyer should so agree, a
                    memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
                    and signed by both parties, and shall be furnished to the
                    Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
                    any such memorandum and distribute funds from the
                    Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
                    thereof.

               (ii) With respect to claims that the parties agree are accounting
                    or bookkeeping based claims, if an agreement cannot be
                    reached after good faith negotiation, either Shareholder
                    Representative or Buyer may refer the dispute to a neutral
                    mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of national
                    reputation with which no party hereto has had a preexisting
                    relationship for resolution (the "Indemnification Referee").
                    The decision of such issues by the Indemnification Referee
                    shall be final and binding on all Merger Parties. The Merger
                    Parties shall submit their positions on the dispute to the
                    Indemnification Referee within thirty (30) days after
                    referral, and shall direct the Indemnification Referee to
                    decide the dispute within fifteen (15) days after submission
                    to it. The Indemnification Referee shall also decide the
                    allocation of fees and expenses of the Indemnification
                    Referee between the Merger Parties with any amounts due from
                    the Shareholders being paid from the Indemnification Escrow
                    Funds. Buyer and the

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

                      Shareholder Representative shall direct the
                      Indemnification Referee to promptly provide invoices of
                      all such fees and expenses directly to the Shareholder
                      Representative, the Escrow Agent and Buyer. In the event
                      the Shareholders are required to pay any fees and expenses
                      for the Indemnification Referee, as soon as possible
                      following Escrow Agent's receipt of the Indemnification
                      Referee's invoice, Escrow Agent shall be instructed to
                      distribute the portion of the invoice amount to be paid by
                      the Shareholders from the funds on deposit in the
                      Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with the wire
                      transfer instructions set forth in such invoice. The
                      Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to verify the
                      accuracy of any information contained in such invoice, nor
                      shall the Escrow Agent incur any liability for acting in
                      accordance with such invoice. Any other costs incurred by
                      either party including, but not limited to, experts,
                      attorneys or financial advisors shall be at the sole cost
                      of the party incurring such cost regardless of the
                      determination.

               (iii)  With respect to claims not based on accounting or
                      bookkeeping matters, if no such agreement can be reached
                      after good faith negotiation, either Buyer or the
                      Shareholder Representative may request that the other
                      party consent to arbitration of the matter unless the
                      amount of the damage or loss at issue is in pending
                      litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration
                      shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
                      both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such
                      event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted
                      by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Buyer and the
                      Shareholder Representative. In the event that within
                      forty-five (45) days after submission of any dispute to
                      arbitration, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative
                      cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, Buyer and the
                      Shareholder Representative shall each select one
                      arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall
                      select a third arbitrator. The arbitrator or arbitrators,
                      as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and
                      establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time
                      for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity,
                      adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or
                      majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
                      discover relevant information from the opposing parties
                      about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator or
                      a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
                      shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
                      shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
                      attorneys' fees and costs, to the extent as a court of
                      competent law or equity, should the arbitrator or a
                      majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
                      determine that discovery was sought without substantial
                      justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
                      without substantial justification. The decision of the
                      arbitrator or a majority of the

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

                          three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the
                          validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
                          Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the
                          parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding
                          anything in Section 7.5(a) or (b), the Buyer and
                          Shareholder Representative shall direct the Escrow
                          Agent to act in accordance with such decision and make
                          or withhold payments out of the Indemnification Escrow
                          Account in accordance therewith. Such decision shall
                          be written and shall be supported by written findings
                          of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the
                          award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
                          arbitrator(s).

                    (iv)  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
                          may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any
                          such arbitration shall be held in Fairfax, Virginia
                          under the rules then in effect of the American
                          Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall
                          determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
                          shall be paid, including the respective expenses of
                          each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the
                          administrative fee of the American Arbitration
                          Association.

             (d)  Third-Party Claims. In the event that any claim for which an
   indemnifying party would be liable to an indemnified party hereunder is
   asserted against an indemnified party by a third party, the indemnified party
   shall notify the indemnifying party of such claim, specifying the nature of
   such claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
   feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
   claim). Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a claim notice, the
   indemnifying party may assume the defense of such claim; provided, however,
   that (a) the indemnifying party shall retain counsel of its choice reasonably
   acceptable to the indemnified party; and (b) the indemnifying party shall
   not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which shall
   not be unreasonably withheld), enter into any settlement of a claim, consent
   to the entry of any judgment with respect to a claim or cease to defend a
   claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, consent or
   cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief shall be imposed against the
   indemnified party or if such settlement does not expressly and
   unconditionally release the indemnified party from all liabilities with
   respect to such claim, with prejudice. The indemnified party may participate
   in the defense of such claim with counsel of its choice; provided, however,
   that the fees and expenses of the indemnified party's counsel shall be paid
   by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has failed to
   assume the defense and employ counsel as provided herein; or (ii) a claim
   shall have been brought or asserted against the indemnifying party as well as
   the indemnified party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised in
   writing by outside counsel that there may be one or more factual or legal
   defenses available to it that are in conflict with those available to the
   indemnifying party, in which case such counsel shall be at the expense of the
   indemnifying party only to the extent that indemnifying party would otherwise
   be required to pay for such counsel by reason of Section 7.1 hereof. If the
   indemnifying party does not assume the defense of such claim, the indemnified
   party may defend against the same in any manner that it reasonably deems
   appropriate. In the event that the Shareholder Representative, on behalf of
   the Shareholders as the indemnifying party, has consented to any such
   settlement, the Shareholder Representative,

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

   on behalf of the Shareholders shall have no power or authority to object
   under any provision of this Article to the amount of any claim by Buyer
   against the Indemnification Escrow Account with respect to such settlement.

         Section 7.6   Exclusive Remedy. Except as set forth in Section 10.10,
the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Article VII shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Buyer and Merger Sub against the Shareholders and by the
Shareholders against the Buyer or the Merger Sub for Losses hereunder, provided
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve or limit the liability of
any party or any officer or director of such party from any liability arising
out of or resulting from actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active
concealment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or in connection with the delivery of any of the documents referred to herein.
If the Shareholders are required to indemnify Buyer, Merger Sub or Buyer's
Affiliates for any Losses hereunder, such payments shall be made solely from the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   TAX MATTERS

         Section 8.1   Tax Returns.

                  (a) Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date. Buyer
   and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared, using
   the accounting and tax preparation services of Aronson & Company, and shall
   duly and timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for
   taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date which are filed after
   the Closing Date. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall permit the
   Shareholder Representative and his or her advisors to review and comment on
   each such Tax Return prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such
   Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative.
   The Shareholder Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the
   Surviving Corporation from funds comprising the Escrow Amount an amount equal
   to the portion of Company Taxes reported on such Tax Returns that relate to
   the portion of such taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that
   were not paid before the Closing Date or that were not reserved for on the
   Closing Date Balance Sheet in a manner consistent with past practice of the
   Company, except to the extent that such Taxes are allowable and recoverable
   costs for inclusion in the costs of agreements with Governmental Entities.

                  (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
   Date. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall file or cause to be filed any
   Tax Returns of the Company for tax periods that begin before the Closing Date
   and end after the Closing Date and pay all Taxes owed by the Company for such
   periods, including all payroll taxes relating to distributions of the Bonus
   Retention Escrow Amount. Contemporaneously with any distributions from the
   Bonus Retention Escrow Amount, the Shareholder Representative shall direct
   the Bonus Retention Escrow Agent to distribute to the Surviving Corporation
   an amount necessary for the Surviving Corporation to pay all required payroll
   or other withholding taxes relating to such distribution from the Bonus
   Retention Escrow Agreement. The Shareholder

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

   Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Surviving
   Corporation from funds comprising the Escrow Amount within fifteen (15) days
   after the date on which such Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an
   amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relate to the portion of such
   taxable period ending on the Closing Date that were not paid before the
   Closing Date or that were not reserved for on the Closing Date Balance Sheet
   in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company, except to the
   extent that such Taxes are allowable and recoverable costs for inclusion in
   the costs of agreements with Governmental Entities. For purposes of this
   Section 8.1(b), in the case of any Taxes that are payable by the Company for
   a taxable period that ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
   payable by the Company which relates to the portion of such taxable period
   ending on the day before the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
   other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be
   the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
   the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
   the day before the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
   days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon
   or related to income or receipts be equal to the amount which would be
   payable by the Company if the relevant taxable period ended on the day before
   the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
   foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
   practice of the Company (taking into account (i) the Tax status of the
   Company for such period, including its Subchapter S corporation status for
   federal income Tax purposes and any similar status for other Tax purposes,
   and (ii) Taxes that are allowable costs and recoverable for inclusion in the
   costs of agreements with Governmental Entities).

         Section 8.2   Certain Contest Rights.

                 (a) Promptly after receipt by Buyer, the Company or any
   Shareholder of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that,
   either at such time or after the lapse of time, might give rise to an
   adjustment or audit of any Tax Return of the Company for periods (i) ending
   on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) beginning before and ending after
   the Closing Date, the party receiving such notice shall notify the other
   parties hereunder (the "Tax Claim Notice"). The Tax Claim Notice shall
   contain factual information (to the extent known to the party receiving the
   inquiry or notice from the taxing authority) describing such demand, claim or
   circumstance, including any asserted tax liability (an "Asserted Tax Claim")
   in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
   received in respect of any such Asserted Tax Claim.

                 (b) Each Shareholder, if such Shareholder desires to contest
   any such Asserted Tax Claim, shall through counsel of such Shareholder's own
   choosing and at their own expense, compromise or contest, either
   administratively or in the courts, any such Asserted Tax Claim. Any
   settlement of an Asserted Tax Claim of the Company shall be entered into only
   upon the written agreement of Buyer. In such event, Buyer and the Surviving
   Corporation shall promptly empower and shall cause the Company to empower (by
   power of attorney and such other documentation as may be appropriate) such
   representative of each such Shareholder as they may designate to represent
   Buyer, or the Surviving Corporation in any audit, claim or refund or
   administrative or judicial proceeding insofar as such audit, claim for refund
   or proceeding involves an Asserted Tax Claim. If Buyer withholds its consent
   to any proposed

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

   settlement to any Asserted Tax Claim (a "Proposed Settlement"), then each
   such Shareholder's liability with respect to the subject matter of the
   Proposed Settlement shall be limited to the amount that such liability would
   have been if the Proposed Settlement had been accepted and the Buyer shall be
   responsible for all expenses incurred thereafter in connection with the
   contest of such tax audit or proceeding except to the extent that the final
   settlement imposes less liability on such Shareholder than the Proposed
   Settlement would have imposed (taking into account such Shareholder's share
   of such expenses).

         Section 8.3   Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Each party
hereto will provide each other with such cooperation and information as any of
them may reasonably request of the other in filing any Tax Return of the
Company, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes
of the Company or a right to a refund of Taxes of the Company or in conducting
any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns of the Company or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules
and related work papers and documents that are reasonably relevant to rulings or
other determinations by taxing authorities. Each party shall make its
representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation
of any documents or information provided hereunder. Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall give the Shareholder Representative reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Books and Records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period
beginning before or on the Closing Date and, if the Shareholder Representative
so requests, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall allow the Shareholder
Representative to take possession of such Books and Records.

         Section 8.4   Refunds.

                 (a) In the event that Buyer or the Company receives a refund or
   credit of Tax of the Company for which the Shareholders made a payment (or a
   payment was made by the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Shareholders) pursuant
   to Section 8.2 of this Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement,
   then the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the
   Indemnification Escrow Account, if such account still exists, or otherwise to
   the Shareholders, the amount of such refund (including any accrued interest
   paid in respect of such refunded Tax) or credit to the extent the refund or
   credit represents payments made by or for the Shareholders with respect to
   events occurring prior to the Closing Date. Each Shareholder shall, as a
   condition to receiving any such refund or credit, agree jointly and severally
   with all other Shareholders receiving the refund or credit, in the event that
   any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to the
   Shareholders pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) is subsequently reduced or
   disallowed, to indemnify and hold harmless the payor for any Tax liability
   assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction or disallowance.

                 (b) In the event that the Shareholders receive a refund or
   credit of Tax of the Company for which the Buyer or the Company made a
   payment pursuant to Section 8.2 or any other provision of this Agreement,
   then the Shareholders shall promptly pay to the Buyer or the Company, as the
   case may be, the amount of such refund (including any accrued interest paid
   in respect of such refunded Tax) or credit to the extent the refund or credit
   represents payments made by or for the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
   with respect to events occurring after the Closing Date. Each of Buyer and
   the Surviving Corporation shall agree jointly and

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

   severally that, as a condition to receiving any such refund or credit, in the
   event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to
   Buyer or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) is
   subsequently reduced or disallowed, to indemnify and hold harmless the payor
   for any Tax liability assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction
   or disallowance.

         Section 8.5   Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any
corporate-level gains Tax triggered by the sale of Company Common Stock and any
similar Tax imposed in any states or subdivisions), shall be paid one-half by
Buyer and one-half by the Escrow Agent from the Indemnification Escrow Account
when due, and the party required by applicable law will file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, the other parties will, and will cause their affiliates to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The expense of
such filings shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Escrow Agent

   impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the party's obligations to
   consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the
   occurrence of such event is due to the failure of the party to perform or
   comply with any of the agreements, covenants, or conditions hereof to be
   performed or complied with by such party prior to the Closing, or (v) if
   either the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other

and be enforceable by the successors and assigns of the Company, Buyer, Merger
Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 10.5  Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, including the Company's Disclosure Schedule and Buyer's Disclosure

remedy accruing to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company upon any breach or default

     Section 10.10  Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that
