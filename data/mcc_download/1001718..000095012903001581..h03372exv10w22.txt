                 original of this Agreement is delivered to the Title Company,
                 Buyer shall deposit the sum of One Hundred Thousand and No/100
                 Dollars ($100,000.00) (herein, the "Deposit") in immediately
                 available funds with the Escrow Holder. Immediately upon (or
                 prior to) expiration of the Due Diligence Period and provided
                 that Buyer has not elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant
                 to Section 4.3 hereof, Buyer shall deposit an additional sum in
                 the amount of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
                 ($100,000.00) with the Escrow Holder, which shall increase the
                 Deposit to the total amount of Two Hundred Thousand and No/100
                 Dollars ($200,000.00). Thereafter, the Deposit shall be
                 non-refundable (except in the event Seller defaults under this
                 Agreement or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement)
                 and shall be retained by Seller as liquidated damages in
                 accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement. If Buyer does
                 not timely place the additional sum with the Escrow Holder,
                 Seller may, at Seller's option, terminate this Agreement upon
                 written notice to Buyer at any time thereafter and prior to
                 Buyer's delivery of the Deposit, in which case the Deposit
                 shall be paid to Buyer. If Buyer subsequently consummates the
                 purchase of the Property as provided in this Agreement, the
                 entire Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price.


         (b)     Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the sum of
                 One Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00) of the Deposit shall
                 be non-refundable, shall be released to Seller and shall be
                 retained by Seller under any and all circumstances, which
                 amount has been bargained for and agreed to as consideration
                 for Seller's execution and delivery of this Agreement and
                 Buyer's right to perform all inspections as described in
                 Section 4 of this Agreement. The balance of the Deposit and all
                 interest accrued thereon shall be fully refundable to Buyer if
                 Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
                 provisions of Section 4.3 of this Agreement, or as otherwise
                 provided in this Agreement.

         (c)     If this Agreement is not properly terminated by Buyer in
                 accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 hereof when and
                 as provided therein, then the entire amount of the Deposit and
                 all accrued interest thereon shall become non-refundable
                 (subject to and except as otherwise provided in Sections
                 3.1(a), 4.2, 4.3, 10.1, 10.2 and 11.10 or any other provision
                 hereof) and shall be retained by Seller in accordance with the
                 liquidated damages provision as set forth in Section 3.2 below.
                 If Buyer subsequently consummates the purchase of the Property
                 as provided in this Agreement, the entire Deposit (including,
                 without limitation, the

                 retained in Escrow shall be applied to the Purchase Price as a
                 credit to the Buyer.

         CLOSE AS PROVIDED HEREIN BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT UNDER SECTION 8.3
         AND SO LONG AS SELLER IS NOT IN DEFAULT HEREUNDER, BUYER AND SELLER
         AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY
         DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE DAMAGES WHICH SELLER WILL SUFFER. THEREFORE,
         BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY AGREE THAT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES
         THAT SELLER WOULD SUFFER IN SUCH EVENT IS AND SHALL BE AN AMOUNT EQUAL

         SHALL BE THE FULL, AGREED AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR BUYER'S BREACH OF
         THIS AGREEMENT AND EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, SHALL BE THE
         SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF SELLER FOR BUYER'S BREACH OF THIS
         AGREEMENT. UPON ANY SUCH FAILURE TO CLOSE AS REQUIRED HEREBY DUE TO A
         DEFAULT BY BUYER UNDER SECTION 8.3 OF THIS AGREEMENT AND SO LONG AS
         SELLER IS NOT IN DEFAULT HEREUNDER, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TERMINATED
         AND NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS
         HEREUNDER, EXCEPT FOR (A) THE RIGHT OF SELLER TO COLLECT SUCH
         LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT FROM ESCROW HOLDER; (B)
         THE RIGHT OF SELLER TO COLLECT FROM BUYER AND, TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH
         FUNDS ARE HELD BY ESCROW HOLDER, FROM ESCROW HOLDER, SUCH AMOUNTS AS

         SELLER AND/OR TO SATISFY ANY MECHANICS' LIEN CLAIMS AGAINST THE
         PROPERTY ARISING OUT OF BUYER'S INSPECTIONS OF THE PROPERTY OR ANY
         OTHER WORK PERFORMED BY BUYER ON THE PROPERTY; AND (C) SELLER'S
         RECOVERY OF ALL REASONABLE LEGAL FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN COLLECTING
         THE AMOUNTS REFERENCED IN THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
         PROVIDED ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER BE LIABLE TO SELLER FOR ANY
         DAMAGES FOR A DEFAULT BY BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING
         ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO
         ANY DEFAULT BY BUYER HEREUNDER, SELLER SHALL HAVE NO RECOURSE TO THE
         PERSONAL ASSETS, PROPERTIES OR FUNDS OF ANY OF BUYER'S OFFICERS,
         DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LIMITED PARTNERS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR

                 condition. The foregoing includes, without limitation, Buyer's

                 caused by Buyer or Buyer's consultants, representatives or

                 cross liability endorsement in favor of Seller, shall specify
                 that such insurance policies shall not be cancelable on less
                 than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Seller, and shall
                 be primary to any liability policy of Seller. Prior to any
                 entry on the Property and as a condition precedent thereto,
                 Buyer shall provide Seller with original certificates
                 evidencing all such insurance as required by this provision.

                 "Documents") which to Seller's knowledge are in Seller's
                 possession. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all Documents
                 which have been, are being or at any time will be provided to
                 Buyer, if any, were and are intended solely as a courtesy in

                 without limitation, as to the content, accuracy or completeness
                 thereof, and Seller hereby expressly disclaims any and all such
                 representations and warranties. Buyer has relied, is relying
                 and shall rely only on its independent review and due diligence

         4.2      TITLE AND SURVEY.

         (a)     Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date hereof,
                 Seller will cause to be delivered to Buyer a commitment for
                 title insurance issued by the Title Company in the form of T-1
                 commitment for title insurance with respect to the Austin
                 Property and Grapevine Property, and in the form of an ALTA

                 Bend Property and the East Granby Property together with copies
                 of all recorded instruments referenced as exceptions therein
                 (collectively, the "Title Commitment"). Within thirty (30) days
                 after the Effective Date hereof, Seller shall cause to be
                 delivered to Buyer a Survey of the Property. Within ten (10)
                 days after delivery of the later of the Title Commitment and
                 Survey to Buyer (the "Title Review Period"), Buyer shall notify
                 Seller in writing of each specific item referenced in the Title
                 Commitment and Survey which is a Title Defect. All items
                 referenced or disclosed in the Title Commitment and Survey or
                 in the underlying documents which are not disapproved in
                 writing by Buyer prior to the expiration of the Title Review
                 Period shall be deemed to be Permitted Exceptions.
                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be a condition
                 precedent to Buyer's obligation to close hereunder that title
                 to the Property shall be free and clear of all monetary liens
                 against the Property, other than the lien of non-delinquent
                 real property taxes, assessments and any liens or other matters
                 arising from Buyer's entry, inspections, investigations,
                 financing or other activities.

         (b)     If Buyer timely objects to any matter set forth in the Title
                 Commitment or Survey as stated in the preceding subparagraph
                 (a), then Seller may, but without any obligation hereunder,
                 elect by written notice to Buyer to use reasonable efforts to
                 cure such disapproved matters prior to expiration of the Due
                 Diligence Period. If Seller so elects by written notice to
                 Buyer, Buyer shall be obligated to close the transaction but
                 the cure of all such matters to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction
                 shall be a condition to Buyer's obligation to close the Escrow
                 and if such matters are not so cured, then at or prior to
                 Closing, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and the Escrow
                 Holder shall return the Deposit to Buyer and neither party
                 shall have any further rights, duties, liabilities or
                 obligations hereunder, except with respect to provisions of
                 this Agreement which expressly survive the termination of this
                 Agreement. If Seller does not elect to cure such disapproved
                 matters, Seller will notify Buyer in writing and Buyer shall
                 within five (5) business days after receipt of such notice
                 either (i) waive all such disapprovals and proceed to close
                 this transaction without offset or deduction of any kind or
                 (ii) terminate this Agreement and Escrow Agent shall return the
                 Deposit together with all interest earned thereon to Buyer. If
                 Buyer fails to make such written election within such five (5)
                 day period, Buyer shall be deemed irrevocably to have elected
                 to waive

         4.3  BUYER'S DISAPPROVAL OF DUE DILIGENCE ITEMS; SUBSEQUENT TERMINATION
         OF AGREEMENT.

         (a)     Buyer may in its sole discretion and for any reason or no
                 reason elect not to proceed with the transaction contemplated
                 by this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence
                 Period. Such election to terminate shall be effected, if at
                 all, by Buyer's written notice which must be delivered to
                 Seller prior to 5:00 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the last day
                 of the Due Diligence Period. If Buyer properly terminates this
                 Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.3(a), then this Agreement
                 shall be terminated, the Escrow Holder shall return the Deposit
                 to Buyer, and neither party shall have any further liabilities,
                 rights, duties or obligations hereunder except with respect to
                 the provisions of this Agreement which expressly survive the
                 termination of this Agreement. If Buyer fails to timely deliver
                 to Seller written notice of Buyer's termination of this
                 Agreement, all conditions of this Section 4.3(a) shall be
                 deemed to have been waived and Buyer shall proceed to close
                 this transaction in accordance with the terms of this
                 Agreement.

         (b)     Upon Buyer's timely termination of this Agreement pursuant to
                 Section 4.3(a) above, the Deposit (other than the One Hundred
                 and No/100 Dollars ($100.00) non-refundable portion thereof)
                 and all accrued interest on the balance of the Deposit retained

              right to object.

              sign the statutory notice relating to the tax rate, bonded
              indebtedness, or standby fee of the district prior to final

<PAGE>


              any  taking or condemnation of the entire Property or any material
              portion thereof prior to the Closing, (for purposes of the
              foregoing, "material" shall mean a taking or condemnation of any
              parcel of the Property as shall substantially and materially
              impair the use of such parcel or which would allow either party to
              terminate the Lease with respect to any parcel of the Property if
              such condemnation occurred during the Lease term), then (i) Buyer
              shall have the right to terminate the Agreement in its entirety by
              giving notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt
              of notice of such condemnation; or (ii) either party may at its
              option terminate this Agreement with respect to such affected
              parcel by written notice to the other delivered no later than ten
              (10) days following such party's notice to the other of such
              taking. If Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement in whole
              pursuant to this Section 10.1, the Deposit shall be returned to
              Buyer with all accrued interest thereon. If either party elects to
              terminate this Agreement only with respect to the affected parcel,
              then the Closing shall occur as set forth herein with respect to
              all other parcels and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
              amount allocated to the affected parcel. If neither party
              terminates this Agreement as provided herein, the parties shall be
              deemed to have elected to proceed with the transactions described
              herein, the Closing shall occur as set forth herein, and subject
              to Tenant's rights under the Lease Agreement, Buyer shall be
              entitled to all condemnation awards payable as a result of such
              taking and the right to collect any such award shall be assigned

              shall expressly survive the Closing of this transaction and shall
              not be merged into the closing documents.

         10.2 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. Prior to Closing, risk of loss of the
         Property by damage or destruction shall be borne by Seller. Seller
         agrees to provide Buyer with prompt written notice of any damage to or
         destruction of the Property of which Seller has knowledge. In such
         event the parties' rights and obligations shall be as follows:

         (a)  If the Repair Cost is ten percent (10%) or less of the Purchase
              Price allocated for the affected parcel of the Property as set
              forth in Section 1.22 hereof, then Buyer shall accept the Property
              at Closing subject to such damage or destruction and Buyer shall
              be entitled to a credit against the Purchase Price in the amount
              of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds actually received by
              Seller prior to the Closing as a result of the loss, and an
              assignment of Seller's rights to the balance of the insurance
              proceeds. As used herein, the term "Repair Cost" means an estimate
              of the actual cost to repair the damage attributable to such
              damage or destruction and obtained by Seller within thirty (30)
              days following the event of damage or destruction from a
              reputable, licensed independent contractor selected by Seller
              licensed to do business in the State of Texas, Indiana or
              Connecticut, as applicable.

         (b)  If the Repair Cost exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price
              allocated for the affected parcel of the Property as set forth in
              Section 1.21 hereof, then (i) Buyer shall have the right to
              terminate this Agreement exercisable only by giving written notice
              of such election to Seller within thirty (30) days after the
              determination of the Repair Cost; (ii) Buyer or Seller shall have
              the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to the affected
              parcel only, in which case


                                      -20-

<PAGE>


              the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount allocated to
              such parcel of the Property; or (iii) Buyer may elect to accept
              the Property at Closing subject to such damage or destruction and
              Buyer shall be entitled to a credit against the Purchase Price in
              the amount of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds actually
              received by Seller prior to the Closing as a result of the loss,
              and an assignment of Seller's rights to the balance of the
              proceeds. If Buyer does not elect to terminate the entire
              Agreement in accordance with (i) above, and either party elects to
              terminate this Agreement with respect to the affected parcel, then
              the Closing shall occur as set forth herein with respect to all
              other parcels and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
              amount allocated to the affected parcel. If Buyer duly exercises
              such termination right as to the whole Agreement, the Deposit
              shall be returned to Buyer with all accrued interest thereon.

         (c)  If the Closing Date would otherwise occur during a time period
              described in this Section 10.2, then the Closing Date shall be
              extended to a date which is ten (10) days following the expiration
              of such time period, but in no event shall any such extension
              pursuant to this provision cause the Closing Date to be later than
              November 10, 2002, and if such applicable time period has not
              expired by such date, then either party may terminate this
              Agreement.

         the "Assessment"). Seller has heretofore furnished to Buyer a copy of
         the Assessment. Buyer understands and agrees that Seller shall not at
         any time be deemed to make or have made any representation or warranty
         with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the Assessment or any
         statements, testing data, reports, or other matters omitted from, or
         contained or referred to in, the Assessment. Any reliance by Buyer upon
         the Assessment or any part thereof in connection with any decision by
         Buyer to proceed with the purchase of the Property shall be at the sole
         risk of Buyer. Buyer shall not have any right, and hereby waives and
         disclaims any such right it may otherwise have, to assert any action or
         claim against Seller by reason of anything contained in or omitted from
         the Assessment.

         event that a Material Adverse Change (as hereinafter defined) in
         Seller's financial condition shall occur between the Effective Date of
         this Agreement and the Closing, Seller will promptly notify the Buyer
         prior to Closing and Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving a
         written notice to Seller on or prior to Closing and Escrow Holder shall
         promptly return the Deposit and all accrued interest thereon to Buyer
         and neither party shall have any further rights, duties, obligations or
         liabilities hereunder, except with respect to those provisions which
         expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. A "Material
         Adverse Change" in Seller's financial condition shall be deemed to
         occur if there is a decline by ten percent (10%) or more of the
         stockholder's equity of the Seller (excluding the effect of any share
         repurchase by Seller up to $15 Million). As of June 30, 2002, the
         Seller's stockholder's equity is $369,450,000 and a ten percent (10%)
         decline would be $36,945,000.

<PAGE>

                                   EXHIBIT "J"

                               CORPORATE GUARANTY


         In consideration of and as an inducement for the granting, execution
and delivery of that certain Lease, dated as of ____________, 20__ (together
with any amendments thereto, hereinafter called "Lease"), by
______________________, a _________________, the Landlord therein named
(hereinafter called "Landlord"), to _____________________________, a
____________ the Tenant therein named (hereinafter called "Tenant"), with
respect to that certain parcel of real property located in ___________________,
which is more fully described on Exhibit A attached hereto, and in further
consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable
consideration paid by Landlord to the undersigned, EGL, Inc., a Texas
corporation (hereinafter called "Guarantor"), Guarantor, intending to be legally
bound, hereby irrevocably guarantees to Landlord (i) the full and prompt payment
when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise) of all Base
Rent, Additional Rent and any and all other sums and charges payable by Tenant
under the Lease, and (ii) the full, faithful and prompt performance and
observance of all the covenants, terms, conditions, and agreements contained in
the Lease which are to be performed and observed by Tenant (all payment and
performance obligations referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to
herein, collectively, as the "Obligations"); and Guarantor does hereby become
primary obligor, and not only surety to Landlord, for and with respect to all of
the Obligations. Terms used herein with their initial letters capitalized which
have been specifically defined in the Lease shall have the same meaning herein
as in the Lease unless such terms are otherwise defined in this Guaranty.

         Guarantor further agrees to pay all actual damages and all actual and
reasonable costs and expenses that may arise in consequence of any default by
Tenant under the Lease or in connection with the enforcement of any rights under
this Guaranty (including, without limitation, all reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred by Landlord or caused by any such default and/or by the enforcement of
this Guaranty). Without limiting any other provision of this Guaranty, the
Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall extend to and include all
amounts which constitute part of the Obligations and would be owed by the Tenant
under the Lease but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable
due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding
involving the Tenant. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the payment
and performance of the Obligations, and the termination of this Guaranty.

         This Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of
payment (and not of collection) and of performance. Guarantor's liability
hereunder is direct and is independent of the Obligations, and may be enforced
without Landlord being required to resort to any other right, remedy or security
and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor without the necessity
for any suit or proceedings on Landlord's part of any kind or nature whatsoever
against Tenant or the joinder of Tenant in any suit or proceeding, without the
necessity of any notice of non-payment, non-performance or non-observance of any
of the Obligations by Tenant or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or
of Landlord's intention to act in reliance hereon or of any other notice or
demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled, all of which Guarantor
hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity
of

<PAGE>

this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in nowise be
terminated, affected or impaired by reason of the assertion or the failure to
assert by Landlord against Tenant, of any of the rights or remedies reserved to
Landlord pursuant to the provisions of the Lease. The Guarantor further waives
promptness and diligence with respect to the Obligations. Landlord will provide
Guarantor with a copy of any written notice of default which Landlord sends to
Tenant under the Lease prior to exercising any rights or remedies under this
Guaranty, provided that the failure to deliver any such notice shall not limit
Landlord's rights or Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty.

         This Guaranty shall be a continuing Guaranty, and (whether or not
Guarantor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the following) the liability
and obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be
released, discharged or in any way impaired by (a) any amendment or modification
of, or supplement to, or extension or renewal of, the Lease or any assignment or
transfer thereof; (b) any exercise or non-exercise of any right, power, remedy
or privilege under or in respect of the Lease or this Guaranty or any waiver,
consent or approval by Landlord with respect to any of the covenants, terms,
conditions or agreements contained in the Lease or any indulgences, forbearances
or extensions of time for performance or observance allowed to Tenant from time
to time and for any length of time; (c) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar
proceeding relating to Tenant, or its properties; (d) any limitation on the
liability or obligation of Tenant under the Lease or its estate in bankruptcy or
of any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any
present or future provision of the federal or any state bankruptcy law or any
other statute or from the decision of any court; (e) any sublease or transfer by
Tenant or any assignment, mortgage or pledge of its interest under the Lease;
(f) any termination of the Lease prior to the expiration of its Term (except
that Guarantor shall not be liable for amounts that would have otherwise accrued
under the Lease after termination of the Lease under Section 10.1 or Section
16.1); (g) any agreement entered into between the Landlord and an assignee or
subtenant of Tenant; (h) any security provided for the Obligations; or (i) any
sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance (A) by Landlord of all or any portion
of the Premises (as such term is defined in the Lease) or of Landlord's interest
in the Lease, or (B) of any ownership interest in the Landlord.

         All of Landlord's rights and remedies under the Lease and under this
Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right
or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a
waiver of any of the others or of any rights or remedies provided by law. No
termination of the Lease or taking or recovering of the premises demised thereby
shall deprive Landlord of any of its rights and remedies against Guarantor under
this Guaranty. This Guaranty shall apply to the Obligations of Tenant under the
Lease as in effect on the date hereof as well as to the Obligations of Tenant
under the Lease as it may be extended, renewed, amended, modified or
supplemented. The Guarantor hereby waives any requirement that the Landlord
protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property
subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any person or
entity or any collateral (including any rights relating to marshaling of
assets).


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

         The Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be paid and
performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Lease, regardless of the
value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations,
and of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any
jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Landlord with
respect thereto. The liability and obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional, not subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment, termination, defense, offset, counterclaim or recoupment
whatsoever (except as otherwise specifically provided in the Lease) (all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Guarantor), whether by reason of any
claim of any character whatsoever, including, without limitation, any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, or by reason of any
liability at any time to the Guarantor or otherwise, whether based upon any
obligations or any other agreements or otherwise, howsoever arising, whether out
of action or inaction or otherwise and whether resulting from default, willful
misconduct of Tenant, negligence or otherwise, and without limiting the
foregoing irrespective of (and whether or not Guarantor shall have notice or
knowledge of): (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Lease or of any
agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time, manner or
place of payment or performance of, or in any other term in respect of, all or
any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or consent to any
departure from the Lease or any other agreement relating to any Obligations; (c)
any increase in, addition to, exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any
lien on or security interest in, any collateral or any release or amendment or
waiver of or consent to any departure from or failure to enforce any other
guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; (d) any other circumstance which
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Tenant
or the Guarantor; (e) the absence of any action on the part of the Landlord to
obtain payment for the Obligations from the Tenant; (f) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or dissolution, or any proceeding of the Tenant or
the Guarantor, including, without limitation, rejection of the guaranteed
Obligations in such bankruptcy; (g) the absence of notice or any delay in any
action to enforce any Obligations or to exercise any right or remedy against the
Guarantor or the Tenant, whether hereunder, under any Obligations or under any
agreement or any indulgence, compromise or extension granted; or (h) the
termination or cessation of a corporate relationship between Guarantor and
Tenant.

         Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent that the Tenant or the
Guarantor makes a payment or payments to the Landlord, which payment or payments
or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to the Tenant or the
Guarantor or their respective estate, trustee, receiver or any other party under
any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to
the extent of such payment or repayment, this Guaranty and the advances or part
thereof which have been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be
reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date such initial
payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred. The provisions of this paragraph
shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the termination
of this Guaranty.

         Until such time as all the Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly
paid to Landlord and performed in full, Guarantor shall have no rights (direct
or indirect) of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnification or
other rights of payment or recovery from any person or entity (including,
without limitation, the Tenant) for any payments made by the Guarantor
hereunder, and Guarantor hereby waives and releases absolutely and
unconditionally,


                                      -4-

<PAGE>

any such rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and
other rights of payment or recovery which it may now have or hereafter acquire.
If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding
sentence and the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall
be deemed to have been paid to the Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in
trust for the benefit of, the Landlord and shall forthwith be paid to the
Landlord to be credited and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Lease. The Guarantor acknowledges
that it will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the granting,
execution and delivery of the Lease by the Landlord and that the waiver set
forth in this paragraph is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. The
provisions of this paragraph shall survive the payment and performance of the
Obligations and the termination of this Guaranty.

         Guarantor represents and warrants to Landlord that (a) the execution
and delivery of this Guaranty has been duly authorized by the Board of Directors
of Guarantor and does not contravene any law, or any contractual or legal
restriction, applicable to it, (b) no authorization or approval or other action
by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory
body is required for its execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty,
(c) there are no conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Guaranty that
have not been satisfied or waived, (d) Tenant is an indirect wholly owned
affiliate or subsidiary of Guarantor, (e) Guarantor will, directly or
indirectly, benefit from the transaction which is the subject of the Lease, and
(f) neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Guaranty, nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, conflicts or will conflict with
or results or will result in a default under or a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of
the Guarantor or of any contract to which the Guarantor is a party or by which
it is bound.

         This Guaranty shall be legally binding upon Guarantor and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Landlord and Lender (as
such term is defined in the Lease) and each of their respective successors and
assigns. Reference herein to Landlord shall be deemed to include Landlord and
its successors and assigns. Reference herein to Tenant shall be deemed to
include Tenant and its successors and assigns. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Landlord may assign or otherwise transfer (whether as an
outright assignment or transfer or as collateral) all or any portion of its
rights and obligations under the Lease to any other person or entity (any such
person or entity, a "Landlord Assign") and such Landlord Assign shall thereupon
become vested (on a non-exclusive basis, as an additional beneficiary) with all
the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Landlord herein or otherwise.

         THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAW OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF
(OTHER THAN THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 35.51 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE
CODE). GUARANTOR HEREBY SUBMITS TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN SAID STATE AND THE
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN SAID STATE (AND ANY
APPELLATE COURTS TAKING APPEALS THEREFROM) FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF GUARANTOR'S
OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND WAIVES ANY AND ALL PERSONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE


                                      -5-

<PAGE>

LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE TO OBJECT TO JURISDICTION WITHIN SUCH STATE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION TO ENFORCE SUCH
OBLIGATIONS. GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN
ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, (A)
THAT IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH JURISDICTION OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN THOSE COURTS OR THAT
THIS GUARANTY MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY THOSE COURTS OR THAT IT IS EXEMPT OR
IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION, (B) THAT THE ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM OR (C) THAT THE VENUE OF THE ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IS
IMPROPER (BUT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF LANDLORD OR ANY LANDLORD
ASSIGN TO BRING ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER FORUM). IN THE EVENT
ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION IS COMMENCED, GUARANTOR AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE, AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER GUARANTOR
OBTAINED, BY SERVICE OF A COPY OF THE SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND OTHER PLEADINGS
REQUIRED TO COMMENCE SUCH LITIGATION UPON GUARANTOR AT GUARANTOR'S ADDRESS SET
FORTH HEREIN.

         Without the prior written consent thereto by Landlord, Guarantor will
not enter into any amendment to this Guaranty and without such consent no such
amendment will be effective in any event. No waiver of any provision of this
Guaranty, and no consent to any departure by Guarantor herefrom, shall be
effective without the prior written consent thereto by Landlord and Lender, and
any waiver or consent for which such written consent is given shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No
failure on the part of the Landlord to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right. Guarantor will from time to time
during the Term (as defined in the Lease), promptly following request of
Landlord or Lender, confirm in writing to Landlord and to Lender that this
Guaranty remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

         At any time when Guarantor is not a reporting company under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, it will deliver to Landlord and
Lender the following information:

         (a) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal
         year of Guarantor, a balance sheet of Guarantor and its consolidated
         subsidiaries as at the end of such year, a statement of profits and
         losses of Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries for such year,
         and a statement of change in the financial position of Guarantor, and
         its consolidated subsidiaries for such year, setting forth in each
         case, in comparative form, the corresponding figures for the preceding
         fiscal year in reasonable detail and scope and certified by independent
         certified public accountants of recognized national standing selected
         by Guarantor; and (b) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of
         the first


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

         three (3) fiscal quarters of Guarantor a balance sheet of Guarantor and
         its consolidated subsidiaries as at the end of such quarter, statements
         of profits and losses of Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries
         for such quarter and a statement of change in financial position of
         Guarantor and in each case, in comparative form, the corresponding
         figures for the similar quarter of the preceding year, in reasonable
         detail and scope, and certified to be true and complete by a financial
         officer of Guarantor having knowledge thereof; the foregoing financial
         statements all being prepared in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles, consistently applied (except as otherwise stated
         therein).

         The Guarantor shall permit the Landlord and Lender and their
representatives, at the expense of such person or entity, except in the event of
an Event of Default under the Lease, in which case at Guarantor's expense, and
upon reasonable prior written notice to the Guarantor, to visit the principal
executive office of the Guarantor, to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts
of the Guarantor with the Guarantor's officers, and (with the consent of the
Guarantor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) its independent
public accountants, and (with the consent of the Guarantor, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld) to visit the other offices and properties of the
Guarantor and each subsidiary, all at such reasonable times and as often as may
be reasonably requested in writing.

         GUARANTOR AND LANDLORD (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS GUARANTY) HEREBY
MUTUALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE ARISING HEREUNDER.
The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the payment and performance of
the Obligations and the termination of this Guaranty.

         All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be either delivered to the notice address of Guarantor by
hand, or sent by reputable overnight courier, or by United States Registered or
Certified Mail, adequate postage prepaid. The notice address for Guarantor shall
be 15350 Vickery Drive, Houston, Texas 77032. Guarantor's address may be changed
from time to time by such party by giving notice as provided above. No change of
address of either party shall be binding on the other party until notice of such
change of address is given as hereby provided. A post office receipt for
registration of such notice or signed return receipt shall be conclusive that
such notice was delivered in due course of mail if mailed as provided above. For
purposes of the calculation of the time periods referred to herein, notice
delivered by hand shall be deemed received when delivered to the place for
giving notice to a party referred to above; notice sent by overnight courier as
provided above shall be deemed received and delivered one (1) day after deposit
with such courier; and notice mailed in the manner provided above shall be
deemed completed upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt as indicated on
the signed return receipt, or (ii) three (3) days after posting as herein
provided. Finally, any written notice addressed as provided hereinabove and
actually received by the addressee, shall constitute sufficient notice for all
purposes under this Lease.

         The Guarantor agrees that it shall not institute against, or join any
other person or entity in instituting against, any Landlord Assign or any person
or entity which is or was a creditor of or holder of any certificate or
instrument issued by any Landlord Assign any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding, or other proceeding under


                                      -7-

<PAGE>


any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law for one (1) year and one (1) day
after the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Landlord Assign
or any such creditor of or holder of a certificate or instrument issued by such
Landlord Assign is paid in full. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Guarantor hereunder, the provisions of this paragraph shall
survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the termination of
this Guaranty.

         Except for provisions of this Guaranty which by their terms survive the
termination hereof, this Guaranty shall terminate after all of the following
shall have occurred: (i) all Base Rent, all Additional Rent and all other sums
and charges payable by the Tenant under the Lease shall have been indefeasibly
paid in full in cash; and (ii) all other Obligations of the Tenant under the
Lease shall have been performed in full in strict accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Lease.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Guarantor, intending to be legally bound hereby,
has caused this Guaranty to be executed by its duly authorized officer and its
