     WHEREAS, AWS directly or indirectly owns (either by itself or with others)
and operates wireless telecommunications systems (the "Alaska Systems") in the
territory covered by the Alaska Cellular Authorizations (as defined in Section
2.3(a)) (collectively, the "Alaska Markets"); and DCS directly or indirectly
owns (either by itself or with others) and operates wireless telecommunications
systems (the "California Systems") in the territory covered by the California
Cellular Authorizations (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) (collectively, the
"California Markets"); and

     WHEREAS, AWS and its Affiliates are engaged in the business of marketing,
selling and providing wireless telecommunications services in the Alaska Markets
(such business, as conducted by AWS, is referred to herein as the "Alaska
Business"); and DCS and its Affiliates are engaged in the business of marketing,
selling and providing wireless telecommunications services in the California
Markets (such business, as conducted by DCS, is referred to herein as the
"California Business"); and

     WHEREAS, AWS and DCS desire to effect an exchange (the "Exchange") of,
among other things, the assets and rights of DCS that relate primarily to the
ownership and operation of the California Systems, including certain licenses
issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), for the assets and
rights of AWS that relate primarily to the ownership and operation of the Alaska
Systems, including certain licenses issued by the FCC, all subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein; and

     WHEREAS, the parties desire that the Exchange be structured as a like-kind
exchange under section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), to the fullest extent practicable.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and
agreements herein set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                    EXCHANGE

     Section 1.1. Asset Consolidation

     At or prior to Closing, (a) AWS and DCS will use all commercially
reasonable efforts, at the expense of DCS (except with regard to any fees of
AWS's outside counsel), to effect the transactions described on Schedule 1.1(a)
(the assets, properties and rights to be conveyed to AWS pursuant to such
transactions are referred to herein as the "Redemption Assets") and (b) AWS will
use all commercially reasonable efforts, at the expense of AWS, to effect the
transactions described on Schedule 1.1(b).

     Section 1.2. Exchange

     Except as otherwise provided and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement:

     (a) At Closing, AWS will, and will cause its Affiliates to, assign,
transfer, deliver and convey to DCS, free and clear of all security interests,
liens, pledges, charges, encroachments, defects of title, options, rights of
first refusal or other rights of third parties (absolute or contingent),
easements or any other encumbrance or restriction on the use or exercise of any
attribute of ownership (collectively, "Liens") other than Permitted Liens (as
defined in Section 18.18), and DCS will acquire, all right, title, and interest
of AWS and its Affiliates in and to, the Alaska Assets (as defined in Section
2.3), in exchange for the California Assets (as defined in Section 2.1).

     (b) At Closing, DCS will, and will cause its Affiliates to, assign,
transfer, deliver and convey to AWS, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens, and AWS will acquire, all right, title and interest of DCS and
its Affiliates in and to the California Assets, in exchange for the Alaska
Assets.

     (c) At Closing, AWS will assign, transfer, deliver and convey to Dobson
Communications Corporation ("DCC"), free and clear of all Liens (other than
Liens created by any agreement to which DCC is a party), all right, title and
interest of AWS in and to the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock of DCC owned
by AWS, including any right to receive dividends or other distributions thereon
(the "DCC Securities").

     Section 1.3. Like-Kind Exchange

     (a) The parties shall cause the Exchange to be treated in such a manner
that such exchange qualifies as a tax-free exchange of multiple, like-kind
assets to the maximum extent permitted by section 1031 of the Code.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, including this Section
1.3, each party acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has obtained its own,
separate tax advice with respect to the characterization of the exchanges
hereunder as like-kind exchanges of property under section 1031 of the Code, and
(ii) is not relying on any representations of the other party with respect to
the characterization of the exchanges hereunder as like-kind exchanges of
property under section 1031 of the Code.

     (b) On or prior to the Closing Date, DCS and AWS shall agree upon the
relative fair market values of the assets to be delivered to the other party
pursuant to Section 1.2. AWS and DCS agree to cause all tax returns and reports
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594, to be filed in accordance with such agreement and not to take
any position inconsistent therewith unless required to do so pursuant to a
"determination" as such term is defined in section 1313 of the Code.

written good faith estimate of the Alaska Closing Date Working Capital prepared
in accordance with this Article 5 (the "DCS Determination") and (ii) AWS shall
deliver to DCS a written good faith estimate of the California Closing Date
Working Capital prepared in accordance with this Article 5 (the "AWS

DCS shall have full access to AWS's records related to the AWS Determination.
Within 30 days after delivery of the DCS Determination, AWS shall advise DCS in

supporting documents and information, to the extent the same is available to AWS
or DCS, as the case may be.

     (b) If AWS does not timely deliver an AWS Post-Closing Objection to DCS,
then the calculation of the California Closing Date Working Capital set forth in
the DCS Determination shall be controlling. If DCS does not timely deliver a DCS
Post-Closing Objection to AWS, then the calculation of the Alaska Closing Date
Working Capital set forth in the AWS Determination shall be controlling. If
neither party timely delivers a Post-Closing Objection, then the payment
contemplated by Section 5.4 shall be made within two business days following the
90th day after the Closing Date.

     (c) If either party timely delivers a Post-Closing Objection, AWS and DCS
shall use good faith efforts to jointly resolve their dispute within 15 days
thereafter, which resolution, if achieved, shall be binding upon all parties to
this Agreement and not subject to further dispute or review. If the parties
resolve their dispute, then the payment contemplated by Section 5.4 shall be
made within two business days after such resolution is reached. If AWS and DCS
cannot resolve their dispute within such 15-day period, then the dispute shall
be submitted for resolution to Ernst & Young LLP (the "Independent
Accountants"). In submitting a dispute to the Independent Accountants, each of
the parties shall furnish, at its own expense, the Independent Accountants and
the other party with such documents and information as the Independent
Accountants may reasonable request. Each party may also furnish to the
Independent Accountants such other information and documents as it deems
relevant with the appropriate copies and notification being given to the other
party. The Independent Accountants may conduct a conference concerning the
disagreements between DCS and AWS at which conference each party shall have the
right to present additional documents, materials and other evidence and to have
present its or their advisors, accountants or counsel. The Independent
Accountants shall promptly, and no later than 30 days after submission of the
dispute, render a decision on the issues presented, and such decision shall be
final and binding on the parties. The payment contemplated by Section 5.4 shall
be made within two business days after receipt of the Independent Accountants'
decision.

     Section 5.4. Post-Closing Adjustment

     If the California Closing Date Working Capital is greater than the Alaska
Closing Date Working Capital, then AWS will pay DCS an amount equal to the
excess of the California Closing Date Working Capital over the Alaska Closing
Date Working Capital. If the Alaska Closing Date Working Capital is greater than
the California Closing Date Working Capital, then DCS will pay AWS an amount
equal to the excess of the Alaska Closing Date Working Capital over the
California Closing Date Working Capital. Any such payment shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds on the date specified in Section 5.3,
and shall not bear any interest.

                                    ARTICLE 6

Real Property Lease that has not expired in accordance with its terms is valid,
binding and enforceable and in full force and effect. None of DCS, any
Affiliate, or, to the knowledge of DCS, any other party to any DCS Real Property
Lease, is in default, violation or breach of any material term thereunder or
received any written notice of default thereunder. Except as set forth on
Schedule 7.4(c), no DCS Leased Property (or any portion thereof) has been
subleased, licensed or otherwise had a right to use granted by DCS or an
Affiliate with respect thereto to any other Person. No improvement on any DCS
Leased Property materially encroaches upon adjoining real estate, and all such
improvements have been constructed in conformity with all "setback" lines,
easements, and other restrictions, or rights of record, that have been
established by any applicable building or zoning ordinances.

     improvement in excess of $100,000;

          (xvii) any equipment lease with annual payments of more than $100,000;

          (xviii) any Contract having annual payments greater than $100,000 or a
     commitment of $200,000 or more in the aggregate; and

     DCS has heretofore delivered to AWS true and correct copies of the Assumed
California Contracts in effect as of the date hereof that are required to be set
forth on Schedule 7.5(a), including all amendments, supplements and
modifications thereto or waivers currently in effect thereunder.

     (b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 7.5(b), neither DCS nor any Affiliate
is in Default (as defined in Section 18.18) in any material respect with respect
to, nor to the knowledge of DCS is there any Default in any material respect by
the other parties to, any Assumed California Contracts. The Assumed California
Contracts are in full force and effect, enforceable against DCS or an Affiliate
in accordance with their terms.

     (c) As of September 30, 2002, there were approximately 59,087 subscribers
of the California Business. Schedule 7.5(c) sets forth, for each California
System, the total number of subscribers, the name of each of the price plans
presently in the process of being implemented or presently covering the active
subscribers of the California Business, together with the approximate number of
subscribers, as of September 30, 2002, under each such plan, and the approximate
number of such subscribers whose account balances have been outstanding for more
than 60 days.

     (d) To the knowledge of DCS, no party to an Assumed California Contract
(which party accounts for $50,000 or more annually in business with DCS or an
Affiliate) has informed DCS or an Affiliate in writing of its intent to cancel
or otherwise modify in any material respect, other than in the ordinary course
of its relationship with DCS or an Affiliate or the California Business, or to
decrease significantly or limit significantly its purchases, services, supplies
or materials under such Assumed California Contract.

     Section 7.6. Governmental Licenses; FCC Matters

     (a) DCS or its Affiliates hold all those licenses, permits and/or
certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by any governmental body
having jurisdiction over the California Business or any California Assets, which
are required in connection with the ownership and operation of the California
Assets and the California Business as it is presently being conducted except for
such licenses, consents, permits, approvals and authorizations for which the
failure to so hold would not be material. DCS or an Affiliate is the exclusive
holder of, and has good, complete and marketable title to, free and clear of all
Liens, the California FCC Authorizations. No person other than DCS or an
Affiliate has any right, title or interest (legal or beneficial) in or to, or
any right or license to use, any California FCC Authorizations. Each California
FCC Authorization has been granted to DCS or an Affiliate by Final Order and is
in full force and effect. Neither DCS nor any Affiliate has entered into any
obligation, agreement, arrangement or understanding to sell, transfer, deliver,
convey, assign or otherwise dispose of any California FCC Authorization or that
would affect the ownership or use of any California FCC Authorization by AWS or
an Affiliate after Closing.

     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.6(b)(i), neither DCS nor any
Affiliate is operating in material conflict with, or in material default or
violation of, any Laws applicable to any California FCC Authorization, and each
is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of each
California FCC Authorization. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.6(b)(ii), and
except for proceedings affecting the wireless industry or wireless licenses
generally, there is not pending or, to the knowledge of DCS, threatened against
DCS or an Affiliate or any California FCC Authorization, nor does DCS have
knowledge of any basis for, any application, action, complaint, claim,
investigation, suit, notice of violation, petition, objection or other pleading,
or any proceeding against DCS or an Affiliate or any California FCC
Authorization, with the FCC or any other Governmental Authority (as defined in
Section 18.18), which questions or contests the validity of, or seeks the
revocation, cancellation, forfeiture, non-renewal or suspension of, any
California FCC Authorization, or which seeks the imposition of any modification
or amendment with respect thereto, or the payment of a fine, sanction, penalty,
damages or contribution in connection with the use of any California FCC
Authorization by DCS or an Affiliate.

     (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.6(c), all documents required to be
filed during the ownership of the California Systems by DCS or its Affiliates
with the FCC or FAA pursuant to FCC Law with respect to each California FCC
Authorization have been timely filed or the time period for such filing has not
lapsed except where the failure to make such filing would not be material. All
of such filings are complete and correct in all material respects. No California
FCC Authorization is subject to any conditions other than those appearing on its
face and those imposed by FCC Law. All amounts owed to the FCC in connection
with the ownership of the California FCC Authorizations have been timely paid,
the calculation of all such amounts is accurate in all material respects and no
further amounts currently are due to the FCC in respect of any California FCC
Authorization.

     (d) DCS or its designated Affiliate is legally qualified to (A) receive and
hold any Alaska FCC Authorization(s) to be acquired thereby and (B) receive any
authorization or approval from any state or local regulatory authority necessary
for it to acquire any such Alaska FCC Authorization(s).

     Section 7.7. Compliance with Laws

     Except as set forth on Schedule 7.7, DCS and its Affiliates are in material
compliance with and there is no material Default under any statute, law,
ordinance, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction, ruling, order or rule of
any federal, state, local, foreign or other governmental or quasi-governmental
agency or body ("Laws") applicable to the California Business.

     Section 7.8. No Conflicts; Consents

     Except for compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act,
consent by the FCC to the assignment of the California FCC Authorizations from
DCS to AWS or its designated Affiliate, and the consents, authorizations and
approvals identified on Schedule 7.8 (collectively, the "Required California
Consents") and the registrations, filings and notices identified on Schedule 7.8
(collectively, the "Required California Notices"), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents by DCS or
an Affiliate nor the performance by them of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will result in a Default under any term, condition or provision of,
or require the consent, authorization or approval of, or any registrations or
filings with or notices to, any person or Governmental Authority under, (i) any
Law to which DCS or an Affiliate or any of the California Assets or the
California Business is subject, (ii) any Assumed California Contract listed on
Schedule 7.5(a), or any California FCC Authorization, or any material note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement or other instrument, to which DCS or
an Affiliate is a party or subject or by which any of the California Assets or
the California Business is bound or affected, or (iii) the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of DCS or, if applicable, the governing documents of any
Affiliate; except, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent
such Default does not (x) result in a material adverse effect to the California
Business as a whole, or (y) impair the ability of DCS or its Affiliates to
consummate the Transactions.

     Section 7.9. Litigation and Legal Proceedings

     Except as set forth on Schedule 7.9, there is no outstanding judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority (including the FCC or any state body having jurisdiction over the
California Business or any California Asset) against DCS or an Affiliate
primarily affecting the California Business or the California Assets or which
questions the validity of any action taken or to be taken pursuant to this
Agreement or in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit or to obtain damages
or other relief in connection with this Agreement. Except as set forth on
Schedule 7.9, there is no litigation, arbitration, investigation or other
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority (including the
FCC or any state body having jurisdiction over the California Business or any
California Asset) pending, or, to the knowledge of DCS, threatened, against DCS
or an Affiliate, the result of which, alone or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the California Business
(taken as a whole), the California Assets (taken as a whole) or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and DCS has no knowledge of any reasonably
likely basis therefor.

     Section 7.10. California System Employees

     Schedule 7.10 sets forth a true and complete list of the names and base
salaries of all employees of DCS and its Affiliates primarily involved in the
operation of the California Business (the "California System Employees"). DCS
and its Affiliates: (i) have in all material respects withheld and reported all
amounts required by Law or by Contract to be withheld and reported with respect
to wages, salaries and other payments to California System Employees; (ii) are
not liable for any material arrears of wages or any material Taxes or any
material penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing; and (iii) are
not liable for any material payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority
(including the FCC or any state body having jurisdiction over the California
Business or any California Asset), with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for California System
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no material pending or to
the knowledge of DCS threatened claims or actions against DCS or its Affiliates
under any worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy involving
any California System Employee. There are no actions, suits, claims or
grievances pending, or, to the knowledge of DCS, threatened relating to any
labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any California System
Employee, including, charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination
complaints. Neither DCS nor any Affiliate has engaged in any unfair labor
practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act with respect to
any California System Employee or the California Business. Neither DCS nor any
Affiliate is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
the California Business and no such collective bargaining agreement is being
negotiated by DCS or any Affiliate. No consent of any union (or similar group or
organization) is required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. There are no pending, or, to the knowledge of
DCS, threatened (a) union representation petitions respecting the California
System Employees, (b) efforts being made to organize any of the California
System Employees, or (c) strikes, slow downs, work stoppages, or lockouts or
threats affecting the California System Employees. Neither DCS nor any Affiliate
has made any representation, warranty or agreement with any of its California
System Employees or any other employees of DCS concerning employment with AWS
after the Closing.

     Section 7.11. California System Employee Benefits

     Except as set forth on Schedule 7.11, neither DCS nor any Affiliate
maintains or sponsors any California Benefit Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "California Benefit Plans" means any material plan, program,
policy, practice, contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for
compensation, severance, termination pay, deferred compensation, performance
awards, stock or stock-related awards, fringe benefits or other employee
benefits or remuneration of any kind, whether written or unwritten or otherwise,
funded or unfunded, including, each "employee benefit plan," within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA (a) which is or has been maintained, contributed to, or
required to be contributed to, by DCS or any "ERISA Affiliate" (which means any
Affiliate of a person which is required to be aggregated with such person under
Section 414 of the Code), (b) which is for the benefit of any California System
Employee, or (c) for which DCS or any Affiliate has or could have any liability.
Neither DCS nor any Affiliate has any agreement or obligation, whether formal or
informal, to create, enter into or contribute to any additional California
Benefit Plan or to modify or amend any existing California Benefit Plan, unless
such amendment or modification is required by applicable Law. Each California
Benefit Plan has been established and administered in material compliance with
its terms and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable
Laws. Neither DCS nor any Affiliate has incurred, and there exists no condition
or set of circumstances in connection with which DCS, AWS or any of their
respective Affiliates could incur, directly or indirectly, any liability or
expense (except for routine contributions and benefit payments) under applicable
Laws or pursuant to any indemnification or other agreement with respect to the
California Benefit Plans. None of the California Benefit Plans is subject to
Title IV of ERISA (including any multiemployer plan within the meaning of ERISA
Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) or Section 412 of the Code, or any multiple
employer plan within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code). No California Benefit Plan provides, reflects or represents
any Liability to provide retiree health to any person for any reason, except as
may be required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither DCS nor any
ERISA Affiliate has represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or
written form) to any California System Employee (either individually or to
California System Employees as a group) or any other person that such California
System Employee(s) or other person would be provided with retiree health, except
to the extent required by statute. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
under any California Benefit Plan or employment agreement or under any related
trust or loan agreement that will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect
to any current or former California System Employee. Each California Benefit
Plan that is intended to be a "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified by issuance and
receipt of a favorable determination letter or reliance upon an opinion letter
which states that the California Benefit Plan meets all requirements under the
Code and that any trust(s) associated with such California Benefit Plan is tax
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. There are no claims (other than routine
claims for benefits), actions or lawsuits pending, or to the knowledge of DCS,
threatened, with respect to any California Benefit Plan or the fiduciaries
responsible for such California Benefit Plan, and to the knowledge of DCS, there
are no circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
action, lawsuit or claim, on behalf of or against any of the California Benefit
Plans or any trusts related thereto.

     Section 7.12. Tax Matters

     Except as set forth on Schedule 7.12, as relates to the California Assets
and the California Business, DCS and its Affiliates have timely filed all Tax
returns and statements which they were required to file, and have paid all Taxes
due prior to the date hereof and will pay when due (or contest in good faith by
appropriate proceedings) all Taxes which may become due on or before the Closing
Date. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.12, neither DCS nor any Affiliate has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to an extension
of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency related to the California
Assets or the California Business. To the knowledge of DCS, there are no
unresolved claims raised by any Tax authority concerning the Tax liability of
DCS or an Affiliate related to the California Assets or the California Business.
All Taxes related to the California Assets and the California Business which DCS
or an Affiliate is required by law to withhold or to collect for payment have
been duly withheld and collected, and have been paid.

     Section 7.13. Financial Statements; Changes

     (a) DCS has delivered to AWS complete and correct copies of (i) the
unaudited financial statements of the California Markets as at and for the
periods ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, each of which include a
balance sheet and related statement of income for the year then ended (the
"California Historical Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited financial
statements of the California Markets at September 30, 2002 (the "California
Balance Sheet Date") including a balance sheet (the "California Balance Sheet")
and related statements of income for the nine (9) month period then ended
(collectively, the "California Interim Financial Statements"). Except as set
forth on Schedule 7.13(a), the California Historical Financial Statements and
the California Interim Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the financial position of the California
Markets and the results of its operations for the periods specified therein
(subject to the absence of footnotes, and, in the case of the California Interim
Financial Statements, to normal year end audit adjustments).

     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.13(b) or as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, with respect to the California Assets, since the California
Balance Sheet Date, neither DCS nor any Affiliate has:

          (i) sold, assigned, or transferred any of the material, assets,
     properties or rights included in the California Assets (except for the
     Excluded California Assets and except pursuant to existing Contracts
     relating to the California Business disclosed on any Schedule to this
     Agreement or inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with
     past practice);

          (ii) entered into any other material transaction primarily relating to
     the California Business other than in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practices;

          (iii) suffered any material damage, destruction or casualty loss with
     respect to the California Assets not covered by insurance;

          (iv) suffered any events which, individually or in the aggregate,
     have, or could be reasonably expected to, materially adversely affect the
     California Assets (as a whole), the California Business (as a whole) or the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

          (v) entered into any agreement or understanding to do any of the
     foregoing.

     (c) DCS has delivered to AWS complete and correct copies of the unaudited
financial statements of DCS as at the California Balance Sheet Date, including a
balance sheet and related statement of income for the nine (9) month period then
ended (collectively, the "DCS Financial Statements"). Except as set forth on
Schedule 7.13(c), the DCS Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the financial position of DCS and the results
of its operations for the period specified therein (subject to the absence of
footnotes and to normal year end audit adjustments).

     Section 7.14. Insurance

     DCS and its Affiliates have maintained all policies of title, liability,
fire, worker's compensation and other forms of insurance (including bonds) that
relate to the California Assets and which insure against risks and Liabilities
to an extent and in a manner customary in the cellular industry. All such
insurance policies and binders are in full force and effect. Neither DCS nor any
Affiliate has received any notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such
policy or binder. No insurance carrier has canceled or reduced any insurance
coverage for DCS or an Affiliate or has given any notice or other indication of
its intention to cancel or reduce any such coverage. DCS and its Affiliates have
complied in all material respects with each of such insurance policies and
binders, and have not failed to give any notice or present any claim thereunder
in a due and timely manner.

     Section 7.15. Brokers

     Except for Lehman Brothers, DCS has not engaged any agent, broker or other
person acting pursuant to the express or implied authority of DCS which is or
may be entitled to a commission or broker or finder's fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the
sale of the California Assets.

     Section 7.16. Environmental Compliance

     (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.16, (i) neither DCS nor any Affiliate
has generated, used, transported, treated, stored, released or disposed of, or
knowingly permitted anyone else to generate, use, transport, treat, store,
release or dispose of any Hazardous Substance (as defined in subsection (b)
below) at, on or in connection with the ownership or occupancy of the California
Assets in violation of any applicable Environmental Laws (as defined in
subsection (c) below); (ii) there has not been any generation, use,
transportation, treatment, storage, release or disposal of any Hazardous
Substance in connection with DCS's or an Affiliate's ownership, occupancy or use
of the California Assets or on, in or under any property or facility owned or
leased by DCS or an Affiliate and included in the California Assets which has
created or might reasonably be expected to create any Liability under any
applicable Environmental Laws; (iii) any Hazardous Substance handled or dealt
with by DCS or an Affiliate at, on or in connection with the ownership or
occupancy of the California Assets has been and is being handled or dealt with
in material compliance with all Environmental Laws; (iv) to the knowledge of
DCS, the operation of the California Business by DCS and its Affiliates is in
compliance with all Environmental Laws; and (v) to the knowledge of DCS, there
are no claims against DCS or any Affiliate by third parties, including
Governmental Authorities, pending or threatened under Environmental Laws arising
out of DCS's or any Affiliate's ownership or use of the California Assets or the
condition of the California Assets.

     (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall
mean any hazardous or toxic substance, pollutant, contaminant or other material
which, as of the date of this Agreement, is defined as hazardous or toxic under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), and its implementing regulations; defined as a
hazardous waste or regulated substance under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976, as amended ("RCRA") and its implementing regulations; or
is regulated under any applicable Environmental Laws, including any substance
which has been determined by regulation, ruling or otherwise by any Governmental
Authority to be a hazardous or toxic substance regulated under federal or state
law, and shall include petroleum and petroleum products.

     (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental Laws" shall
mean common law, CERCLA, RCRA, NEPA and any applicable statutes, regulations,
rules, ordinances, codes, licenses, permits, orders, approvals, plans,
directives, authorizations, concessions, franchises and similar items of all
Governmental Authorities and all applicable judicial, administrative and
regulatory decrees, judgments and orders, any of which relate to (i) the
protection of human health or the environment from the effects of Hazardous
Substances, including those pertaining to reporting, licensing, permitting,
investigating and remediating discharges, releases or threatened releases of
Hazardous Substances into the air, surface water, sediments, groundwater or
land; (ii) the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage,
disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Substances; or (iii) the ownership,
occupancy or operation of the California Assets or Alaska Assets, as applicable.

     (d) DCS has delivered to AWS true and complete copies of all transaction
screens (to the extent any transaction screens were performed) and Phase I
environmental site assessment reports (as such terms are commonly understood in
the industry) that DCS has on file with respect to the California Assets. AWS
acknowledges that it is not entitled to rely on such reports (since the
consultants did not prepare them for the benefit of AWS).

     Section 7.17. Accounts Receivable

     All accounts receivable of DCS and any Affiliate relating to the California
Business as set forth on the California Balance Sheet are or will be valid and
genuine, have arisen or will arise solely out of bona fide sales and deliveries
of goods, performance of services and other business transactions in the
ordinary course of the California Business consistent with past practices, and
the allowance for collection losses on such balance sheets have been or will be
determined in accordance with GAAP and based upon DCS's historical experience in
collecting its accounts receivable. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of DCS, there are no facts or circumstances that will, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in the allowances for collection losses on the
California Balance Sheet being inadequate to cover expected collection losses.

     Section 7.18. Solvency

     DCS is Solvent. "Solvent" means, at any time, that (i) the fair value of
the applicable entity's property is greater than the amount of its Liabilities
(whether subordinated, contingent, unmatured, unliquidated or otherwise); (ii)
the present fair saleable value of the applicable entity's property is not less
than the amount that will be required to pay its probable liability on its debts
as they become absolute and matured; (iii) the applicable entity is able to
realize upon its property and pay its debts and other liabilities as they mature
in the normal course of business; (iv) the applicable entity does not intend to,
and does not believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond its ability
to pay as such debts and liabilities mature; and (v) the applicable entity is
not engaged in business or a transaction for which its property would constitute
unreasonably small capital.

     Section 7.19. Valid Transaction

     Any transfer made by DCS or any Affiliate of any right, title or interest
in or to the California Assets does not constitute a fraudulent conveyance under
any applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) such
transfer is being made for a valid business purpose and (b) such transfer is
being made for fair consideration. Neither DCS nor any of its Affiliates has
taken any action with the intent to hinder or delay payment to any creditors of
DCS or any Affiliate.

     Section 7.20. Undisclosed Liabilities

     Neither DCS nor any Affiliate has any Liabilities arising out of or
relating to the California System or any of the California Assets, except as and
to the extent reflected or reserved for in the California Interim Financial
Statements and except (i) as set forth in Schedule 7.20, (ii) for Liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
the California Balance Sheet Date and in each case to the extent permitted to be
incurred in accordance with the terms hereof, (iii) for executory obligations
under any Assumed California Contract, and (iv) for those that are not required
to be disclosed under GAAP.

     Section 7.21. DCS Cell Sites

     Schedule 7.21 lists each cell site (including each cell site on which DCS
or an Affiliate has placed one or more antennas and the number of antennas
placed on such cell site) (a "DCS Cell Site") currently operated or used by each
of DCS or an Affiliate in respect of the California System as of the date
hereof, indicating the address of such Cell Site and the geographical
coordinates thereof, whether DCS or such Affiliate is the owner of such Cell
Site and, if so, whether any other person is permitted to co-locate towers or
antennas thereon or has any other rights with respect thereto. Schedule 7.21
also sets forth (i) each instance where DCS or an Affiliate co-locates its
antennas relating to the California System on another person's tower or antenna
structure and (ii) whether any antenna structure on which DCS or an Affiliate
locates antennas is one which requires registration with the FCC under 47 C.F.R.
17.4, by reason of the obligation to file notification with the FAA under 47
C.F.R. 17.7 and, if so, the Antenna Structure Registration Number thereof.

     Section 7.22. CALEA

     Except as set forth in Schedule 7.22, there has been validly and timely
filed a Flexible Deployment Submission with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(the "FBI") in accordance with the FBI's Flexible Deployment Assistance Guide
with respect to the California Systems, and a Petition for Extension with the
FCC requesting an extension of the current CALEA capability compliance deadline
with respect to the California Systems until November 19, 2003.

     Section 7.23. Subscriber Agreements

     Each subscriber agreement with a customer of the California Business
provides either (a) that DCS (or its successor, including, following the
Closing, AWS) may increase the rates for service upon 30 days' notice to the
customer, in which event the customer may without penalty terminate the
agreement, or (b) that DCS may without penalty terminate the subscriber
agreement upon 30 days' notice.

     Section 7.24. Inventory

     The inventory included in the California Assets as of the dates set forth
on Schedule 7.24, together with the locations thereof, are set forth in Schedule
7.24. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.24, such inventory is of good, usable
and merchantable quality in all material respects and does not include items
which, in the ordinary course of the California Business, have been discontinued
or are off-specification, damaged, dormant, obsolete, non-salable, non-usable,
or not first quality; provided, that DCS is not representing hereby that such
inventory would not, in the ordinary course of AWS's business, be discontinued
or be considered off-specification, damaged, dormant, obsolete, non-salable,
non-usable, or not first quality. No mobile phones included in inventory are
pre-programmed to search for the SOC of DCS or an Affiliate on a preferred or
exclusive basis and any pre-programming contained in such phones may be
eliminated without incurring additional costs, in an immaterial amount of time
and without affecting the utility or marketability of such phones.

     Section 7.25. Pre-Paid Subscribers

     The California Systems have fewer than 500 pre-paid subscribers in the
aggregate.

                                   ARTICLE 8
                             REPRESENTATIONS OF AWS

     AWS hereby represents and warrants to DCS that:

     Section 8.1. Organization; Qualification

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
AWS and AWS Alaska have the power and authority to execute and deliver and,
subject to obtaining the Required Alaska Consents (as defined in Section 8.8)
and giving the Required Alaska Notices (as defined in Section 8.8), perform

thereby.

     Section 8.2. Authorization, Execution and Delivery

     The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by
AWS, and the transfer of the Alaska Assets and the DCC Securities to DCS or its
designated Affiliate have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all
necessary corporate action, including approval by AWS's Board of Directors. The
execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to which any
Affiliate of AWS is a party have been duly and validly authorized and approved
by all necessary corporate action, including approval by such Affiliate's Board
of Directors. This Agreement is, and each of the other Transaction Documents
when executed and delivered will be, a valid and binding obligation of AWS or
its Affiliate, as applicable, enforceable against AWS or such Affiliate in
accordance with its terms subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

     Section 8.3. Title to and Condition of Assets

     (a) AWS, its Affiliates that are direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of AWS and (before giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by Section 1.1(b)) Cellular Alaska Partnership have good and marketable title or

including all properties and assets reflected on the Alaska Balance Sheet and
not sold, retired or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of the Alaska Business consistent with past practices, free and
clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and except for the Liens listed on

effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 1.1(b)) Cellular Alaska
Partnership have full power, right and authority to sell and convey to DCS good
and marketable title to the Alaska Assets, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens. Immediately prior to the Closing, no person other than AWS
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries will have any right, title or interest in or
to any of the assets, properties and rights of AWS and its Affiliates (including
Affiliates that are not wholly-owned subsidiaries of AWS) that relate primarily
to the Alaska Business.

     (b) AWS has good and marketable title to the DCC Securities, free and clear
of all Liens (other than Liens created by any agreement to which DCC is a
party).

be provided to DCS pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Alaska
Assets include all material rights, assets and property necessary or material to
operate the Alaska Business as it is currently operated.

     (d) All buildings, structures, facilities, Machinery and Equipment and
other items of tangible property and assets (excluding inventory) which would be
included in the Alaska Assets if the Closing took place on the date hereof,
including all network equipment, are, in the aggregate and taken as a whole, in
good working condition and repair, subject to normal wear and maintenance, and
are located such that they are not materially encroaching on the property or
rights of any person.

     Section 8.4. Real Property

     Schedule 2.3(d) lists all real property and interests in real property
owned or leased by AWS or an Affiliate and used primarily in the Alaska
Business, and specifying the address and legal description suitable to identify
the property, a reasonable description of the use of each property, and which of
the properties are owned and which are leased.

     (a) With respect to each parcel of owned real property included in the
Alaska Assets, and except for matters set forth on Schedule 8.4(a):

          (i) AWS or an Affiliate has good and marketable title to the parcel of
     real property, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens and
     except for the Liens listed on Schedule 8.3 which will be discharged at
     Closing;

          (ii) there are no leases, subleases, licenses, concessions, or other
     agreements to which AWS or an Affiliate is a party or, to the knowledge of
     AWS, subleases, licenses, concessions or other agreements to which AWS or
     an Affiliate is not a party, granting to any party or parties the right of
     use or occupancy of any portion of the parcel of real property; and

          (iii) there are no outstanding options or rights of first refusal to
     purchase the parcel of real property, or any portion thereof or interest
     therein.

     (b) With respect to each parcel of real property listed on Schedule 2.3(d),
and except for matters set forth on Schedule 8.4(b):

          (i) To the knowledge of AWS, AWS or an Affiliate has valid and
     enforceable rights of physical and legal ingress and egress to and from
     such parcel; and

          (ii) Neither AWS nor any Affiliate has received any notice of, and AWS
     has no knowledge of, any non-compliance with applicable building codes,
     zoning regulations, occupational health and safety Laws or any other Laws,
     including environmental laws enforced by the FCC, applicable to such parcel
     or AWS's or an Affiliate's use or occupancy thereof.

     (c) Schedule 8.4(c) contains a list of all leases and occupancy and/or use
agreements of real property used primarily in the Alaska Business to which AWS
or an Affiliate is a tenant, lessee, licensee or grantee, together with any
amendments thereto (the "AWS Real Property Leases"). True, correct and complete
copies of each of the AWS Real Property Leases have been delivered by AWS to
DCS, together with any subleases granted with respect to the real property
covered by the AWS Real Property Leases (the "AWS Leased Property"). Each AWS
Real Property Lease, that has not expired in accordance with its terms is valid,
binding and enforceable and in full force and effect. None of AWS, any
Affiliate, or, to the knowledge of AWS, any other party to any AWS Real Property
Lease, is in default, violation or breach of any material term thereunder or
received any written notice of default thereunder. Except as set forth on
Schedule 8.4(c), no AWS Leased Property (or any portion thereof) has been
subleased, licensed or otherwise had a right to use granted by AWS or an
Affiliate with respect thereto to any other Person. No improvement on any AWS
Leased Property materially encroaches upon adjoining real estate, and all such
improvements have been constructed in conformity with all "setback" lines,
easements, and other restrictions, or rights of record that have been
established by any applicable building or zoning ordinances.

     Section 8.5. Assumed Contracts and Subscribers

     (a) Set forth on Schedule 8.5(a) is a list of all Contracts currently in

Alaska Business including those that fall within any one or more of the

     improvement in excess of $100,000;

          (xvii) any equipment lease with annual payments of more than $100,000;

          (xviii) any Contract having annual payments greater than $100,000 or a
     commitment of $200,000 or more in the aggregate; and

          (xix) any other material Contract not made in the ordinary course of
     business consistent with past practice.

     AWS has heretofore delivered to DCS true and correct copies of the Assumed
Alaska Contracts in effect as of the date hereof that are required to be set
forth on Schedule 8.5(a), including all amendments, supplements and
modifications thereto or waivers currently in effect thereunder.

     (b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 8.5(b), neither AWS nor any Affiliate
is in Default (as defined in Section 18.18) in any material respect with respect
to, nor to the knowledge of AWS is there any Default in any material respect by
the other parties to, any Assumed Alaska Contracts. The Assumed Alaska Contracts
are in full force and effect, enforceable against AWS or an Affiliate in
accordance with their terms.

     (c) As of September 30, 2002, there were approximately 122,421 subscribers
of the Alaska Business. Schedule 8.5(c) sets forth, for each Alaska System, the
total number of subscribers, the name of each of the price plans presently in
the process of being implemented or presently covering the active subscribers of
the Alaska Business, together with the approximate number of subscribers, as of
September 30, 2002, under each such plan, and the approximate number of such
subscribers whose account balances have been outstanding for more than 60 days.

     (d) To the knowledge of AWS, no party to an Assumed Alaska Contract (which
party accounts for $50,000 or more annually in business with AWS or an
Affiliate) has informed AWS or an Affiliate in writing of its intent to cancel
or otherwise modify in any material respect, other than in the ordinary course
of its relationship with AWS or an Affiliate or the Alaska Business, or to
decrease significantly or limit significantly its purchases, services, supplies
or materials under such Assumed Alaska Contract.

     Section 8.6. Governmental Licenses; FCC Matters

     (a) AWS or its Affiliates hold all those licenses, permits and/or
certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by any governmental body
having jurisdiction over the Alaska Business or any Alaska Assets, which are
required in connection with the ownership and operation of the Alaska Assets and
the Alaska Business as it is presently being conducted except for such licenses,
consents, permits, approvals and authorizations for which the failure to so hold
would not be material. AWS or an Affiliate is the exclusive holder of, and has
good, complete and marketable title to, free and clear of all Liens, the Alaska
FCC Authorizations. No person other than AWS or an Affiliate has any right,
title or interest (legal or beneficial) in or to, or any right or license to
use, any Alaska FCC Authorizations. Each Alaska FCC Authorization has been
granted to AWS or an Affiliate by Final Order and is in full force and effect.
Neither AWS nor any Affiliate has entered into any obligation, agreement,
arrangement or understanding to sell, transfer, deliver, convey, assign or
otherwise dispose of any Alaska FCC Authorization or that would affect the
ownership or use of any Alaska FCC Authorization by DCS or an Affiliate after
Closing.

     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.6(b)(i), neither AWS nor any
Affiliate is operating in material conflict with, or in material default or
violation of, any Laws applicable to any Alaska FCC Authorization, and each is
in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of each
Alaska FCC Authorization. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.6(b)(ii), and except
for proceedings affecting the wireless industry or wireless licenses generally,
there is not pending or, to the knowledge of AWS, threatened against AWS or an
Affiliate or any Alaska FCC Authorization, nor does AWS have knowledge of any
basis for, any application, action, complaint, claim, investigation, suit,
notice of violation, petition, objection or other pleading, or any proceeding
against AWS or an Affiliate or any Alaska FCC Authorization, with the FCC or any
other Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 18.18), which questions or
contests the validity of, or seeks the revocation, cancellation, forfeiture,
non-renewal or suspension of, any Alaska FCC Authorization, or which seeks the
imposition of any modification or amendment with respect thereto, or the payment
of a fine, sanction, penalty, damages or contribution in connection with the use
of any Alaska FCC Authorization by AWS or an Affiliate.

     (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.6(c), all documents required to be
filed during the ownership of the Alaska Systems by AWS or its Affiliates with
the FCC or FAA pursuant to FCC Law with respect to each Alaska FCC Authorization
have been timely filed or the time period for such filing has not lapsed except
where the failure to make such filing would not be material. All of such filings
are complete and correct in all material respects. No Alaska FCC Authorization
is subject to any conditions other than those appearing on its face and those
imposed by FCC Law. All amounts owed to the FCC in connection with the ownership
of the Alaska FCC Authorizations have been timely paid, the calculation of all
such amounts is accurate in all material respects and no further amounts
currently are due to the FCC in respect of any Alaska FCC Authorization.

     (d) AWS or its designated Affiliate is legally qualified to (A) receive and
hold any California FCC Authorization(s) to be acquired thereby and (B) receive
any authorization or approval from any state or local regulatory authority
necessary for it to acquire any such California FCC Authorization(s).

     Section 8.7. Compliance with Laws

     Except as set forth on Schedule 8.7, AWS and its Affiliates are in material
compliance with and there is no material Default under any Laws applicable to
the Alaska Business.

     Section 8.8. No Conflicts; Consents

     Except for compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act,
consent by the FCC to the assignment of the Alaska FCC Authorizations from AWS
to DCS or its designated Affiliate, and the consents, authorizations and
approvals identified on Schedule 8.8 (collectively, the "Required Alaska
Consents") and the registrations, filings and notices identified on Schedule 8.8
(collectively, the "Required Alaska Notices"), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents by AWS or
an Affiliate nor the performance by them of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will result in a Default under any term, condition or provision of,
or require the consent, authorization or approval of, or any registrations or
filings with or notices to, any person or Governmental Authority under, (i) any
Law to which AWS or an Affiliate or any of the Alaska Assets or the Alaska
Business is subject, (ii) any Assumed Alaska Contract listed on Schedule 8.5(a)
, or any Alaska FCC Authorization, or any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement or other instrument, to which AWS or an Affiliate is
a party or subject or by which any of the Alaska Assets or the Alaska Business
is bound or affected, or (iii) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of AWS
or AWS Alaska or, if applicable, the governing documents of any Affiliate;
except, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent such Default
does not (x) result in a material adverse effect to the Alaska Business as a
whole, or (y) impair the ability of AWS or its Affiliates to consummate the
Transactions.

     Section 8.9. Litigation and Legal Proceedings

     Except as set forth on Schedule 8.9, there is no outstanding judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority (including the FCC or any state body having jurisdiction over the
Alaska Business or any Alaska Asset) against AWS or an Affiliate primarily
affecting the Alaska Business or the Alaska Assets or which questions the
validity of any action taken or to be taken pursuant to this Agreement or in
which it is sought to restrain or prohibit or to obtain damages or other relief
in connection with this Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.9, there is
no litigation, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority (including the FCC or any state body having
jurisdiction over the Alaska Business or any Alaska Asset) pending, or, to the
knowledge of AWS, threatened, against AWS or any Affiliate, the result of which,
alone or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the Alaska Business (taken as a whole), the Alaska Assets (taken as a
whole) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and AWS has no
knowledge of any reasonably likely basis therefor.

     Section 8.10. Alaska System Employees

     Schedule 8.10 sets forth a true and complete list of the names and base
salaries of all employees of AWS and its Affiliates primarily involved in the
operation of the Alaska Business (the "Alaska System Employees"). AWS and its
Affiliates: (i) have in all material respects withheld and reported all amounts
required by Law or by Contract to be withheld and reported with respect to
wages, salaries and other payments to Alaska System Employees; (ii) are not
liable for any material arrears of wages or any material Taxes or any material
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing; and (iii) are not
liable for any material payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority
(including the FCC or any state body having jurisdiction over the Alaska
Business or any Alaska Asset), with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for Alaska System
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no material pending or to
the knowledge of AWS threatened claims or actions against AWS or its Affiliates
under any worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy involving
any Alaska System Employee. There are no actions, suits, claims or grievances
pending, or, to the knowledge of AWS, threatened relating to any labor, safety
or discrimination matters involving any Alaska System Employee, including,
charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints. Neither AWS nor
any Affiliate has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act with respect to any Alaska System Employee or
the Alaska Business. Neither AWS nor any Affiliate is presently, nor has it been
in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or
other labor union contract applicable to the Alaska Business and no such
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by AWS or any Affiliate. No
consent of any union (or similar group or organization) is required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. There
are no pending, or, to the knowledge of AWS, threatened (a) union representation
petitions respecting the Alaska System Employees, (b) efforts being made to
organize any of the Alaska System Employees, or (c) strikes, slow downs, work
stoppages, or lockouts or threats affecting the Alaska System Employees. Neither
AWS nor any Affiliate has made any representation, warranty or agreement with
any of its Alaska System Employees or any other employees of AWS concerning
employment with DCS after the Closing. No Alaska System Employee is on
sabbatical leave or has been granted a sabbatical leave that will commence on or
after the date hereof, as defined in AWS's company policies.

     Section 8.11. Alaska System Employee Benefits

     Except as set forth on Schedule 8.11, neither AWS nor any Affiliate
maintains or sponsors any Alaska Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Alaska Benefit Plans" means any material plan, program, policy,
practice, contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for compensation,
severance, termination pay, deferred compensation, performance awards, stock or
stock-related awards, fringe benefits or other employee benefits or remuneration
of any kind, whether written or unwritten or otherwise, funded or unfunded,
including, each "employee benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA (a) which is or has been maintained, contributed to, or required to be
contributed to, by AWS or any ERISA Affiliate, (b) which is for the benefit of
any Alaska System Employee, or (c) for which AWS or any Affiliate has or could
have any liability. Neither AWS nor any Affiliate has any agreement or
obligation, whether formal or informal, to create, enter into or contribute to
any additional Alaska Benefit Plan or to modify or amend any existing Alaska
Benefit Plan, unless such amendment or modification is required by applicable
Law. Each Alaska Benefit Plan has been established and administered in material
compliance with its terms and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and
other applicable Laws. Neither AWS nor any Affiliate has incurred, and there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which DCS, AWS or
any of their respective Affiliates could incur, directly or indirectly, any
liability or expense (except for routine contributions and benefit payments)
under applicable Laws or pursuant to any indemnification or other agreement with
respect to the Alaska Benefit Plans. None of the Alaska Benefit Plans is subject
to Title IV of ERISA (including any multiemployer plan within the meaning of
ERISA Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) or Section 412 of the Code, or any multiple
employer plan within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code). No Alaska Benefit Plan provides, reflects or represents any
Liability to provide retiree health to any person for any reason, except as may
be required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither AWS nor any ERISA
Affiliate has represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written
form) to any Alaska System Employee (either individually or to Alaska System
Employees as a group) or any other person that such Alaska System Employee(s) or
other person would be provided with retiree health, except to the extent
required by statute. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Alaska
Benefit Plan or employment agreement or under any related trust or loan
agreement that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current
or former Alaska System Employee. Each Alaska Benefit Plan that is intended to
be a "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified by issuance and receipt of a favorable
determination letter or reliance upon an opinion letter which states that the
Alaska Benefit Plan meets all requirements under the Code and that any trust(s)
associated with such Alaska Benefit Plan is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of
the Code. There are no claims (other than routine claims for benefits), actions
or lawsuits pending, or to the knowledge of AWS, threatened, with respect to any
Alaska Benefit Plan or the fiduciaries responsible for such Alaska Benefit Plan,
and to the knowledge of AWS, there are no circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any action, lawsuit or claim, on behalf of or against
any of the Alaska Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto.

     Section 8.12. Tax Matters

     Except as set forth on Schedule 8.12, as relates to the Alaska Assets and
the Alaska Business, AWS and its Affiliates have timely filed all Tax returns
and statements which they were required to file, and have paid all Taxes due
prior to the date hereof and will pay when due (or contest in good faith by
appropriate proceedings) all Taxes which may become due on or before the Closing
Date. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.12, neither AWS nor any Affiliate has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to an extension
of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency related to the Alaska
Assets or the Alaska Business. To the knowledge of AWS, there are no unresolved
claims raised by any Tax authority concerning the Tax liability of AWS or an
Affiliate related to the Alaska Assets or the Alaska Business. All Taxes related
to the Alaska Assets and the Alaska Business which AWS or an Affiliate is
required by law to withhold or to collect for payment have been duly withheld
and collected, and have been paid.

     Section 8.13. Financial Statements; Changes

     (a) AWS has delivered to DCS complete and correct copies of (i) the
unaudited financial statements of the Alaska Markets as at and for the periods
ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, each of which include a balance
sheet and related statement of income for the year then ended (the "Alaska
Historical Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited financial statements of
the Alaska Markets at September 30, 2002 (the "Alaska Balance Sheet Date")
including a balance sheet (the "Alaska Balance Sheet") and related statements of
income for the nine (9) month period then ended (collectively, the "Alaska
Interim Financial Statements"). Except as set forth on Schedule 8.13(a), the
Alaska Historical Financial Statements and the Alaska Interim Financial
Statements fairly present in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP, the
financial position of the Alaska Markets and the results of its operations for
the periods specified therein (subject to the absence of footnotes, and, in the
case of the Alaska Interim Financial Statements, to normal year end audit
adjustments).

     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.13(b) or as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, with respect to the Alaska Assets, since the Alaska Balance
Sheet Date, neither AWS nor any Affiliate has:

          (i) sold, assigned, or transferred any of the material, assets,
     properties or rights included in the Alaska Assets (except for the Excluded
     Alaska Assets and except pursuant to existing Contracts relating to the
     Alaska Business disclosed on any Schedule to this Agreement or inventory in
     the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice);

          (ii) entered into any other material transaction primarily relating to
     the Alaska Business other than in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practices;

          (iii) suffered any material damage, destruction or casualty loss with
     respect to the Alaska Assets not covered by insurance;

          (iv) suffered any events which, individually or in the aggregate,
     have, or could be reasonably expected to, materially adversely affect the
     Alaska Assets (as a whole), the Alaska Business (as a whole) or the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

          (v) entered into any agreement or understanding to do any of the
     foregoing.

     Section 8.14. Insurance

     AWS and its Affiliates have maintained all policies of title, liability,
fire, worker's compensation and other forms of insurance (including bonds) that
relate to the Alaska Assets and which insure against risks and Liabilities to an
extent and in a manner customary in the cellular industry. All such insurance
policies and binders are in full force and effect. Neither AWS nor any Affiliate
has received any notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy or
binder. No insurance carrier has canceled or reduced any insurance coverage for
AWS or any Affiliate or has given any notice or other indication of its
intention to cancel or reduce any such coverage. AWS and its Affiliates have
complied in all material respects with each of such insurance policies and
binders, and have not failed to give any notice or present any claim thereunder
in a due and timely manner.

     Section 8.15. Brokers

     AWS has not engaged any agent, broker or other person acting pursuant to
the express or implied authority of AWS which is or may be entitled to a
commission or broker or finder's fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the
Alaska Assets.

     Section 8.16. Environmental Compliance

     (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.16, (i) neither AWS nor any Affiliate
has generated, used, transported, treated, stored, released or disposed of, or
knowingly permitted anyone else to generate, use, transport, treat, store,
release or dispose of any Hazardous Substance at, on or in connection with the
ownership or occupancy of the Alaska Assets in violation of any applicable
Environmental Laws; (ii) there has not been any generation, use, transportation,
treatment, storage, release or disposal of any Hazardous Substance in connection
with AWS's or an Affiliate's ownership, occupancy or use of the Alaska Assets or
on, in or under any property or facility owned or leased by AWS or an Affiliate
and included in the Alaska Assets which has created or might reasonably be
expected to create any Liability under any applicable Environmental Laws; (iii)
any Hazardous Substance handled or dealt with by AWS or an Affiliate at, on or
in connection with the ownership or occupancy of the Alaska Assets has been and
is being handled or dealt with in material compliance with all Environmental
Laws; (iv) to the knowledge of AWS, the operation of the Alaska Business by AWS
and its Affiliates is in compliance with all Environmental Laws; and (v) to the
knowledge of AWS, there are no claims against AWS or any Affiliate by third
parties, including Governmental Authorities, pending or threatened under
Environmental Laws arising out of AWS's or any Affiliate's ownership or use of
the Alaska Assets or the condition of the Alaska Assets.

     (b) AWS has delivered to DCS true and complete copies of all transaction
screens (to the extent any transaction screens were performed) and Phase I
environmental site assessment reports (as such terms are commonly understood in
the industry) that AWS has on file with respect to the Alaska Assets. DCS
acknowledges that it is not entitled to rely on such reports (since the
consultants did not prepare them for the benefit of DCS).

     Section 8.17. Accounts Receivable

     All accounts receivable of AWS and any Affiliate relating to the Alaska
Business as set forth on the Alaska Balance Sheet are or will be valid and
genuine, have arisen or will arise solely out of bona fide sales and deliveries
of goods, performance of services and other business transactions in the
ordinary course of the Alaska Business consistent with past practices, and the
allowance for collection losses on such balance sheets have been or will be
determined in accordance with GAAP and based upon AWS's historical experience in
collecting its accounts receivable. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of AWS, there are no facts or circumstances that will, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in the allowances for collection losses on the
Alaska Balance Sheet being inadequate to cover expected collection losses.

     Section 8.18. Solvency

     AWS is Solvent.

     Section 8.19. Valid Transaction

     Any transfer made by AWS or any Affiliate of any right, title or interest
in or to the Alaska Assets does not constitute a fraudulent conveyance under any
applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) such
transfer is being made for a valid business purpose and (b) such transfer is
being made for fair consideration. Neither AWS nor any of its Affiliates has
taken any action with the intent to hinder or delay payment to any creditors of
AWS or its Affiliates.

     Section 8.20. Undisclosed Liabilities

     Neither AWS nor any Affiliate has any Liabilities arising out of or
relating to the Alaska System or any of the Alaska Assets, except as and to the
extent reflected or reserved for in the Alaska Interim Financial Statements and
except (i) as set forth in Schedule 8.20, (ii) for Liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the Alaska
Balance Sheet Date and in each case to the extent permitted to be incurred in
accordance with the terms hereof, (iii) for executory obligations under any
Assumed Alaska Contract, and (iv) for those that are not required to be
disclosed under GAAP.

     Section 8.21. AWS Cell Sites

     Schedule 8.21 lists each cell site (including each cell site on which AWS
or an Affiliate has placed one or more antennas and the number of antennas
placed on such cell site) (an "AWS Cell Site") currently operated or used by
each of AWS or an Affiliate in respect of the Alaska System as of the date
hereof, indicating the address of such Cell Site and the geographical
coordinates thereof, whether AWS or such Affiliate is the owner of such Cell
Site and, if so, whether any other person is permitted to co-locate towers or
antennas thereon or has any other rights with respect thereto. Schedule 8.21
also sets forth (i) each instance where AWS or an Affiliate co-locates its
antennas relating to the Alaska System on another person's tower or antenna
structure and (ii) whether any antenna structure on which AWS or an Affiliate
locates antennas is one which requires registration with the FCC under 47 C.F.R.
17.4 by reason of the obligation to file notification with the FAA under 47
C.F.R. 17.7 and, if so, the Antenna Structure Registration Number thereof.

     Section 8.22. CALEA

     Except as set forth in Schedule 8.22, there has been validly and timely
filed a Flexible Deployment Submission with the FBI in accordance with the FBI's
Flexible Deployment Assistance Guide with respect to the Alaska Systems, and a
Petition for Extension with the FCC requesting an extension of the current CALEA
capability compliance deadline with respect to the Alaska Systems until November
19, 2003.

     Section 8.23. Subscriber Agreements

     Each subscriber agreement with a customer of the Alaska Business provides
either (a) that AWS (or its successor, including, following the Closing, DCS)
may increase the rates for service upon 30 days' notice to the customer, in
which event the customer may without penalty terminate the agreement, or (b)
that AWS may without penalty terminate the subscriber agreement upon 30 days'
notice.

     Section 8.24. Inventory

     The inventory included in the Alaska Assets as of the dates set forth on
Schedule 8.24, together with the locations thereof, are set forth in Schedule
8.24. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.24, such inventory is of good, usable
and merchantable quality in all material respects and does not include items
which, in the ordinary course of the Alaska Business, have been discontinued or
are off-specification, damaged, dormant, obsolete, non-salable, non-usable or
not first quality; provided, that AWS is not representing hereby that such
inventory would not, in the ordinary course of DCS's business, be discontinued
or be considered off-specification, damaged, dormant, obsolete, non-salable,
non-usable or not first quality. All of the mobile phones included in inventory
are pre-programmed to search for the SOC of AWS on a preferred or exclusive
basis and any pre-programming contained in such phones (other than to search for
the SOC of AWS) may be eliminated without incurring additional costs, in an
immaterial amount of time and without affecting the utility or marketability of
such phones.

     Section 9.1. Financial Statements and System Information

     (a) DCS covenants and agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing,
DCS shall provide AWS, promptly after they become available and in any event
within 45 days of the end of each calendar month, the unaudited balance sheet,
statement of income (including detailed revenue classifications), as well as key
operating statistics, including gross subscriber additions, disconnects and

California Business conducted in each of the California Markets. Immediately
prior to Closing, DCS will identify in writing the owner of the California
Assets by item or, if appropriate, by category.

     (b) AWS covenants and agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing,
AWS shall provide DCS, promptly after they become available and in any event
within 45 days of the end of each calendar month, the unaudited balance sheet,
statement of income (including detailed revenue classifications), as well as key
operating statistics, including gross subscriber additions, disconnects and
end-of-period number of subscribers for such month, as they relate to the Alaska
Business conducted in each of the Alaska Markets. Immediately prior to Closing,
AWS will identify in writing the owner of the Alaska Assets by item or, if
appropriate, by category.

     Section 9.2. FCC Approvals

     (a) Each of DCS and AWS covenants and agrees that it will fully cooperate
with the other, and do all things reasonably necessary to assist the other to
obtain all consents and approvals and to file all notices necessary for
assignment to DCS of the Alaska FCC Authorizations and applications therefor
that are included in the Alaska Assets, and to AWS of the California FCC
Authorizations and applications therefor that are included in the California
Assets, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including the furnishing
of financial and other information specifically with respect to DCS or AWS, as
the case may be, reasonably required by the person whose consent or approval is
being sought. Each party (the "Notifying Party") shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to provide adequate prior written notice to the other (the
"Notified Party") of any meeting with Governmental Authorities the purpose of
which is to seek a consent or approval to the transactions contemplated hereby
or resulting from any notice being filed, and the Notified Party shall have the
right to attend all such meetings with appropriate Governmental Authorities for
the purpose of obtaining such consents or approvals and responding to issues
resulting from the filing of a notice. Each of DCS and AWS hereby agrees to file
the necessary applications and other filings with the FCC seeking consent to the
assignment of the Alaska FCC Authorizations to DCS and of the California FCC
Authorizations to AWS, and to file for all other necessary regulatory approvals
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, within
15 business days following the date hereof to the extent any such filings have
not been made prior to the date hereof, or as soon as practicable after the
filing by the parties hereto of any notifications of pro forma transfers of
control required in connection with the implementation of the provisions of
Section 1.1, and to diligently pursue the processing of any such applications
and filings before the FCC and other applicable Governmental Authorities.
Neither party shall take any action or fail to take any action if such act or
omission is likely to cause a delay in, or the FCC not to grant its consent to,
the assignment of the FCC Authorizations contemplated hereby, it being
understood that if any petition to deny is filed against the transfer of the
California FCC Authorizations or the Alaska FCC Authorizations principally by
reason of the qualifications of only one of the parties to this transaction,
then it shall be the primary responsibility of such party to defend against any
allegations in such petition. DCS and AWS shall each pay their own filing fees
in connection with any filings pursuant to this Section 9.2(a).

     (b) DCS and AWS shall each cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and file with the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the
United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and other regulatory authorities as
promptly as possible after the date on which the condition set forth in Section
10.11 is satisfied or waived, but in any event within 10 business days following
such date, all requisite applications and amendments thereto together with
related information, data and exhibits necessary to satisfy the requirements of
the HSR Act (if applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
DCS and AWS shall each pay their own filing fees in connection with any filings
pursuant to this Section 9.2(b).

     Section 9.3. Third Party Consents; Closing Conditions

cooperate with each other, and will do all things reasonably necessary to assist
the other, to obtain all Required Alaska Consents and Required California
Consents, as the case may be, and give all Required Alaska Notices and Required
California Notices, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable, including
the furnishing of financial and other information specifically with respect to
it or its Affiliates reasonably required by the person or Governmental Authority
whose consent or approval is being sought.

     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, to the extent
that any Assumed Alaska Contract to be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed
to DCS, or any Assumed California Contract to be sold, assigned, transferred or
conveyed to AWS, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, is not capable of being sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed
without the approval, consent or waiver of the issuer thereof, the other party
thereto, or any third person (including a Governmental Authority), and such
approval, consent or waiver has not been obtained, or if such sale, assignment,
transfer or conveyance, or attempted assignment, transfer or conveyance, of such
Assumed Alaska Contract or Assumed California Contract, as the case may be,
would constitute a breach thereof, and such approval, consent or waiver has not
been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign,
transfer or convey such Assumed Alaska Contract or Assumed California Contract,
as the case may be; provided each of DCS and AWS shall comply with Section 18.1.

     (c) DCS and AWS shall use reasonable best efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, DCS and AWS shall cause their respective Affiliates to take the
actions contemplated to be taken by them pursuant to this Agreement.

transfer of the Alaska FCC Authorizations and the California FCC Authorizations,
and the approvals required under the HSR Act, and (ii) issue the Required Alaska
Notices and the Required California Notices.

     (f) DCS and AWS hereby covenant and agree that neither of them will, and
that each of them will cause their respective Affiliates not to, accept or agree
to any modifications or amendments to, or the imposition of any condition to the
transfer of, any of the Assumed Alaska Contracts or Assumed California
Contracts, or (except in the ordinary course of business in compliance with
applicable FCC Laws) any of the FCC Authorizations included in any of the Alaska
Assets or the California Assets, that are not acceptable to the other party
hereto.

     Section 9.4. Conduct of Business

     (a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, neither DCS nor
AWS shall (and each of DCS and AWS will cause their respective Affiliates not
to) engage in any practice, take any action or enter into any transaction
outside the ordinary course of business with respect to the California Business
and Alaska Business, as appropriate, without the prior approval of the other
party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall
continue to operate the California Business or the Alaska Business, as the case
may be, in the ordinary course consistent with past practices.

     Section 9.6. Alaska System Employees

     (a) Schedule 9.6 contains a list of all persons employed by AWS in the
operation of the Alaska Systems and physically located in the Alaska Markets to
whom DCS will be obligated to offer employment in accordance with the terms of
this Section 9.6 (the "Alaska Designated Employees"). Each Alaska Designated
Employee who is actively employed by AWS as of the Closing Date will receive an
offer of employment from DCS as of the Closing Date upon the terms and
conditions described herein. Any Alaska Designated Employee who is not actively
at work as of the Closing Date (deemed "Alaska Inactive Employees") shall not
receive an offer of employment from DCS, nor be deemed to be an Alaska
Transitioned Employee (defined below) unless he or she returns to active service
within 90 days of the Closing Date and notifies DCS in writing thereof. DCS
shall promptly offer such Alaska Inactive Employee employment following receipt
of such notice on substantially the same terms and conditions as similarly
situated Alaska Transitioned Employees as of the date that such Alaska Inactive
Employee becomes an Alaska Transitioned Employee, the start-date of such Alaska
Inactive Employee (assuming he or she accepts DCS's offer) to be specified by
DCS in its discretion, provided, that in no event shall it be later than the
expiration of such 90-day period. Each Alaska Inactive Employee shall remain
employed by AWS during such 90-day period following the Closing Date unless and
until such Alaska Inactive Employee becomes an Alaska Transitioned Employee in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.6(a). For purposes of this
Agreement, all Alaska Designated Employees who accept DCS's offer of employment
and become employed by DCS as of the Closing Date and all Alaska Inactive
Employees who subsequently become employed by DCS within the 90-day period
referred to above are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Alaska
Transitioned Employees." Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement limits the rights of DCS to eliminate an employee's position for any
reason following the Closing Date.

     (b) The participation of each Alaska Transitioned Employee in the Alaska
Benefit Plans and programs will terminate effective upon the Closing Date or
such later date on which an Alaska Inactive Employee becomes employed by DCS,
except with respect to compensation and benefits that remain payable or due
under the terms of such Alaska Benefit Plans and programs or benefits and other
employment related rights to which Alaska Inactive Employees are entitled while
receiving benefits pursuant to AWS's short term disability plan, or except as
otherwise required by Law or such Alaska Benefit Plans or programs. Nothing in
this Agreement creates or is intended to create any rights in third parties or
third party beneficiaries, including any rights to be employed or respecting the
terms and duration of employment.

     (c) DCS shall be responsible for any and all salaries, wages, benefits and
other compensation or payments payable to each Alaska Transitioned Employee for
services rendered to DCS after the Closing Date or such later date as an Alaska
Inactive Employee becomes an Alaska Transitioned Employee, on such terms and
conditions as DCS may, in its sole discretion, unilaterally implement.

     (d) AWS shall remain responsible for any Alaska Inactive Employees who do
not become Alaska Transitioned Employees as provided above for all purposes,
including but not limited to, compensation and benefits.

     (e) Each Alaska Transitioned Employee shall be employed on terms and
conditions, including, but not limited to, wages or salaries and benefits, which
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the terms and conditions offered
by DCS to similarly situated employees of DCS. From and after the Closing Date,
each Alaska Transitioned Employee shall be eligible to participate in the
employee benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements maintained by DCS
in which similarly situated employees of DCS are generally eligible to
participate, based on the eligibility criteria of each plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. On and after the Closing Date, DCS shall cause each such plan,
program, agreement and arrangement to treat all service with AWS prior to the
Closing Date as service for DCS for purposes of eligibility to participate,
waiting periods, vacation or paid time off accrual level, limitations as to
preexisting medical conditions but not for benefit accrual or contribution
purposes under any pension plan, profit sharing plan, savings plan or other
deferred compensation plan maintained by DCS or for purposes of eligibility for
any retiree health, life or other retiree welfare benefit plan maintained by
DCS. With respect to worker's compensation benefits, AWS accepts continuing
responsibility after the Closing Date for payment of all benefits to or on
behalf of workers for (a) claims accepted or in process on or prior to the
Closing Date, and (b) claims related to industrial injuries or occupational
diseases for which a right to file for worker's compensation benefits existed or
accrued on or prior to the Closing Date.

     (f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to restrict DCS from
operating its existing employee benefit plans, including full authority to amend
or terminate such plans in accordance with their respective terms and applicable
laws.

     (g) AWS agrees to provide or cause to be provided to DCS all such records
and information as DCS may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent
of, and to meet DCS's obligations under this Section 9.6.

     (h) Prior to Closing, AWS shall cash out all accrued, unused vacation hours
of Alaska Transitioned Employees as of the Closing Date.

     (i) AWS shall remain solely responsible for any and all liabilities
relating to or arising in connection with the requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code, to provide continuation of health care coverage in respect of Alaska
Transitioned Employees and their covered dependents due to coverage under the
Alaska Benefit Plans, including with respect to qualifying events that occur as
a result of their termination of employment with AWS or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof.

     (j) On or before the date required by applicable Law, AWS shall contribute
to the accounts of the Alaska Transitioned Employees under each Alaska Benefit
Plan all amounts required by such Alaska Benefit Plan or applicable Laws to be
contributed with respect to such Alaska Transitioned Employee on account of any
period prior to Closing.

     (k) AWS and DCS will treat DCS as a "successor employer" and AWS or the
applicable Affiliate thereof as a "predecessor," within the meaning of Sections
3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to Alaska Transitioned
Employees for purposes of taxes imposed under the United States Federal
Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act.

     (l) AWS shall comply and cause compliance with the provisions of the WARN
Act and any other federal, state, or local Laws regarding "plant closings,"
"mass layoffs" (or similar triggering event), or change of control, as they
relate to the Transactions. AWS further covenants to comply and cause compliance
with any notice obligations under any applicable state unemployment insurance
Law with respect to employees whose employment has been terminated by AWS or an
Affiliate of AWS.

     Section 9.7. California System Employees

     (a) Schedule 9.7 contains a list of all persons employed by DCS in the
operation of the California Systems and physically located in the California
Markets to whom AWS will be obligated to offer employment in accordance with the
terms of this Section 9.7 (the "California Designated Employees"). Each
California Designated Employee who is actively employed by DCS as of the Closing
Date will receive an offer of employment from AWS as of the Closing Date upon
the terms and conditions described herein. Any California Designated Employee
who is not actively at work as of the Closing Date (deemed "California Inactive
Employees") shall not receive an offer of employment from AWS, nor be deemed to
be a California Transitioned Employee (defined below), unless he or she returns
to active service within 90 days of the Closing Date and notifies AWS in writing
thereof. AWS shall promptly offer such California Inactive Employee employment
following receipt of such notice on substantially the same terms and conditions
as similarly situated California Transitioned Employees as of the date that such
California Inactive Employee becomes a California Transitioned Employee, the
start-date of such California Inactive Employee (assuming he or she accepts
AWS's offer) to be specified by AWS in its discretion, provided, that in no
event shall it be later than the expiration of such 90-day period. Each
California Inactive Employee shall remain employed by DCS during such 90-day
period following the Closing Date unless and until such Alaska Inactive Employee
becomes a California Transitioned Employee in accordance with the terms of this
Section 9.7(a). For purposes of this Agreement, all California Designated
Employees who accept AWS's offer of employment and become employed by AWS as of
the Closing Date and all California Inactive Employees who subsequently become
employed by AWS within the 90-day period referred to above, are hereafter
collectively referred to as the "California Transitioned Employees."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement limits the rights of
AWS to eliminate an employee's position for any reason following the Closing
Date.

     (b) The participation of each California Transitioned Employee in the
California Benefit Plans and programs will terminate effective upon the Closing
Date or such later date on which a California Inactive Employee becomes employed
by AWS, except with respect to compensation and benefits that remain payable or
due under the terms of such California Benefit Plans and programs or benefits
and other employment related rights to which California Inactive Employees are
entitled while receiving benefits pursuant to DCS's short term disability plan,
or except as otherwise required by Law or such California Benefit Plans or
programs. Nothing in this Agreement creates or is intended to create any rights
in third parties or third party beneficiaries, including any rights to be
employed or respecting the terms and duration of employment.

     (c) AWS shall be responsible for any and all salaries, wages, benefits and
other compensation or payments payable to each California Transitioned Employee
for services rendered to AWS after the Closing Date or such later date as a
California Inactive Employee becomes a California Transitioned Employee, on such
terms and conditions as AWS may, in its sole discretion, unilaterally implement.

     (d) DCS shall remain responsible for any California Inactive Employees who
do not become California Transitioned Employees as provided above for all
purposes, including but not limited to, compensation and benefits.

     (e) Each California Transitioned Employee shall be employed on terms and
conditions, including, but not limited to, wages or salaries and benefits, which
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the terms and conditions offered
by AWS to similarly situated employees of AWS. From and after the Closing Date,
each California Transitioned Employee shall be eligible to participate in the
employee benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements maintained by AWS
in which similarly situated employees of AWS are generally eligible to
participate, based on the eligibility criteria of each plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. On and after the Closing Date, AWS shall cause each such plan,
program, agreement and arrangement to treat all service with DCS prior to the
Closing Date as service for AWS for purposes of eligibility to participate,
waiting periods, vacation or paid time off accrual level, limitations as to
preexisting medical conditions but not for benefit accrual or contribution
purposes under any pension plan, profit sharing plan, savings plan or other
deferred compensation plan maintained by AWS or for purposes of eligibility for
any retiree health, life or other retiree welfare benefit plan maintained by
AWS. With respect to worker's compensation benefits, DCS accepts continuing
responsibility after the Closing Date for payment of all benefits to or on
behalf of workers for (a) claims accepted or in process on or prior to the
Closing Date, and (b) claims related to industrial injuries or occupational
diseases for which a right to file for worker's compensation benefits existed or
accrued on or prior to the Closing Date.

     (f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to restrict AWS from
operating its existing employee benefit plans, including full authority to amend
or terminate such plans in accordance with their respective terms and applicable
laws.

     (g) DCS agrees to provide or cause to be provided to AWS all such records
and information as AWS may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent
of, and to meet AWS's obligations under this Section 9.7.

     (h) Prior to Closing, DCS shall cash out all accrued, unused vacation hours
of California Transitioned Employees as of the Closing Date.

     (i) DCS shall remain solely responsible for any and all liabilities
relating to or arising in connection with the requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code, to provide continuation of health care coverage in respect of
California Transitioned Employees and their covered dependents due to coverage
under the California Benefit Plans, including with respect to qualifying events
that occur as a result of their termination of employment with DCS or any ERISA
Affiliate thereof.

     (j) On or before the date required by applicable Law, DCS shall contribute
to the accounts of the California Transitioned Employees under each California
Benefit Plan all amounts required by such California Benefit Plan or applicable
Laws to be contributed with respect to such California Transitioned Employee on
account of any period prior to Closing.

     (k) DCS and AWS will treat AWS as a "successor employer" and DCS or the
applicable Affiliate thereof as a "predecessor," within the meaning of Sections
3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to California Transitioned
Employees for purposes of taxes imposed under the United States Federal
Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act.

     (l) DCS shall comply and cause compliance with the provisions of the WARN
Act and any other federal, state, or local Laws regarding "plant closings,"
"mass layoffs" (or similar triggering event), or change of control, as they
relate to the Transactions. DCS further covenants to comply and cause compliance
with any notice obligations under any applicable state unemployment insurance
Law with respect to employees whose employment has been terminated by DCS or an
Affiliate of DCS.

     Section 9.8. No Shop

     (a) Prior to the Closing, AWS shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not
to), directly or indirectly, sell, agree to sell, solicit inquiries or proposals
or furnish any information with respect to, or initiate or participate in any
negotiations or discussions whatsoever concerning any acquisition or purchase
of, (i) any or all of the Alaska Assets outside of the ordinary course of the
Alaska Business, and (ii) the DCC Securities. AWS shall cause its and its
Affiliates' officers, employees, agents and representatives to refrain from
doing any of the above.

     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, AWS or an
Affiliate may, directly or indirectly, sell, agree to sell, solicit inquiries or
proposals or furnish any information with respect to, or initiate or participate
in any negotiations or discussions whatsoever concerning any acquisition or
purchase of, any or all of the Alaska Assets pursuant to a transaction in which
(x) such Alaska Assets constitute an immaterial or incidental portion of the
assets being sold, assigned or otherwise disposed of, and (y) the person
acquiring the Alaska Assets (whether by operation of law or otherwise) agrees in
writing and is obligated to consummate or cause the consummation of the
Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof, without delay or impairment to
the Transactions.

     (c) Except as contemplated by Section 1.1, prior to the Closing, DCS shall
not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, sell, agree
to sell, solicit inquiries or proposals or furnish any information with respect
to, or initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions whatsoever
concerning any acquisition or purchase of, any or all of the California Assets
outside of the ordinary course of the California Business. DCS shall cause its
and its Affiliates' officers, employees, agents and representatives to refrain
from doing any of the above.

     (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) above, DCS or an
Affiliate may, directly or indirectly, sell, agree to sell, solicit inquiries or
proposals or furnish any information with respect to, or initiate or participate
in any negotiations or discussions whatsoever concerning any acquisition or
purchase of, any or all of the California Assets pursuant to a transaction in
which (x) such California Assets constitute an immaterial or incidental portion
of the assets being sold, assigned or otherwise disposed of, and (y) the person
acquiring the California Assets (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
agrees in writing and is obligated to consummate or cause the consummation of
the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof, without delay or
impairment to the Transactions.

     Section 9.9. Post-Closing Non-Compete

     (a) During the Non-Compete Period, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 9.9, AWS will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, either alone or jointly with any other person, acquire or hold an
ownership interest in (other than an ownership interest in an Exempt Person),
manage, operate, control or otherwise engage in a business that provides or
resells, or a license that enables the provision or resale of, facilities-based
mobile wireless telecommunications services using spectrum in the 824-849 MHz,
869-894 MHz or 1850-1990 MHz frequency bands, in the State of Alaska (the
services described in this sentence being referred to herein as the "Competitive
Services"). In addition, during the Non-Compete Period, AWS will not grant any
person the right to market Competitive Services (on a primary basis, tagline
basis or otherwise) under the "AT&T Wireless" brand or any successor brand used
by AWS or its Affiliates on a national basis. Competitive Services shall not
include roaming services provided to customers of any person other than AWS and
its Affiliates roaming in the State of Alaska (whether or not such person has
the right to use the "AT&T Wireless" brand or any successor brand used by AWS or
its Affiliates on a national basis). "Non-Compete Period" means (i) with respect
to Competitive Services using the TDMA protocol, the period beginning on the
Closing Date and expiring on February 25, 2007 and (ii) with respect to
Competitive Services using the GSM/GPRS or EDGE protocols, or using spectrum in
the 824-849 MHz, 869-894 MHz or 1850-1990 MHz frequency bands, the period
beginning on the Closing Date and expiring on the fifth anniversary thereof.
"Exempt Person" means any person that (x) is not an Affiliate of AWS, (y) to
which AWS and its Affiliates do not direct their roaming traffic (in respect of
Competitive Services) on a priority basis with respect to DCS and (z) does not
market Competitive Services (on a primary basis, tagline basis or otherwise)
under the "AT&T Wireless" brand or any successor brand used by AWS or its
Affiliates on a national basis. DCS's agreement to enter into the GSM Build-Out
Agreement (Alaska) and the GSM Roaming Agreement (Alaska) at Closing is a
material inducement to AWS's agreement to the restrictions set forth in this
Section 9.9. Accordingly, AWS's obligations in this Section 9.9 relating to
Competitive Services using any protocol other than TDMA shall terminate upon any
early termination (prior to the stated expiration of the initial term or any
renewal term) of the GSM Build-Out Agreement (Alaska) or the GSM Roaming
Agreement (Alaska), or any successor agreements, other than a termination by DCS
resulting from a breach thereof by AWS. Furthermore, if AWS and its Affiliates
intend to offer Competitive Services that are based on a protocol that AWS uses
or will use on a nationwide basis in the same time frame as in the State of
Alaska using spectrum in the 824-849 MHz, 869-894 MHz or 1850-1990 MHz frequency
bands, AWS shall notify DCS of such intention, and if DCS demonstrates a good
faith intention to provide such Competitive Services (other than Competitive
Services using the TDMA or GSM/GPRS protocols) in the State of Alaska within a
reasonable period of time thereafter, then, for so long as DCS continues to take
reasonable measures to provide such Competitive Services, AWS and its Affiliates
will refrain, until the expiration of the applicable Non-Compete Period, from
providing such Competitive Services in the State of Alaska.

     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, AWS and its
Affiliates may enter into a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other
similar business combination transaction with a third party (any such
transaction being referred to herein as a "Competitive Transaction") that
results in AWS or any such Affiliates owning, managing, operating or controlling
systems providing Competitive Services that are then operating commercially in
the State of Alaska (any such systems, but only the portion thereof operating in
the State of Alaska, being referred to herein as the "Competitive Systems"), but
subject to the further provisions of this Section 9.9. Upon the execution of
definitive agreements relating to a Competitive Transaction, AWS will notify DCS
thereof and, if DCS so requests, AWS and DCS will discuss the sale of the
Competitive Systems to DCS at their Fair Market Value (as defined below) as of
the date that AWS and DCS agree in principle to such a sale. If AWS and DCS do
not agree in principle to such a sale within 30 days after the commencement of
such discussions, then AWS will be free to sell or otherwise dispose of the
Competitive Systems to a third party, provided, that for a period of 90 days
after the commencement of such discussions, any such third party sale must be on
terms no less favorable than those discussed with DCS.

     (c) During the period from the date of the closing of the applicable
Competitive Transaction to the expiration of the applicable Non-Compete Period
or, if earlier, the consummation of a sale or other disposition of such
Competitive Systems (if any) in accordance with paragraph (b) above, AWS will
either:

          (i) cause substantially all its subscribers (other than subscribers of
     the Competitive Systems and subscribers acquired by AWS or its Affiliates
     as a result of the Competitive Transaction), for purposes of the GSM
     Roaming Agreement (Alaska) and the Operating Agreement (as defined in
     Section 18.18), to seek service from DCS in those portions of the Alaska
     Markets (if any) served by the Competitive Systems before seeking service
     from the Competitive Systems; or

          (ii) if and to the extent either AWS or DCS or any of their respective
     Affiliates has, and is using in the ordinary course of its business, the
     technological capability to identify its own intra-company roaming traffic
     (provided that to the extent DCS or an Affiliate has such capability and
     AWS does not have such capability, DCS will provide the relevant technology
     to AWS, at no cost to AWS, if AWS elects to make reimbursement payments
     pursuant to this clause (ii)), then AWS shall (once the technology is
     installed and tested) pay DCS on a monthly basis an amount equal to the
     actual monthly roaming revenue (net of production costs) generated by
     subscribers of AWS's non-Alaska markets roaming on the Competitive Systems;
     provided that, until the foregoing technology has been installed and
     tested, or if no such technology is available in accordance with the
     foregoing terms, then AWS will pay DCS on a monthly basis an amount equal
     to DCS's average monthly roaming revenue (net of production costs)
     generated by AWS's subscribers roaming in the Alaska Markets during the
     period from the Closing Date to the date of closing of the Competitive
     Transaction.

     (d) In addition to complying with clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (c) above
(the election (which shall be a one-time election for each Competitive
Transaction) between such alternatives to be made by AWS in its sole discretion
at the time of closing of such Competitive Transaction), if (at the date of the
closing of the Competitive Transaction) the Fair Market Value of the Competitive
Systems (determined by an independent appraiser selected by AWS and DCS or, if
they cannot agree, appointed by the American Arbitration Association at the
request of either party) is greater than ten percent of the Fair Market Value of
the assets, properties and rights transferred in the Competitive Transaction (as
determined by AWS in its reasonable judgment), AWS will not operate the
Competitive Systems under the "AT&T Wireless" brand or any successor brand used
by AWS or its Affiliates on a national basis.

     (e) "Fair Market Value" means, with respect to any asset, as of the date of
determination, the cash price at which a willing seller would sell and a willing
buyer would buy such asset in a transaction negotiated at arm's length, each
being apprised of and considering all relevant facts, circumstances and factors,
and neither acting under compulsion, with the parties being unaffiliated third
parties acting without time constraints.

     (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, AWS
shall have the right to terminate this Section 9.9 with respect to Competitive
Services using the GSM/GPRS protocol in the event of a material breach by DCS of
either the GSM Buildout Agreement (Alaska) or the GSM Roaming Agreement (Alaska)
that is not cured within the applicable cure period.

     (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, DCS
shall not be entitled to injunctive relief with respect to that portion of any
proposed Competitive Transaction, or any other provisions of paragraph (b)
above, that relate to service areas located outside the Alaska Markets, and
DCS's only remedy in respect of such provisions or portion of the proposed
Competitive Transaction shall be to seek monetary damages from AWS. To the
extent that any proposed Competitive Transaction or other provisions of
paragraph (b) above relate to service areas located within the Alaska Markets,
DCS shall be entitled to injunctive relief with respect to such provisions or
portion of the proposed Competitive Transaction.

     Section 9.10. Personal Computers

     (a) Within ten business days after the Closing Date, DCS shall have the
right to uninstall and/or remove from the personal computers that are California
Assets any proprietary software owned by DCS and other files not constituting
California Assets; provided that such uninstallation or removal shall take place
at mutually convenient times, and with mutually convenient processes, for AWS
and DCS within such ten-business day period.

     (b) Within ten business days after the Closing Date, AWS shall have the
right to uninstall and/or remove from the personal computers that are Alaska
Assets any proprietary software owned by AWS and other files not constituting
Alaska Assets; provided that such uninstallation or removal shall take place at
mutually convenient times, and with mutually convenient processes, for AWS and
DCS within such ten-business day period.

     Section 9.11. Contracts Held by Affiliates

     (a) All of the Contracts set forth in Schedule 7.5(a) that relate primarily
to the California Business and that are held by an Affiliate of DCS shall be
assigned to DCS prior to the Closing, and DCS shall obtain all consents and give
all notices necessary to do so and shall furnish copies of such consents and
notices to AWS. Any agreements described in Section 7.5(a)(v) and listed on
Schedule 7.5(a), including the DCS Affiliate Leases, shall have been terminated
pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to AWS.

     (b) All of the Contracts set forth in Schedule 8.5(a) that relate primarily
to the Alaska Business and that are held by an Affiliate of AWS shall be
assigned to AWS prior to the Closing, and AWS shall obtain all consents and give
all notices necessary to do so and shall furnish copies of such consents and
notices to DCS. Any agreements described in Section 8.5(a)(v) and listed on
Schedule 8.5(a), including the AWS Affiliate Leases, shall have been terminated
pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to DCS.

     Section 9.12. Negative Covenants

     With respect to the California Business and the Alaska Business, during the
period from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement and except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,

take any of the following actions without the prior written consent of the other
party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld:

     (a) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding involving
payments, assets, or Liabilities with a value in excess of $100,000 in the
aggregate, or materially alter, amend, or modify or terminate, or exercise any

     (b) except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

     (f) with the exception of any changes required by Law or affecting all or
substantially all of the wireless systems owned by DCS or AWS nation-wide,
implement any material change in (i) the terms and conditions of any agreements
with subscribers or (ii) the types or quality of products and services provided
to subscribers;

     (g) add any new pre-paid subscribers;

     (h) except as required by Law, enter into any collective bargaining

or imposed upon the Transactions, other than income taxes and franchise taxes
for periods up to and including the Closing Date, whether imposed on DCS (or its
Affiliates) or AWS (or its Affiliates), shall be paid one-half by DCS and
one-half by AWS.

     Section 9.14. FCC Compliance

     (a) With regard to any non-compliance with FCC Laws set forth on Schedules
7.6(b)(i) and (ii), DCS agrees to remediate and bring into material compliance

("DCCLP") in the letter agreement of even date herewith between DCCLP and AWS
(the "DCCLP Letter Agreement"), shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of each of the date hereof and the Closing Date (unless such
representation or warranty is made as of a particular date in which case such
representation or warranty will be considered only as of such particular date),
provided, however, that for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties, such representations and warranties that are
qualified by materiality qualifications shall be true and correct in all
respects the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date. DCS shall have

     Section 10.3. Third Party Consents; FCC; HSR Act

     DCS shall have received all Required California Consents with respect to
all mobile telephone switching office leases, retail store leases, cell site
leases (other than those for which AWS is the lessor) and debt instruments of
DCS or DCC, and shall have delivered to AWS copies thereof. DCS shall have given

as applicable, of the action is pending, no such stay is in effect, and, if any
deadline for filing any such request is designated by statute or regulation,

in Exhibit E as to the validity under Oklahoma law of the transfer of the DCC
Securities contemplated by Section 1.2(c) and other Oklahoma law matters shall
be given by Pate, Kempf & Knarr and/or other Oklahoma counsel to DCS reasonably
acceptable to AWS.

     Section 10.6. No Threatened or Pending Litigation

     On the Closing Date, no suit, action or other proceeding, or injunction or

other relief in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction
Documents, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or

                                   ARTICLE 13
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 13.1. Indemnification by DCS

     Notwithstanding the Closing, subject to the terms of this Article 13, DCS
agrees to indemnify and to hold AWS and its Affiliates, and their respective
shareholders, officers, directors and employees (the "AWS Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against and in respect of any Liability, action, suit, demand,
judgment, cost of investigation and reasonable attorney fees (but excluding the
Assumed California Liabilities and any exemplary, consequential or punitive
damages) (collectively, "AWS Losses"), sustained, incurred or paid by any AWS
Indemnified Party in connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly
or indirectly: (a) any breach of a representation or warranty on the part of DCS
under this Agreement or on the part of DCC under the DCC Letter Agreement or on
the part of DCCLP under the DCCLP Letter Agreement, (b) any breach or
nonfulfillment of any covenant on the part of DCS under this Agreement, (c) any

Business for the period prior to the Closing, or (f) any and all Taxes that are
(i) obligations of DCS or an Affiliate or (ii) Pre-closing Taxes (as defined
below) that arise out of the California Business or California Assets (including
any such Taxes which become Liabilities of AWS as a transferee of the California
Business or the California Assets).

     Section 13.2. Indemnification by AWS

     Notwithstanding the Closing, subject to the terms of this Article 13, AWS
agrees to indemnify and to hold DCS and its Affiliates, and their respective
shareholders, officers, directors and employees (the "DCS Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against and in respect of any Liability, action, suit, demand,
judgment, cost of investigation and reasonable attorney fees (but excluding the
Assumed Alaska Liabilities and any exemplary, consequential or punitive damages)
(collectively, "DCS Losses"), sustained, incurred or paid by any DCS Indemnified
Party in connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly or
indirectly: (a) any breach of a representation or warranty on the part of AWS
under this Agreement, (b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant on the
part of AWS under this Agreement, (c) any Excluded Alaska Liability, (d) any
Excluded Alaska Asset, (e) AWS's ownership, operation or control of the Alaska
Assets or the Alaska Business for the period prior to the Closing, or (f) any
and all Taxes that are (i) obligations of AWS or an Affiliate or (ii)
Pre-closing Taxes that arise out of the Alaska Business or Alaska Assets
(including any such Taxes which become Liabilities of DCS as a transferee of the
Alaska Business or the Alaska Assets).

     Section 13.3. Notice and Defense of Claims

     (a) A party claiming indemnification under this Article 13 (the "Asserting
Party") must promptly notify (in writing and in reasonable detail) the party
from which indemnification is sought (the "Defending Party") of the nature and
basis of such claim for indemnification not later than the end of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 13.6. If such claim relates to a claim,
suit, litigation or other action by a third party against the Asserting Party or
any Liability to a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Defending Party may
elect to assume such Liability and control the defense of the Third Party Claim
at its own expense with counsel selected by the Defending Party. Assumption of
such Liability, as against the Asserting Party, shall not be deemed an admission
of liability as against any such third party. If the Defending Party assumes
liability for the Third Party Claim as against the Asserting Party and assumes
the defense and control of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 13.3,
the Asserting Party may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
through counsel of its choosing, but the Defending Party shall not be liable for
any fees and expenses of counsel for the Asserting Party incurred thereafter in
connection with the Third Party Claim, provided, however, that no Defending
Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Asserting Party, consent
to the entry of any judgment against the Defending Party or enter into any
settlement or compromise which (i) does not include, as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Asserting Party of a
release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Asserting Party
from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, provided that this
requirement shall be deemed waived to the extent that the Asserting Party does
not undertake to provide and promptly execute and, concurrently with the
delivery of any such release, deliver a corresponding release of the third party
claimant with respect to such Third Party Claim, or (ii) includes terms and
conditions that adversely affect the Asserting Party; provided further, however,
that in the case of clause (ii), the Asserting Party may not unreasonably
withhold such consent.

     (b) If the Defending Party does not assume liability for, and the defense
of, the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 13.3, the Asserting Party
shall have the right (a) to control the defense thereof, and (b) if the
Asserting Party shall have notified the Defending Party of the Asserting Party's
intention to negotiate a settlement of the Third Party Claim (at the Defending
Party's expense to the extent the matter is determined to be subject to
indemnification hereunder), which notice shall include the material terms of any
proposed settlement in reasonable detail, the Asserting Party may settle the
Third Party Claim (at the Defending Party's expense to the extent the matter is
determined to be subject to indemnification hereunder) on terms not materially
inconsistent with those set forth in such notice, unless the Defending Party
shall have notified the Asserting Party in writing of the Defending Party's
election to assume Liability for and the defense of the Third Party Claim
pursuant to this Section 13.3 within ten days after receipt of such notice, and
the Defending Party promptly thereafter shall have taken appropriate action to
implement such defense. The Asserting Party shall not be entitled to settle any
such Third Party Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of the Defending Party by the third party
claimant on account thereof, provided that such requirement shall be deemed
waived to the extent that the Defending Party does not undertake to provide and
promptly execute and, concurrently with delivery of any such release, deliver a
corresponding release of the third party claimant with respect to such Third
Party Claim. The Asserting Party and the Defending Party shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with respect to the defense
and settlement of any Third Party Claim covered by this Article 13.

     (c) The failure of any indemnified party to give an indemnifying party a
notice of claim shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability in
respect of such claim, demand or action which it may have to such indemnified
party on account of the indemnity agreement of such indemnifying party contained
in this Article 13, except to the extent such indemnifying party can establish
actual prejudice and direct damages as a result thereof.

     Section 13.4. Set-Off

     (a) DCS shall have the right to offset its obligation to pay any amount of
indemnification to the AWS Parties pursuant to Section 13.1 against any amount
of indemnification that AWS may owe the DCS Parties pursuant to Section 13.2 of
this Agreement.

     (b) AWS shall have the right to offset its obligation to pay any amount of
indemnification to the DCS Parties pursuant to Section 13.2 against any amount
of indemnification that DCS may owe the AWS Parties pursuant to Section 13.1 of
this Agreement.

     Section 13.5. Limitations

     The Defending Party's obligations to indemnify the Asserting Party pursuant
to this Article 13 shall be subject to the following limitations:

     (a) No indemnification under Section 13.1(a) or 13.2(a) for any Losses
shall be required to be made by the Defending Party until the aggregate amount
of the Asserting Party's Losses exceeds $2,000,000, and then indemnification
shall be required to be made by the Defending Party only to the extent of such
Losses that exceed $1,000,000; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply to (i) any intentional breach of a representation or warranty, (ii) any
breach by DCS of a representation or warranty set forth in Sections 7.2, 7.3(a),
7.6, 7.12, 7.15, 7.16 and 7.21 (each, a "DCS Exempt Representation"), or (iii)
any breach by AWS of a representation or warranty set forth in Sections 8.2,
8.3(a), 8.3(b), 8.6, 8.12, 8.15, 8.16 and 8.21 (each, an "AWS Exempt
Representation").

     (b) The aggregate liability of the Defending Party under Section 13.1(a) or
13.2(a), as applicable, shall not exceed $15,000,000, provided, that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to (w) any intentional breach of a
representation or warranty, (x) any breach by AWS of Section 8.3(b), (y) any
breach by DCS of a DCS Exempt Representation, or (z) any breach by AWS of an AWS
Exempt Representation.

     (c) The indemnification obligation of a Defending Party shall be reduced to
the extent of any available insurance proceeds payable to the Asserting Party,
net of any increased insurance premiums becoming payable by the Asserting Party
to the extent such increase is a direct result of such insurance proceeds
becoming available. The Defending Party shall pay its indemnification
obligations as and when required by this Article 13 and the Asserting Party
shall refund to the Defending Party any such amounts determined to be in excess
of the Defending Party's obligations due to reductions pursuant to this Section
13.5(c). Additionally, the Asserting Party shall refund promptly to the
Defending Party any amount of the Asserting Party's Losses that are subsequently
recovered by the Asserting Party pursuant to a settlement or otherwise.

     (d) To the extent that any AWS Losses relate to California Assets used in,
or the California Business conducted in, the Santa Cruz, CA MSA, any payments
made by DCS as indemnification under this Article 13 for such AWS Losses shall
be paid in an amount equal to the product of (i) the full amount otherwise
required to be paid under this Article 13 multiplied by (ii) 87.38649%. This
discount shall be applied with regard to the calculation of the aggregate amount
of an Asserting Party's Losses, pursuant to Section 13.5(a).

     (e) From and after the Closing Date, the indemnification rights contained
in this Article 13 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties hereunder, and shall supersede and displace all other rights that either
party may have under Law, with respect to any breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement or in any
certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument furnished hereunder or
in connection with the execution and performance of this Agreement.

     Section 13.6. Survival of Representations and Warranties

     All representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement or
in any certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument furnished
hereunder shall survive for a period lasting eighteen months after Closing,
except that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 7.3(a),
8.3(a) and 8.3(b) shall survive Closing indefinitely, (b) any intentional breach
or misrepresentation or fraud shall survive Closing indefinitely, and (c) except
as otherwise provided in clause (a) above, the DCS Exempt Representations and
the AWS Exempt Representations shall survive until the expiration of the 15-day
period commencing on the expiration date of the relevant statute of limitations
period (including any applicable extensions thereof), unless in each case
survival is governed by the preceding clauses (a) or (b). Any claim by a party
based upon breach of any such representation or warranty made pursuant to
Article 15 or otherwise must be submitted to the other party prior to or at the
expiration of the applicable survival period, along with a written explanation
in reasonable detail of the specifics of such breach. In the case of any claim
submitted within such time period, the right of the party submitting the claim
to recover from the other party with respect to such claim shall not be
dependent on the claim being resolved or the losses being incurred within such
time period. The right to indemnification hereunder shall not be affected by any
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing Date or the actual
or constructive knowledge of any party and each party shall be entitled to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein regardless of any such
investigation or knowledge. The waiver of any condition regarding the accuracy
of any representation or warranty, or regarding the performance of or compliance
with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right of indemnification or
any other remedy of the waiving party after Closing based on the inaccuracy of
such representation or warranty or the nonperformance of or noncompliance with
such covenant or obligation.

     Section 13.7. Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties

     (a) AWS acknowledges and agrees that DCS does not make, and has not made,
any representations or warranties relating to DCS or its Affiliates, the
California Business or the California Assets other than the representations and
warranties of DCS expressly set forth in this Agreement. In addition, AWS
acknowledges and agrees that DCS has not made any implied warranties including
implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose with
regard to any of the California Assets or the California Business. Without
limiting the generality of the disclaimer set forth in the two preceding
sentences, DCS does not make, and DCS, its officers, employees, representatives
and agents have not made, and shall not be deemed to have made any
representation relating to DCS or its Affiliates, the California Business or the
California Assets given in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in any filing made by or on behalf of DCS or an Affiliate with any
Governmental Authority or in any other information provided to or made available
to AWS, and no statement made in any such filing or contained in any such other
information shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty of DCS hereunder
or otherwise. DCS represents to AWS that no person has been authorized by DCS to
make any representation or warranty in respect of DCS or its Affiliates, the
California Business or the California Assets in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that is inconsistent with or in addition to the
representations and warranties of DCS expressly set forth in this Agreement.

     (b) DCS acknowledges and agrees that AWS does not make, and has not made,
any representations or warranties relating to AWS or its Affiliates, the Alaska
Business or the Alaska Assets other than the representations and warranties of
AWS expressly set forth in this Agreement. In addition, DCS acknowledges and
agrees that AWS has not made any implied warranties including implied warranties
of merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose with regard to either the
Alaska Assets or the Alaska Business. Without limiting the generality of the
disclaimer set forth in the two preceding sentences, AWS does not make, and AWS,
its officers, employees, representatives and agents have not made, and shall not
be deemed to have made any representation relating to AWS or its Affiliates, the
Alaska Business or the Alaska Assets given in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any filing made by or on behalf of AWS or an
Affiliate with any Governmental Authority or in any other information provided
to or made available to DCS, and no statement made in any such filing or
contained in any such other information shall be deemed to be a representation
or warranty of AWS hereunder or otherwise. AWS represents to DCS that no person
has been authorized by AWS to make any representation or warranty in respect of
AWS or its Affiliates, the Alaska Business or the Alaska Assets in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is inconsistent with
or in addition to the representations and warranties of AWS expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

     Section 13.8. Payment

     (a) Upon a determination of Liability under this Article 13, the
appropriate party shall pay the indemnified party the amount so determined
within 10 business days after the date of such determination. If there should be
a dispute as to the amount or manner of determination of any indemnity
obligation owed under this Agreement, the party from which indemnification is
due shall nevertheless pay when due such portion, if any, of the obligation as
shall not be subject to dispute. The difference, if any, between the amount of
the obligation ultimately determined as properly payable under this Agreement
and the portion, if any, theretofore paid shall bear interest as provided below
in Section 13.8(b).

     (b) If all or part of any indemnification obligation under this Agreement
is not paid when due, then the indemnifying party shall pay the indemnified
party interest on the unpaid amount of the obligation for each day from the date
the amount became due until payment in full, payable on demand, at the
fluctuating rate per annum which at all times shall be two percentage points in
excess of the "Prime Rate" published from time to time in the "Money Rates"
table of the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal.

                       CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRESS RELEASES

     Section 14.1. Confidentiality

     The Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated May 21, 2002 between DCS and AWS
(the "NDA") shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms, except that it
may be terminated upon termination of this Agreement. The obligations of AWS
under the NDA and under this Article 14 shall terminate as of the Closing,
except with respect to Information (as defined in the NDA) of DCS that does not
relate to the California Business that AWS is required by the NDA to keep
confidential. The obligations of DCS under the NDA and under this Article 14
shall terminate as of the Closing, except with respect to Information (as
defined in the NDA) of AWS that does not relate to the Alaska Business that DCS
is required by the NDA to keep confidential.

     Section 14.2. Press Releases

     No press release or public disclosure or disclosure to any third party,
either written or oral, of the existence or terms of this Agreement shall be
made by either AWS or DCS without the consent of the other subject to the
provisions of Section 14.3, and AWS and DCS shall each furnish to the other
advance copies of any release which it proposes to make public concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and the date upon which AWS or
DCS, as the case may be, proposes to make such press release.

     Section 14.3. Disclosures Required by Law

     This Article 14 shall not, however, be construed to prohibit any party from
making any disclosures to any Governmental Authority that it is required to make
by Law or from filing this Agreement with, or disclosing the terms of this
Agreement to, any institutional lender to such party, or prohibit DCS, AWS or
any of their Affiliates from disclosing to its investors, partners, accountants,
auditors, attorneys, parent company and, with regard to DCS, to Lehman Brothers
as its broker/dealer on this transaction, such terms of this transaction as are
customarily disclosed to them in connection with the sale or acquisition of a
cellular telephone system; provided, however, that in the case of disclosure to
any Governmental Authority, the disclosing party shall request confidential
treatment of this Agreement and its terms, and in the case of disclosure to any
other person, the disclosing party shall inform the recipient of the
confidential nature of such information and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the recipient to agree to keep such information
confidential in accordance with the terms of Section 14.1; and provided,
however, that each party shall provide to the other reasonable advance copies of
any public release except where the provision of such advance notice is not
permissible.

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 15.1. Breaches and Defaults; Opportunity to Cure

     Prior to the exercise by a party of any termination rights afforded under
this Agreement (other than Section 15.2(f)), if either party (the "Non-Breaching
Party") believes the other (the "Breaching Party") to be in breach hereunder,
the Non-Breaching Party shall provide the Breaching Party with written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such breach, whereupon if such
breach is curable the Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days from the
receipt of such notice to cure such breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Non-Breaching Party; provided, however, that if such breach is curable but is
not capable of being cured within such period and if the Breaching Party shall
have commenced action to cure such breach within such period and is diligently
attempting to cure such breach, then the Breaching Party shall be afforded an
additional sixty (60) days to cure such breach; provided, however, the cure
period for a breach shall in no event extend beyond the Outside Date (as defined
in Section 15.2(e)). If the breach is not cured within such time period, then
the Breaching Party shall be in default hereunder and the Non-Breaching Party
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement (as provided in Section 15.2).
This right of termination shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
rights of the Non-Breaching Party under Article 13 of this Agreement.

     Section 15.2. Termination

     This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned, by written notice given to the other party, at any time prior
to the Closing:

     (a) by mutual written consent of DCS and AWS;

     (b) by either DCS or AWS, if any court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or other United States Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the sale of the California Assets to AWS or
the sale of the Alaska Assets to DCS (in either case, which DCS and AWS shall
have used all commercially reasonable efforts to have lifted or reversed) and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable;

     (c) subject to Section 15.1, by AWS, if, as of any date, DCS shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants such that the
condition set forth in Section 10.1 shall not be satisfied as of such date;

     (d) subject to Section 15.1, by DCS, if, as of any date, AWS shall have
materially breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants such
that the condition set forth in Section 11.1 shall not be satisfied as of such
date;

     (e) by either DCS or AWS if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the date that is (i) nine months after the date of this Agreement or (ii)
if the Closing shall have not occurred within nine months after the date of this
Agreement by reason of a petition to deny FCC approval of the Transactions, 12
months after the date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date"), unless the failure
to consummate the Closing shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform in any material respect its obligations
under this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing;
or

     (f) by AWS if the Lender Acknowledgement is not delivered to DOC with a
copy to AWS within 75 days after the date hereof, provided, that if AWS does not
notify DCS in writing within five business days following such 75th day of its

been waived.

                                  BROKERS' FEES

     Each party represents and warrants to the other that it shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any fee or commission due to any broker or finder
it has engaged with respect to this transaction and the other party hereto shall
be indemnified for any liability with respect thereto pursuant to Article 15
hereof.

                                   ARTICLE 17
                                   ARBITRATION

     Any controversy, dispute or claim (collectively, a "Dispute") between the
parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination
or validity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with
the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
then pertaining. However, in all events, these arbitration provisions shall
govern over any conflicting rules that may now or hereafter be contained in the
AAA rules. The arbitration shall be held in the State of New York unless the
parties mutually agree to have the arbitration held elsewhere, and judgment upon
the award made therein may be entered by any court having jurisdiction in the
State of New York; provided however, that nothing contained in this Article 17
shall be construed to limit or preclude a party from bringing any action in any
court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other provisional relief to
compel another party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement during
the pendency of the arbitration proceedings. Any judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over
the subject matter hereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any
equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding
instituted to resolve any claim hereunder.

     Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who shall
be chosen by agreement of the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in
accordance with the rules of the AAA. The arbitrator shall permit such discovery
as he shall determine is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account
the needs of the parties and the desirability of making discovery expeditious
and cost-effective. Any such discovery shall be limited to information directly
related to the controversy or claim in arbitration and shall be concluded within
sixty (60) days after appointment of the third arbitrator.

     The substantially prevailing party in any arbitration hereunder, as
determined by the arbitrator, shall be entitled to an award of a percentage of
its reasonable costs incurred in connection therewith, including attorneys'
fees, determined by dividing the amount actually awarded to the prevailing party
by the amount claimed by the prevailing party.

     For any Dispute submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be as it
would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding.

     Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the
arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a written
opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached and will
deliver such documents to each party to this Agreement along with a signed copy
of the award.

     The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the
power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or the provisions of this Agreement and shall make his decision based
on and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 18
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 18.1. Additional Instruments of Transfer

     (a) From time to time after the Closing, each party shall, if requested by
the other party, make, execute and deliver such additional assignments, bills of
sale, deeds and other instruments, as may be reasonably necessary or proper to
carry out the specific provisions of this Agreement, including (i) the transfer
to AWS of all of DCS's right, title and interest in and to the California Assets
and any right, title or interest that any Affiliate of DCS may have in any asset
used primarily in the California Business, other than an Excluded California
Asset, and (ii) the transfer to DCS of all of AWS's right, title and interest in
and to the Alaska Assets and any right, title or interest that any Affiliate of
AWS may have in any asset used primarily in the Alaska Business, other than an
Excluded Alaska Asset. Such efforts and assistance shall be at the cost of the
requesting party.

     (b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, DCS is not
obligated to sell, assign, transfer or convey to AWS any of its rights and
obligations in and to any California Assumed Contract to be sold, assigned,
transferred or conveyed, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom (a "California Interest") without first obtaining all
necessary approvals, consents or waivers. To the extent any Required California
Consents have not been obtained by DCS as of the Closing and AWS elects to
proceed with the Closing, DCS shall, for a period equal to the shorter of twelve
months after the Closing, or the remaining term of such Interest, (i) use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any such third party;
(ii) cooperate with AWS in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to
provide the benefits (including the payment to AWS of any monies received by DCS
in connection therewith and including cooperation with AWS's efforts to obtain
the consent of the third party to any such cell site lease or license regarding
the assignment of such cell site lease or license to AWS) of such California
Interest to AWS so long as AWS performs all obligations with respect to the
California Interest (and the payment of all expenses in connection therewith);
and (iii) enforce, at the request of AWS and at the expense and for the account
of AWS, any rights of DCS arising from such California Interest against such
issuer thereof or the other party or parties thereto (including the right to
elect to terminate any such California Interest in accordance with the terms
thereof upon the request of AWS); provided, however, that none of AWS or DCS
shall be obligated to pay any consideration or other sums therefor (except for
filing fees and other ordinary administrative charges and except as set forth
above) to the third party from whom such approval, consent or waiver is
requested.

     (c) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, AWS is not
obligated to sell, assign, transfer or convey to DCS any of its rights and
obligations in and to any Alaska Assumed Contract to be sold, assigned,
transferred or conveyed, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom (an "Alaska Interest") Interest without first obtaining all
necessary approvals, consents or waivers. To the extent any Required Alaska
Consents have not been obtained by AWS as of the Closing and DCS elects to
proceed with the Closing, AWS shall, for a period equal to the shorter of twelve
months after the Closing, or the remaining term of such Alaska Interest, (i)
except with regard to cell site leases or licenses, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any such third party; (ii) cooperate
with DCS in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide the
benefits (including the payment to DCS of any monies received by AWS in
connection therewith and including cooperation with DCS's efforts to obtain the
consent of the third party to any such cell site lease or license regarding the
assignment of such cell site lease or license to DCS) of such Alaska Interest to
DCS so long as DCS performs all obligations with respect to the Alaska Interest
(and the payment of all expenses in connection therewith); and (iii) enforce, at
the request of DCS and at the expense and for the account of DCS, any rights of
AWS arising from such Alaska Interest against such issuer thereof or the other
party or parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate any such
Alaska Interest in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of DCS);
provided, however, that none of AWS or DCS shall be obligated to pay any
consideration or other sums therefor (except for filing fees and other ordinary
administrative charges and except as set forth above) to the third party from
whom such approval, consent or waiver is requested.

corporate or FCC attorney retained by it, incurred in connection with the
preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     Section 18.4. Transfer Taxes

     AWS and DCS shall bear equally the expense of all use, sales, transfer and
other similar transaction taxes, if any, which are imposed solely and directly
by reason of the sale and delivery of the California Assets from DCS to AWS and
the Alaska Assets from AWS to DCS under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary set forth in this Section 18.4, (i) AWS shall in no event
be responsible in any manner for the payment of any taxes on any gross or net
income, gross or net receipts or gain which DCS may realize as a result of the
sale of the California Assets or otherwise related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) DCS shall in no event be responsible in

     Section 18.6. Governing Law

     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York (without application of principles of conflicts of
law). In connection with any controversy arising out of or related to this
Agreement, DCS and AWS hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of New York, if a basis for
federal court jurisdiction is present, and, otherwise, in the state courts of
the State of New York located in New York County. DCS and AWS each irrevocably
consents to service of process out of the aforementioned courts and waives any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought
in the aforementioned courts.

     Section 18.7. Assignment

     Except as permitted by Section 9.8(b) and Section 9.8(d), neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned (by operation of law or otherwise) by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that DCS may assign its
rights under this Agreement to acquire the Alaska Assets and assume the Assumed
Alaska Liabilities to DCC or any wholly-owned subsidiary of DCC, and AWS may
assign its rights under this Agreement to acquire the California Assets and to
assume the Assumed California Liabilities to any of its wholly-owned

     All agreements made and entered into in connection with this transaction
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their

     No alteration, modification or change of this Agreement shall be valid
except by an agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, no failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder (and no course of dealing
between or among any of the parties) shall operate as a waiver of any such
right, power or privilege. No waiver of any default on any one occasion shall
constitute a waiver of any subsequent or other default. No single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall preclude the further or
full exercise thereof.

     Section 18.10. Entire Agreement

     Except for the NDA, this Agreement merges all previous negotiations and
agreements between the parties hereto, either verbal or written, and constitutes
the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

     Section 18.11. Counterparts

     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one agreement. Facsimile signatures shall be deemed original
signatures.

     Section 18.12. Severability

     If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person
or circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder
of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the
greatest extent permitted by law, but only as long as the continued validity,
legality and enforceability of such provision or application does not materially
(a) alter the terms of this Agreement, (b) diminish the benefits of this
Agreement or (c) increase the burdens of this Agreement, for any person.

     Section 18.13. Section Headings

     The section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the purpose
of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and shall not in any
way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     Section 18.14. Interpretation

     As both parties have participated in the drafting of this Agreement, any
ambiguity shall not be construed against either party as the drafter. Unless the
context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, (a) "or" has the inclusive
meaning frequently identified with the phrase "and/or," (b) "including" has the
inclusive meaning frequently identified with the phrase "including, but not
limited to" and (c) references to "hereof," "hereunder" or "herein" or words of
similar import relate to this Agreement.

     Section 18.15. Further Assurances

     (a) For a period of six (6) months after Closing, DCS agrees to provide to
AWS from time to time any information that DCS possesses with respect to the
operation of the California Assets prior to the Closing which AWS reasonably
requests in connection with AWS's financing efforts or in connection with any
FCC or other regulatory filing. No such information furnished by DCS shall
constitute a representation or warranty to AWS or any other person; DCS shall
not have any Liability in respect of such information to AWS or any other
person; and any Liability, action, suit, demand, judgment, cost of investigation
and reasonable attorney fees (but excluding any exemplary, consequential or
punitive damages) sustained, incurred or paid by any DCS Indemnified Party in
connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly, the
provision of any such information to AWS pursuant to this paragraph shall be
considered a DCS Loss for purposes of this Agreement.

     (b) For a period of six (6) months after Closing, AWS agrees to provide to
DCS from time to time any information that AWS possesses with respect to the
operation of the Alaska Assets prior to the Closing which DCS reasonably
requests in connection with DCS's financing efforts or in connection with any
FCC or other regulatory filing. No such information furnished by AWS shall
constitute a representation or warranty to DCS or any other person; AWS shall
not have any Liability in respect of such information to DCS or any other
person; and any Liability, action, suit, demand, judgment, cost of investigation
and reasonable attorney fees (but excluding any exemplary, consequential or
punitive damages) sustained, incurred or paid by any AWS Indemnified Party in
connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly, the
provision of any such information to DCS pursuant to this paragraph shall be
considered an AWS Loss for purposes of this Agreement.

     Section 18.16. Third Parties

     Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any
person other than the parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or
Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

     Section 18.17. Remedies

     The parties acknowledge and agree that the material California Assets,
including the California FCC Authorizations, and the material Alaska Assets,
including the Alaska FCC Authorizations, and the DCC Securities are unique and
that remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the
event of a breach by DCS or AWS in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement. Accordingly, the parties agree that in the event of any such breach
by DCS or AWS prior to the Closing, the other party shall be entitled, among
other remedies, to a decree of specific performance. In addition, the parties
agree that in the event of a breach by DCS or AWS of Section 9.8 prior to
Closing, or (except as otherwise provided in Section 9.9(g)) in the event of a
breach by AWS of Section 9.9 after the Closing, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled, among other remedies, to a decree of specific performance.

AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.
7277 164th Avenue N.E.
Redmond, Washington  98052


Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special counsel to Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc., an
Oklahoma corporation ("Dobson"), in connection with the execution and delivery
of that certain Asset Exchange Agreement dated as of December 24, 2002 (the
"Exchange Agreement") by and between Dobson and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.
("AWS"). Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning
given to such terms in the Exchange Agreement.

     In connection with the delivery of this opinion, we have examined the
Exchange Agreement, including the Schedules thereto, the corporate records of
Dobson and the following agreements (together with the Exchange Agreement, the
"Related Agreements"):

     (a)  The Master Lease Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (b)  The Transition Services Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002,
          between Dobson and AWS;

     (c)  The Cordova Option Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002, among
          Dobson, AWS and AT&T Wireless Services of Alaska, Inc. (the "Option
          Agreement");

     (d)  The GSM Buildout Agreement (Alaska), dated the date hereof, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (e)  The GSM Roaming Agreement (Alaska), dated the date hereof, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (f)  The Amendment No. 3 to Operating Agreement, dated the date hereof,
          between Dobson and AWS;

     (g)  The letter agreement regarding system operator code issues, dated the
          date hereof, between Dobson and AWS;

     (h)  The [AT&T Wireless Brand Transition License Agreement], dated the date
          hereof, among Dobson, AWS and AT&T Corp.; and

     (i)  The [Conveyance Instruments].

     We have also examined such other agreements, instruments and documents and
matters of law as we deemed relevant or necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, we have
relied, without independent verification, on the certificates of officers of
Dobson, certificates of public officials and upon the accuracy and completeness
of the representations set forth in the Exchange Agreement. However, except to
the extent expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent
investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts.

     Whenever our opinion with respect to the existence or absence of facts is
indicated to be based upon our knowledge, we are referring solely to the
conscious awareness of the particular Edwards & Angell attorneys who have
devoted substantive attention to the matters contemplated by the Exchange
Agreement without there being any investigation. No inference as to our actual
or imputed knowledge concerning any fact should be drawn from the fact of our
past or current representation of Dobson.

     In our examination we have assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures,
(b) the completeness and authenticity of all documents and records submitted to
us as originals, (c) the conformity to original documents and records of all
documents and records submitted to us as certified, photostatic or conformed
copies, (d) the due execution and delivery of the Related Agreements by you, (e)
the power, authority and legal right of all parties to the Related Agreements
(other than Dobson) to enter into the Related Agreements and to perform their
obligations thereunder and the due authorization of the Related Agreements by
all parties thereto (other than Dobson), (f) the validity of all applicable
statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations and (g) the legal capacity of all
natural persons executing documents. We have also assumed that each of the
Related Agreements is a valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto
(other than Dobson), enforceable against them in accordance with their terms.

     We have investigated such questions of law as we have deemed necessary for
the purpose of rendering this opinion. Our opinions expressed herein are limited
to the laws of the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States,
except that we express no opinion as to (a) matters arising under or governed by
the Communications Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations of the FCC
promulgated thereunder, (b) the Telecommunications Act of 1996, (c) the Federal
Aviation Act or the rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration
promulgated thereunder, (d) the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, (e)
the public service or public utilities laws, rules or regulations of any
jurisdiction, (f) the antitrust, antifraud, trade regulations, investment
company or similar laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction, (g) the
franchise or similar laws of the United States, or any other jurisdiction, (h)
the laws, rules or regulations of any municipality or other local agency within
any state or (i) the laws of any other jurisdiction (collectively, "Excluded
Laws"). Furthermore, our opinions are based upon our consideration of only those
laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York and of the United States
(other than Excluded Laws) which, in our experience, are typically applicable to
parties and assets in transactions of the type contemplated by the Related
Agreements (collectively, "Applicable Laws"). We are members of the bar of the
State of New York, and, as such, do not purport to be experts on laws other than
the laws of the State of New York and certain Federal laws of the United States.
Further, with respect to the opinions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3,
clauses (i) (with respect to Oklahoma law only) and (ii) of paragraph 4 and
paragraph 7, we have relied exclusively on the opinions of Pate, Kempf & Knarr
and McAfee & Taft, copies of which are attached hereto. We have no reason to
believe that we are not justified in relying on such opinion.

     The opinions expressed below are subject to the following qualifications:

     a. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements may be subject
to and affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium, avoidance or other laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally.

     b. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements and particular
provisions thereof are subject to or may be affected by limitations imposed by
general principles of equity and the availability of equitable remedies
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in
equity).

     c. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements may be subject
to or affected by statutory or decisional law limiting or rendering ineffective
obligations to indemnify or the waiver or release of rights or defenses.

     d. Certain rights, remedies, forfeitures, penalties, waivers or elections
contained in the Related Agreements may be rendered ineffective or limited by
applicable laws or judicial decisions governing such provisions, but such laws
and judicial decisions do not, in our opinion, make the Related Agreements
inadequate for the substantive realization of the benefit intended to be
provided thereby.

     Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

     1. Dobson is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Oklahoma and has all necessary corporate
power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business and to enter into and perform the Related Agreements.

     2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Related Agreements by
Dobson have been fully and validly authorized and approved by all necessary
corporate action.

     3. The execution, delivery and performance by Dobson of the Related
Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions do not constitute and will
not result in a breach or violation of, or default under, the organizational
documents of Dobson.

     4. To our knowledge, except for compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act, consent by the FCC to the assignment of the California FCC
Authorizations by Dobson, and the consents, authorizations, approvals,
registrations, filings and notices identified on Schedule 7.8 to the Exchange
Agreement, neither the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement or any
of the other Related Agreements by Dobson, nor the performance by it of the
Transactions, will result in a Default under any term, condition or provision
of, or require the consent, authorization or approval of, or any registrations
or filings with or notices to, any person or Governmental Authority under, (i)
any Applicable Laws or (ii) any Assumed California Contract listed on Schedule
7.5(a) of the Exchange Agreement; except, with respect to each of clauses (i)
and (ii) above, to the extent such Default or failure to obtain such consent,
authorization or approval, or to register, file or make notice, would not
reasonably be expected to (x) result in a material adverse effect to the
California Business taken as a whole or (y) impair in any material respect the
ability of Dobson to consummate the Transactions.

     5. Each Related Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Dobson,
and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms.

     6. The [conveyance instruments employed at Closing (e.g., Bill of Sale)]
are in form sufficient to effect the transfer of the California Assets to AWS or
its designee in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement.1 We express
no opinion, however, as to the nature or extent of Dobson's rights in, or title
to, the California Assets or any other property purported to be transferred by
the [conveyance instruments employed at Closing].

     7. The transfer of the DCC Securities contemplated by Section 1.2(c) of the
Exchange Agreement is valid under Oklahoma law and will not conflict with or
violate any of the provisions thereof.

     8. To our knowledge, there is no judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority
outstanding, or any litigation, proceeding or investigation pending or
threatened, against Dobson which questions the validity of any action to be
taken pursuant to or in connection with any Related Agreement or affects the
California Assets.

     This opinion is solely for your benefit in connection with the transaction
contemplated by the Exchange Agreement and without our express written consent
this opinion may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person. This
opinion is not to be referred to or quoted in any document, report or financial
statement, or filed with, or delivered to, any Governmental Agency or other
person or entity, without our prior written consent in each instance. We assume
no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or
circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in facts
or law that may hereafter occur.

                                              Very truly yours,

                                              EDWARDS & ANGELL, LLP

     sufficiency of the form of the conveyance instruments is a matter of
     California law.

                                    [], 2003



Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc.
14201 Wireless Way
Oklahoma City, OK 73134


Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special counsel to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("AWS"), in connection with the execution and delivery of
that certain Asset Exchange Agreement dated as of December 24, 2002 (the
"Exchange Agreement") by and between Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc. ("Dobson")
and AWS. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning
given to such terms in the Exchange Agreement.

     In connection with the delivery of this opinion, we have examined the
Exchange Agreement, including the Schedules thereto, the corporate records of
AWS and the following agreements (together with the Exchange Agreement, the
"Related Agreements"):

     (a)  The Master Lease Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (b)  The Transition Services Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002,
          between Dobson and AWS;

     (c)  The Cordova Option Agreement, dated as of December 24, 2002, among
          Dobson, AWS and AT&T Wireless Services of Alaska, Inc. (the "Option
          Agreement");

     (d)  The GSM Buildout Agreement (Alaska), dated the date hereof, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (e)  The GSM Roaming Agreement (Alaska), dated the date hereof, between
          Dobson and AWS;

     (f)  The Amendment No. 3 to Operating Agreement, dated the date hereof,
          between Dobson and AWS;

     (g)  The letter agreement regarding system operator code issues, dated the
          date hereof, between Dobson and AWS;

     (h)  The Network Membership License Agreement, dated the date hereof, among
          Dobson, AWS and AT&T Corp.; and

     (i)  The conveyance instruments listed on Annex A hereto.

     We have also examined such other agreements, instruments and documents and
matters of law as we deemed relevant or necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, we have
relied, without independent verification, on the certificates of officers of
AWS, certificates of public officials and upon the accuracy and completeness of
the representations set forth in the Exchange Agreement. However, except to the
extent expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent
investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts.

     Whenever our opinion with respect to the existence or absence of facts is
indicated to be based upon our knowledge, we are referring solely to the
conscious awareness of the particular Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman LLP
attorneys who have devoted substantive attention to the matters contemplated by
the Exchange Agreement without having made any investigation. No inference as to
our actual or imputed knowledge concerning any fact should be drawn from the
fact of our past or current representation of AWS.

     In our examination we have assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures,
(b) the completeness and authenticity of all documents and records submitted to
us as originals, (c) the conformity to original documents and records of all
documents and records submitted to us as certified, photostatic or conformed
copies, (d) the due execution and delivery of the Related Agreements by you, (e)
the power, authority and legal right of all parties to the Related Agreements
(other than AWS and AT&T Wireless Services of Alaska, Inc.) to enter into the
Related Agreements and to perform their obligations thereunder and the due
authorization of the Related Agreements by all parties thereto (other than AWS
and AT&T Wireless Services of Alaska, Inc.), (f) the validity of all applicable
statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations and (g) the legal capacity of all
natural persons executing documents. We have also assumed that each of the
Related Agreements is a valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto
(other than AWS and AT&T Wireless Services of Alaska, Inc.), enforceable against
them in accordance with their terms.

     We have investigated such questions of law as we have deemed necessary for
the purpose of rendering this opinion. Our opinions expressed herein are limited
to the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and
the Federal law of the United States, except that we express no opinion as to
(a) matters arising under or governed by the Communications Act of 1934 or the
rules and regulations of the FCC promulgated thereunder, (b) the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, (c) the Federal Aviation Act or the rules and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration promulgated thereunder, (d)
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, (e) the public service or public
utilities laws, rules or regulations of any jurisdiction, (f) the antitrust,
antifraud, trade regulations, investment company or similar laws of the United
States or any other jurisdiction, (g) the franchise or similar laws of the
United States, or any other jurisdiction, (h) the laws, rules or regulations of
any municipality or other local agency within any state or (i) the laws of any
other jurisdiction (collectively, "Excluded Laws"). Furthermore, our opinions
are based upon our consideration of only those laws, rules and regulations of
the State of New York and of the United States (other than Excluded Laws) which,
in our experience, are typically applicable to parties and assets in
transactions of the type contemplated by the Related Agreements (collectively,
"Applicable Laws"). We are members of the bar of the State of New York, and, as
such, do not purport to be experts on laws other than the laws of the State of
New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and certain Federal laws of the
United States.

     The opinions expressed below are subject to the following qualifications:

     a. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements may be subject
to and affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium, avoidance or other laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally.

     b. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements and particular
provisions thereof are subject to or may be affected by limitations imposed by
general principles of equity and the availability of equitable remedies
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in
equity).

     c. The validity and enforceability of the Related Agreements may be subject
to or affected by statutory or decisional law limiting or rendering ineffective
obligations to indemnify or the waiver or release of rights or defenses.

     d. Certain rights, remedies, forfeitures, penalties, waivers or elections
contained in the Related Agreements may be rendered ineffective or limited by
applicable laws or judicial decisions governing such provisions, but such laws
and judicial decisions do not, in our opinion, make the Related Agreements
inadequate for the substantive realization of the benefits intended to be
provided thereby.

     Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

     1. AWS is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all necessary corporate
power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business and to enter into and perform the Related Agreements.

     2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Related Agreements by AWS
have been fully and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate
action.

     3. The execution, delivery and performance by AWS of the Related Agreements
and the consummation of the Transactions do not constitute and will not result
in a breach or violation of, or default under, the organizational documents of
AWS.

     4. To our knowledge, except for compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act, consent by the FCC to the assignment of the Alaska FCC
Authorizations by AWS, and the consents, authorizations, approvals,
registrations, filings and notices identified on Schedule 8.8 to the Exchange
Agreement, neither the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement or any
of the other Related Agreements by AWS, nor the performance by it of the
Transactions, will result in a Default under any term, condition or provision
of, or require the consent, authorization or approval of, or any registrations
or filings with or notices to, any person or Governmental Authority under, (i)
any Applicable Laws or (ii) any Assumed Alaska Contract listed on Schedule
8.5(a) of the Exchange Agreement; except, with respect to each of clauses (i)
and (ii) above, to the extent such Default or failure to obtain such consent,
authorization or approval, or to register, file or make notice, would not
reasonably be expected to (x) result in a material adverse effect to the Alaska
Business taken as a whole or (y) impair in any material respect the ability of
AWS to consummate the Transactions.

     5. Each Related Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by AWS, and
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms.

     6. The conveyance instruments listed on Annex A hereto are in form
sufficient to effect the transfer of the Alaska Assets to you or your designee
in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement.1 We express no opinion,
however, as to the nature or extent of AWS's rights in, or title to, the Alaska
Assets or any other property purported to be transferred by such conveyance
instruments.

     7. To our knowledge, there is no judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority
outstanding, or any litigation, proceeding or investigation pending or
threatened, against AWS which questions the validity of any action to be taken
pursuant to or in connection with any Related Agreement or affects the Alaska
Assets.

     This opinion is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Exchange Agreement and without our express written consent
this opinion may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person. This
opinion is not to be referred to or quoted in any document, report or financial
statement, or filed with, or delivered to, any Governmental Agency or other
person or entity, without our prior written consent in each instance. We assume
no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or
circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in facts
or law that may hereafter occur.

                                             Very truly yours,

Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc.
14201 Wireless Way
Oklahoma City, OK 73134
Attention: Ronald L. Ripley, Esq.

         Re:      Asset Exchange Agreement

Gentlemen:

     I have acted as special communications counsel on Federal Communications
Commission ("FCC") matters to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. ("AWS") in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Asset Exchange Agreement
between AWS and Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc. ("DCS"), dated as of December 24,
2002 (the "Agreement"), and the filing with the FCC of the related license
assignment applications. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section
11.5 of the Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein or the context hereof
otherwise requires, each term used herein with its initial letter capitalized
has the meaning given to such term in the Agreement.

     In connection with this opinion, I have examined an executed copy of the
Agreement. I have also examined the FCC public files that were made available to
me by the FCC through its electronic Universal Licensing System database as of
________ __, 2003 ("FCC Public Files") for the FCC Licenses described below and
our internal files related to the FCC Licenses (collectively the "File Review").
In such examination and in rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have
assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures where any such signature purports
to have been made in a corporate, governmental, fiduciary or other capacity, and
that the person who affixed such signatures had authority to do so, (ii) the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity
with the original documents of any copies hereof submitted to me as certified,
conformed, or photocopied for my examination, and (iii) the correctness and
completeness of the FCC Public Files made available to me.

     With respect to factual matters underlying the opinions set forth herein, I
have relied solely upon the File Review described above and upon review of
documents, records and instruments provided by AWS and pertinent disclosures to
me by appropriate representatives of AWS. All statements of fact in this opinion
are made to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.

     The opinions rendered herein are limited to matters arising under the FCC
Laws. I express no opinion concerning any other laws. [THE FOLLOWING IS FOR
INCLUSION IN THE WBK OPINION LETTER ONLY: Furthermore, this opinion is limited
to those matters on which undersigned counsel has represented DCS before the
FCC.] No implication shall be drawn from anything herein that has the effect of
extending any such opinion beyond what is expressly stated.

     In rendering this opinion, I have undertaken no independent field
inspection or other technical or engineering evaluation of the facilities that
have been constructed or are authorized pursuant to licenses that are covered by
the Agreement. Accordingly, I express no opinion with respect to matters about
which I would not know without conducting such a field inspection and evaluation
thereof. Additionally, I am expressly not rendering an opinion on how the Alaska
Systems are being operated.

     I express no opinion whatsoever in this letter as to the legal
qualifications of DCS under the FCC Laws, or such qualifications of its assigns,
if any, to directly or indirectly hold any of the Alaska FCC Authorizations.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:

     1. Cellular Alaska Partnership ("CAP") and AT&T Wireless Services of
Alaska, Inc. ("AWS-AK") are the duly authorized licensees of the Alaska FCC
Authorizations listed on Schedule 2.3(a)(i) of the Agreement, and CAP and AWS-AK
are authorized to utilize the radio frequency spectrum in accordance with the
FCC Laws related to the FCC Licenses. Each Alaska FCC Authorization has been
granted to CAP or AWS-AK and is in full force and effect. There are no
conditions imposed on the Alaska FCC Authorizations except for conditions listed
on the Alaska FCC Authorizations or imposed by the FCC Laws.

     2. To my knowledge, except for matters affecting the wireless industry or
cellular telecommunications services generally, there are no proceedings,
complaints or investigations pending or threatened under the FCC Laws against
AWS by or before the FCC that seek the revocation, non-renewal or any material
adverse modification of the Alaska FCC Authorizations.

     3. The Staff of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the FCC granted
its consent to the assignment of the Alaska FCC Authorizations. FCC consent to
the assignments described in the immediately preceding sentence has become a
Final Order.

     This opinion is furnished by me to you solely in connection with the
subject transactions. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other
purpose, or furnished to, quoted to or relied upon by any other person, firm or
corporation for any purpose without my prior written consent. This opinion
speaks only as of the date hereof and to its addressee. I expressly disclaim any
responsibility or obligation to update this opinion, to consider its
applicability or correctness or to take into account changes in law, facts or
any other development of which I may later become aware.

                                   Sincerely,


                                   David C. Jatlow

language at the end of the "Rates" section of Exhibit C, as such Exhibit C was
amended and restated by the Second Addendum to Operating Agreement, dated as of

     Expect as specifically set forth herein, the OA is not amended or modified
in any respect and shall continue in full force and effect.

     This Addendum may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
Addendum.

     This Addendum shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws of
the State of Delaware without reference to the choice of law principles, except
as subject to the United States Arbitration Act and the Federal Communications
Act.

Documents, whether in connection with the defense of a claim or otherwise, shall
be kept confidential by the receiving party and its Affiliates, and shall not be
used or disclosed by the receiving party or its Affiliates except to the extent
required in connection with the performance of the receiving party's obligations
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or as required by law;
provided, that the receiving party shall, if requested, provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure and shall seek
confidential treatment where procedures for requesting the same exist.

cure period shall be provided for a breach that by its nature cannot be cured);
and

     (b) immediately upon the Bankruptcy of the other party.

     Section 4.3. Effect of Termination

     Termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not relieve any party of
any liability which at the time of termination has already accrued to such party
or which thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such
termination, nor shall any such termination affect in any way the other
Transaction Documents or the survival of any right, duty or obligation of any
party which is expressly stated elsewhere in this Agreement to survive
termination hereof. The provisions of Section 3.3 and Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7
shall survive any termination of this Agreement for any reason.

                                    ARTICLE 5
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 5.1. Indemnification By DCS

     DCS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AWS and its Affiliates, and
their respective shareholders, partners, members, controlling persons,
directors, managers, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "AWS
Indemnitees"), from and against all costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(whether in a lawsuit between AWS and DCS or otherwise), damages, taxes,
liabilities and expenses arising out of or resulting from (or in connection with
the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding
arising out of) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of DCS or any of its Affiliates made in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto.

     Section 5.2. Indemnification By AWS

     AWS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless DCS and its Affiliates, and
their respective shareholders, partners, members, controlling persons,
directors, managers, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "DCS
Indemnitees"), from and against all costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(whether in a lawsuit between AWS and DCS or otherwise), damages, taxes,
liabilities and expenses arising out of or resulting from (or in connection with
the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding
arising out of) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of AWS or any of its Affiliates made in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto.

     Section 5.3. Procedures

     In the case of any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which DCS or
AWS (as the case may be, the "Indemnifying Party") is obligated hereunder to
indemnify any AWS Indemnitee or DCS Indemnitee (as the case may be, the
"Indemnified Party"), the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party, which may assume the defense thereof by
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, no later
than ten days after the date of such notice, provided that in no event shall any
delay or failure to notify the Indemnifying Party relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations under this Article 5. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may do so, with all costs and expenses
thereof being borne by the Indemnifying Party, and if the Indemnifying Party
does assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may, if it so desires, employ
counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such claim, action or
proceeding. The Indemnifying Party may, without the Indemnified Party's consent,
settle or compromise any claim, action or proceeding or consent to the entry of
any judgment if such settlement, compromise or judgment involves only the
payment of money by the Indemnifying Party (which payment is made or adequately
provided for at the time of such settlement, compromise or judgment), or
provides for unconditional release by the claimant or plaintiff of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liability in respect of such
claim, action or proceeding and does not impose injunctive relief against any of
them. If such settlement, compromise or judgment would impose injunctive relief
on any Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise or consent to judgment
shall be made only with the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance
to the Indemnifying Party in the defense of the claim, action or proceeding.

                                    ARTICLE 6

     (b) If the Dispute is not resolved by the business representatives within
30 days of their first meeting, then the Dispute shall be submitted to binding
arbitration pursuant to Section 6.4.

     Section 6.4. Binding Arbitration

     (a) All Disputes that are not resolved pursuant to Section 6.3 shall be

provisions of this Section 6.4 and the CPR Rules for Non-Administered
Arbitration (the "CPR Rules") to the extent such Rules do not conflict with this
paragraph and this Agreement.

     (b) The party commencing arbitration (the "claimant") shall deliver to the
other party (the "respondent") a notice of arbitration in accordance with the
CPR Rules. The arbitration shall be deemed commenced as to any respondent on the
date on which the notice of arbitration is received by the respondent (the date
of receipt of notice of arbitration being referred to herein as "Commencement");
provided, that in the case of an arbitration commenced against AWS, notice of
arbitration shall not be deemed received unless it references this Agreement and
is delivered to General Counsel, AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., 7277 164th Avenue

under this Agreement must be delivered. The respondent's notice of defense shall
be served upon the claimant within ten days after Commencement.

     (c) The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator,
knowledgeable in the legal and technical aspects of the Dispute, appointed by
CPR.

     (d) Discovery shall be limited to the production of documents to be used by
each party to prove or defend against the claims and counterclaims alleged in
the notices of arbitration and defense and, if depositions are required, each
party shall be limited to three depositions of no longer than three hours each.
If the arbitrator decides to hold an evidentiary hearing, each party's
presentation of its case, including its direct and rebuttal testimony, shall be
limited to three days.

     (e) The arbitrator shall issue an order preventing the parties, CPR and any
other participants to the arbitration from disclosing to any third party any
information obtained via the arbitration, including discovery documents,
evidence, testimony and the award except as may be required by law.

     (f) All requests for injunctive relief shall be decided by the arbitrator,
provided, however, that requests for temporary injunctive relief may be
submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction if the arbitrator has not yet
been appointed. The arbitrator shall have the authority to modify any injunctive
relief granted by such a court.

     (g) The arbitration award shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) state only the
damages and injunctive relief granted, if any; (iii) be made final within 30
days of Commencement; and (iv) be entered by either party in any court having
competent jurisdiction provided that the party entering the award shall request
that the court prevent the award from becoming publicly available except as may
be required by law. The arbitrator shall not limit, expand or otherwise modify
the terms of this Agreement, and shall not award punitive or other damages in
excess of compensatory damages. The arbitrator shall orally state the reasoning
on which the award rests but shall not state such reasoning in any writing.

     (h) Each party shall bear its own expenses, but those related to the
compensation of the arbitrator shall be borne equally.

     (i) The parties agree that the existence and contents of the entire
arbitration, including the award, shall be deemed a compromise of a dispute
under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall not be discoverable in
any proceeding, shall not be admissible in any court (except for the enforcement
thereof) or arbitration and shall not bind or collaterally estop either party
with respect to any claim or defense made by any third party.

     Section 7.2. Amendment; Waiver

     Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be amended or modified
except in a writing signed by both parties. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any such right or power,
preclude any other further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
or power. No waiver by any party of any departure by any other party from any

     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall be binding upon any
transferee of, or successor to, all or any portion of the Systems owned by DCS

its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party and any purported assignment or delegation without such prior written
consent shall be null and void and without force or effect; provided, that AWS
may assign its rights and delegate its duties hereunder in whole or in part to
any direct or indirect subsidiary of AWS (it being understood and agreed that no
such assignment or delegation shall relieve AWS of its obligations hereunder).

     Section 7.4. No Third Party Beneficiaries

     This Agreement is entered into solely for the benefit of the parties and no
person other than the parties, their respective successors and permitted
assigns, their Affiliates to the extent expressly provided herein, and (to the

                           Core Features and Services

911 - Support for 911 services based on local law enforcement agencies.

AIRLINK ENCRYPTION - Cyphering SGSN enabled.

AIRLINK QUALITY MONITORING - The mobile end station (MES) shall support GPRS
standard mobility management features.

AUTHENTICATION - Process that validates the subscriber's identity when the phone
is turned on (i.e. registers). The SIM, handset and network perform
authentication of the user.

BARRING ALL INCOMING/OUTGOING CALLS (BAIC & BAOC) - Feature initiated by carrier
or subscriber that intercepts (i.e. bars) all incoming/outgoing calls to/from
the subscriber's mobile. Barred calls receive treatment rather than going to
voice mail. Subscribers with BAIC feature will not receive/place calls while on
the AWS network or while roaming on other networks. Emergency and customer care
calls are allowed.

BARRING/ALLOWING OUTGOING INTERNATIONAL CALLS (BOIC) - Feature initiated by AWS
that intercepts (i.e. bars) outgoing international calls placed from the
subscriber's mobile. Subscribers with the BOIC feature will not be able to
originate calls on the AWS network or while roaming on another network.

CALL DELIVERY - Feature that permits subscriber to receive incoming calls while
in home market or while roaming in other networks.

CALL FORWARDING -Feature that allows subscribers to forward unconditionally
calls to any number defined by the subscriber that falls within the pre-defined
rules (e.g. no call forwarding to 800, 900, international, etc.).

CALL FORWARDING UNCONDITIONAL - Calls are forwarded immediately when the mobile
subscriber's number is dialed.

CALL ORIGINATION - Feature that permits subscriber to make a call depending on
the subscriber's call category while in home market or while roaming in other
networks.

CALL WAITING - Feature that informs the subscriber of an incoming call and
allows the subscriber to toggle between the initial and incoming call.

CALLING NUMBER ID PRESENTATION (CNIP) - Feature that allows the originating
caller to present its Caller ID on a per call basis using *82. This feature is
only applicable to subscribers who have requested their Caller ID to be blocked
for all calls.

CALLING NUMBER ID RESTRICT (CNIR) - Feature that allows the originating caller
to block its Caller ID on a per call basis using *67. CAMEL - Support future
dialed triggers and VLR triggers using CAMEL technology.

CLOSED USER GROUP (CUG)/- Feature that allows subscribers in the same CUG to
dial each other using private numbering plans such as office extensions (e.g.
four digit dialing from wireless phone).

PRIVATE NUMBERING PLAN (PNP) A service tailored for enterprise customers that
allows abbreviated dialing (ex. 4-digit) to reach home office extensions.

DATA SUPPORT - our subscribers roaming while using data services will be routed
back to AWS' SGSN. Some examples of features supported via this arrangement
include:

     o    Native Internet Behavior for Mobile - same internet behavior as on-net
          experience

     o    WCO Frame Relay - VPN service and equipment will offer secure
          connection through the foreign network to private third party sites

     o    Layer 2 Connection to Enterprises - VPN service and equipment will
          offer secure connection through the foreign network to private third
          party sites or RIM Blackberry type services

     o    Public Address Space for Mobiles - MES roaming on a foreign network
          shall have publicly addressable IP addresses

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE AND CALL COMPLETION (DACC) - Feature that allows a
subscriber to utilize nationally consistent dialing patterns to reach a
directory assistance call center (i.e. "411", "NPA-555-1212", "00") to request a
listed local or long distance number and have the call automatically completed
to the requested number. Call completion should be offered to all customers
other than toll restrict customers.

DISCONTINUOUS TRANSMISSION (DTX) - Feature that allows the mobile device to
transmit only when voice activity is present, significantly extending the talk
time of mobiles (up to 65%) and overall system quality. DTX will be provided in
both the network and the handset. DTX is part of the network software load and
is "on" at all times.

FLEXIBLE ALERTING - Uses Pilot Dialing number, to ring multiple handsets
simultaneously or ring a series of handsets sequentially. +

GPRS TRANSPORT 1-4 SLOTS - Feature that allows subscribers with capable handsets
or devices to set up a wireless data session using up to 4 timeslots at a time.
Each timeslot provides 14 Kb/s data throughput rate.

INTERNATIONAL + CODE DIALING - Also known as International Access Code, is the
number defined for the serving country that must be dialed prior to the country
code and destination number. Since the international access code is different
for every country, the GSM standard has defined the + dialed character to mean
the serving system's international access code. In the U.S. this would be 011.

INTERNATIONAL DIRECT DIALING (IDD) - Feature that allows subscribers to direct
dial international numbers.

MESSAGE WAITING INDICATOR(MWI) - Indicates a received message on the terminal.
MWI will indicate for text and voice mail messages.

MULTI-PARTY SERVICE (3-WAY & 6-WAY CALLING) - Feature that allows the mobile
subscriber to create a call with additional parties (i.e. conference call). The
number of parties that can be included in the call is limited to six. The mobile
subscriber that invokes this service can selectively remove parties from the
call through their phone.

NETWORK PERFORMANCE MONITORING - The foreign network shall be monitored for
throughput performance by the operator.

OVER THE AIR PROGRAMMING (OAP) - Service that is used periodically to send PLMN
updates (i.e. roaming carrier information) and other data (i.e. dynamic IP
address, MSISDN, voice mail access number) to customer's devices.

PERSONAL ACCOUNT OPTION - Ability to have two numbers on one handset. +

SHORT MESSAGING SERVICE (SMS) - Feature that allows subscribers to send (i.e.
mobile originate) and receive (i.e. mobile terminate) text messages.

SINGLE NUMBER HOTLINE - Feature that allows subscribers to call a single number
only (like 911 or 611 customer care). +

STANDARD DIALING - Feature that supports #, +, ten digit and seven digit dialing
as required, blocking 900 numbers.

SUBSCRIBER IDENTIFIER - Subscriber ID is the numeric ID used in the network and
billing system to uniquely identify the subscriber. The IMSI is the subscriber
ID used for the GSM networks and is composed of three parts:

         Mobile Country code (MCC) = 3 digits
         Mobile Network code (MNC) = 2/3 digits
         Mobile Subscriber ID / Number (MSIN) = up to 10 digits

TOLL RESTRICT - Feature that allows AWS to restrict subscriber access to local
service only. +

v.42 COMPRESSIONS - Data compression in the network allows faster download
speeds to the terminal.

VOICE MAIL - Feature that allows a caller to leave a recorded message for a
subscriber when they do not answer their phone.

VOICE MAIL SUPPORT WHILE ROAMING - Feature that allows for efficient routing to
voice mail from the mobile's home MSC rather than the serving MSC when roaming.

VOICE PRIVACY - Feature in the network and handsets to enable increased voice
security through encryption of the voice channel over the air.

4.   Annexes

     The Annexes are divided as set out in the Overview of the Annex
     Structure, in Common Annexes and in 2 sets of individual Annexes; one
     set for each operator.

5.   Scope of the Agreement

5.1       In respect of and subject to their licenses or rights and other
          national binding regulations to establish and operate GSM networks,
          the Parties to the Agreement agree to establish Roaming between DCS's
          GSM/GPRS network(s) in Alaska and AWS's GSM/GPRS networks in the
          United States in accordance with relevant Technical Specifications and
          GSM Association Permanent Reference Documents, including all the
          commercial aspects, as defined in the Annexes hereto or as may be
          amended from time to time.

5.2       So long as no material breach by DCS of the Build-Out Agreement has
          occurred and is continuing, AWS, in its capacity as a HPMN Operator,
          shall cause substantially all of its Roaming Subscribers, when Roaming
          in the State of Alaska, to normally seek Services as Roaming
          Subscribers from DCS prior to seeking Services from any other carrier.
          Any nationwide GSM/GPRS Roaming agreement between AWS and DCS, as
          contemplated by Section 8.1.1 shall, with respect to the State of
          Alaska, contain an obligation of AWS substantially similar to the
          obligation of AWS set forth in the preceding sentence of this Section
          5.2. AWS represents and warrants that each GSM/GPRS Roaming agreement
          to which it or a controlled Affiliate is a party that is in existence
          on the date hereof does not prohibit AWS from granting DCS Roaming
          preference on DCS's GSM/GPRS networks in the State of Alaska.

5.3       Additional requirements and exceptions to the Technical Specifications
          and GSM Association Permanent Reference Documents, as agreed between
          the Parties, are detailed in the Annexes to the Agreement or as may be
          amended from time to time.

6.   Implementation of the network and services

6.1       Network Implementation

          The Parties agree to comply with the relevant requirements and
          procedures of the GSM Association Permanent Reference Documents agreed
          by the GSM Association from time to time and as amended by the GSM
          Association from time to time.

6.2       Services

6.2.1     The Services provided by each Party are defined in Annex I.2 as may be
          amended from time to time.

6.2.2     The Services made available to individual Roaming Subscribers shall
          only be those for which the Roaming Subscribers have valid
          subscriptions in their HPMN.

6.2.3     Both Parties agree that their subscribers, while Roaming, may
          experience conditions of service different from the conditions in
          their HPMN.

7.   Modifications

7.1       Nothing in this Agreement shall limit either Party's right to
          implement new Services or change its existing Services as it sees fit.
          Each Party agrees to use its best efforts to give the other Party at
          least four (4) weeks written notice of any major change which has an
          impact on Roaming.

7.2       Following such notice of change both Parties agree to discuss the
          impact of any such change for Roaming Subscribers, including Roaming
          Subscribers' access to these Services, and the necessary actions to be
          performed, e.g. testing or administrative activities

8.   Charging, Billing and Accounting

8.1       Charging and tariffs

8.1.1     Both Parties agree that when a Roaming Subscriber uses the Services of
          the VPMN Operator, the Roaming Subscriber's HPMN Operator shall be
          responsible for payment of charges for the Services so used in
          accordance with the tariffs of the VPMN Operator stated in Annex
          I.3.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that:

          For the duration of this Agreement, and not subject to change pursuant
          to Article 8.1.3 below, the VPMN Operator tariffs for domestic GSM and
          GPRS Roaming shall be the following: *

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                             GSM Airtime Rates per MOU   GPRS Rates per Kilobyte
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Period               DCS          AWS as VPMN  Reciprocal GPRS Rates
                            as VPMN- GSM         - GSM
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The rates in the above table will become effective at the beginning of the first
clearinghouse Roaming cycle following the Closing Date under the Exchange
Agreement (for example, if the Closing Date is February 2, 2003, then the rates
in the above table would become effective on February 16, 2003); provided,
however that the "Year 1" GPRS Roaming rate will become effective on the date on
which DCS commercially launches its GSM network.

With respect to the GPRS Roaming rate, on or before the expiration of Year 1,
AWS and DCS shall agree upon the rate to be applicable in Year 2 and each
successive year.

If AWS and DCS enter into a nationwide GSM/GPRS Roaming agreement and such
agreement includes the Roaming preference language set forth in Article 5.2 and
the reduced Roaming tariffs described below in this paragraph, then such
nationwide GSM/GPRS Roaming agreement will supersede this Agreement in all
respects. The nationwide GSM/GPRS Roaming agreement will contain a provision
that, for a period of five years from the Closing Date under the Exchange
Agreement, the GSM Roaming rate DCS pays for its customers in the Alaska Markets
who Roam on AWS's GSM/GPRS network will be *

AWS and Dobson agree to work together in good faith to implement the rate
differential set forth in the above table and in the preceding paragraph,
provided that the parties will not be obligated to implement such rate
differential in the event it is not technologically feasible or is unreasonably
costly.

The "AWS GSM Average Roaming Rate" is the *

8.1.2     However, the HPMN Operator shall not be liable for the payment of
          charges for chargeable Services provided by the VPMN Operator without
          Subscriber Identity Authentication as defined in GSM Association
          Permanent Reference Documents, except to the extent that the HPMN
          Operator actually recovers all charges due in relation to the Roaming
          Subscriber. In the case of re-authentication malfunction, procedures
          are further detailed in Annex I.5.2.

8.1.3     Notwithstanding Article 18.1 either Party shall have the right to vary
          its tariff stated in the Annex I.3.1 or subsequent variation thereof,
          other than those set forth in 8.1.1 above. In the case of scheduled
          changes (as described in BA.27) a Party shall give 60 days written
          notice of any variation to its tariff and the new change shall take
          effect on the first day of the month following the expiration of the
          60 day notice period. In the case of unscheduled changes (as described
          in BA.27) a Party shall use all reasonable endeavours to give adequate
          notice of such changes and the new change shall take effect on the
          first day following the expiration of the notice period given. Any
          variation in the tariff shall be deemed to be incorporated into the
          Agreement.

8.2       Implementation of TAP

          The implementation of TAP shall be done according to the GSM
          Association Permanent Reference Documents and the provisions set out
          in the Annex C.3.1.

8.3       Billing and Accounting

          The implementation of billing and accounting shall be done according
          to the GSM Association Permanent Reference Documents and the
          provisions set out in Annex C.3.2 as amended from time to time or
          where there is a differing accounting practice or regulations in the
          U.S., the U.S. practice or regulations shall prevail.

9.   Customer Care

     The responsibilities of each Party concerning Customer Care are
     described in Annex C.4.

10.  Confidentiality

10.1      The Parties agree that all aspects of the contents of the Agreement
          shall be treated as confidential and that no information in respect of
          the content of the Agreement shall be disclosed without the prior
          written consent of both of the Parties except as necessary to
          implement the Agreement and inform customers.

10.2      The Parties hereby agree to treat all information exchanged between
          them (hereinafter referred to as "Information") in connection with the
          Agreement as confidential and agree not to disclose such Information
          in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part except as provided in
          this Article 10. The other Party shall not use any Information other
          than in connection with the discussions between them and any
          transactions resulting therefrom, or for the borrowing of funds or
          obtaining of insurance, in which case the disclosing Party shall cause
          the lenders or insurance companies to undersign a confidentiality
          undertaking which has the equivalent content as this Article 10 before
          receiving the Information. Each Party shall be liable in accordance
          with Article 13 to the other Party in respect of any unauthorized
          disclosure of Information made by the lender or by the insurance
          company to whom it has disclosed Information.

10.3      The Parties will disclose Information only to their directors,
          employees, professional advisers and agents who need to know such
          Information for the purposes of providing Roaming Services and any
          transaction resulting therefrom, or for the borrowing of funds or
          obtaining of insurance and who are informed of the confidential nature
          of such Information.

10.4      In addition to the above, Information may be transmitted to
          Governmental, judicial or regulatory Authorities, as may be required
          by any Governmental, judicial or regulatory Authority, provided, that
          the Party transmitting such Information gives the other Party
          reasonable notice and opportunity to seek confidential treatment of
          such Information by any such Authority.

10.5      For the purposes of the Agreement, Information shall not be considered
          to be confidential if such Information is:

          a) in or passed into the public domain other than by breach of this
          Article; or

          b) known to a receiving Party prior to the disclosure by a disclosing
          Party; or

          c) disclosed to a receiving Party without restriction by a third party
          having the full right to disclose; or

          d) independently developed by a receiving Party to whom no disclosure
          of confidential Information relevant to such Information has been
          made.

10.6      Article 10 shall survive the termination of the Agreement for a period
          of ten (10) years.

11.  Data Privacy

11.1      Each Party's obligations hereunder to transfer information to the
          other Party shall not apply to the extent that a Party is prohibited
          from doing so by applicable regulations and laws applicable to Roaming
          and/or data protection.

11.2      The Parties confirm that they shall comply with applicable Data
          Privacy Regulations/Laws. Further Details of Data Privacy aspects are
          given in Annexes C.6. and I.6

12.  Fraud Prevention

     The Parties shall co-operate in good faith regarding the procedures
     concerning fraudulent or unauthorised use by Roaming Subscribers.
     Details of Fraud Prevention procedures are given in Annex C.7.

13.  Liability of the Parties

13.1      In no event shall either Party be liable for any consequential damage
          or loss of whatsoever nature, including but not limited to, loss of
          profit or loss of business.

14.  Suspension of Services

14.1      Suspension of Services to individual Roaming Subscribers or all
          Roaming Subscribers

          Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the VPMN
          Operator may without liability suspend or terminate all or any of its
          Services to Roaming Subscriber(s) in circumstances where it would
          suspend or terminate those Services to its own subscribers, including
          but not limited to:

          a) subscribers using equipment which is defective or illegal;

          b) subscribers causing any technical or other problems on the VPMN
          Operator's network;

          c) suspected fraudulent or unauthorised use;

          d) authentication of the subscription not being possible; or

          e) maintenance or enhancement of the network.

14.2      Suspension of Services to all Roaming Subscribers by VPMN Operator

          In case of a proposed suspension of Services to all Roaming
          Subscribers, the VPMN Operator shall use its best efforts to give four
          (4) weeks written notice to the other Party prior to the suspension
          taking effect. If the suspension continues for more than six (6)
          months, the other Party shall have the right to terminate the
          Agreement by written notice.

14.3      Suspension of Services to all Roaming Subscribers by HPMN Operator

          The HPMN Operator has the right at any time, without discriminating
          among operators and without liability, by giving reasoned written
          notice to the VPMN Operator, to suspend access to the VPMN Services
          for its own subscribers Roaming in the VPMN, or if it is technically
          more practicable, to require that the VPMN Operator takes actions to
          suspend all of its Services to Roaming Subscribers of the HPMN
          Operator. The VPMN Operator shall use its best efforts to comply with
          such requirement within five (5) working days after receipt of the
          notice.

          The suspension shall be removed as soon as the reason for the
          suspension has been overcome by the VPMN Operator to the reasonable
          satisfaction of the HPMN Operator.

15.  Force Majeure

15.1      Non-performance of either Party's obligations pursuant to the
          Agreement or delay in performing same shall not constitute a breach of
          the Agreement if to the extent, and for as long as, it is due to a
          force majeure event, including, but not being limited to, governmental
          action, or requirement of regulatory authority, lockouts, strikes,
          shortage of transportation, war, rebellion or other military action,
          fire, flood, natural catastrophes, or any other unforeseeable
          obstacles that a Party is not able to overcome with reasonable
          efforts, or non-performance of obligations by a sub-contractor to a
          Party pursuant to any of the aforementioned reasons. The Party
          prevented from fulfilling its obligations shall on becoming aware of
          such event inform the other Party in writing of such force majeure
          event as soon as possible. If the force majeure event continues for
          more than six (6) months, either Party shall have the right to
          terminate the Agreement with immediate effect by written notice.

15.2      If the affected Party fails to inform the other Party of the
          occurrence of a force majeure event in accordance with Article 15.1
          above, then such Party thereafter shall not be entitled to refer to
          such event as force majeure as a reason for non-fulfilment, to the
          extent such Party is disadvantaged by such delay. This obligation does
          not apply if the force majeure event is known by both Parties or the
          affected Party is unable to inform the other Party due to the force
          majeure event.

16.  Duration of the Agreement

          The initial term of this Agreement shall expire on the tenth (10th)
          anniversary of the Starting Date. Unless either party provides the
          other with no less than ninety (90) days notice prior to the
          expiration of the initial term, the Agreement shall continue on a
          month-to-month basis, subject to termination by either party on ninety
          (90) days notice

17.  Termination of the Agreement

17.1      In addition to the conditions of Article 16, the Agreement may be
          terminated as follows:

          a) by mutual agreement of the Parties; or

          b) by one of the Parties, with immediate effect, when the other party
          is in material breach of the Agreement and does not remedy, or is not
          capable of remedying, such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt
          of a written notice to such effect; or

          c) by AWS with immediate effect if DCS no longer owns or operates the
          Alaska Markets or assigns this Agreement in contravention of Article
          19.1;

          d) by one of the Parties, with immediate effect, if the other Party
          becomes bankrupt or insolvent or if that other Party enters into any
          composition or arrangement with its creditors and that other Party is
          not able to ensure performance of its obligations under the Agreement
          by a guarantee from a first class bank, payable on first written
          demand; or

          e) by written notice of either Party to the other in the event that
          Roaming becomes technically or commercially impracticable on either
          Party's network and the provisions set out in Article 14 are not
          sufficient to solve the problem or if an unacceptable level of
          unauthorized use occurs and the other Party is not capable of
          remedying such unauthorized use within sixty (60) days of receipt of a
          written notice to such effect; or

          f) subject to Article 19.1 by one of the Parties, with immediate
          effect, in the event a final order by the relevant governmental
          authority revoking or denying renewal of the GSM license(s) or
          permission to operate a GSM network(s) granted to the other Party, or
          any other license necessary to operate the GSM Services, takes effect.

18.  Changes to the Agreement, Annexes and Addenda

18.1      Any amendments and/or additions to the Agreement and/or Annexes and/or
          Addenda shall be valid only if made in writing and signed by duly
          authorized representatives of both Parties hereto.

18.2      It is also recognised by the Parties that it may be appropriate to
          seek changes to the Agreement in the light of experience and
          development in the GSM Association and the establishment of Roaming
          between the Parties. Accordingly, in such event the Parties shall
          enter into good faith discussions with a view to agreeing mutually
          acceptable modifications to the Agreement.

19.  Miscellaneous

19.1      Successors and Assigns

          The Agreement and the rights and obligations specified herein shall be
          binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective legal successors
          and permitted assigns, and neither Party shall sell, transfer or
          assign the Agreement or any part, interest, right or obligation
          hereunder, except that a Party shall have the right to transfer or
          assign the Agreement in whole (but not in part) to an Affiliated
          Company who is also the Signatory to the GSM Association provided that
          such assignee expressly assumes, by written instrument approved by the
          Parties, all of the obligations of such Party hereunder and thereby
          becomes a Party hereunder, it being understood that such assignment
          shall not release the assigning Party of its obligations under Article
          10 of this Agreement. No person other than a Party to the Agreement
          shall acquire any rights hereunder as a third-party beneficiary or
          otherwise by virtue of the Agreement.

19.2      Headings

          The headings of the Agreement are for the convenience of reference
          only and shall in no way limit or affect the meaning or interpretation
          of the provisions of the Agreement.

19.3      No waiver

          Failure by any Party at any time or times to require performance of
          any provisions of the Agreement shall in no manner affect its rights
          to enforce the same, and the waiver by any Party of any breach of any
          provisions of the Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver by
          such Party of any succeeding breach of such provision or waiver by
          such Party of any breach of any other provision hereof.

19.4      Provisions severable

          If any part of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
          such determination shall not invalidate any other provision of the
          Agreement; and the Parties shall attempt, through negotiations in good
          faith, to replace any part of the Agreement so held to be invalid or
          unenforceable. The failure of the Parties to agree on such replacement
          shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of the Agreement.

20.  Choice of Law

     The Agreement and any matters relating hereto shall be governed by and
     construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New
     York.

21.  Dispute Resolution & Arbitration

21.1      The parties shall use and strictly adhere to the following dispute
          resolution processes, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
          Section 21.1, to resolve any and all disputes, controversies or
          claims, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory (hereinafter,
          "Dispute(s)"), arising out of or relating to this Agreement (and any
          prior agreement this Agreement supersedes), including without
          limitation, its making, termination, non-renewal, its alleged breach
          and the subject matter of this Agreement:

21.2      The parties shall first attempt to settle each Dispute through good
          faith negotiations. The aggrieved party shall initiate such
          negotiations by giving the other party written notice of the existence
          and nature of the Dispute. The other party shall in writing to the
          aggrieved party acknowledge such notice of Dispute within ten (10)
          business days. Such acknowledgement may also set forth any Dispute
          that the acknowledging party desires to have resolved in accordance
          with this Section.

21.3      Thereafter, if any Dispute is not resolved by the parties through
          negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the notice
          of acknowledgement, either party may terminate informal negotiations
          with respect to that Dispute and request that the Dispute be submitted
          to non-binding mediation. Any mediation of a Dispute under this
          Section shall be conducted by the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution
          ("CPR") in accordance with the then current CPR "Model Mediation
          Procedure for Business Disputes" ("Model Procedures") and the
          procedures specified in this Section to the extent that they conflict
          with, modify or add to such Model Procedures. Any demand for
          initiation of mediation of a Dispute must be given in writing to both
          the other party involved and to the CPR and must set forth the nature
          of the Dispute. Each party to the mediation shall bear its own
          expenses with respect to mediation and the parties shall share equally
          the fees and expenses of the CPR and the mediator. The failure by a
          party to timely pay its share of the mediation fees and expenses of
          the CPR and the mediator shall be a bar to arbitration under Section
          21.4 of that party's Dispute(s). Any mediation under this Section
          shall be conducted within the State of New York at a site selected by
          the mediator that is reasonably convenient to the parties. Each party
          shall be represented in the mediation by representatives having final
          settlement authority with respect to the Dispute(s). All information
          and documents disclosed in mediation by any party shall remain private
          and confidential to the disclosing party and may not be disclosed by
          any party outside the mediation. No privilege or right with respect to
          any information or document disclosed in mediation shall be waived or
          lost by such disclosure.

21.4      Any dispute not finally resolved after negotiation and mediation in
          accordance with Sections 21.2 and 21.3 shall, upon the written demand
          of any involved party delivered to the other party and the CPR, be
          finally resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the
          then current CPR "Non-Administered Arbitration Rules" ("Arbitration
          Rules") and the procedures specified in this Section to the extent
          that they conflict with, modify or add to such Arbitration Rules. Any
          Dispute of any other party not finally resolved after negotiation and
          mediation pursuant to Sections 21.2 and 21.3 may be made a part of the
          arbitration demanded by another party, provided that the written
          notice of demand for arbitration of that Dispute is received by the
          CPR before selection of an arbitrator by the CPR. Any demand for
          arbitration of a Dispute received by the CPR after the selection of
          the arbitrator must be resolved through a separate arbitration
          proceeding in accordance with the Section. Each party shall bear its
          own expenses with respect to arbitration and the parties shall share
          equally the fees and expenses of the CPR and the arbitrator. Unless
          otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing, the arbitration
          shall be conducted by one (1) neutral arbitrator. The arbitration
          shall be conducted in the State of New York at a site selected by the
          arbitrator that is reasonably convenient to the parties. The
          arbitrator shall be bound by and strictly enforce the terms of the
          Agreement and may not limit, expand, or otherwise modify the terms of
          this Agreement. The arbitrator shall make a good faith effort to apply
          applicable law, but an arbitration decision and award shall not be
          subject to review because of errors of law. The arbitrator shall have
          the sole authority to resolve issues of the arbitrability of any
          Dispute, including the applicability or running of any statute of
          limitation. The arbitrator shall not have power to award damages in
          connection with any Dispute in excess of actual compensatory damages
          or to award punitive damages and each party irrevocably waives any
          claim thereto. The arbitrator shall not have the power to order
          pre-hearing discovery of documents or the taking of depositions. The
          arbitrator may compel, to the extent provided by the FAA (as
          hereinafter defined), attendance of witnesses and the production of
          documents at the hearing. The arbitrator's decision and award shall be
          made and delivered to the parties within six (6) months of selection
          of the arbitrator by the CPR and judgment on the award by the
          arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

21.5      This Section shall be interpreted, governed by and enforced in
          accordance with the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections
          1-14 (the "Federal Arbitration Act" or "FAA"). The laws of the State
          of New York, except those pertaining to choice of law, arbitration of
          disputes and those pertaining to the tie limits for bringing an action
          that conflict with the terms of this Dispute resolution provision,
          shall govern all other substantive matters pertaining to the
          interpretation and enforcement of the other terms of this Agreement
          with respect to any Dispute. Any party to a Dispute, which is the
          subject of a notice initiating the Dispute resolution procedures under
          this Section, may seek a temporary injunction in any state or federal
          court of competent jurisdiction to the limited extent necessary to
          preserve the status quo during the pendency of final resolution of a
          Dispute in accordance with this Section. If court proceedings to stay
          litigation of a Dispute or compel arbitration of a Dispute are
          necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings shall
          pay all associated costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees that the other
          party reasonably incurs in connection with such court proceedings. An
          order to pay such costs, expenses and attorney fees shall become part
          of any decision and award of the arbitrator of the Dispute. An
          arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 21.4 to resolve a Dispute may
          also issue such injunctive orders and shall have the power to modify
          or dissolve the injunctive order of any court to the extent it
          pertains to the Dispute which the arbitrator has been selected to
          finally resolve. The parties, their representatives, other
          participants, and the mediator and arbitrator shall hold the
          existence, content and result of the mediation and arbitration of a
          Dispute in confidence except to the limited extent necessary to
          enforce a final settlement agreement or to obtain and secure
          enforcement of or a judgment on an arbitration decision and award.

21.6      The statute(s) of limitation applicable to any Dispute shall be tolled
          upon initiation of the Dispute resolution procedures under this
          Section and shall remain tolled until the Dispute is resolved by
          mediation or arbitration under this Section. Tolling shall cease if
          the aggrieved party with a Dispute does not initiate mediation within
          sixty (60) calendar days after good faith negotiations are terminated
          by any party and, after mediation of a Dispute, if the aggrieved party
          with a Dispute does not initiate a demand for arbitration within sixty
          (60) calendar days after mediation is terminated. However, any Dispute
          is forever barred that has not expressly been made the subject of the
          written notice required under Section 21.2 above hereafter within have
          to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or
          any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute
          in the Southern District of New York and New York County. Each of the
          Parties hereby agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
          enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
          other manner provided by law. Each of the Parties hereby consents to
          process being served by any party to this Agreement in any actions by
          the transmittal of a copy thereof to such Party at the address listed
          on the first page of this Agreement.

                               [Letterhead of AWS]

[Closing Date]

Chief Executive Officer
Dobson Cellular Systems, Inc.

Re:      System Operator Code Issues


Dear Everett:

This letter agreement sets forth the terms pursuant to which Dobson Cellular
Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Dobson") may use the AT&T Wireless
Services, Inc. ("AWS") System Operator Code ("SOC"; and, each phone which is
programmed to search for the AWS SOC, a "SOC-locked phone") in the Anchorage,
Alaska MSA and the portions of the AK-2 RSA (collectively, the "Alaska Markets")
that AWS is transferring to Dobson pursuant to an Asset Exchange Agreement dated
as of December 24, 2002 (the "Asset Exchange Agreement") between Dobson and AWS.
The execution of this letter agreement is a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Exchange Agreement.

In order to facilitate the transfer of the Alaska Markets from AWS to Dobson,
AWS hereby grants Dobson the right to use the AWS SOC in the Alaska Markets
during the period (the "Term") from the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the
five-year anniversary of the last date (the "Last Sales Date") on which a
SOC-locked phone is sold by Dobson in the Alaska Markets (which date shall not
be later than the first date on which AWS is no longer providing AWS Transition
Services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement (as defined in the
Exchange Agreement) and (b) the first date on which the Benchmark Calculation
(as defined below) is 7.5% or less. Within 30 days of the end of each quarter,
Dobson shall provide AWS a written report setting forth the Benchmark
Calculation. For purposes of this letter agreement, the term "Benchmark
Calculation" shall mean the quotient derived from dividing the number of phones
in use in the Alaska Markets at the time of calculation which were also in use
as of the Last Sales Date by the total number of phones which were in use in the
Alaska Markets as of the Last Sales Date, multiplied by one hundred (100) (it
being understood that Dobson shall not provide service to a subscriber who uses
a SOC-locked phone if such subscriber is no longer eligible to receive service
from Dobson in accordance with Dobson's customary business practices).

After expiration of the Term, (a) AWS may terminate Dobson's right to use the
AWS SOC upon 120 days' written notice to Dobson and (b) Dobson may discontinue
using the AWS SOC upon 30 days' written notice to AWS.

AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts, at Dobson's expense, to facilitate
an over-the-air change of the alpha tag on the SOC-locked phones, if necessary,
in the event of a brand change in the Alaska Markets.

We request that you sign and return the enclosed copy of this letter indicating
your agreement to the terms set forth above. If you have any questions, please
contact me.

Sincerely,


Mark D. Bradner
Corporate Development



AGREED TO AND ACCEPTED BY:
