insurance on the Employee&#146;s life. The Trust was created by the Employee as of March 19, 1999 for the principal benefit of the Employee&#146;s family. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

in connection therewith (collectively the &#147;Policies&#148;). The Company has advised the Employee that the lower of the &#147;P.S. 58&#148; rates or the Insurers&#146; own rates for one-year term insurance may be taxable as income to him to the
extent the Trust does not annually pay for this economic benefit and that the split-dollar arrangement may have other tax consequences. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P
