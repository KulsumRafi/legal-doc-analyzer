Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reduction provided for herein shall be made only if the amount of the reduction in the payments specified in Section 5.a. is less than the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code on the portion of the Total Payments which constitute "excess parachute payments."  The tax counsel selected pursuant to this Section 5.b. may consult with tax counsel for the Executive, but shall have complete, sole and final discretion to determine which Severance Benefits shall be reduced and the amounts of the required reductions.

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><U>Date of Termination</B></I></U>.  For purposes of this Agreement, the date of termination of the Executive's employment shall be the date notice is given to the Executive by the Company and/or any successor or, in the case of a Constructive Discharge, the date set forth in a written notice given to the Company by the Executive, provided that the Executive gives such notice within twelve (12) calendar months of the Constructive Discharge in the case of a Change of Control, and within six (6) calendar months of the Constructive Discharge in other cases, and specifies thereof the event constituting the Constructive Discharge.</P>

<P>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Employment Period, he shall support the Company's interests and efforts in all regulatory, administrative, judicial or other proceedings affecting the Company and, after the termination of her employment with the Company, he shall use best efforts to comply with all reasonable requests of the Company that he cooperate with the Company, whether by giving testimony or otherwise, in regulatory, administrative, judicial or other proceedings affecting the Company except any proceeding in which he may be in a position adverse to that of the Company.

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>9.  <B><I><U>General Release</B></I></U>.   The obligations of the Company to make any post-termination payments under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under Sections 4.a., 5.a., 5.c. and 8.b.) are contingent upon the prior receipt by the Company of a general release reasonably satisfactory to the Company releasing the Company, and all parties connected therewith, from any and all claims and liabilities which the Executive may have against the Company, including any claims arising out of or in any way connected with the Executive's employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates, and the termination of said employment relationship.  In the event that the Executive (or the Executive's estate, in the event of the death of the Executive) fails to execute and deliver the general release described above within 60 days of the date of receipt of the release, the Company shall be relieved of all obligations to make any post-termination payments of any kind or nature under this Agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>10.  <B><I><U>No Mitigation</B></I></U>.  The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>11.  <B><I><U>Assignment</B></I></U>.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Company hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company, including without limitation any corporation or other entity acquiring all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by operation of law or otherwise.  This Agreement and the rights of the Executive hereunder shall not be assignable by the Executive, and any assignment by the Executive shall be null and void.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>12.  <B><I><U>Arbitration</B></I></U>.  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in Augusta, Maine, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The pendency of any such dispute or controversy shall not affect any rights or obligations under this Agreement.  Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>13.  <B><I><U>Waiver; Amendment</B></I></U>.  The failure of either party to enforce, or any delay in enforcing, any rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such rights, unless such waiver is an express written waiver which has been signed by the waiving party.  Waiver of any one breach shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other provision hereof.  This Agreement can be amended only by written instrument signed by each party hereto and no course of dealing or practice or failure to enforce or delay in enforcing any rights hereunder may be claimed to have effected an amendment of this Agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>14.  <B><I><U>Singular Contract</B></I></U>.  This Agreement is a singular agreement between the Executive and the Company, and is not part of a general "plan" or "program" for employees as a group.  This Agreement shall, under no circumstances, be deemed to be an "employee welfare benefit plan" or an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as "ERISA").  Notwithstanding, the Company may submit a letter to the Department of Labor indicating the possible establishment of a so-called unfunded "top hat" plan for the benefit of a select group of management and highly compensated employees to avoid the costs and uncertainties which may occur in the event of a Department of Labor audit and challenge relative to compliance with any allegedly applicable provisions of ERISA.  The Executive specifically acknowledges and agrees that the filing of the so-called "top hat" letter notice by the Company shall not be construed or interpreted as an admission on the part of the Company that this Agreement constitutes an ERISA plan, and the Company hereby categorically states, and the Executive hereby agrees, that this Agreement is an <I>ad hoc</I> individual contract with the Executive.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>15.  <B><I><U>Notices</B></I></U>.  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and sent by first-class, registered or certified mail or hand-delivered to the Executive at the last residence address he has provided to the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal executive offices to the attention of the Corporate Secretary.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>16.  <B><I><U>Titles and Captions</B></I></U>.  The section and paragraph titles and captions contained herein are for convenience only and shall not be held to explain, modify, amplify, or aid in the interpretation, construction or meaning of the provisions of this Agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>17.  <B><I><U>Miscellaneous</B></I></U>.  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Maine.  In the event that any provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>18.  <B><I><U>Entire Agreement</B></I></U>.  The terms of this Agreement are intended by the parties to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the employment of the Executive by the Company and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF</B>, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement effective as of the date first written above.</P>
