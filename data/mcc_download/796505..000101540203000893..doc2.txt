     limitation, any environmental contamination or pollution, and the Company
     has not, at its option and expense, wholly repaired such Assets or replaced
     such Assets with assets which are as nearly identical as practicable in
     value, form and function, Buyer shall have the right, at its sole
     discretion and election, to either (i) terminate this Agreement or (ii)
     subject to the other terms of this Agreement, complete the purchase
     contemplated by this Agreement in which event:

                  (i)   The Company shall assign and transfer to Buyer and Buyer
          shall be entitled to receive all insurance proceeds and other
          compensation collected by reason of such loss, damage or destruction,
          together with any rights to receive any uncollected insurance proceeds


                                       12
<PAGE>
          or other compensation relating to such loss, damage or destruction and
          an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate amount of any applicable
          deductibles under any insurance policies covering the lost, damaged or
          destroyed Assets plus any self-insured retentions; or

                  (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the Purchase Price of
          the Assets by an amount equal to the cost of repair, or if destroyed
          or damaged beyond repair, or if expropriated, seized, lost or stolen,
          by an amount equal to the replacement cost; or

                  (iii) Buyer shall be entitled to utilize alternatives 1 and 2
          concurrently, but not both with respect to any single Asset.

     If Buyer elects to complete the purchase contemplated hereby
notwithstanding any such loss, damage or destruction, and if the Company assigns
such insurance proceeds and other compensation and any other rights thereto to
Buyer, then, at the Buyer's reasonable request,  the Company shall cooperate
with Buyer, at no cost or expense to Buyer, in collecting all insurance proceeds
and other compensation with respect thereto.

     The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any deductible amounts
under such insurance policies and self-insured retentions which are not paid by
the Company to Buyer.

Company as of their respective dates and the results of its operations for the

described in the Disclosure Letter hereto, the Company does not have any
Liabilities (and there is no basis for any present or future proceeding against

     The Assets, including without limitation buildings, plants, structures, and
equipment of the Company are structurally sound, are in good operating condition
and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are adequate for the uses to

shall use its best efforts and shall cooperate with Buyer with respect to the
transfer to Buyer of all existing manufacturers', vendors', installers' and

from material defects in material or workmanship for the term and under the
conditions set forth in the Company's standard written product warranties.
Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, during the three (3) years
immediately preceding the date hereof, the Company has not received a claim
based upon an alleged breach of product warranty, or arising from manufacture or
sale of its products ("Product Liability Claims").  The Company has no

experience with respect thereto.

     3.10   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

     All accounts receivable of the Company that are reflected on the accounting
records of the Company as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Accounts
Receivable") represent or will represent valid obligations arising from sales
actually made or services actually performed in the Ordinary Course of Business.
To Shareholders' Knowledge, the Accounts Receivable are or will be as of the
Closing Date current and collectible net of the respective reserves shown on the
accounting records of the Company as of the Closing Date (which reserves are
adequate and calculated consistent with past practice and, in the case of the
reserve as of the Closing Date, will not represent a material adverse change in
the composition of such Accounts Receivable in terms of aging). Subject to such
reserves and except as described in the Disclosure Letter,, each of the Accounts
Receivable either has been or, to Shareholders' Knowledge, will be collected in
full, without any set-off, within ninety days after the day on which it first
becomes due and payable. The Company has not received written notice of any
contest, claim, or right of set-off under any Contract with any obligor of an
Accounts Receivable relating to the amount or validity of such Accounts
Receivable. The Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all

Course of Business and are of good quality and in good condition and sufficient
for the purpose for which they were purchased and/or manufactured.  Except as
described in the Disclosure Letter, the Inventory has been purchased and/or
manufactured in the Ordinary Course of Business and is consistent with the
anticipated requirements of the Company's business, and the volume of purchases
and/or production thereof and of orders therefor have not been reduced or
increased in anticipation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

deficiencies proposed as a result of any such audits have been paid, reserved
against, settled, or, as described in the Disclosure Letter, are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The Disclosure Letter describes all
adjustments to the United States federal income Tax Returns filed by the Company
for all taxable years since its inception, and the resulting adjustments
proposed by the IRS. Except as described in the Disclosure Letter, neither
Shareholders nor the Company has given or been requested to give waivers or
extensions (or is or would be subject to a waiver or extension given by any
other Person) of any statute of limitations relating to the Tax Returns of the
Company.

     (c)     The charges, accruals, and reserves with respect to Taxes on the
books of the Company are adequate (determined in accordance with GAAP) and are

                                       34
<PAGE>
     Each party's right of termination under Section 9.1 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of
a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all further obligations of the parties under
this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 11.1 and
11.3 will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a
party because of the Breach of the Agreement by the other party or because one
or more of the conditions to the terminating party's obligations under this

with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party's right to
pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing. The
right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such

any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of
Damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants,
and obligations.

     10.2  INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS

     The Company and the Shareholders, jointly and severally, will indemnify and

     (b)     A claim by Buyer with respect to any representation or warranty of

     10.5  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

     (a)     Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10.2,
10.4, or (to the extent provided in the last sentence of Section 10.3) Section
10.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party
under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of
such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified
party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the
defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party's failure to give
such notice.

     (b)     If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.5(a) is brought against
an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent
that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such
Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity
to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such
Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying
party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in
connection with the defense of such Proceeding.  If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for
purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within
the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of
such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified
party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on
any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party, and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its
consent.  If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any
Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within twenty (20) days after
the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party
will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or
settlement effected by the indemnified party.

     (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may
adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages
for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive
right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying
party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld).

<PAGE>
10.6     PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--OTHER CLAIMS

     A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought.

10.7     LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION

     Neither Buyer, the Company, nor the Shareholders shall be required to
provide indemnification for the breach or falsity of any representation or
warranty unless and until the indemnified party has sustained cumulative losses
as a result of one or more such breaches or falsities of at least Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000). Once such cumulative losses equal or exceed the sum of Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000), the indemnifying party shall provide indemnification
for all losses sustained as a result of such breach(es) or falsity(ies) in
excess of such sum.

11.     GENERAL PROVISIONS

     11.1  EXPENSES

     Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including without

this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including all fees and expenses of agents, representatives,
counsel, and accountants.  The Company will not incur, and the Shareholders will
cause the Company not to incur, any out-of-pocket expenses in connection with

of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such
party arising from a Breach of this Agreement by another party.

     Any public announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions will be issued, if at all, at such time, in

provided, however, that Buyer may make any announcement it reasonably deems
necessary to comply with Legal Requirements without prior consultation with the
Company or Shareholders.  Unless consented to by Buyer in advance or required by
Legal Requirements, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and the
Shareholders shall cause the Company to, keep this Agreement strictly
confidential and may not make any disclosure of this Agreement to any Person.
The Company, Shareholders, and Buyer will consult with each other concerning the
