         or the Assuming Bank, respectively, pursuant to subsection (a) hereof
         shall be estimated as of the month end prior to Closing Date ("Interim
         Balance Sheet") and a settlement payment ("Settlement Payment") shall
         be made at Closing based upon the Interim Balance Sheet. Within 10 days
         prior to the Closing Date, or at such time as the parties mutually
         agree, Seller and the Assuming Bank shall jointly determine the
         Settlement Payment required at Closing. Within 30 days after the
         Closing Date, or at such time as the parties may mutually agree, Seller
         and the Assuming Bank shall jointly determine the actual settlement
         payment required by subsection (a) above and the Closing Balance Sheet,
         as applicable, and make appropriate adjustments ("Post-Closing
         Settlement Payment").

                  (c)      In the event any bookkeeping omissions or errors are
         discovered in preparing any balance sheet for the Purchased Branch or
         in completing the transfer and assumptions contemplated hereby, the
         parties agree to correct such errors and omissions, it being understood
         that no adjustments will be made that are inconsistent with the
         judgments, methods, policies, or accounting principles utilized by
         Seller in preparing and maintaining the accounting records of the
         Purchased Branch. Adjustments made pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) are
         not intended to bring the accounting records of the Purchased Branch
         into accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

         7.2      FORM OF PAYMENT. The Settlement Payment shall be made in
immediately available funds on the Closing Date by the Assuming Bank if the
Settlement Payment is a positive number and by Seller if the Settlement Payment
is a negative number.

         7.3      INTEREST. The Post-Closing Settlement Payment shall bear no
interest.

         7.4      SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS. In the event that the Assuming Bank or
Seller discovers any errors or omissions as contemplated by Section 7.1(c) or
any error with respect to the payments made under Section 7.1(b) after the
Settlement Date, the Assuming Bank and Seller agree to promptly correct any such
error or omission, make any payments and effect any

transfers or assumptions as may be necessary to reflect any such correction;
provided, that interest shall not be paid with respect to any such payments.

         7.5      CLOSING. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to the
provisions of Section 14.11, and subject to the conditions of Article IX hereof,
the closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and assumption of the Acquired
Assets and Liabilities Assumed as provided by Sections 2.1 and 3.1 shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, at the offices of Locke Liddell & Sapp
LLP, Houston, Texas, on a mutually agreeable date within ten (10) business days
or as promptly as practicable after receipt of all regulatory approvals, the
expiration of all waiting periods and the satisfaction of all conditions to
Closing under this Agreement, or at such other place, time and date as the
parties may agree. The date and time of the Closing are herein referred to as
the "Closing Date." For purposes of this Agreement, the Closing shall be deemed
to be effective immediately following the close of business on the date on which
the Closing shall occur.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                             CONTINUING COOPERATION

         8.1      GENERAL MATTERS. The parties hereto agree that they will, in
good faith and with their best efforts, cooperate with each other to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to effect the purposes
hereof.

         8.2      ADDITIONAL TITLE DOCUMENTS. Seller and the Assuming Bank each
agree, at any time, and from time to time, upon the request of any party hereto,
to execute and deliver such additional instruments and documents of conveyance
as shall be reasonably necessary to vest in the appropriate party its full legal
or equitable title in and to the property transferred pursuant to this Agreement
or to be transferred in accordance herewith. The Assuming Bank shall prepare
such instruments and documents of conveyance (in form and substance satisfactory
to Seller) as shall be necessary to vest title in the Assuming Bank to the
Acquired Assets. The Assuming Bank shall be responsible for recording such
instruments and documents of conveyance at its own expense.

         8.3      PAYMENT OF DEPOSITS.

                  (a)      In the event any depositor does not accept the
         obligation of the Assuming Bank to pay any Deposit of the Purchased
         Branch assumed by the Assuming Bank pursuant to this Agreement and
         asserts a claim against Seller for all or any portion of any such
         Deposit, the Assuming Bank agrees on demand to provide to Seller, as
         the case may be, funds sufficient to pay such claim in an amount not in
         excess of the Deposit reflected on the books of the Assuming Bank at
         the time such claim is made. Upon payment of such amount by the
         Assuming Bank to Seller, as the case may be, the Assuming Bank shall be
         discharged from any further obligation under this Agreement to pay to
         any such depositor the amount of such Deposit paid to Seller.

<PAGE>

                  (b)      For a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days
         after the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly reimburse the Assuming
         Bank for any (i) amount the Assuming Bank refunds to depositors of the
         Purchased Branch in interest adjustments after the Closing Date arising
         out of errors occurring prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any prepaid
         fees which the Assuming Bank is required to refund to depositors of the
         Purchased Branch after the Closing Date as a result of the cancellation
         of services formerly provided by Seller, in accordance with the
         applicable schedules of service charges for which such depositors had
         prepaid Seller prior to the Closing Date.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         10.1     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER. Seller represents
and warrants to the Assuming Bank as follows:

                  (a)      Corporate Existence and Authority. Seller (i) is duly
         organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
         State of Texas and has full power and authority to own and operate its
         properties and to conduct its business as now conducted by it, and (ii)
         subject to regulatory approval, has full power and authority to execute
         and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this
         Agreement in accordance with its terms. Seller has taken all necessary
         corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
         of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions contemplated
         hereby.

                  (b)      Third Party Consents. Except as set forth on Schedule
         10.1(b), no Governmental Authority or other third party consents
         (including but not limited to approvals, licenses, registrations, or
         declarations) are required in connection with execution, delivery, or
         performance by Seller of this Agreement.

                  (c)      Execution and Enforceability. This Agreement has been
         duly executed and delivered by Seller. Upon the due authorization,
         execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Assuming Bank, this
         Agreement will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
         Seller, enforceable, (subject to regulatory approval) in accordance
         with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
         bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
         laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general
         equity principles.

                  (d)      Title and Right to Convey. Seller has good title to,
         and is the sole owner of, all of the Acquired Assets, free and clear of
         any lien, pledge, claim, security interest, encumbrance, charge or
         restriction of any kind; except for the Permitted Encumbrances.

                  (e)      Compliance with Law.

                           (i)      The Acquired Assets and Liabilities Assumed
                  are not in violation of any statute, regulation, order,
                  decision, judgment, or decree of, or any restriction imposed
                  by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Seller
                  or any assets or liabilities of Seller, or any foreign
                  government or agency thereof having such jurisdiction, with
                  respect to the conduct of the business of Seller, the nature
                  of the Deposits of the Purchased Branch held by Seller or the
                  ownership of the assets of Seller, which, either individually
                  or in the aggregate with all other such violations, would
                  materially and adversely affect the Acquired Assets or the
                  Liabilities Assumed, or the ability of Seller to perform,
                  satisfy, or observe any obligation or condition under this
                  Agreement or which would otherwise have a Material Adverse
                  Effect on the Purchased Branch.

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     Neither the execution and delivery nor the
                  performance by Seller of this Agreement will result in any
                  violation by Seller of, or be in conflict with, any provision
                  of any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, or
                  decree of any Governmental Authority.

                           (iii)    The Deposits are insured by the FDIC to the
                  fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and
                  assessments due and payable in connection therewith have been
                  paid by Seller.

                           (iv)     All Records and accountings of Seller
                  (including, when prepared, the Interim Closing Balance Sheet
                  and Closing Balance Sheet) are maintained in all material
                  respects in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
                  requirements, reflect only actual transactions, and reflect in
                  all material respects assets, liabilities, accruals and items
                  of income and expense in accordance with generally accepted
                  accounting principles consistently applied. All Records and
                  accountings of the Purchased Branch are true, complete and
                  correct in all material respects.

                  (f)      Compliance with Law and Other Obligations.

                           (i)      Seller is not in violation or breach of or
                  in default under (A) any obligation, agreement, covenant, or
                  condition contained in its charter or organizational
                  documents, articles of association, or by-laws or (B) any
                  contract, lease, or other instrument to which Seller is a
                  party (or which is binding on Seller or any assets of Seller),
                  which violation, breach, or default, either individually or in
                  the aggregate with all such other violations, breaches and
                  defaults, would materially and adversely affect the Acquired
                  Assets or the Liabilities Assumed or Seller's ability to
                  perform, satisfy, or observe any obligation or condition under
                  this Agreement or which would otherwise have a Material
                  Adverse Effect on the Purchased Branch.

                           (ii)     Neither the execution and delivery nor the
                  performance by Seller of this Agreement will result in a
                  violation, breach of, or default under or be in conflict with:
                  (A) its organizational documents or charter, articles of
                  association, or by-laws, or (B) any other agreement or
                  instrument to which Seller is a party, or which is binding on
                  Seller or the assets of Seller, or (C) any order, decree,
                  award, or judgment issued by any Governmental Authority which
                  is binding on Seller or any assets of Seller, and will not
                  result in the creation of any Lien on the assets of Seller.

                  (g)      Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 10.1(g)
         hereto, there is no legal action, suit, investigation or proceeding
         (whether or not Seller is a party thereto), claim, controversy or
         contingent liability pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened
         against Seller, any assets of Seller or the Purchased Branch, which
         questions the validity

<PAGE>

         of this Agreement, any Assumed Contract or any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby or which would, if adversely determined, either
         individually or in the aggregate with all such other actions, suits,
         investigations or proceedings if adversely determined, materially and
         adversely affect the Acquired Assets or the Liabilities Assumed or
         Seller's ability to perform, satisfy, or observe any obligation or
         condition under this Agreement or which would otherwise have a Material
         Adverse Effect on the Purchased Branch. There is no injunction, order,
         judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon Seller or the
         Purchased Branch that, either individually or in the aggregate (i) has
         had since March 22, 2001, or could reasonably be expected to have, a
         Material Adverse Effect on the Purchased Branch, or (ii) which has
         affected, or could reasonably be expected to affect, in a materially
         adverse manner, the Acquired Assets, the Liabilities Assumed or
         Seller's ability to perform, satisfy or observe any obligation or
         condition under this Agreement. To the knowledge of Seller, there are
         no facts, circumstances or conditions affecting the Purchased Branch
         which would indicate or suggest the possibility of any unrecognized
         future loss caused (A) by defalcation, embezzlement or other employee
         malfeasance, or by (B) payments made, cash transactions effected or
         Deposits accepted in violation of any law, rule or regulation.

                  (h)      Environmental Compliance. To Seller's knowledge and
         except as set forth on Schedule 10.1(h), the Seller is in compliance in
         all material respects with all material federal, state, and local laws,
         regulations, and ordinances relating to the environment and to the
         release, emission or discharge of materials, wastes, substances,
         pollutants or contaminants into the air, ground, or water applicable to
         the Bank Premises. There are no material actions, suits, or proceedings
         pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against Seller by or
         before any Governmental Authority, concerning any noncompliance or
         alleged noncompliance with any such laws, regulations, and ordinances.

                  (i)      Loans.

                           (i)      Except as set forth on Schedule 10.1(i), to
                  the knowledge of Seller, (A) each of the Loans was validly and
                  legally made and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
                  the borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms subject
                  to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
                  similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
                  generally and subject to general principles of equity; (B) any
                  mortgage or security agreement relating to each Loan is
                  properly secured and recorded or perfected and represents a
                  valid mortgage or security interest on properties described
                  therein; and (C) no amount owed under any Loan is subject to
                  any meritorious defenses. Seller has not entered into any
                  agreement which, to Seller's knowledge, will result in a
                  future waiver or negation of any material rights or remedies
                  currently available against the borrower (or guarantor, if
                  any) on any such Loan. To Seller's knowledge, no claim,
                  counterclaim, set-off right or other similar right has been
                  asserted, and no grounds for any meritorious claim,
                  counterclaim, set-off right or other similar right exists,
                  with respect to any Loan which could impair the collectability
                  thereof.

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     Except as set forth on Schedule 10.1(i),
                  each mortgage securing a Loan has been, since March 22, 2001,
                  and is evidenced by documentation of the types customarily
                  employed by Seller, which are consistent in all material
                  respects with federal and state banking laws, rules and
                  regulations, and prudent banking practices and standards, and
                  complete copies thereof have been maintained by Seller in
                  accordance with such standards and practices. Seller has duly
                  performed in all material respects all of its obligations
                  under such documentation to the extent that such obligations
                  to perform have accrued.

                           (iii)    Except as set forth on Schedule 10.1(i), to
                  Seller's knowledge, since March 22, 2001, all of the Loans
                  currently held by the Purchased Branch were solicited,
                  originated and currently exist in material compliance with all
                  applicable loan policies and procedures of Seller (as
                  previously described to the Assuming Bank) and comply in all
                  material respects with all applicable federal and state laws,
                  rules and regulations (including applicable usury statutes,
                  the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
                  the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Flood Disaster
                  Protection Act, and other applicable consumer protection
                  statutes and the regulations thereunder).

                           (iv)     If, under generally accepted accounting
                  principles, any reserve should be established in respect of
                  any Loan (or in respect of all Loans in the aggregate as an
                  unallocated reserve), such reserve has been established with
                  respect to such Loan or Loans in the amount set out in
                  Schedule 10.1(i).

                           (v)      Each reserve (if any) identified in Schedule
                  10.1(i) is adequate, in the reasonable and good faith judgment
                  of Seller, to absorb any loss which may occur in respect of
                  the Loan or Loans to which such reserve relates.

         10.2     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ASSUMING BANK. The
Assuming Bank represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

                  (a)      Corporate Existence and Authority. The Assuming Bank
         (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
         laws of the United States and has full power and authority to own and
         operate its properties and to conduct its business as now conducted by
         it, and (ii) subject to regulatory approval, has full power and

                  (b)      Third Party Consents. Except for the consent of the
         Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under 12 U.S.C. Section

<PAGE>

         registrations, or declarations) are required in connection with
         execution, delivery, or performance by the Assuming Bank of this
         Agreement.

                  (c)      Execution and Enforceability. This Agreement has been
         duly executed and delivered by the Assuming Bank. Upon the due
         authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, this
         Agreement will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
         the Assuming Bank, enforceable (subject to regulatory approval) in
         accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited
         by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
         laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general
         equity principles.

                  (d)      Compliance with Law.

                           (i)      The Assuming Bank is not in violation of any
                  statute, regulation, order, decision, judgment, or decree of,
                  or any restriction imposed by any Governmental Authority
                  having jurisdiction over the Assuming Bank or any of its
                  assets, or any foreign government or agency thereof having
                  such jurisdiction, with respect to the conduct of the business
                  of the Assuming Bank, or the ownership of the properties of
                  the Assuming Bank, which, either individually or in the
                  aggregate with all other such violations, would materially and
                  adversely affect the ability of the Assuming Bank to perform,
                  satisfy, or observe any obligation or condition under this
                  Agreement.

                           (ii)     Neither the execution and delivery nor the
                  performance by the Assuming Bank of this Agreement will result
                  in any violation by the Assuming Bank of, or be in conflict
                  with, any provision of any applicable law or regulation, or
                  any order, writ, or decree of any Governmental Authority.

                  (e)      Compliance with Obligations.

                           (i)      The Assuming Bank is not in violation or
                  breach of or in default under (A) any obligation, agreement,
                  covenant, or condition contained in its charter or
                  organizational documents, articles of association, or by-laws
                  or (B) any contract, lease, or other instrument to which the
                  Assuming Bank is a party (or which is binding on the Assuming
                  Bank or any assets of the Assuming Bank), which violation,
                  breach, or default, either individually or in the aggregate
                  with all such other violations, breaches and defaults, would
                  materially and adversely affect the Assuming Bank's ability to
                  perform, satisfy, or observe any obligation or condition under
                  this Agreement.

                           (ii)     Neither the execution and delivery nor the
                  performance by the Assuming Bank of this Agreement will result
                  in a violation, breach of, or default under or be in conflict
                  with: (A) its organizational documents or charter, articles of
                  association, or by-laws, or (B) any other agreement or
                  instrument to which the Assuming Bank is a party, or which is
                  binding on the Assuming Bank or the

<PAGE>

                  assets of Assuming Bank, or (C) any order, decree, award, or
                  judgment issued by any Governmental Authority which is binding
                  on the Assuming Bank or any assets of Assuming Bank, and will
                  not result in the creation of any Lien on the assets of the
                  Assuming Bank.

                  (f)      Litigation. There is no legal action, suit,
         investigation or proceeding (whether or not the Assuming Bank is a
         party thereto) pending or, to Assuming Bank's knowledge, threatened
         against the Assuming Bank or of its any assets which questions the
         validity of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
         hereby or which would, if adversely determined, either individually or
         in the aggregate with all such other actions, suits, investigations or
         proceedings if adversely determined, materially and adversely affect
         the Assuming Bank's ability to perform, satisfy, or observe any
         obligation or condition under this Agreement.

                  (g)      Capital. To he best of the Assuming Bank's knowledge,
         the Assuming Bank has such capital that regulatory approval of this
         transaction should not be denied on the basis of inadequacy of capital.

                           ordinary course consistent with past practice, use
                           reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact
                           the Purchased Branch's business relationships
                           (including relationships with customers), and take no
                           action which would adversely affect or delay the

                           best efforts to not cause nor permit the Purchased

                                    a proposed renewal, amendment or termination
                                    of any commitment with respect to any lease,
                                    contract or agreement involving the
                                    Purchased Branch other than in the ordinary
                                    course of business consistent with past
                                    practice;

                                             (13)     waive any material right,
                                    whether in equity or at law, that it has
                                    with respect to any Loan;

                                             (14)     make less stringent than
                                    as in effect on the date of this Agreement
                                    (and as previously disclosed to the Assuming
                                    Bank) the Purchased Branch's operational
                                    policies, activities or practices (including
                                    practices with respect to customer service
                                    charges, credit underwriting policies or
                                    standards and policies or

                                    charge-off or classification of loans,
                                    reserves and provisions for loan losses, the
                                    placement of loans in non-accrual status,
                                    the acceptance of deposits, the
                                    implementation of know-your-customer and
                                    related standards, and liability
                                    management); or

                                             (15)     bid for public fund
                                    deposits except for renewals of those public
                                    fund deposits set forth on Schedule 11.1(b)
                                    hereof.

                  (c)      Untrue Representations. Seller shall promptly notify
         the Assuming Bank in writing if Seller has knowledge of any fact or
         condition that makes untrue, or shows to have been untrue, in any
         material respect, any schedule or any other information furnished
         pursuant to this Agreement by Seller to the Assuming Bank or any
         representation or warranty made in or pursuant to this Agreement or
         that results in Seller's failure to comply with any covenant, condition
         or agreement contained in this Agreement.

                  (d)      Litigation and Claims. Seller shall promptly notify
         the Assuming Bank in writing if Seller has knowledge of any litigation,
         or of any claim, controversy or contingent liability that might be
         expected to become the subject of litigation affecting the Acquired
         Assets or the Liabilities Assumed (other than garnishment proceedings),
         and Seller shall promptly notify the Assuming Bank of any legal action,
         suit or proceeding or judicial, administrative or governmental
         investigation, pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
         against Seller that questions or might question the validity of this
         Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby, or any actions taken
         or to be taken by Seller pursuant hereto or thereto or seeks to enjoin
         or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  (e)      Adverse Changes. Seller shall promptly notify in
         writing the Assuming Bank if, to Seller's knowledge, any change or
         development shall have occurred or been threatened with regard to
         Seller, the Acquired Assets or the Liabilities Assumed that has or may
         reasonably be expected to have or lead to a Material Adverse Effect on
         Seller, the Acquired Assets or the Liabilities Assumed. Notwithstanding
         the disclosure to the Assuming Bank of any such change, Seller shall
         not be relieved of any liability to the Assuming Bank pursuant to this
         Agreement for, nor shall the providing of such information by Seller to
         the Assuming Bank be deemed a waiver by the Assuming Bank of, the
         breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
         Agreement.

                  (f)      Investigation. Between the date of this Agreement and
         the Closing Date, Seller shall afford to the Assuming Bank and its
         authorized agents and representatives reasonable access at mutually
         convenient times to the Purchased Branch and to Records and other
         information within Seller's possession relating to the Purchased Branch
         and the Acquired Assets and Liabilities Assumed. Seller shall cause its
         personnel to cooperate with the Assuming Bank and provide to the
         Assuming Bank reasonable assistance in the

<PAGE>

         Assuming Bank's investigation of matters relating to the Purchased
         Branch and to the Acquired Assets and Liabilities Assumed and the
         Assuming Bank's preparation for an orderly transition (including, at
         Assuming Bank's request, arranging employment interviews with Purchased
         Branch employees). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree
         that the Assuming Bank's investigations and preparations for the
         transition shall be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably
         interfere with the Purchased Branch's normal operations, customers and
         employee relations. All information provided by a party hereto (the
         "Providing Party") to the other Party hereto (the "Receiving Party")
         will be kept confidential by the Receiving Party and shall not, except
         as required by law or with the prior written consent of Providing
         Party, be disclosed by the Receiving Party in any manner whatsoever
         except as contemplated herein, in whole or in part, and shall not be
         used by the Receiving Party, other than in connection with the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be consummated,
         all copies of the information, including that portion of the
         information which consists of analyses, compilations, forecasts,
         studies or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party which
         reflect such information, will be, at the Receiving Party's sole
         option, either returned to Providing Party or destroyed upon the
         written request of Providing Party. A written certification of such
         destruction shall be delivered by the Receiving Party promptly
         following such destruction. The foregoing shall not apply to any
         information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public
         other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party, or (ii)
         becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis
         from a source which is not prohibited from disclosing such information
         to the Receiving Party by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation
         to Providing Party. In the event that the Receiving Party becomes
         legally compelled to disclose any of the information furnished to it by
         Providing Party, the Receiving Party will provide Providing Party with
         prompt notice so that Providing Party may seek a protective order or
         other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of
         this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy
         is not obtained, or that Providing Party waives compliance with the
         provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall furnish only
         that portion of the information that is legally required and shall
         exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
         confidential treatment will be afforded the information. The Receiving
         Party shall not be liable for the disclosure of the information
         hereunder to a tribunal compelling such disclosure unless such
         disclosure to such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous
         disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its agents, affiliates or
         advisors not permitted by this Agreement. In any filings that may be
         required to obtain the regulatory approvals, the Assuming Bank will
         request confidential treatment of this Agreement, including the
         exhibits and schedules hereto, and the amount of the Purchase Price and
         will consult with the other party hereto prior to the disclosure of
         this Agreement, the exhibits or the schedules or the amount of the
         Purchase Price in the event such request is denied.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
         Assuming Bank and its agents or representatives shall not perform any
         investigation or study of Seller, or any

<PAGE>

         asset or property of Seller which may involve the intrusive or
         destructive sampling or analysis or chemical testing of any portion of
         such asset or property or any improvements thereon, including without
         limitation, of any soil, water or groundwater on, under or about such
         asset or property ("Phase II Investigation"), without first (a)
         submitting to Seller a detailed description of (i) the work to be
         performed as part of the Phase II Investigation, (ii) the persons to
         undertake such Phase II Investigation, and (iii) the types and amounts
         of insurance coverage maintained by such persons, and (b) obtaining the
         prior written consent of Seller as to such matters. Seller may grant or
         withhold such consent in its sole discretion and may grant such consent
         subject to such terms, conditions or restrictions as Seller may in its
         sole discretion require. In all events, Seller or its representatives
         shall have the right, but not the obligation, to observe any and all
         activities associated with performance of any agreed Phase II
         Investigation, and may obtain half of any samples which the Assuming
         Bank or its representatives may collect during the Phase II
         Investigation. In the event the Assuming Bank or its representatives
         conduct a Phase II Investigation, the Assuming Bank shall cause (x) any
         investigation-derived waste generated or created in connection with
         performance of the Phase II Investigation (including without
         limitation, drill cuttings, purged or developed water, or sample
         remnants) to be removed from any investigated property, (y) any wells
         installed during the Phase II Investigation to be plugged and
         abandoned, and (z) the restoration of any investigated property to
         substantially the same physical condition which existed before
         commencement of the Phase II Investigation, all within seven (7) days
         after completion of the field activities related to the Phase II
         Investigation, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
         The Assuming Bank shall be responsible for executing on its own behalf,
         and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations any and all
         manifests, shipping documents, plugging and abandoning reports and
         similar documents in connection with its obligations under this
         paragraph. The Assuming Bank agrees to indemnify and hold Seller
         harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages,
         expenses, and causes of action arising out of the Assuming Bank's
         inspections of the real or personal property of Seller, including
         without limitation, any Phase II Investigation.

                  (g)      EDP Conversion. Between the date hereof and the
         Closing Date, Seller shall use its best efforts to cooperate in the
         conversion of the Purchased Branch from Seller's existing electronic
         data processing systems to the systems of the Assuming Bank ("EDP
         Conversion") so that Assuming Bank is able to and shall convert the
         Purchased Branch's existing electronic data processing systems to the
         systems of the Assuming Bank on the Closing Date. Seller will provide
         conversions files in Seller's standard format. Seller will provide to
         Assuming Bank a maximum of three test tapes. Service for debit and ATM
         cards on Deposit accounts shall be discontinued at the end of Seller's
         business day on the Closing Date.

                  (h)      Condemnation. If prior to Closing all or any portion
         of the Bank Premises is taken or is made subject to eminent domain or
         other governmental acquisition proceedings, then Seller shall promptly
         notify Assuming Bank thereof, and on the

<PAGE>

         Closing Date pay to the Assuming Bank all payments received or to be
         received in respect thereto; provided, however, that the Assuming Bank
         shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in the event that the
         Book Value of the portion of the Bank Premises so taken or made subject
         to eminent domain is in excess of $50,000, unless Seller agrees to pay
         the Assuming Bank the difference between the fair market value of such
         portion as of the date immediately preceding such condemnation and the
         condemnation award.

                  (i)      Insurance Proceeds and Casualty Payments. In the
         event of any damage, or destruction affecting the Acquired Assets
         between the date hereof and the time of the Closing, Seller shall
         deliver to the Assuming Bank notice of such damage or destruction and,
         at the Assuming Bank's election, shall either fix or repair such damage
         or destruction or pay to the Assuming Bank the insurance proceeds, to
         the extent of the applicable amount set forth in Section 7.1(a) hereof
         with respect to Bank Premises, Fixtures and the replacement cost with
         respect to the Furniture and Equipment, as the case may be, received
         (or with respect to insurance proceeds, which would be received
         assuming Seller's insurance policy had no deductible) by Seller as a
         result thereof; provided, however, that the Assuming Bank shall have
         the right to terminate this agreement in the event of that the Book
         Value of such Acquired Assets so damaged or destroyed is in excess of
         $50,000, unless Seller agrees to pay the Assuming Bank the difference
         between the fair market value of such Acquired Assets as of the date
         immediately preceding such damage or destruction and the insurance
         proceeds.

                  (j)      Notices to Customers. The Assuming Bank may,
         following receipt of all required regulatory approvals for the
         transactions contemplated herein, but no earlier than 35 days prior to
         the Closing Date, communicate with, and deliver information, brochures,
         bulletins, press releases and other communications to, depositors and
         borrowers of the Purchased Branch concerning the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement and concerning the business and
         operations of the Purchased Branch, and Seller shall take all
         reasonable steps to cooperate with the Assuming Bank in effecting such
         communications.

         11.2     COVENANTS OF THE ASSUMING BANK. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Assuming Bank hereby covenants and agrees that it shall do or cause
to be done at all times all things necessary to maintain and preserve and keep
in full force and effect its corporate existence, and all rights and franchises
material to the business of the Assuming Bank, up through the Closing Date.

         11.3     SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. In the event this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, for a period of 18 months after the
date of such termination, neither party will, without the prior approval of the
other party, directly or indirectly (excluding contacts initiated by the
employee and any contact that results from advertisements in public journals or
mass media or contact by search firms engaged by the other party in the ordinary
course of business and directed only as to the position to be filled and not
directed as to a specific employee or group of employees) hire or solicit for
employment, or otherwise disrupt the

<PAGE>

employment relationship of any person who is employed by the other party, and
whose employment relates to the Purchased Branch or with whom the other party
has had significant contact.

         11.4     BEST EFFORTS; TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION. Each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its best efforts promptly to take or cause to be taken all
action and promptly to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the
Closing Date any further action is necessary, proper or advisable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable each party to
this Agreement shall cause its proper officers and/or directors to take all such
necessary action. Without limiting the foregoing, the Assuming Bank agrees to
promptly prepare and file all applications and other notices required in
connection with on or before the 15th business day after the date hereof, and to
use its best efforts to obtain promptly and comply with all conditions contained
in, the regulatory approvals described in Section 10.2(b) and any other consent,
approval or other action by, or notice to or registration or filing with, any
governmental or administrative agency or authority required or necessary to be
made, obtained or complied with, as the case may be, by the Assuming Bank in
connection with the performance of this Agreement by the Assuming Bank or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that any delay
by Seller in furnishing information for the application or reviewing the
application shall extend the period in which the Assuming Bank is required to
file the application under this Section 11.4 The Assuming Bank shall provide an
information request to Seller for Seller's information to be included in the
application on or before the tenth business day after the date hereof. To the
extent that any application filed in connection with obtaining any such approval
contains any significant information relating to Seller, prior to submitting
such application to any regulatory agency, the Assuming Bank will permit Seller
to review such information and will consider in good faith the suggestions of
Seller with respect thereto. Seller shall have the right to approve any such
information that relates to Seller, provided that such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Assuming Bank shall use its best efforts to insure
that any information provided by Seller, its Affiliates or representatives to be
submitted in connection with submissions to governmental or administrative
agencies or authorities receives confidential treatment if so requested by
Seller.

         The Assuming Bank shall provide to Seller copies of all applications
and other notices required in connection with the regulatory approvals described
in Section 10.2(b) (excluding personal financial information relating to
directors or regulatory examinations of the Assuming Bank and its Affiliates)
and any other consent, approval or other action by, or notice to, or
registration or filing in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement within five days of such submissions. The Assuming Bank shall provide
copies of any comments, requests or actions by governmental or administrative
agencies or authorities to Seller within five days of the Assuming Bank's
receipt thereof. The Assuming Bank shall not be required to provide copies of
any such comments or requests which relate to personal information of directors
or regulatory examinations of the Assuming Bank and its Affiliates, unless such

<PAGE>

comments or requests indicate that the applications related thereto may not be
approved. Information provided under this paragraph shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 11.1(f).

         11.5     USE OF NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, no interest in or right to use any logo, name,
trademark or service mark presently or previously used by Seller is being
conveyed pursuant to this Agreement. The Assuming Bank agrees that on and after
the Closing Date neither it nor any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Branch) will use names containing the words "Sterling" or "CaminoReal" in
connection with any business or activity engaged in by the Assuming Bank and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that Assuming Bank may identify the Acquired
Assets and the Liabilities Assumed as being formerly owned by Seller in
connection with any customer or regulatory inquiry. Promptly after the Closing
Date, the Assuming Bank shall commence the removal of the trade names, names,
service marks, logos, insignia, slogans, emblems, symbols, designs, and other
identifying characteristics ("names") from all premises, equipment, interior
decor items, fixtures and furnishings. Such removal shall be at the sole expense
of the Assuming Bank and shall be completed not later than five days after the
Closing Date. Within three business days after the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and the Assuming Bank will permit Seller to, remove all exterior signs
containing Seller's name. On the Closing Date, Seller will remove all printed
materials and related business literature associated with the Purchased Branch.

         11.6     ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The parties to this Agreement
agree to allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with the rules under Section
1060 of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Such
allocation shall be based on the fair market value of the Acquired Assets. The
Assuming Bank agrees to provide Seller with a schedule allocating the Purchase
Price among the Acquired Assets and with a properly completed Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 within 60 days after the Closing Date but in no event later
than 90 days before the due date, including extensions, for the consolidated
federal income tax return that includes Seller for the taxable year including
the Closing Date. If Seller objects to any items reflected on such schedule,
Seller shall notify the Assuming Bank of such objection and its reasons for
objecting, in which case the Assuming Bank and Seller shall attempt to resolve
the disagreement. If the Assuming Bank and Seller cannot resolve the
disagreement, the allocation shall be determined by a nationally recognized
independent appraiser selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to the
Assuming Bank. The fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne equally by
the Assuming Bank and Seller. Seller and the Assuming Bank agree to act in
accordance with the computations and allocations contained in the schedule as
finally agreed or determined by such independent appraiser (including any
modifications thereto reflecting any post-closing adjustments) in any relevant
Tax Returns or similar filings (including any forms or reports required to be
filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder ("1060 Forms")) and to file such 1060 Forms in the manner
required by applicable law. Seller and the Assuming Bank will promptly notify
each other in accordance with Section 14.6 of any challenge by any tax authority
to such computations or allocations.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                                 EMPLOYEE PLANS

         12.1     EMPLOYEES; PARTICIPATION IN ASSUMING BANK PLANS. Attached
hereto as Schedule 12.1 is a list which Seller represents sets out all Purchased
Branch employees, including inactive employees, as of the date hereof. Except as
set forth in this Agreement, the Assuming Bank shall have no obligation in
respect of any Purchased Branch employee employed by Seller unless such employee
is hired by the Assuming Bank. The Assuming Bank's decision to offer employment
is subject to the Assuming Bank's sole discretion and nothing contained herein
is to be construed as an employment contract, as an offer of employment, or as
an agreement to offer employment, with respect to any such employee. Unless
employment has been offered by the Assuming Bank and accepted by the employee by
the Closing Date, all Purchased Branch employees employed by Seller shall be
terminated by Seller as of the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date,
employees of the Purchased Branch who are hired by the Assuming Bank shall cease
participation in all plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for
their benefit by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Commencing on the Closing
Date, the Assuming Bank shall provide to employees of the Purchased Branch who
are hired by the Assuming Bank such plans, programs, policies and arrangements
being maintained by the Assuming Bank and which contain terms that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees
of the Assuming Bank or any of its Affiliates. Each employee of Seller who is
hired by the Assuming Bank shall be given credit for all purposes under such
plans, programs, policies and arrangements, including fringe benefits,
maintained by the Assuming Bank (except for benefit accrual under a defined
benefit plan) for all service prior to the Closing Date with Seller and its
Affiliates.

         12.2     CLAIMS INCURRED PRIOR TO AND AFTER CLOSING. Seller will retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability
and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each employee of the Purchased
Branch or their covered dependents which are covered and payable under Seller's
Welfare Benefit Plans with respect to claims incurred by such employees and
former employees or their covered dependents prior to the Closing Date. Expenses
and benefits with respect to claims incurred by employees of the Purchased
Branch who are hired by the Assuming Bank or their covered dependents on or
after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the Assuming Bank. For
purposes of this Section, a claim is deemed incurred when the services that are
the subject of the claim are performed: in the case of life insurance, when the
death occurs; in the case of long-term disability benefits, when the disability
occurs; and, in the case of a hospital stay, when such stay commences. Seller
will retain responsibility for all welfare plan expenses and benefits, if any,
including responsibility for compliance with COBRA, for all former employees of
the Purchased Branch who are not employed by Seller on the Closing Date or such

                  circumstances to the indemnitor;

                           (ii)     as soon as practicable after such a claim is
                  made or threatened, give written notice thereof to the

                  making records and appropriate personnel available to the
                  indemnitor at such times as the indemnitor shall request
                  (provided that such personnel are under the employ of the
                  indemnitee as such time), (b) providing copies of invoices or
                  other evidence of expense incurred, and (c) providing the
                  indemnitor copies of any process, pleadings, correspondence or
                  other writings relating to the claim;

                           (iv)     cooperate and take all such steps as the
                  indemnitor may reasonably request to preserve and protect any
                  defense to such claim; and

                           (v)      upon reasonable prior notice, afford to the
                  indemnitor the right, which the indemnitor may exercise at its
                  (or their) sole discretion and at its (or their) own expense,
                  to participate in (and/or assume full responsibility for the
                  direction of) the investigation, defense and/or settlement of
                  such claims.

         13.2     LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article XIII, no indemnification shall be
required to be made by either party until the aggregate amount of all such
claims by a party exceeds $50,000. Once such aggregate amount exceeds $50,000,
such party shall thereupon be entitled to indemnification for all amounts in
excess of such $50,000 which result in direct damage to such party by way of any
cost, loss, liability, expense, judgment, fine, or settlement actually incurred
by such party in accordance with Section 13.1; provided, however, subject to the
foregoing, no party shall have any liability under this Article XIII for
consequential damages.

         13.3     EXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDIES. The remedies of the Assuming Bank
Indemnified Persons under Section 13.1(a) shall be considered the Assuming Bank
Indemnified Persons' sole

<PAGE>

and exclusive remedies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except
with respect to such remedies specifically set forth herein, the Assuming Bank
hereby releases, waives and agrees not to sue Seller or any of its shareholders
officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, successors
or assigns ("Seller's Related Parties") for any and all claims, causes of
action, rights of contribution, cost recovery, losses, liabilities, suits,
costs, fees, judgments or expenses which may now exist or which may hereafter
arise, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE SOLE,
CONTRIBUTORY, PASSIVE OR PARTIAL NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLER OR ANY
OF THE SELLER'S RELATED PARTIES, in connection with:

                           (i)      any material, waste, substance, substance,

                  any Governmental Authority, or the improper handling,
                  management or disposal of which may affect human health or
                  safety, property (or the use thereof) or the environment, or

                           (ii)     the compliance by Seller or any of its
                  predecessors, or any of its current or former real or personal
                  property, with applicable laws, regulations, standards to,
                  pollutant or contaminant limitations, orders or directives
                  pertaining directly or indirectly to human health or safety or

                  referred to herein necessary to consummate the Closing
                  contemplated hereby or if there shall have been a material
                  failure of condition, or a material breach of any
                  representation or warranty, covenant or agreement, after
                  affording such defaulting party a 30 day period after notice
                  in which to cure;

                           (iii)    By Seller or the Assuming Bank upon notice
                  given to the other if the Closing shall not have taken place

                  permanent order, enjoining, prohibiting or otherwise
                  materially limiting or conditioning the Assuming Bank's
                  business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

         officers or directors (except as set forth in this Section). The
         obligations of the parties to this Agreement under this Section shall
         survive any such termination.

         this Agreement pursuant to Sections 14.11(a)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi)
