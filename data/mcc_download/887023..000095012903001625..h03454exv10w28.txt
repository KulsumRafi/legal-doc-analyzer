            they will conduct the development on the Compound and it's Products
            according to the Work Plans, with the goal of developing
            commercially marketable Products for topical indications in the
            shortest feasible period of time. The parties also agree that
            Revotar shall be responsible under the Work Plans for the
            development program defined therein, conduct any non-clinical work
            necessary for development of topical applications of the Compound,
            conduct the clinical trials regarding the Compound and it's Products
            in the Territory, and Patent filing,


                                       10
<PAGE>

            maintenance and prosecution regarding the Products in the Territory.
            The obligations of the Work Plans for topical indications are
            considered to be completed when the conditions described in
            paragraph 3.2.2 (ii) or (iii) apply.

            the Compound and the Products for all indications in the Field of
            Use other than the topical indications, and will be responsible for
            all costs associated therewith. TBC will have no responsibilities
            under and bear none of the expense for such efforts.

            3.1.3 PARTICIPATION BY TBC IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Except where TBC
            and Revotar agree that it is necessary for obtaining regulatory
            approval, TBC does not intend to develop the Compound or it's
            Products in the Territory and in the Field of Use pursuant to the
            Development Program or the Work Plans. TBC, at its own expense, may
            undertake development work on the Compound or it's Products for use

            Program and the Work Plans to conduct and pay for any Phase III
            Clinical Trials involving the Compound or it's Products. The parties
            instead contemplate that Revotar will enter into a Licensing
            Transaction whereby a Third Party will conduct such trials.

            relevant for registration purposes generated by the Parties for
            non-topical indications will be shared in English upon reimbursement
            of 50% of the Development Costs associated with such work. Once
            information is paid for by a Party, its uses will be limited in the
            following manner; (i) for internal evaluation, (ii) non-confidential
            summary information may be shared with Third Parties without prior
            consent from either Party, (iii) detailed data can be used by the
            Parties or their licensees for registration or regulatory purposes
            necessary to obtain approvals from governmental agencies, (iv)
            detailed data may also be shared with a Third Party pursuant to a
            separate confidentiality agreement subject to the limitations
            contained in paragraph 8.2 and (v) any publication or public
            presentation of information will require prior approval of the
            originating party; such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
            Revotar and TBC will endeavor to oblige any of its sublicensees, at
            their option, to pass on information concerning the Compound and
            Products relating to non-topical indications and to assent to
            passing on such information to Revotar and TBC on the same basis as
            provided above. Regarding topical indications, Revotar and TBC will
            endeavor to oblige any sublicensee to provide information regarding
            Compound or it's Products to Revotar or TBC in English without cost.
            TBC and Revotar will treat information in a manner consistent with
            (i) through (v) above.

<PAGE>

            decision making regarding any disagreements with the Work Plan will
            reside with the CEO of Revotar. In any year where none of (i)
            through (iii) above do occur, then the Project Representatives shall
            promptly present the disagreement to the chief executive officers of
            the Parties or their designees, who shall attempt resolution of the
            matter. If the chief executives or designees cannot promptly resolve
            such disagreement within thirty (30) days, then the dispute shall be
            resolved under the arbitration provisions of Section 11.7.

            3.2.3 WORK PLANS. The parties hereto will agree on the initial Work
            Plan for 2003 within 90 days of the Effective Date. If the Project
            Representatives agree to pursue New Indications, then a new Work

            the term of this Agreement and twice during the three (3) calendar
            years following the termination hereof, during regular business
            hours and upon reasonable notice, to its records and books for the
            sole purpose of determining the appropriateness of all amounts
            payable hereunder or verifying the royalties and profit sharing
            amounts payable hereunder. If such examination reveals that such
            amounts have been overstated or such royalties have been understated
            for any calendar year, such overpayment shall be promptly refunded
            or in the case of any underpayment, such party shall promptly pay
            the amount of any underpayment; provided that if such examination
            was not conducted by an independent accountant, the party whose
            records were examined shall have the right to engage an independent
            accountant reasonably acceptable to examining party to verify the
            results of such examination. Any sublicense granted by Revotar

            quarter just ended shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing
            on the last day of such calendar quarter published by a New York
            money center bank designated by Revotar which Revotar uses for

5. COMMERCIALIZATION.

      5.1   TBC TO MANUFACTURE. TBC has the right, but not the obligation,
            subject to the provisions of Section 2.1 above, to manufacture all
            Revotar's requirements for the Compound and/or Products, subject to
            customary forecast and order procedures. If TBC or its subcontractor
            is manufacturing the Compound and/or Products, TBC's (or its
            subcontractor's) responsibilities shall include all aspects of the
            manufacturing process, including maintenance of manufacturing
            inventory, quality control and shipment of Compound and/or Products
            in accordance with orders placed by Revotar. TBC and Revotar will
            also agree to negotiate in good faith a manufacturing agreement
            which will include provisions on forecasts, delivery time, quality
            control, quality assurance, delivery location, insurance, packaging,
            inventories, term and time of payment and such other provisions as
            are customarily included in agreements of this type. As compensation
            for such manufacturing services, TBC shall be entitled to receive
            payment of its COGS. Revotar shall have the right to audit at its
            expense the manufacturer or submanufacturer of the Compound or
            Products.

      5.2   REVOTAR AND TBC TO SELL IN TERRITORY AND NORTH AMERICA,
            RESPECTIVELY. Following regulatory approval in any country in the
            Territory or in North America, Revotar and TBC shall use
            commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell the Products in
            such country. Revotar and TBC will use all resources in such
            marketing and sales efforts that it would use regarding any of its
            other products with similar commercial potential. All terms of sale,
            including pricing policies, credit terms, cash discounts and returns
            and allowances, shall be set by


                                       24
<PAGE>

            Revotar or TBC in their respective regions. Revotar and TBC shall be
            responsible for invoicing the customers in their respective regions
            for Products and collecting payment therefore. The Parties will
            consult each other regarding the selection of the trademarks to be
            used for the sale of Products in the Territory, which selection will
            take into account the desirability for worldwide trademarks. Such
            trademarks regarding sales of Products in the Territory will be
            owned by Revotar. In the event TBC is marketing and selling
            Products, TBC will have the right to use such trademarks outside the
            Territory at no cost to TBC.

      5.3   SUBLICENSING. If Revotar or TBC will grant a sublicense to Third
            Parties then Revotar and TBC will impose to the sublicensee to
            assume the obligations entered into by Revotar and TBC in section
            5.2, sentences 1 and 2.

6. TBC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

            TBC represents and warrants to Revotar as follows:

      6.1   NO THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS. Except for the Participation Agreement
            and the Side Letter to the Participation Agreement dated July 21,
            2000, there are no agreements with third parties relating to the
            Products.

      6.2   NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. TBC owns or possesses adequate licenses or
            other rights to use all patents, patent rights, inventions and
            know-how necessary for the manufacture, use and sale of the Compound
            and Products and to grant the licenses granted herein. To the best
            knowledge of TBC, the manufacture, use or sale of the Products and
            Compound pursuant to this Agreement will not infringe or conflict
            with any Third Party right or patent and TBC is not aware of any
            pending patent


                                       25
<PAGE>

            application that if issued would be infringed by the manufacture,
            use or sale of the Products pursuant to this Agreement. TBC has not
            received any notice from a third party that any manufacture, use or
            sale of the Products and Compound pursuant to this Agreement
            infringes or conflicts with any Third party right or patent.


                                       26
<PAGE>

7. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

      7.1   IMPROVEMENTS. Improvements conceived or made solely by the employees
            of either party during the term of this Agreement shall be the sole
            property of such party. Improvements made jointly by employees of
            both parties during the term of this Agreement shall be owned by
            Revotar. All Improvements no matter if conceived solely by one party
            to this Agreement or jointly shall be automatically included in the
            license granted to Revotar under Section 2; provided, that the
            parties agree to negotiate in good faith appropriate modifications
            to the terms of this Agreement which reflect the fact that an
            Improvement has been jointly developed or developed only by TBC.
            Each party shall promptly disclose to the other any Improvements
            developed by its employees or agents acting on its behalf. Each
            party agrees that all employees and other persons acting on its
            behalf under this Agreement shall be obligated under a binding
            written agreement to assign (or exclusively license in the case of
            academics) to such party or as such party shall direct all
            Improvements made or conceived by such employee or other person.

            New Chemical Entities, including Compound follow-up molecules
            discovered by Revotar will be the exclusive intellectual property of
            Revotar. TBC agrees to waive patent infringement litigation against
            Revotar related to such discoveries.

      7.2   PATENT PROSECUTION AND MAINTENANCE. The parties agree that they will
            coordinate with each other in all reasonable respects the worldwide
            prosecution of the Patents, subject to the provisions of this
            Section 7. TBC shall be responsible,


                                       27
<PAGE>

            at its expense, for prosecuting and maintaining any patents and
            patent applications relating to the Patents in existence on the date
            of the License Agreement. Revotar shall be responsible, at its
            expense, for filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Patents to the
            extent they are not in existence on the date of the License
            Agreement (including Improvements owned by Revotar or jointly
            developed by Revotar and TBC, but excluding Improvements owned
            exclusively by TBC). Each party shall furnish the other party with
            copies of any patent application concerning Subject Technology or
            Improvements sufficiently in advance of the anticipated filing date
            (but in no event less than 5 working days before filing) so as to
            give the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment.
            Each party shall also furnish copies to the other party of all
            communications to and from United States and foreign patent offices
            regarding patents or patent applications relating to this Agreement
            within a reasonable time prior to filing such communication or
            promptly following the receipt thereof. Each party shall reasonably
            consider any comments the other party may have related to such
            patent applications or communications. Each party shall have the
            right at its expense to file, prosecute and maintain patents in the
            United States and all foreign countries on Improvements owned solely
            by it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, beyond best efforts, neither
            party assumes liability to the other for the successful prosecution
            of any patent application. However, if either party shall fail to
            pay an annuity, tax or other maintenance fee with respect to a
            Patent or Patent application or otherwise decide not to pursue a
            Patent relating to Improvements owned solely by


                                       28
<PAGE>

            it, it shall give the other party timely notice and the opportunity
            to take such action and assume all ownership rights to such Patent
            or Patent application.

      7.3   THIRD PARTY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT. Each party shall give the other
            prompt notice of each claim or allegation that the exercise of
            rights hereunder constitutes an infringement of one or more patents
            or other rights of a Third Party. Revotar shall use all commercially
            reasonable efforts to defend the parties against any such claim or
            allegation with counsel of its own choice reasonably acceptable to
            Revotar. The costs of such defense and any costs of settling or
            otherwise satisfying such claim (including damage awards, if any)
            shall be borne as follows:

            7.3.1 TBC COSTS. TBC shall bear all costs associated with claims
            based on any patent issued or patent application published as of the
            date of the License Agreement. If Revotar continues to sell the
            Products following notice of such claim against explicit requests to
            the contrary by TBC, then Revotar shall have the obligation to
            satisfy all claims in connection with such continued sales activity.
            At all times, Revotar shall have the right to defend itself at its
            cost against this with counsel of its own choice reasonably
            acceptable to TBC.

            7.3.2 REVOTAR COSTS. Revotar shall bear all costs associated with
            claims based on any patent or patent application that was not issued
            or published as of the date of the License Agreement.

            7.3.3 COOPERATION. Each party agrees to cooperate with the other in
            the defense of any such claim or allegation, including, to the
            extent able, furnishing testimony by its employees and providing
            technical support and information as requested. Neither party shall
            settle or discontinue defense of any such case without the


                                       29
<PAGE>

            other's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
            withheld. In the case of any proposed settlement involving a
            cross-license with a Third Party, neither party may unreasonably
            refuse to enter into such a cross-license. The provisions of this
            Section 7.3 shall also apply to actions for declaratory relief which
            raise or are in response to an issue of infringement of a Third
            Party patent.

      7.4   INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES. Each party shall give the other party
            prompt written notice of any incident of infringement of Patents
            that comes to its attention. The parties shall thereupon confer as
            to what steps are to be taken to stop or prevent such infringement.
            Revotar agrees to use reasonable efforts to stop any such
            infringement, but shall not be obligated to commence proceedings
            against the infringer. If Revotar decides to commence proceedings,
            however, Revotar shall be responsible for any legal costs incurred
            and will be entitled to retain any settlement or damage award
            received, and TBC agrees to cooperate with Revotar in such
            proceeding. TBC shall have the right at its expense to engage its
            own counsel in connection with such proceedings. Should Revotar
            decide not to commence proceedings, and should the infringement
            represent a substantial threat to the commercial value of any
            Products, TBC shall be entitled (but not obligated) to do so in its
            own name and/or in Revotar's name against the infringer, in which
            event TBC shall be responsible for all legal costs incurred, and
            will be entitled to retain any settlement or damage award received,
            and Revotar agrees to cooperate with TBC in such proceedings and
            Revotar shall have the right at its expense to engage its own
            counsel in connection with such proceedings.

8. CONFIDENTIALITY.

      8.1   GENERAL. Any party receiving Confidential Information pursuant to
            this Agreement shall maintain the confidential and proprietary
            status of such Confidential Information, keep such Confidential
            Information and each part thereof within its possession or under its
            control sufficient to prevent any activity with respect to the
            Confidential Information that is not specifically authorized by this
            Agreement and prevent the disclosure of any Confidential Information
            to any Third Party using the same degree of care it would use with
            respect to its own information of like importance; provided,
            however, that such restrictions shall not apply to any Confidential
            Information that is (a) independently developed outside the scope of
            this Agreement by employees of the receiving party having no access
            to or knowledge of the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder,
            (b) in the public domain at the time of its receipt or thereafter
            becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving
            party, (c) lawfully received without an obligation of
            confidentiality from a Third Party having the right to disclose such
            information, (d) released from the restrictions of this Section 8 by
            the express written consent of the disclosing party, (e) disclosed
            to any permitted assignee, sublicensee or subcontractor or customer
            of Revotar or TBC, provided that such assignee, sublicensee,
            subcontractor or customer is subject to the provisions of this
            Section 8 or substantially similar provisions or (f) required by
            law, statute, rule or court order to be disclosed, including
            requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FDA, any
            PRA, and other regulatory authorities, provided that the disclosing
            party uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain


                                       31
<PAGE>

            confidential treatment of any such disclosure. Without limiting the
            generality of the foregoing, Revotar and TBC each shall use all
            commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, if not already in place,
            confidentiality agreements from its respective relevant employees
            and agents, to protect the Confidential Information as herein
            provided.

      8.2   DISCLOSURE OF AGREEMENT. Neither party shall make a public
            announcement or otherwise disclose the terms of this Agreement to
            any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other
            except that the parties may without such consent disclose (a) the
            existence of this Agreement, (b) the identity of the other party and
            (c) the general subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing statement, both parties may disclose details of this
            agreement to third parties, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement,
            for the purpose of business negotiations with potential licensees,
            financial investors, financial advisors, patent attorneys and
            governmental agencies.

            Each party shall also be permitted to make such disclosure of the
            terms of this Agreement as its counsel reasonably determines is
            necessary to comply with law, provided that such party shall use
            commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of
            any such disclosure.

9. INDEMNIFICATION.

      9.1   MUTUAL RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION. Each party shall defend, indemnify
            and hold harmless the other and its directors, officers, employees
            and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses
            and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by or asserted
            against it or any of the foregoing arising out of the development,
            testing, manufacture, handling or storage of any Product by such
            party, including without limitation (i) any actual or alleged bodily
            injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of any
            Product manufactured by such party, (ii) any actual or alleged
            violation of law applicable to the development, testing,
            manufacture, handling or storage of the Products by such party and
            (iii) any Product recall of Product manufactured by such party that
            is ordered by a governmental agency or required by a confirmed
            Product failure as reasonably determined by the parties, except as
            otherwise provided herein and except to the extent that such
            liabilities, losses and expenses result from the negligence or
            willful misconduct of a party, in which case the party who engaged
            in such negligence or willful misconduct shall indemnify and hold
            harmless the other party and its directors, officers, employees and
            agents. Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
            other party and its directors, officers, employees and agents from
            and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses and expenses,
            including attorneys' fees, incurred by or asserted against the other
            party or any of the foregoing arising out of a misrepresentation
            regarding any sales of Products by such party, it Affiliates or
            sublicensees which is not in accordance with


                                       33
<PAGE>

            approved Product claims.

      9.2   PROCEDURE. Any person that intends to claim indemnification under
            this Section 9 (an "Indemnitee") shall promptly notify the other
            party (the "Indemnitor") of any claim, in respect of which the
            Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor
            shall assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory
            to the parties; provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall have the
            right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be
            paid by the Indemnitor, if representation of such Indemnitee by the
            counsel retained by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to
            actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnitee and
            any other party represented by such counsel in such proceedings. The
            indemnity agreement in this Section 9 shall not apply to amounts
            paid in settlement of any loss, claim, liability or action if such
            settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which
            consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. The failure to deliver
            notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the
            commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to
            defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability
            to the Indemnitee under this Section 9, but not any liability that
            it may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section 9.
            The Indemnitee and its employees and agents shall cooperate fully
            with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the
            investigation of any action, claim or liability covered by this
            indemnification. In the event that each party claims indemnity from
            the other and one party is finally held liable to indemnify the
            other, the Indemnitor shall additionally be liable to pay the
            reasonable legal costs


                                       34
<PAGE>

            and attorneys' fees incurred by the Indemnitee in establishing its
            claim for indemnity.

      9.3   PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE. Each party shall use all commercially
            reasonable efforts to maintain product liability insurance with
            respect to its manufacture and sale of the Products hereunder. Such
            insurance shall be in such amounts and subject to such deductibles
            as the parties may agree based upon standards prevailing in the
            industry at the time such manufacturing commences. At such time as a
            Product is being launched by a party for commercial sale, the
            parties shall attempt to maximize the product liability insurance
            coverage for both parties. TBC shall maintain such insurance for so
            long as Revotar continues to sell any Product manufactured by TBC,
            and thereafter for so long as TBC maintains insurance for itself
            covering such manufacture or sales. Revotar shall maintain such
            insurance for as long as Revotar continues to sell any Product
            pursuant to this Agreement manufactured by it, and thereafter for so
            long as Revotar maintains insurance for itself covering such
            manufacture or sales.

10. TERM AND TERMINATION.

      10.1  LICENSE TERM. The obligations of Revotar under the license granted
            in section 2 shall terminate on a country by country and Product
            formulation by Product formulation basis upon the legal sale by a
            Third Party of a generic version of TBC1269 for that particular
            formulation in that particular country. Thereafter, Revotar shall
            have a license to and perpetual rights in such Patents and Subject
            Technology in such country as to the Product or Compound in
            question.

      10.2  TERMINATION FOR BREACH. Either party may terminate this Agreement by
            written notice to the other in the event that (i) the other party
            fails to perform any material obligation hereunder and such failure
            is not cured within 60 days following prompt notice thereof from the
            non-defaulting party, or (ii) any bankruptcy, receivership,
            insolvency or bankruptcy reorganization proceedings are instituted
            by the other party or any such proceedings are instituted against
            the other party and not dismissed within 120 days. The bankruptcy of
            a party shall not give rise to the right of the bankrupt party to
            terminate any license granted herein.

      10.3  TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO PROCEED.

            Regarding the asthma indication, if more than 18 months lapse

            entering into a license(s) agreement(s) between Revotar and a Third
            Party covering the asthma indication in at least the European
            Market, Japan and/or North America market, then the license will
            terminate for asthma. In the event that Revotar has entered into a
            license agreement for Japan, an additional 6 months will be added to
            the 18 month lapse period. Revotar must assure that adequate due
            diligence provisions obligate its licensee(s) to timely conduct
            clinical development and regulatory submissions. In case of breach
            of contract by the licensee(s), the license will revert to Revotar
            and Revotar will reassume the obligations as the licensee of TBC as
            stated in this Agreement.

            the next patient in a new clinical trial for a topical indication
            conducted by Revotar, or (ii) the submission of a marketing
            application for a topical indication to the EMEA or any country

            Revotar must assure that adequate due diligence provisions obligate
            its licensee(s) to timely conduct clinical development and
            regulatory submissions. In case of breach of contract by the
            licensee(s), the license will revert to Revotar and Revotar will
            reassume the obligations as the licensee of TBC as stated in this

<PAGE>

            indication conducted by TBC and the enrollment of the next patient
            in a new clinical trial for a topical indication (except where TBC
            has submitted a regulatory approval dossier in any country within
            North America) and TBC has not entered into a license(s) covering a
            topical indication within North America. TBC must assure that
            adequate due diligence provisions obligate its licensee(s) to timely
            conduct clinical development and regulatory submissions.

            ten (10) business days after its receipt of such notice, the other
            party may, by written notice to the party initiating ADR, add
            additional issues to be resolved. If the parties cannot agree upon
            the selection of a neutral within twenty (20) business days
            following receipt of the original ADR notice, a neutral shall be
            selected by the then President ("Vorstandsvorsitzender") of the
            German Institution of Arbitration (D.I.S.), Bonn. The neutral shall
            be a single individual having relevant experience in the
            pharmaceutical industry. The neutral selected shall not be an
            employee, director or shareholder of either party or of an
            Affiliate. Each party shall have ten (10)


                                       41

            business days from the date the neutral is selected to object in
            good faith to the selection of that person. If either party makes
            such an objection, the then President of the DIS shall, as soon as
            possible thereafter, select another neutral under the same
            conditions as set forth above.

      11.8  SEVERABILITY. If any provision hereof should be held invalid,
            illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, then,
            to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) all other provisions
            hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction
            and shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the
            intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be possible and
            (b) such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
            the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any
            other jurisdiction.

      11.9  HEADINGS. Headings used herein are for convenience only and shall
            not in any way affect the construction of, or be taken into
            consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

      11.10 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
            number of counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed
            and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which
            counterparts, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
            instrument.

      11.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Research Agreement, as
            amended and attached hereto, contains the entire agreement and
            understanding of the parties hereto, and supersedes any prior
            agreements or understandings between the parties with respect to the
            subject matter hereof.
