                                    BENEFITS

4.1 NORMAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT. Upon a Participant's termination from service
with the Board of Directors pursuant to the Bank's policies with respect to
normal retirement of directors (including retirement caused by a failure of
shareholders of Alliance Bancorp of New England, Inc. to provide requisite
approval to elect a Participant nominated as a director by the Board of
Directors of the Company for election by the Company's shareholders) other than

Retirement Benefit equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) multiplied by the
Participant's Years of Service up to a maximum of twenty (20) Years of Service.

4.2 CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFIT. In the event of a Change in Control, each
Participant in the Plan shall be treated as if he had completed twenty (20)
Years of Service as of the date of the Change in Control, regardless of his age
or number of Years of Service.

4.3 VESTING OF DEFERRED BENEFIT ACCOUNT. A Participant shall be 100% vested in
his Retirement Benefit under the Plan upon the completion of five (5) Years of
Service.

4.4 TERMINATION FOR JUST CAUSE. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Plan, a Participant who terminates service on account of Just Cause shall not be
entitled to any benefit under this Plan.

4.5 NON-COMPETITION. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the
payment of benefits pursuant to this Section is contingent upon the
Participant's agreement that, for a period of one (1) year following termination
of service on the Board of Directors, the Participant will not, without the
Bank's prior written consent, serve as a director, officer, or in any similar
capacity with an entity whose business materially competes with the depository,
lending or other business activities of the Bank in any city, town, or country
in which the Bank has an office or has filed an application for regulatory
approval to establish an office.


                                    ARTICLE V
                               PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

5.1 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 4.1. The benefit determined in accordance
with Section 4.1 of the Plan shall be paid to the Participant in annual
installments for a period of ten (10) years (10 installments), commencing on the
first business day of the first month following the Participant's termination of
service.


5.2 PAYMENTS UPON DEATH. Upon the death of a Participant, the Bank shall pay to
the Participant's Beneficiary an amount determined as follows:

    a)       If the Participant dies after benefit payments have commenced under
             Section 5.1 of the Plan, then the Participant's Beneficiary shall
             receive, in a single lump sum payment, the Actuarial Equivalent of
             the remaining payments that would have been made to the Participant
             had he survived until the last payment due to him was paid. The
             payment to the Participant's Beneficiary under this Section 5.2(a)
             shall be made within ninety (90) days of the date of the death of
             the Participant.






                                        5

    b)       If the Participant, who otherwise would have been entitled to a
             benefit under Section 4.1 of the Plan had he retired on his date of
             death, dies prior the commencement of benefit payments under
             Section 5.1 of the Plan, then the Participant's Beneficiary shall
             receive, in a single lump sum payment, the Actuarial Equivalent of
             the payments that would have been made to the Participant had he
             survived until the last payment due to him was paid. The payment to
             the Participant's Beneficiary under this Section 5.2(b) shall be
             made within ninety (90) days of the date of the death of the
             Participant.

5.3 PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL. Within thirty (30) days of the effective
date of the Change in Control, each Director who is eligible for the Retirement
Benefit payable under Section 4.2 of the Plan shall deliver to the Bank a form,
attached to this Plan as Appendix A, and make an election regarding the time and
manner of the payment of the benefit. In the event of the death of a Director
prior to receipt of the benefits due him upon a Change in Control, such
Director's surviving spouse or his estate, as the case may be, shall receive
such benefits in the same manner as elected by the Director.


                                   ARTICLE VI
                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

6.1 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. Each Participant shall have the right, at any time,
to designate any person or persons as his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (both
principal as well as contingent) to whom payment under this Plan shall be paid
in the event of his death prior to complete distribution of the Retirement
Benefit due him under the Plan. Any Participant Beneficiary designation shall be
made in a written instrument filed with the Committee and shall be effective
only when received in writing by the Committee.

6.2 CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY. Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a
Participant by the written filing of such change on a form prescribed by the
Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel all
Beneficiary designations previously filed.

6.3 NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. If a Participant fails to designate a
Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the
Participant, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary shall be deemed to be
the person or persons surviving him in the first of the following classes in
which there is a survivor, share and share alike:

    a)       The surviving spouse;

    b)       The Participant's children, except that if any of the children
             predecease the Participant but leave issue surviving, then such
             issue shall take by right of representation the share their parent
             would have taken if living;

    c)       The Participant's estate.

6.4 EFFECT OF PAYMENT. The payment to the deemed Beneficiary shall completely
discharge the Bank's obligations under this Plan.

                                            benefit he would have received under
                                            Section 4.2 of the Plan.

                                    <>      in equal annual payments over a
                                            period of ten years.

2.       Time of Payment.           The Director shall begin to receive
                                    Retirement Benefits as soon as practicable
                                    after

                                    <>      A Change in Control closes.

                                    <>      the January 1st after a Change in
                                            Control closes.

                                    <>      the January 1st following the ______
                                            anniversary of the Change in
                                            Control.

3.       Frequency of Payment. Unless paid in a lump sum, the Retirement
         Benefits shall be paid on an annual basis.

4.       Effect of Election. The elections made in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof
         shall become irrevocable on the date 30 days before the closing of a
         Change in Control. The Director may at any time and from time to time
         change his designation of, and manner of payment to, a Beneficiary.
         Such election shall, however, become irrevocable upon the Director's
         death.

5.       Mutual Commitments. The Bank agrees to make payment of all amounts due
         the Director in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the elections
         made by the Director herein. The Director agrees to be bound by the
         terms of the Plan, as in effect on the date hereof, and as properly
         amended hereafter. The parties recognize and agree that this Agreement
         supersedes and nullifies any prior distribution election to the extent
         it is inconsistent herewith.
