               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of
MedUnite Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of MedUnite Inc. at December 31, 2002, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As more fully discussed in Note 16, the Company was acquired on December 31,
2002.

1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

   THE COMPANY

   MedUnite Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware in June 2000. The
   Company was formed to develop and maintain an exchange that provides
   connectivity applications in the healthcare market that facilitates various
   business transactions, including claims submission, real-time claim status
   inquiry, eligibility and referral and authorization.

   The Company is subject to risks common to rapidly growing technology-based
   companies, including rapid technological change, dependence on principal
   products, new product development, new product introductions, other
   activities of competitors, and a limited operating history in Internet
   related e-commerce activities.

   During 2002, the Company incurred a net loss of $48,859,000 and generated
   negative cash flows from operations of $26,655,000. The Company has an
   accumulated deficit of $102,466,000 as of December 31, 2002.

   As a result of these losses and negative cash flow, management engaged in
   efforts to sell the Company. On December 31, 2002, the Company was sold to
   ProxyMed, Inc. ("ProxyMed'), a publicly held provider of healthcare
   transaction processing services based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $10.0
   million in cash and $13.4 million in 4% Convertible Notes issued to the
   Company's founders (see Note 16). Without the sale of the Company to ProxyMed
   there would have been substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
   continue as a going concern. These financial statements reflect the financial
   position of the Company before the consummation of the acquisition by
   ProxyMed and do not reflect any adjustments that might have resulted from
   such transaction or if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.


2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   BASIS OF PRESENTATION

   The financial statements include the accounts of MedUnite Inc. and represent
   the financial position of the Company immediately prior to its acquisition by
   ProxyMed on December 31, 2002 (see Note 16).

   USE OF ESTIMATES

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
   of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
   liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
   of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
   differ from those estimates.

   REVENUE RECOGNITION

   The Company derives revenue from processing electronically submitted medical
   claims for insurance companies and health care providers. Revenue is
   recognized as services are provided according to the terms of the underlying
   contracts. Certain transaction fee revenue may be subject to revenue sharing
   or rebates per agreements with resellers, vendors, other clearinghouses, one
   of the founders and other business partners. Revenue from maintenance fees is
   recognized ratably over the applicable period.

   COST OF REVENUE

   Cost of revenue includes third party hosting and support services of network

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
   from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
   Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and certificates of deposit
   with a financial institution. Cash and cash equivalents used to support
   collateral instruments, such as letters of credit, are reclassified as either
   current or long-term assets depending upon the maturity date of the
   obligation they collateralize.

   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
   Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
   useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
   straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
   term of the lease. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of
   and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
   any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Expenditures for
   repairs, maintenance and minor renewals and betterments are expensed as
   incurred. Examination for obsolete, damaged and impaired fixed assets is
   periodically reviewed by management.

   INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE

   Internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
   software during the application development stage are capitalized.
   Amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
   lives of the assets. Application development stage costs generally include
   software configuration, coding, installation to hardware and testing. Costs
   of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality
   are also capitalized. Costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and
   enhancements are expensed as incurred.

   INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

   The Company assesses potential impairments of its intangible and other
   long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in
   circumstances have made recovery of an asset's carrying value unlikely.
   Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed annually (or more frequently if
   impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Intangible assets that are not
   deemed to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance
   with the Company's policy for long-lived assets. An impairment loss is
   recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows
   expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) is less than its
   carrying value or when third-party evidence exists as to the value of the
   long-lived assets. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the
   amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value and would
   be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a
   charge to operations.

   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

   ADVERTISING COSTS

   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $112,000
   for the year ended December 31, 2002.

   INCOME TAXES

   Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes
   expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income
   tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of
   differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets
   and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from
   tax credits and loss carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense or benefit
   represents the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset or
   liability. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in
   the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or
   all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

   The Company's financial instruments subject to concentrations of credit risk
   consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
   Company's policy is to place its cash and cash equivalents with high quality
   financial institutions in order to limit its credit exposure. To date, the
   Company has not experienced any credit losses associated with these financial
   institutions. Accounts receivable are generally uncollateralized. The Company
   performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an
   allowance for potential credit losses as considered necessary.

   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The estimated fair values of financial instruments which are presented herein
   have been determined by management using available market information and
   appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
   required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value.
   Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of
   amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

   Cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, net, and accounts
   payable are reflected in the accompanying Balance Sheets at amounts
   considered by management to reasonably approximate fair value due to their
   short-term nature.

   The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt generally using
   discounted cash flow analysis based on our current borrowing rates for
   similar types of debt. As of December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the
   long-term debt approximated the fair value of such instruments.

   COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

   Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in the equity of a
   business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
   circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company presents other
   comprehensive income (loss) in its statement of stockholders' equity. For the
   year ended December 31, 2002 the only component of comprehensive loss is net
   loss.

3. ACQUISITION

   In August 2001, the Company acquired NDC Health's physician network services
   business (the "Acquisition"). The physician network services business
   connects physicians to payors to provide electronic processing for claims,
   eligibility, referrals and other health transactions. The Company acquired
   the physician network services business in exchange for 15,263,402 shares of
   Series A preferred stock, having an estimated fair value, as determined by
   management, of $15,263,000, and a promissory note with a principal amount of
   $2,300,000, having an estimated fair value of $1,966,000 (see Note 9). In
   addition, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $1,043,000 related to the
   acquisition.

   The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
   and accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in
   the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The
   aggregate purchase price was allocated as follows:

         Accounts receivable           $  2,214,000
         Property and Equipment             572,000
         Identifiable intangibles        10,665,000
         Goodwill                         5,555,000
         Other assets                        52,000
         Accrued liabilities               (786,000)
                                       ------------
            Total purchase price       $ 18,272,000
                                       ============

   As a result of an impairment review by management at December 31, 2002
   prompted by the sale of the Company to ProxyMed (see Note 16), the Company
   incurred an impairment charge of $3,194,000 in relation to certain of the
   identifiable intangible assets from the Acquisition (see Note 6). The
   resulting fair values recorded were based on an independent third-party
   appraisal of the assets utilizing a replacement cost methodology.

4. INVESTMENT IN WARRANT OF QUOVADX, INC.

   In October 2000, the Company entered into a Software License and Services
   Agreement (the "Agreement") with Quovadx, Inc., formerly XCare.net, Inc.
   ("Quovadx") under which Quovadx provided software development and hosting
   services related to the Company's internet portal. The development services
   were invoiced to the Company on a time and materials basis and the hosting
   service fees were invoiced based on the number of servers hosted. In June
   2001, the Company accepted and paid approximately $6,700,000 for a perpetual
   software license, which is included in property and equipment. However, as a
   result of an impairment review by management at December 31, 2002, the
   Company wrote down the remaining net book value of the license to its fair
   market value (see Note 5).

   While the Company has taken an impairment charge for the perpetual software
   license, it is evaluating whether it still may be liable to purchase software
   maintenance services from Quovadx through December 31, 2005. Such
   commitments, if paid, would be due as follows:

   During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company capitalized $2,006,000
   of internal-use software development costs.

   Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment,
   including amortization of internal-use software development costs, was
   $8,829,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

   As a result of an impairment review by management at December 31, 2002
   prompted by the sale of the Company to ProxyMed (see Note 16), the Company
   wrote-down certain software and license fees associated with its processing
   platforms and previously capitalized internal-use software resulting in
   impairment charges totaling $8,476,000. The resulting fair values recorded
   were based on an independent third-party appraisal of the assets utilizing a
   replacement cost methodology.

                                                             ===========


   Through December 31, 2002, intangible assets were being amortized using the
   straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:

                Software platform                             3 years
                Non-compete agreement                         5 years

9. DEBT

   During 2001 and 2000, the Company received proceeds of $24,340,000 and
   $20,000,000, respectively, from its founders in connection with the issuance
   of convertible notes payable (the "Notes"), as amended. The Notes have annual
   interest rates ranging from 6.10% to 6.53%. The principal balance of the
   Notes automatically converted into 44,340,331 shares of Series A preferred
   stock at $1.00 per share upon the closing the Acquisition in August 2001. The
   outstanding accrued interest of $1,565,000 was converted into notes payable
   at 6% stated interest per year. The Company imputed an interest rate of 12%
   on these notes, which more accurately reflects the rate that the Company
   would pay to a third party lender. The resulting debt discount of $129,000
   was recorded as additional paid-in capital because the notes were issued to
   the founders. The notes are repayable in four quarterly installments during
   2003. Accrued interest related to these notes of $133,000 is included in
   accrued liabilities at December 31, 2002.

   During 2001, the Company issued a promissory note in connection with the
   Acquisition. The note has a principal amount of $2,300,000 payable in full in
   August 2004, and was initially recorded at its estimated fair value of
   $1,996,000, representing an effective annual interest rate of 12%. Accrued
   interest related to this note of $198,000 is included in other long-term
   liabilities at December 31, 2002.

   In February 2002, the Company issued convertible promissory notes bearing
   interest at 2.74% per annum, pursuant to a note purchase agreement with its
   founders, under which the Company borrowed an aggregate amount of
   $18,160,000. Under the terms of the promissory notes, in the event that the
   Company issues and sells shares of Series B Preferred Stock to new investors
   with total proceeds of not less than $30,000,000, including the $18,160,000
   advanced, prior to February 2003, then the outstanding principal of the
   convertible promissory notes will automatically convert into shares of Series
   B Preferred Stock at the same price per share that the shares of Series B
   Preferred Stock are sold to the new investors. If a financing does not occur
   before February 2003, then the outstanding principal balance (except for
   $2,569,000 owed to NDCHealth representing NDCHealth's contribution in this
   financing in excess of its prorata ownership in the Company) will
   automatically convert into shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the price
   per share equal to the then fair market value. The Series B Preferred Stock
   will have such rights, preferences and privileges as are approved by the
   required vote of the founders (as defined in the Company's amended and
   restated certificate of incorporation); provided that the rights of the
   Series B Preferred stockholders shall be pari passu to the rights of the
   Series A Preferred stockholders upon a liquidation of the Company. The
   Company imputed an interest rate of 8% on these notes, which more accurately
   reflects the rate that the Company would pay to a third party lender. The
   resulting debt discount of $885,000 was recorded as additional paid-in
   capital because the notes were issued to the founders. Accrued interest
   related to these notes of $444,000 is included in accrued liabilities at
   December 31, 2002.

   In August 2002, the Company issued promissory notes bearing interest at 6%
   per annum, pursuant to a note purchase agreement with its founders, under
   which the Company subsequently borrowed the maximum amount available of
   $5,815,000. The outstanding principal amount of the loan is due and payable
   on the earliest of the following events: (a) December 31, 2002, (b) the date
   that the Company completes an equity financing for the minimum amount of
   $20,000,000 or (c) the effective date of a change of control of the Company.
   The Company imputed an interest rate of 12% on these notes, which more
   accurately reflects the rate that the Company would pay to a third party
   lender. The resulting debt discount of $96,000 was recorded as additional
   paid-in capital because the notes were issued to the founders. Accrued
   interest related to these notes of $81,000 is included in accrued liabilities
   at December 31, 2002.

   Maturities of long-term debt and notes payable are as follows (see Note 16):

10. COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK

    COMMON STOCK

    The rights and privileges of the common stock under the Company's Amended
    and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are as follows:

    Each holder of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is entitled to
    one vote per share. Holders of Class B common stock, voting as a separate
    class, are entitled to elect or remove from office the founders' members of
    the Company's Board of Directors. The holders of all outstanding shares of
    Company stock, voting together on an if-converted basis as a single class,
    are entitled to elect all remaining members of the Board of Directors.

    Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into an equal
    number of shares of Class A common stock transferred to a non-founder. Class
    B common stock transferred to a non-founder will automatically convert into
    Class A common stock. In addition, Class B common stock owned by the
    founders will automatically convert into Class A common stock upon the
    earlier of (a) the fifth anniversary of an initial public offering of the
    Company, or (b) when the founders own, in aggregate, less than 50% of Class
    B common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the Series A
    preferred stock.

    PREFERRED STOCK

    The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A preferred stock under
    the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are as
    follows:

    DIVIDENDS - The holders of shares of the Series A preferred stock are
    entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the original issue price,
    which is $1.00 per share, per annum (subject to appropriate adjustment in
    the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
    recapitalization affecting such shares), payable when and as declared by the
    Board of Directors of the Company. The right to receive dividends shall be
    noncumulative; however the Company shall not declare or pay any
    distributions on shares of common stock until the preferred stockholders
    have received a cumulative distribution at the rate specified above.

    LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE - In certain events, including liquidation,
    dissolution or winding up of the Company, including a consolidation or
    merger and conveyance of substantially all of the assets of the Company, the
    holders of Series A preferred stock have a preference in liquidation over
    the common stockholders equal to the original issue price of $1.00 per share
    (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock
    split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares),
    plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If the assets of the Company
    are not sufficient to fulfill the liquidation amount, the stockholders will
    share in the liquidation amount on a pro rata basis.

    SALE OF THE COMPANY - In the event the Board of Directors decides to pursue
    the sale of the Company, the founders shall be given the first right of
    refusal to acquire the Company. If none of the founders exercise this right,
    NDCHealth has the option to purchase the Company (see Note 16).

    VOTING RIGHTS - Each holder of preferred stock shall be entitled to the
    number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into
    which they are then convertible. Holders of Series A preferred stock, voting
    as a separate class, are entitled to elect or remove from office the
    founders' members of the Company's Board of Directors.

    CONVERSION - Each share of preferred stock is automatically convertible into
    one share of Class B common stock (subject to customary adjustments to
    protect against dilution) upon the closing of a public offering of the
    Company's common stock that results in gross proceeds of at least
    $50,000,000.

11. INCOME TAXES

    At December 31, 2002, deferred tax assets consist of the following:


         Net operating loss carryforwards            $ 29,865,000
         Capitalized start-up costs                     9,789,000

         Deferred tax asset valuation allowance       (35,061,000)
                                                     ------------

                                                     ============

    Due to the uncertainty of the Company generating future taxable income, the
    Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

    A reconciliation of income taxes to the amounts computed by applying the
    statutory federal income tax rate to the net loss is summarized as follows:


         Amounts computed at statutory federal rate      $(16,611,000)
         State taxes                                       (2,430,000)

                                                         ------------
                                                         $         --
                                                         ============

    At December 31, 2002, the Company had $71,876,000 and $71,876,000 of federal
    and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, which will be
    limited under Internal Revenues Section 382 due to the change in ownership
    that occurred on December 31, 2002. The federal and state net operating loss
    carryforwards begin to expire in 2020 and 2010, respectively.


12. STOCK OPTIONS

    The Company has adopted the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan")
    providing for the granting of up to 10,280,374 shares of the Company's
    common stock. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options and
    restricted stock awards. Incentive stock options granted under the Plan must
    be granted with strike prices not less than the fair market value.
    Non-qualified stock options granted under the Plan must be granted with
    strike prices not less than 85% of fair market value. Options generally
    expire ten years from the date of grant. Option vesting is determined by the
    Board of Directors upon each grant and is generally a five-year period.

    In June 2000, the Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with
    an executive under which the Company issued stock options to purchase
    2,803,738 shares of common stock and is obligated to issue 847,458 shares of
    restricted common stock to the executive. If the executive's employment
    terminates, other than for cause, prior to the fifth anniversary of the
    executive's hire date, the Company is obligated to repurchase all of the
    restricted common stock for an aggregate price equal to the greater of the
    then fair market value or $1,000,000. Commencing on the fifth anniversary of
    the executive's hire date, the executive has a right to sell all or some of
    his shares of restricted common stock and stock option shares to the Company



                                       14
<PAGE>

    for a guaranteed fixed pre-tax gain of $7,000,000 in the aggregate assuming
    all shares were repurchased. This amount was being recognized as
    compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the five-year service
    period. Through December 31, 2002, $3,558,000 had been recorded as deferred
    compensation; however, this amount was adjusted to $1,000,000 pursuant to a
    separation agreement entered into with the executive on December 31, 2002
    (see Note 16). As a result, the Company has recorded a gain of $2,558,000
    pursuant to this event.

    During 2002, no options were granted or exercised and options for 3,738,318
    shares (including those of the executive noted above) were
    forfeited/cancelled (with an average exercise price of $1.32).

    At December 31, 2002, 5,566,233 shares were available for future grants
    under the Plans.

    The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding as
    of December 31, 2002 (see Note 16):

</TABLE>

    PRO FORMA EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE

    Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based compensation been
    determined based on fair value of the options at the date of the grant, the
    Company's net loss would not have been materially different from the net
    loss reported for 2002.

    The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
    assumptions for grants during 2001: dividend yield of 0%, expected life of
    five years, expected volatility of 0%, and risk-free interest rate of 6%. No
    options were granted during 2002.


13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for substantially all
    employees who meet certain minimum lengths of employment and minimum age
    requirements. Contributions are made by employees based on the lesser of 60%
    of eligible compensation or the deferral limit set by the government
    ($11,000 in 2002). Non-discretionary employer matching contributions are
    made up to 100% of the employee's pretax contribution up to a maximum of 6%
    of eligible compensation. Matching contributions vest under a five-year
    schedule, based on completed full years of service, as follows: 20% after
    one year; 40% after two years; 60% after three years; 80% after four years;
    and 100% after five years. Matching contributions totaling $668,000 for the
    year ended December 31, 2002 have been expensed.

14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    The Company was founded by seven leading insurance companies who are
    expected to be among the Company's primary customers (the "Founders"). In
    August 2001, the Company entered into service agreements with each of the
    Founders under which the Company will facilitate specified business
    transactions for fees. These agreements have a term of two years and
    automatically renew for successive annual periods, if not cancelled by
    either party.

    At December 31, 2002 the Company has accounts receivable from its Founders
    in the aggregate amount of $419,000. During 2002, the Company recognized
    revenue of $1,983,000 from its Founders.

    At December 31, 2002, the Company has accounts receivable from NDCHealth of
    $1,315,000 and accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to NDCHealth of
    $2,053,000. During 2002, the Company transacted the following with NDCHealth
    (i) recognized revenue of $4,897,000; (ii) recognized the reimbursement of
    expenses of certain operating costs of $569,000; and (iii) incurred amounts
    payable to under revenue sharing, rebate and expense reimbursement
    agreements totaling $3,509,000.

                                             ===========

    During 2002, the Company acquired assets under capital leases totaling
    $84,000. Assets under capital leases included in property and equipment at
    December 31, 2002 had a net book value of $374,000, which includes
    accumulated amortization of $215,900.

    Rent expense was $2,155,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Certain
    facility operating leases contain escalation clauses. The Company recognizes
    rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related lease term.

    In connection with its facilities lease in San Diego, California, the
    Company entered into an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of
    $750,000. The letter of credit expires September 30, 2004. In an effort to
    control its operating costs, the Company has engaged a commercial real
    estate broker to assist the Company in subleasing or terminating its
    facilities lease in San Diego. As of December 31, 2002, gross rents of
    $2,509,000 remain on this property through September 2004 and are included
    in the table above.

    EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

    The Company entered into employment agreements with certain executives that
    provide for cash severance payments if the executives are terminated without
    cause. The Company's aggregate commitment under these agreements is
    $1,535,000 at December 31, 2002.

    The Company has entered into retention agreements with several key
    management employees. The bonuses due under these retention agreements are
    payable in two parts: 50% upon a change of control of the Company and 50%
    upon the earlier to occur of (i) 90 days following the change in control
    event or (ii) involuntary termination of the employee. As of December 31,
    2002, the Company's total potential commitment under these retention
    agreements was $257,000.

    SERVICES AGREEMENT

    In April 2002, the Company entered into a three-year information technology
    services agreement to outsource certain hosting, system maintenance and
    operation services. Actual service fees are based on the number of
    transactions processed by the software being supported; however, the Company
    is committed to pay a minimum annual service fee of $1,212,000. At December
    31, 2002, $790,000 is accrued towards this minimum annual amount. The
    Company has the option to cancel the agreement by providing 90 days notice
    and paying an early termination fee which will be equal to between one and
    three months' average transaction fees, depending upon when the agreement is
    terminated.

16. ACQUISITION BY PROXYMED

    On December 31, 2002, the Company was sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    ProxyMed for $10.0 million in cash and $13.4 million in 4% Convertible Notes
    paid to the founders due December 31, 2008.

    As a result of this transaction, the following events took place (i) all
    capital stock held by the Founders, including any restricted stock held by
    other parties as part of compensation-related plans, were cancelled; (ii)
    all notes payable, convertible notes and related accrued interest to the
    Founders (except for the $2,300,000 issued to NDC Health in the Acquisition,
    plus $198,000 of accrued interest on this note, and a $2,569,000 note
    payable issued to NDCHealth on December 31, 2002) were cancelled; (iii) all
    stock options outstanding under the Company's 2001 Equity Incentive Plan
    were cancelled; and (iv) NDC Health waived its right of first refusal to
    purchase the Company.

    Subsequent to the acquisition by ProxyMed, the Company's senior management
    team was terminated along with approximately 20% of the general workforce in
    an effort to control costs. Additionally, the Company has attempted to enter
    into financing agreements with certain major vendors and, as noted in Note
    15, has attempted to sublease or terminate is facilities lease in San Diego
    as a means to curtail cash flow.
