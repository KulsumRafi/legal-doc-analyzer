made and may hereafter make loans to Borrower. The parties hereto have agreed to
amend the Credit Agreement in order to (i) provide for a temporary increase in
the amount of the Commitment, and (ii) extend the maturity of the Revolving

         Accordingly, for adequate and sufficient consideration, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders agree

2. Amendments.

         (a) The defined term "Commitment" in Section 1.1 of the Credit
Agreement is amended in its entirety as follows:

                           "Commitment" means an amount (subject to reduction or

                           $35,000,000 for the period between March 19, 2003,
                           and the Commitment Reduction Date, and (b)
                           $30,000,000 at any time thereafter. For purposes of
                           this paragraph, the term "Commitment Reduction Date"
                           means the earlier of (i) the closing date of the
                           first Asset Securitization to be completed after
                           March 19, 2003, and (ii) June 30, 2003.

         (b) The defined term "Stated Termination Date" in Section 1.1 of the
Credit Agreement is amended in its entirety as follows:

                           "Stated Termination Date" means May 31, 2004.
