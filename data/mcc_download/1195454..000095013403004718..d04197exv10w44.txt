               (a) SBCS covenants and agrees to convert the Existing Traffic
          from Existing Traffic Services to Existing TSA Services or New
          Services within 12 months after the Overlay Network is sufficiently

          as applicable (the "Service Conversion"), subject to Section 3.3 of
          the Master Alliance Agreement, and provided that SBCS shall be

          covenant and agree that Williams will have no obligation to provide

                                                            TO TRANSPORT
                                                            SERVICES AGREEMENT


                      PRICING FOR EXISTING TRAFFIC SERVICES

         This is Schedule O to the Transport Services Agreement dated as of
February 8, 1999, as amended as of September 29, 2000 (the "Amendment"), among
SBCS and Williams.

1. Definitions. The following terms, when used in this Schedule with initial
capital letters, shall have the means given thereto in this Section 1. Other
terms used in this Schedule with initial capital letters but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meaning given thereto in the TSA or in
the Purchase Agreement.

               "Access and Offnet Transport Amount" - means, for each Prepayment
Period, the product of (a) the amount of SBCS' monthly cost for access and
offnet transport for the Existing Traffic (both prior to and after the Service
Conversion) as at the most recent month end prior to (i) the Closing Date with
respect to the year 2000; (ii) the end of the immediately preceding Prepayment
Period with respect to Prepayment Period II and each Prepayment Period
thereafter, and (b) the number of months in the related Prepayment Period. An
example of the determination of such payments for February 2000 is shown as
"Total Usage Paid" on Attachment 1.

               "Applicable Percentage" - means, the proration, for each
Prepayment Period after the first Prepayment Period, for the percentage of
annual volume of Existing Traffic on the Transferred Assets, the percentage of
annual volume of Existing Traffic which will be converted during such Prepayment
Period to Existing TSA Services on the Overlay Network and the percentage of
annual volume of Existing Traffic which will be converted during such Prepayment
Period to New Services on the Overlay Network. The parties agree to negotiate in
good faith to determine each percentage prior to the beginning of each
subsequent Prepayment Period after the first Prepayment Period. For example,
after the first Prepayment Period, the parties may determine that, for the next
Prepayment Period, 70% of the Existing Traffic will remain on the Transferred
Assets, 30% of the Existing Traffic will be converted to Existing TSA Services
on the Overlay Network and 0% of the Existing Traffic will be converted to New
Services on the Overlay Network. Each of these percentages would be the
"Applicable Percentage" and would be used in determining the Prepaid Amount for
the next Prepayment Period.

               "C Amount" - means, for each Prepayment Period, the product of
(a) the then applicable OnNet C Rate, and (b) the then Applicable Percentage of
the number of minutes of the MOU Commitment which are being carried over the
Transferred Assets.


<PAGE>

               "Local Facilities and Offnet IXC Circuit Amount" - means, for
each Prepayment Period, the product of (a) the amount of SBCS' monthly cost for
local facilities and offnet interexchange circuits for the Existing Traffic as
at the most recent month end prior to (i) the Closing Date with respect to the
year 2000; (ii) the end of the immediately preceding Prepayment Period with
respect to Prepayment Period II and each Prepayment Period thereafter, and (b)
the number of months in the related Prepayment Period. An example of the
determination of such payments for February 2000 is shown as "Total Fixed Costs
Paid" on Attachment 1. The Local Facilities and Offnet IXC Circuit Amount to be
prepaid will not include charges for Customer OnNet Private Lines and Customer
Offnet Private Lines. Offnet IXC circuits will be deducted from the Prepayment
Amount at the rates set forth in the pricing agreement between the parties which
is attached as Attachment 3.

               "Monthly Rack Charge" - as set forth for each location in the
last column of the following chart:

The Real Estate Lease component of the above Monthly Rack Charges shall be
adjusted to reflect changes in lease payments made by Williams pursuant to the
terms of a particular Real Estate Lease. In addition, the Parties will review
the electricity and maintenance expenses at each location and will in good faith
negotiate new costs if the electricity price index increases by more than 10%.
The parties agree that in the event SBCS' amp usage exceeds the breaker size,
the parties will negotiate in good faith the "Amperage Charge Per Rack" in order
to compensate Williams for the increase in usage.

for its customers is attached as Attachment 2 (the "Customer Offnet Private
Lines"). Customer Offnet Private Lines shall be billed by Williams to SBCS in
accordance with Section 9 of the TSA at the off-net pricing set forth therefore
in the pricing agreement attached as Attachment 3. The monthly charges for the
Customer Offnet Private Lines shall be in addition to the Prepaid Amount and
shall not be deducted as an expense in determination thereof.

5. Customer OnNet Private Lines. The existing on net private line circuits which
are maintained for SBCS' customers and are supplied on the Transferred Assets
(the "Customer OnNet Private Lines") are listed in Attachment 4. Customer OnNet
Private Lines shall be billed by Williams to SBCS in accordance with Section 9
of the TSA at standard TSA prices; provided, however, that no charges shall
apply until the earliest of (a) March 30, 2001 or (b) the first MOU of Existing
Traffic traverses the Overlay Network. The monthly Customer OnNet Private Line
charges shall be in addition to the Prepaid Amount and shall not be deducted as
an expense in the determination thereof.

6. True-Up of Actual Usage vs. Prepaid Amount.

               (a) Within six (6) business days after the close of each month,
SBCS will prepare a monthly MOU report indicating for the Existing Traffic the
MOUs carried on the Transferred Assets for such month. This report will be
generated by summarizing CDR and AMA records, both billable and erred, to
calculate conversation MOUs. For purposes of the SBCS report, MOUs shall not be
rounded in any way. A copy of the form of SBCS monthly report is attached as
Attachment 5.

               (b) Within six (6) business days after the close of each month,
Williams will prepare a monthly MOU report indicating for the Existing Traffic
the MOUs carried on the Overlay Network for such month. For purposes of the
Williams report, rounding for MOUs on the Overlay Network shall be as follows:
Unbundled usage sensitive charges are billed based on actual usage for all calls
in one (1) second increments. Bundled usage sensitive charges are billed based
on actual usage for all answered calls that exceed two (2) seconds. The minimum
call duration for billing purposes is: (a) for international service, except
Mexico, thirty (30) seconds minimum initial period and usage is rounded to the
next higher six (6) second increment after the initial period; (b) for service
to and from Mexico, sixty (60) seconds minimum initial period and usage is
rounded to the next higher sixty (60) second increment after the initial period;
(c) for service to and from extended U.S., including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico
and Guam, six (6) seconds minimum initial period and usage is rounded to the
next higher six (6) second increment after the initial period. The information
to be included in the Williams' monthly report is as follows: billing period;
account number; total billed bundled MOUs and total billed transport MOUs.

               (c) If the actual usage by SBCS of MOUs for a particular
Prepayment Period falls short of the Committed MOUs for such Prepayment Period,
then, promptly after the end of each Prepayment Period, the parties shall
perform a calculation (the "Shortfall Calculation"). The Shortfall Calculation
shall be performed as follows: take the product of (i) the Committed MOUs for
the applicable Prepayment Period minus the number of MOUs actually purchased by
SBCS for such Prepayment Period (the "Shortfall"), and (ii) the Blended Rate.
The Blended Rate shall be equal to the weighted average of the OnNet C Rate and
the rates for Existing TSA Services and New Services as of the last month of the
applicable Prepayment Period. The product of the Shortfall and the Blended Rate
shall be the "Shortfall Amount". SBCS shall be required to pay to Williams the
Shortfall Amount within thirty (30) days from SBCS' receipt of an invoice from
Williams for such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the
Prepaid Amount remains at the end of the Prepayment Period (the "Excess Prepaid
Amount"), SBCS shall receive a credit for the Excess Prepaid Amount against the
Shortfall Amount. If the Excess Prepaid Amount for the applicable Prepayment
Period exceeds the Shortfall Amount, then the excess shall be applied to the
Prepaid Amount for the next Prepayment Period.

               (d) If the deductions of the applicable price hereunder for the
actual usage by SBCS of MOUs during a particular Prepayment Period cause the
Prepaid Amount for such Prepayment Period to be exhausted (i.e. the Prepaid
Amount runs out prior to the end of the Prepayment Period), then SBCS shall, as
of the date such Prepaid Amount is exhausted, begin paying all of the charges
included in the Prepaid Amount for the balance of such Prepayment

<PAGE>

Period at the then applicable rates on a monthly basis according to the payment
terms in Section 9 of the TSA.

               (e) The amount of actual MOUs for the Existing Traffic and the
pricing therefor under this Schedule O will be tracked monthly by the Parties
against the running balance of Prepaid Amounts and will be reconciled on a
quarterly basis between actual usage and the related Prepaid Amount.

7. Recalculated OnNet C Rate. The On Net C Rate will be recalculated for each
Six-Month Period after the first Six-Month Period (the "Recalculated OnNet C
Rate"), by dividing an average of the last two months of Williams' depreciation
and direct expenses to operate the Transferred Assets (which expenses shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the determination made by the Parties of
the On Net C Rate for the first Six-Month Period hereunder) by a monthly average
of the last six months of MOUs of the Existing Traffic. The Recalculated OnNet C
Rate shall then be used for the deduction against the Prepaid Amount for the
next Six-Month Period. The direct expenses and depreciation for Customer OnNet
Private Lines and collocation will be excluded from the pool of expenses
starting with the first six-month recalculation of the OnNet C Rate.

         An example of the calculation is as follows:

                    After the first six months, Williams's two-month recent cost
               to operate the Transferred Assets is $4,600,000, for an average
               monthly cost of $2,300,000. The annual cost, therefore, is
               $27,600,000 and with a [**********], totals [***********]. The
               average monthly MOU on both the Transferred  Assets and MOUs
               transitioned to the Overlay Network are [***********] MOUs a
               month, or [*************] MOUs a year. The Recalculated OnNet C
               Rate for the next Six-Month Period would be [***********] of
               expense divided by the [*************] MOUs, for [******] per
               MOU.

8. Determination of Actual MOU Usage Pricing. In determining the pricing of
actual MOU usage under this Schedule O for purposes of the true-up under Section
6, the following shall apply:

         (a) Existing Traffic Services. The pricing of Existing Traffic Services
shall be at the OnNet C Rate while carried on the Transferred Assets.

         (b) Existing TSA Services. Once Existing Traffic is converted to
Existing TSA Services on the Overlay Network, the rate at which such Existing
TSA Services shall be deducted from the Prepaid Amount shall be equal to the
rates set forth in the TSA.

         (c) New Services. Once Existing Traffic is converted to New Services on
the Overlay Network, the rate at which such New Services shall be deducted from
the Prepaid



<PAGE>

Amount shall be equal to the rates agreed upon by the parties in accordance with
Section 2A.3(b).

         (d) LEC Usage. The expenses of LEC usage for the Existing Traffic which
includes monthly payments for access and offnet transport, variable and other
miscellaneous charges like 800 dips, DA costs, etc., will be deducted from the
Prepaid Amount [***********************]. Actuals will be reported by SBCS in
the monthly report referred to in Section 6(a).

         (e) Facility Portion. The expenses of the facility portion of monthly
payments for local facilities for the Existing Traffic will be deducted from the
Prepaid Amount [**** *******************]. Actuals will be reported by SBCS in
the monthly report referred to in Section 6(a).

         (f) Off Net IXC Circuits. The expenses of off-net IXC circuits for the
Existing Traffic that use the DMS 250 switches included in the Transferred
Assets will be deducted from the Prepaid Amount at the rates set forth for off
net circuits in the pricing agreement attached as Attachment 3. Actuals will be
reported by SBCS in the monthly report referred to in Section 6(a).

         (g) OffNet Circuits at Onnet Rates. In no event will SBCS receive
On-Net Transport Services pricing under the TSA for any Off-Net circuit or
transport unless and until such circuit or transport has been physically
transitioned to the Overlay Network.
