PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL

Mr. Richard C. Camilleri
2306 Mississauga Road North
Mississauga, Ontario
L5H 2Ll

Dear Rick:

Further to our discussions, I am pleased to provide herein the terms of your
employment with CanWest Global Communications Corp. (the "Company"), as follows:

1.  Title:                 Chief Operating Officer

2.  Start Date:            June 1, 2002 or as agreed between the parties

3.  Location:              Winnipeg, Manitoba

4.  Initial Location:      Given the high profile nature of the job and the
                           difficulty involved in transplanting yourself and
                           your family from Toronto to Winnipeg, and the need to
                           understand our largest business units which are based
                           in Toronto, you will be based in Toronto until
                           December 31, 2002 and, thereafter, you will be
                           required to relocate to Winnipeg. You will be
                           required to spend at least one (1) day per week in
                           Winnipeg until then.

5.  Salary:                $600,000 per annum

6.  Incentive Bonus:       Up to 60% of your base remuneration. You will be

                           plan, which essentially provides that 75% of the
                           bonus is based on achievement of overall corporate
                           financial objectives, and 25% is based on achievement
                           of personal objectives set by the Chief Executive
                           Officer. The financial objectives include performance
                           thresholds based on net earnings, earnings per share,
                           and return on shareholders' equity.

7.  Stock Options:         You will receive a grant of 50,000 options at the
                           Start Date and, thereafter, you will be eligible to
                           receive up to 40,000 options per annum pursuant to
                           the Company's Executive Stock Option Plan ("ESOP").

                           2003 Year (CanWest's Fiscal Year ends August 31). The
                           ESOP is an earnings driven plan so option grants are
                           made only if the financial

                           targets are achieved. A copy of the ESOP will be
                           forwarded to you as soon as possible. The ESOP may be

12. Company Vehicle:       You will be entitled to the use of a vehicle with a

                           the real estate commission on its sale, the Company
                           will provide you with a furniture allowance of up to

                           equivalent to three (3) months' basic salary; namely,
                           $150,000. Similarly, you will be able to terminate

Mr. Richard C. Camilleri

Dear Rick:

Thank you for your various recent e-mails. It appears the executed copies of the
letter agreement dated May 22, 2002 (the "Agreement") are at Leonard Asper's
home office. Once same are obtained, we will return one (1) fully executed
original to you for your records.

Based on your subsequent discussion with Leonard Asper, I confirm that your
"Start Date" will now be July 2, 2002 rather than June 1, 2002. That being the
case, the so-called "probationary period" should be extended one (1) month as
well. Accordingly, this letter will serve as our mutual agreement to amend the
Agreement by providing that all references in the Agreement to "December 31,
2002" shall be read as "January 31, 2003".

All of the terms and conditions of the Agreement remain unchanged.

Kindly acknowledge your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and
returning the duplicate copy of this letter to my attention.

We are greatly anticipating your arrival and hope that the Winnipeg summer will
be in full bloom for your first "official visit".

Yours very truly,


Richard M. Leipsic
Vice President & General Counsel
