below: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Affiliated
Corporation" means any corporation that is a member of the "affiliated group" (as defined in Section&nbsp;1504 of the Code) of which the Company is a member. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anniversary
Date" means any or a specific anniversary of the Effective Date, as the context requires. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cause"
means (a)&nbsp;conviction of Executive for a felony, or the entry by Executive of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony, (b)&nbsp;a willful and material breach by
Executive of paragraph&nbsp;6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement, (c)&nbsp;the commission of an act of fraud involving dishonesty for personal gain which is materially injurious to the Company,
(d)&nbsp;the willful and continued refusal by the Executive to substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such refusal resulting from his incapacity due to mental illness or
physical illness or injury), after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Company's Board of Directors, where such demand specifically identifies the manner in which
the Company's Board of Directors believes that the Executive has refused to substantially perform his duties and the passage of a reasonable period of time for Executive to comply with such demand or
(e)&nbsp;the willful engaging by the Executive in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company or its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this paragraph, no act or failure to act
on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best
interest of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to termination for Cause arising out of conduct described in clause&nbsp;(b), (c), (d)&nbsp;or
(e)&nbsp;above, the Executive may not be terminated for Cause unless there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than
three-quarters of the entire Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting of such board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the
Executive, together with his counsel or other advisors, to be heard at such meeting), finding that in the good faith opinion of the board the Executive had engaged in conduct described above in
clause&nbsp;(b), (c), (d), or (e)&nbsp;of the first sentence of this paragraph and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such a finding by the Board of Directors of the Company is a
prerequisite to a termination for Cause pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (d)&nbsp;or (e)&nbsp;above; provided, however, that such a finding may be challenged, by appropriate judicial process, on the
merits (i.e., that Cause did not exist) or on the basis that the board's finding was not made in good faith (provided that proof that Cause for termination existed shall be a complete defense to any
showing that the board's findings was not made in good faith). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Code"
means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cost
of Living Amount" means an amount calculated by multiplying the Base Salary then in effect by a fraction, (a)&nbsp;the numerator of which shall be the amount (not less than zero)
by which the latest Cost of Living Index available as of the time of determination exceeds the Cost of Living Index for the same period during the immediately preceding year, and (b)&nbsp;the
denominator of which shall be the latest Cost of Living Index for the same period during the immediately preceding year. </FONT></P>
