installments on, or as soon as reasonably practical after, September 1, 2001,

The Company will pay to the Employee a second retention bonus equal to
the Employee&#146;s Target Bonus, payable in cash in two equal installments on, or
as soon as reasonably practical after, March 1, 2003, and September 1,

employed by the Company on the applicable payment date to receive the payment
due on that date. (Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employee&#146;s employment
with the Company terminates before a particular payment date because of the
Employee&#146;s death or Disability, the Company will pay to the Employee (or the
Employee&#146;s estate in the case of death) a prorated portion of the retention
bonus payment otherwise due on such payment date, based upon the number of days
the Employee remained employed by the Company since the previous payment
date.)&#160; These retention bonuses will
take the place of all other incentive compensation, whether annual or
long-term, for the Company&#146;s 2001 and 2002 fiscal years (except for any project
bonus the Employee may be eligible to receive).&#160; If the Employee is eligible for a project bonus for 2001, the
retention bonus payments payable on September 1, 2001, and March 1, 2002, under

bonus for 2002, the retention bonus payments payable on September 1, 2002, and
March 1, 2003, under this Agreement shall be offset against the project bonus
for 2002.&#160; The retention bonus payment
payable on September 1, 2003, shall be offset against any annual incentive or
project incentive compensation otherwise payable for the Company&#146;s 2003 fiscal
