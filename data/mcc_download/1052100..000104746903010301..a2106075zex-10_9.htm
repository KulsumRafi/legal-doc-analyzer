the first through tenth anniversaries of the Award Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercisability of any Option held by a Covered Employee shall be deferred to the extent that the
Committee, in its discretion, determines that current exercise of the Option would cause loss of the Company's tax deduction pursuant to Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. In no event
shall such deferral continue beyond the first day of the calendar year after the Optionee ceases to be a Covered Employee. An Optionee's death, Disability, retirement or other termination of
employment shall not shorten the term of any outstanding Option. In no event shall the period of time over which the Option may be exercised exceed the longer of (i)&nbsp;eleven years from the Award
Grant Date, or (ii)&nbsp;the thirtieth (30th) day of the calendar year immediately following the year in which an Optionee ceased to be a Covered Employee. An Option, or portion thereof, may be
exercised in whole or in part only with respect to whole Shares. Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company
specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, in cash, by check or such other instrument as may be acceptable to the Committee (including
instruments providing for "cashless exercise"). Payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of unrestricted Shares already owned by the Optionee or restricted stock or deferred stock
subject to an award under the Waddell&nbsp;&amp; Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date the Option is exercised,
as determined by the Committee). If payment of the option exercise price of an Option is made in whole or in part in the form of restricted stock or deferred stock, the Shares received upon the
exercise of such Option shall be restricted or deferred, as the case may be, in accordance with the original term of the restricted stock award or deferred stock award in question, except that such
restrictions or deferral provisions shall apply to only the number of such Shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or deferred stock surrendered upon the exercise of such Option. No
Shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An Optionee shall have rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to the Option when the
Optionee has given written notice of exercise and has paid in full for such Shares. </FONT></P>

exercise price equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of exercise of the prior Option, having a term of no more than the later of either (i)&nbsp;the original option period

Option, plus the number of shares (if any) withheld to cover income taxes and employment taxes (plus any selling commissions) on the exercise. "Annual SORP Exercise Date" shall mean August&nbsp;1,
or if August&nbsp;1 is not a trading day on the New York Stock Exchange, "Annual SORP Exercise Date" shall mean the next succeeding trading date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may
