         limited to, information, manuals, credit cards, cell phone, laptop,
         software, and any other equipment acquired during his term of
         employment. Further, Employee agrees to waive any severance payments
         or any other rights (but not any obligations due to Employer) due
         under his employment agreement dated March 30,1998.

2.       NO ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he shall
         receive no benefits other than set forth herein. Employee has 13,334
         (as of 14 March 2003) vested options as attached in Exhibit A and all
         stock options will expire 30 days after Employee's employment
         termination date pursuant to the Manhattan Associates Stock Option
         Plan.

3.       COMPLIANCE WITH CONFIDENTIALITY. Employee agrees not to use or share
         any confidential, proprietary or trade secret information about any
         aspect of Employer's business with any non-Manhattan Associates
         employee or business entity at any time in the future.

4.       RELEASE OF CLAIMS. For and in consideration of the promises,
         covenants, and warranties contained herein, and other good and
         valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby expressly
         acknowledged, on behalf of himself, his heirs, administrators,
         executors, successors and assigns, Employee does hereby release,
         remise, acquit and forever discharge Employer and each of Employer's
         successors, assigns, subsidiaries, affiliates and parent corporations,
         and each and all of Employer's respective past and present officers,
         directors, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, from any and
         all rights, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses, actions
         and causes of action whatsoever, including but not limited to claims
         for compensation, stock options, stock rights, wages, benefits,

         or in any way related to Employee's employment or termination of
         employment with Employer, and/or any other matter or claim occurring
         or existing at any time from the beginning of time through the date of
         the execution of this Agreement. Employee understands and agrees that
         by signing this Agreement, he is giving up any right which he may have
         under federal, state, or municipal law, and is hereby covenanting not
         to file complaints or lawsuits or to assert any claims against

6.       EMPLOYEE STATEMENT ABOUT RELEASEES. Employee further agrees that he
         shall make no negative statements concerning, or take any action that
         derogates Employer or other Releasees, or its or other Releasees

         operations or damage any of Releasees' business relationships.

7.       EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS BY EMPLOYEE. Employee agrees and understands that
         any action by him in violation of this SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND

         repayment by the Employee of the value of all consideration paid to
         Employee by Employer pursuant to this Agreement, and shall further
         require Employee to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees in
         defending any action Employee brings, plus any other damages to which
         the Employer may be entitled.

8.       DENIAL OF LIABILITY. Employer and Employee understand and agree that
         the payment of the monies set forth in this Agreement does not
         constitute an admission of liability or violation of any applicable
         law, any contract provisions or any rule or regulation, as to which
         Releasees expressly deny liability. This Agreement shall not be
         admissible in any proceeding except an action to enforce its terms.

         force and effect.

10.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. Employee agrees that this SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND
         RELEASE constitutes the complete Agreement between the parties and

         Agreement to review this document, and within seven (7) days of
         signing this SEPARATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT, to revoke this
         Agreement. Employer agrees and Employee understands that he does not
         waive any rights or claims that may arise after the date this
