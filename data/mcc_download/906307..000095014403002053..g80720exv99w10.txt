                EXTENSION AND MODIFICATION AND SECURITY AGREEMENT


         This Extension and Modification And Security Agreement, dated as of
January 30, 2003 (the "Extension Agreement"), is made by and among Nutritional
Sourcing Corporation ("NSC"), a Delaware Corporation (f/k/a/ Pueblo Xtra
International, Inc.), Pueblo International, LLC ("Pueblo"), a Delaware limited
liability company, Xtra Super Food Centers, Inc.(Xtra), a Delaware corporation,
Pueblo Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Xtra Merger Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, Caribad, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation and All Truck,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (all, except NSC, herein referred to as a"Borrower"
or "Borrowers") and Westernbank Puerto Rico, a Puerto Rico banking corporation
(the "Lender").

                                   BACKGROUND

         A. Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of April 29, 1997 (as amended from time to time and including the Consent
Agreement, the "Credit Agreement"), among NSC, Pueblo, Xtra and the Syndication
Agent, the Administrative Agent (together, the "Agents"), and the Banks party
thereto from time to time. As provided in Article XII capitalized terms used
herein that are defined in the Credit Agreement and are not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings prescribed in the Credit Agreement.

         B. Prior to August 1, 2002 Pueblo had informed the Banks that it would
not pay certain interest due and payable on August 1, 2002 to NSC which in turn
resulted in the failure of NSC to pay required interest to the United States
Trust Company of New York as indenture trustee, pursuant to the terms of the
indentures (the "Indentures"), dated as of July 28, 1993 and April 29, 1997, on
August 1, 2002 (which was then the next due date for interest) in respect of the
PXI Senior Notes (collectively referred to as "Interest Payment Defaults"). The
Interest Payment Defaults constituted Events of Default under Section 9.04(a)(i)
of the Credit Agreement. The Interest Payment defaults also constituted defaults
in payment under the Indentures and were not cured and constituted "Events of



                                       2
<PAGE>

Default" under and as defined in such Indentures. Pueblo has also failed to
perform and comply with the covenanst contained in Sections 8.09, 8.10 and 8.11
of the Credit Agreement( the "Financial Covenant Defaults") which also
constituted Events of Default under the Credit Agreement.

         C. In connection with the Interest Payment Defaults, Pueblo requested
that the Banks forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the
Credit Documents. Subject to the terms and conditions of a Consent Agreement,
dated as of August 1, 2002 by and among NSC, Pueblo, Xtra, the Agents and the
Banks (the "Consent Agreement"), the Banks agreed to such request.

         D. As a result of the Interest Payment Defaults an involuntary petition
was filed against NSC under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in Case No. 02-12550 (the "Chapter 11 Case") in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court").
The Chapter 11 Case is pending.




                                       3

         E. All Obligations of Pueblo to the Banks pursuant to the Credit
Agreement, are due and payable February 1, 2002 (the "Due Date"). Such
Obligations are guaranteed by NSC. Neither the Borrower, NSC nor any other
person liable thereon has the means or ability to pay such Obligations on the
Due Date.

         F. The Borrowers and NSC have requested that Lender make revolving and
term loans to the Borrower and grant the Borrower other financial
accommodations, up to the maximum amount of $80,000,000 for a period of 5 years.
However, there is insufficient time for Lender to prepare the necessary
documentation and for the Borrower and NSC to provide the necessary security and
obtain the required approvals prior to the Due Date.

         G. Consequently, the Borrowers and NSC have requested that: (i) Lender
purchase the Loans and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement, (ii) extend
the times for payment thereof and (iii) grant the Borrowers additional Loans and
other financial accommodations, as a bridge loan until September 30, 2003, all
as a "bridge" facility and Lender is willing to do so, but only on the terms and


                                       4
<PAGE>

subject to the conditions of this Extension Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                                 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

         1.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EXISTING INTEREST PAYMENT DEFAULTS; EXISTING
CREDIT DOCUMENTS. The Borrowers and NSC acknowledge and agree that: (a) the
Interest Payment Defaults are material in nature and constitute Events of
Default; (b) the Credit Documents are, legal, binding, valid and enforceable
against the Borrowers and NSC in every respect and all of the terms and
conditions thereof are binding upon the Borrowers and NSC; (c) the PXI Senior
Notes are fully subordinated to the Obligations of the Borrower to the Banks
under the Credit Agreement; (d) the Subordinated Intercompany Notes are fully
subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the
Obligations and (e) as of the date hereof there exists no defense, setoff,
offset or counterclaim on the part of the Borrowers and NSC to any of the



                                       5
<PAGE>

Obligations. The Borrowers and NSC further acknowledge and agree that as of a
result of the Interest Payment Defaults and the Chapter 11 Case, the holder of
the Obligations is entitled, upon notice to the Borrower, to accelerate the
Obligations pursuant to the Credit Documents and to exercise all rights and
remedies under the Credit Documents, applicable law or otherwise. With respect
to the Interest Payment Defaults, to the extent that any of the Credit Documents
require notification to the Borrowers and NSC of the existence of a default or
an opportunity for the Borrowers and NSC to cure such a default, or both, such
notice and period for cure have been properly given by the Banks or are hereby
waived by the Borrower and NSC.

         1.2 ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF  OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS.   (a)  The
Borrowers and NSC  represent and warrant to Lender that as of the Closing
Date, the Borrower will be  indebted to the Banks in an aggregate amount

         (i) the principal sum of  $33,900,000, which it is anticipated will
be apportioned as follows:

         (ii) accrued but unpaid interest, L/C Fees, Facing Fees and
Commitment Commissions; plus

         (iii) the costs and expenses (including, reasonable attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Banks in connection with negotiation and preparation of the sale
of the Obligations to Lender.

         (b) The foregoing amounts, items 1.2(a)(i) through 1.2(a)(iii),
inclusive, are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Current Outstanding
Obligations". All such indebtedness will be owing by Borrowers and guaranteed by
NSC, without any rights of offset, counterclaims or defenses of any kind.
Nothing contained herein shall alter, amend, modify or extinguish the
obligations of any Credit Party to repay the Current Outstanding Obligations and
neither this Extension Agreement nor any of the other Financing Agreements
constitute a novation of any of the Credit Documents.

amounts now owed by the Credit Parties to the Banks and which will hereafter be
owed by the Credit Parties to the Lender hereunder and under the Credit
Documents.

         1.4 REAFFIRMATION OF SECURITY INTERESTS. (a) All of the assets of the
Credit Parties which were pledged, assigned, conveyed, mortgaged, hypothecated
or transferred to or in favor of the Banks pursuant to the Credit Documents
including, the Collateral, constitute and will constitute collateral security
for all of the Obligations. Each Credit Party hereby reaffirms its respective
prior conveyance to or in favor of the Collateral Agent and the Banks of a
continuing security interest in and lien on the Collateral as well as a security
interest in and lien upon any and all funds and/or monies of such Credit Party.

8.11 thereof), none of Borrowers or NSC is in default, and no other party is in
default, in any material respect under any of the Purchased Assets and no event

at closing, all Purchased Collateral where possession is a requisite to the
perfection of a security interest in the Purchased Collateral. The Banks have

requisite to the perfection of a security interest in the Purchased Collateral.

         (j) Borrowers have insured the Purchased Collateral at all times

                                   ARTICLE III
                           MODIFIED CREDIT FACILITIES

         In lieu of the Loans, Commitments and other financial accommodations
provided for in the Credit Agreement, Lender intends to make Loans and grant
Borrower other financial accommodations as hereafter set forth in this Article
III as follows:

         3.1      REVOLVING LOANS.

         (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions contained herein,
Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to Borrower from time to time in amounts
requested by Borrowers up to the amount equal to:

                  (i) Up to ninety (90%) percent of the Net Amount of Eligible
                  Accounts, PLUS

                  (ii) Up to the lesser of: (A) sixty five percent (65%) of the
                  Value of Eligible Inventory or (B) eighty percent (80%) of the
                  "Net Recovery Percentage" for Eligible Inventory, PLUS

                  (iii) Up to One Hundred Percent (100%)of the Pledged Cash,
                  LESS



                                       17
<PAGE>

                  (iv) any Availability Reserves;

                  PROVIDED THAT, except in Lender's discretion, the aggregate
                  amount of Revolving Loans at any time outstanding pursuant to
                  Section 3.1(a)(i)(ii)and (iii) hereof shall in no event exceed
                  Thirty Five Million dollars ($ 35,000,000).

        (b) Lender may, in its discretion, from time to time, upon not less than
five (5) days prior notice to Borrower, (i) reduce the lending formula with
respect to Eligible Accounts and Eligible Inventory to the extent that Lender
determines in good faith that: (A) the Dilution with respect to the Accounts for
any period has increased in any material respect or may be reasonably
anticipated to increase in any material respect above historical levels, or (B)
the general creditworthiness of account debtors has declined or (C) the amount
determined pursuant to section 3.1(b)(i)(A) hereof as of the close of any month
is greater than 5% or (ii) reduce the lending formula(s) with respect to
Eligible Inventory to the extent that Lender determines that: (A) the number of



                                       18
<PAGE>

days of the turnover of the Inventory for any period has changed in any material
respect or (B) the liquidation value of the Eligible Inventory, or any category
thereof, has decreased, or (C) the nature and quality of the Inventory has
deteriorated. In determining whether to reduce the lending formula(s), Lender
may consider events, conditions, contingencies or risks which are also
considered in determining Eligible Accounts, Eligible Inventory or in
establishing Availability Reserves. Lender anticipates that any reduction on
account of a determination by Lender under Section 2.1(b)(i)(C) hereof will be
at a rate which is not less than twice the percentage determined thereunder.

         (c) Except in Lender's discretion, the aggregate amount of the Loans
and the Letter of Credit Accommodations outstanding at any time shall not exceed
the Maximum Credit. In the event that the outstanding amount of any component of
the Loans, or the aggregate amount of the outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit
Accommodations exceed the amounts available under the lending formulas, the
sublimits for Letter of Credit Accommodations set forth in Section 3.2(d) or the
Maximum Credit, as applicable, such event shall not limit, waive or otherwise
affect any rights of Lender in that circumstance or on any future occasions and



                                       19
<PAGE>

Borrower shall, upon demand by Lender, which may be made at any time or from
time to time, immediately repay to Lender the entire amount of any such
excess(es) for which payment is demanded.

         (d) Lender may treat the then undrawn amounts of outstanding Letter of
Credit Accommodations for the purpose of purchasing Eligible Inventory as
Revolving Loans to the extent Lender is in effect basing the issuance of the
Letter of Credit Accommodations on the Value of the Eligible Inventory being
purchased with such Letter of Credit Accommodations. In determining the actual
amounts of such Letter of Credit Accommodations to be so treated for purposes of
the sublimit, the outstanding Revolving Loans and Availability Reserves shall be
attributed first to any components of the lending formulas in Section 3.1(a)
that are not subject to such sublimit, before being attributed to the components
of the lending formulas subject to such sublimit.

         3.2 LETTER OF CREDIT ACCOMMODATIONS.

         (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions contained herein, at
the request of Borrower, Lender agrees to provide or arrange for Letter of
Credit Accommodations for the account of Borrower containing terms and
conditions acceptable to Lender and the issuer thereof. Any payments made by


                                       20
<PAGE>

Lender to any issuer thereof and/or related parties in connection with the
Letter of Credit Accommodations shall constitute additional Revolving Loans to
Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.2.

         (b) In addition to any charges, fees or expenses charged by any bank or
issuer in connection with the Letter of Credit Accommodations Borrowers shall
pay to Lender a letter of credit fee at a rate equal to two point five percent
(2.5%) per annum on the daily outstanding balance of the Letter of Credit
Accommodations for the immediately preceding month (or part thereof), payable in
arrears as of the first day of each succeeding month, except that Borrower shall
pay to Lender such letter of credit fee, at Lender's option, without notice, at
a rate equal to four point five percent (4.5%) per annum on such daily
outstanding balance for: (i) the period from and after the date of termination
or non-renewal hereof until Lender has received full and final payment of all
Obligations (notwithstanding entry of a judgment against any Borrower) and (ii)
the period from and after the date of the occurrence of an Event of Default for



                                       21
<PAGE>

so long as such Event of Default is continuing as determined by Lender. Such
letter of credit fee shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty
(360) day year and actual days elapsed and the obligation of Borrowers to pay
such fee shall survive the termination or non-renewal of this Extension
Agreement.

         (c) No Letter of Credit Accommodations shall be available unless on the
date of the proposed issuance of any Letter of Credit Accommodations the
Revolving Loans available to Borrower (subject to the Maximum Credit and any
Availability Reserves) are equal to or greater than: (i) if the proposed Letter
of Credit Accommodation is for the purpose of purchasing Eligible Inventory, the
sum of (A) thirty five percent (35%) of the Value of such Eligible Inventory,
plus (B) freight, taxes, duty and other amounts which Lender estimates must be
paid in connection with such Inventory upon arrival and for delivery to one of
Borrower's locations for Eligible Inventory within the United States of America,
Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and (ii) if the proposed Letter of Credit
Accommodation is for any other purpose an amount equal to one hundred (100%)
percent of the face amount thereof and all other commitments and obligations
made or incurred by Lender with respect thereto. Effective on the issuance of
each Letter of Credit Accommodation an Availability Reserve shall be established
in the applicable amount set forth in Section 3.2(c)(i) or Section 3.2(c)(ii).


                                       22
<PAGE>

         (d) Except in Lender's discretion, the amount of all outstanding Letter
of Credit Accommodations and all other commitments and obligations made or
incurred by Lender in connection therewith shall not at any time exceed Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate, included within the overall
Revolving Loans. At any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is
continuing, upon Lender's request, Borrower will either furnish cash collateral
to secure the reimbursement obligations to the issuer in connection with any
Letter of Credit Accommodations or furnish cash collateral to Lender for the
Letter of Credit Accommodations and in either case, the Revolving Loans
otherwise available to Borrower shall not be reduced as provided in Section
3.2(d) to the extent of such cash collateral.

         (e) Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses which
Lender may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit
Accommodations and any documents, drafts or acceptances relating thereto,
including any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses due to

                                INTEREST AND FEES

         In lieu of the interest and fees provided for in the Credit Agreement
and the Consent Agreement Borrower shall pay to Lender interest and fees as
follows:

         4.1   INTEREST.

         (a) Borrower shall pay to Lender interest on the outstanding principal
amount of the non-contingent Obligations at the Interest Rate. Notwithstanding

accruing hereunder on and after the date of any Event of Default or termination
or non-renewal hereof shall be payable on demand.

         (b) Borrower may from time to time request that Prime Rate Loans be
converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans or that any existing Eurodollar Rate Loans
continue for an additional Interest Period. Such request from Borrower shall
specify the amount of the Prime Rate Loans which will constitute Eurodollar Rate
Loans (subject to the limits set forth below) and the Interest Period to be
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions


                                       28
<PAGE>


contained herein, three (3) Business Days after receipt by Lender of such
request from Borrower, such Prime Rate Loans shall be converted to Eurodollar

PROVIDED THAT, (i) no Event of Default, or event which with notice or passage of
time or both would constitute an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is
continuing, (ii) no party hereto shall have sent any notice of termination or
non-renewal of this Extension Agreement, (iii) Borrower shall have complied with

determined by Lender (but with no obligation of Lender to make such Revolving
Loans) and (vii) Lender shall have determined that the Interest Period or
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate is available to Lender through the Reference Bank and

                                       29
<PAGE>

Loan by Borrower. Any request by Borrower to convert Prime Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue any existing Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
irrevocable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lender
and Reference Bank shall not be required to purchase United States Dollar
deposits in the London interbank market or other applicable Eurodollar Rate
market to fund any Eurodollar Rate Loans, but the provisions hereof shall be
deemed to apply as if Lender and Reference Bank had purchased such deposits to
fund the Eurodollar Rate Loans.

         (c) Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall automatically convert to Prime Rate
Loans upon the last day of the applicable Interest Period, unless Lender has
received and approved a request to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loan at least
three (3) Business Days prior to such last day in accordance with the terms
hereof. Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall, at Lender's option, upon notice by
Lender to Borrower, convert to Prime Rate Loans in the event that (i) an Event

constitute an Event of Default, shall exist, (ii) this Extension Agreement shall
terminate or not be renewed, or (iii) the aggregate principal amount of the
Prime Rate Loans which have previously been converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans
or existing Eurodollar Rate Loans continued, as the case may be, at the

Exceed either (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans then outstanding,
or (B) the Revolving Loans then available to Borrower under Section 3.1 hereof.
Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon demand by Lender (or Lender may, at its
option, charge any loan account of Borrower) any amounts required to compensate
Lender, the Reference Bank or any participant with Lender for any loss
(including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by such
person, as a result of the conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Prime Rate
Loans pursuant to any of the foregoing.

         (d) Interest shall be payable by Borrower to Lender monthly in arrears
not later than the first day of each calendar month and shall be calculated on
the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. The
interest rate on non-contingent Obligations (other than Eurodollar Rate Loans)
shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to each increase or decrease in
the Prime Rate effective on the first day of the month after any change in such
Prime Rate is announced based on the Prime Rate in effect on the last day of the


                                       31
<PAGE>

month in which any such change occurs. In no event shall (i) charges
constituting interest payable by Borrower to Lender exceed the maximum amount or
the rate permitted under any applicable law or regulation and if any part of
this Extension Agreement is in contravention of any such law or regulation, such
part or provision shall be deemed amended to conform thereto and (ii) except as
may be required by the preceding subclause (i) the Interest Rate never be less
than six percent (6%) per annum.

in an amount equal to $5,000 in respect of Lender's services for each month (or
part thereof) while this Extension Agreement remains in effect and for so long
thereafter as any of the Obligations are outstanding, which fee shall be fully
earned as of and payable in advance on the date hereof and on the first day of
each month hereafter.

<PAGE>


         4.4 UNUSED LINE FEE. Borrower shall pay to Lender monthly, an unused
line fee at a rate equal to zero point five (0.5%) percent per annum calculated
upon the amount by which $30,000,000 exceeds the average daily principal balance
of the outstanding Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations during
the immediately preceding month (or part thereof), while this Extension
Agreement is in effect and for so long thereafter as any of the Obligations are
outstanding, which fee shall be payable on the first day of each month in
arrears.

         4.5 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. Borrower shall pay Lender fees for Letter of
Credit Accommodations as stated in Section 3.2(b) hereof.

         4.6 EARLY TERMINATION FEE.

         If for any reason (a) this Extension Agreement is terminated prior to
the end of then current term or any renewal term of this Extension Agreement, or
(b) Borrower and NSC fail to enter into the Definitive Loan Agreement or the
Definitive Loan Agreement fails to close (i) prior to the end of the current
term or any renewal term of this Extension Agreement or (ii) on or before

                                       33
<PAGE>

(as approved by Lender) is not consummated on or prior to September 30, 2003, in
view of the impracticality and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages
and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of
Lender's lost profits as a result thereof, Borrower agrees to pay to Lender, on
demand, an early termination fee in the amount set forth below if such
termination or failure is effective in the period indicated:

AMOUNT                                  PERIOD
------                                  ------

(a) $4,000,000                          From the Closing Date to and including
                                        the day which is 180 days thereafter,

(b) $2,400,000                          From the 181st day after the Closing
                                        Date to and including September 30,
                                        2003.



                                       34
<PAGE>


Such early termination fee shall be presumed to be the amount of damages
sustained by Lender as a result of such early termination and Borrower agrees
that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. In addition,
Lender shall be entitled to such early termination fee upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default described in Sections 11.1(g) 11.1(h) hereof, except if
(a)Lender does not exercise its right to terminate this Extension Agreement, (b)
Lender elects, at its option, to provide financing to Borrower or permit the use
of cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code and (c)such financing is approved
on terms acceptable to Lender; PROVIDED THAT, such termination fee shall remain
payable as otherwise provided herein. The early termination fee provided for in
this Section 4.6 shall be deemed included in the Obligations. Borrower waives
any claim for reduction of fees whether or not such fees are treated as a
penalty.

         4.7 CHANGES IN LAWS AND INCREASED COSTS OF LOANS.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall, upon notice by Lender to Borrower, convert to Prime
Rate Loans in the event that (i) any change in applicable law or regulation (or
the interpretation or administration thereof) shall either (A) make it unlawful
for Lender, the Reference Bank or any participant to make or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Loans or to comply with the terms hereof in connection with the Eurodollar



                                       35
<PAGE>

Rate Loans, or (B) shall result in the increase in the costs to Lender, the
Reference Bank or any participant of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate
Loans by an amount deemed by Lender to be material or (C) reduce the amounts
received or receivable by Lender in respect thereof, by an amount deemed by
Lender to be material or (ii) the cost to Lender, the Reference Bank or any
participant of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall otherwise
increase by an amount deemed by Lender to be material. Borrower shall pay to
Lender, upon demand by Lender (or Lender may, at its option, charge any loan
account of Borrower) any amounts required to compensate Lender, the Reference
Bank or any participant with Lender for any loss (including loss of anticipated
profits), cost or expense incurred by such person as a result of the foregoing,
including, without limitation, any such loss, cost or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or re- employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
person to make or maintain the Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof. A

                                       36
<PAGE>


certificate of Lender setting forth the basis for the determination of such
amount necessary to compensate Lender as aforesaid shall be delivered to
Borrower and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

         (b) If any payments or prepayments in respect of the Eurodollar Rate
Loans are received by Lender other than on the last day of the applicable
Interest Period (whether pursuant to acceleration, upon maturity or otherwise),
including any payments pursuant to the application of collections or any other
payments made with the proceeds of collateral, Borrower shall pay to Lender upon
demand by Lender (or Lender may, at its option, charge any loan account of
Borrower) any amounts required to compensate Lender, the Reference Bank or any
participant with Lender for any additional loss (including loss of anticipated
profits), cost or expense incurred by such person as a result of such prepayment
or payment, including without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired
by such person to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion
thereof.

         5.2 PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST. (a) Borrower irrevocably and
unconditionally authorizes Lender (or its agent) to file at any time and from
time to time such financing statements with respect to the Collateral naming
Lender or its designee as the secured party and Borrower as debtor, as Lender
may require, and including any other information with respect to Borrower or
otherwise required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of such
jurisdiction as Lender may determine, together with any amendments and
continuations with respect thereto, which authorization shall apply to all
financing statements filed on, prior to or after the date hereof. Borrower
hereby ratifies and approves all financing statements naming Lender or its
designee as secured party and Borrower as debtor with respect to the Collateral
(and any amendments with respect to such financing statements) filed by or on
behalf of Lender (or the Banks) prior to the date hereof and ratifies and
confirms the authorization of Lender (or the Banks) to file such financing

<PAGE>

on behalf of Borrower any symbol required for authenticating any electronic
filing. In the event that the description of the collateral in any financing
statement naming Lender or its designee as the secured party and Borrower as
debtor includes assets and properties of Borrower that do not at any time
constitute Collateral, whether hereunder, under any of the other Financing
Agreements, under any of the Security Documents or otherwise, the filing of such
financing statement shall nonetheless be deemed authorized by Borrower to the
extent of the Collateral included in such description and it shall not render
the financing statements ineffective as to any of the Collateral or otherwise
affect the financing statement as it applies to any of the Collateral. In no
event shall Borrower at any time file, or permit or cause to be filed, any
correction statement or termination statement with respect to any financing
statement (or amendment or continuation with respect thereto) naming the Banks
or Lender or its designee as secured party and Borrower as debtor.

         5.3 ADDITIONAL SECURITY COVENANTS. (a) Borrower does not have any
chattel paper (whether tangible or electronic) or instruments as of the date
hereof, except as set forth in Schedule 5.3(a) hereto. In the event that
Borrower shall be entitled to or shall receive any chattel paper or instrument
after the date hereof, Borrower shall promptly notify Lender thereof in writing.
Promptly upon the receipt thereof by or on behalf of any Borrower (including by
any agent or representative), Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered



                                       42
<PAGE>

to Lender, all tangible chattel paper and instruments that Borrower has or may
at any time acquire, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment
duly executed in blank as Lender may from time to time specify in each case
except as Lender may otherwise agree. At Lender's option, Borrower shall, and
Lender may at any time on behalf of Borrower, cause the original of any such
instrument or chattel paper to be conspicuously marked in a form and manner
acceptable to Lender with the following legend referring to chattel paper or
instruments as applicable: "This _______________________ ____________________ is
subject to the security interest of Westernbank Puerto Rico and any sale,
transfer, assignment or encumbrance of this _________________________
___________________ violates the rights of such secured party".

interest in any electronic chattel paper or any "transferable record" (as such
term is defined in Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global
and National Commerce Act or in Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction), Borrower shall
promptly notify Lender thereof in writing. Promptly upon Lenders request,
Borrower shall take, or cause to be taken, such actions as Lender may request to
give Lender control of such electronic chattel paper under Section 9-105 of the

except as set forth in Schedule 8.8 hereto. Borrower shall not, directly or
indirectly, after the date hereof open, establish or maintain any deposit
account unless each of the following conditions is satisfied: (i) Lender shall
have received not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice of
the intention of Borrower to open or establish such account which notice shall

the account, the owner of the account, the name and address of the bank at which
such account is to be opened or established, the individual at such bank with
whom such Lender is dealing and the purpose of the account and Lender shall have
consented thereto in writing in accordance with Section 15.11 hereof, (ii) the


                                       44

account on terms and conditions acceptable to lender. The terms of this
subsection 5.3(c) shall not apply to deposit accounts specifically and
exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes and other employee wage and benefit
payments to or for the benefit of Borrower's salaried employees.

         (d) Borrower does not own or hold, directly or indirectly, beneficially
or as record owner or both, any investment property, as of the date hereof, or
have any investment account, securities account, commodity account or other

except as set forth in Schedule 5.3(d) hereto. In the event that Borrower shall
be entitled to or shall at any time after the date hereof hold or acquire any
certificated securities, Borrower shall promptly endorse, assign and deliver the
same to Lender, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly
executed in blank as Lender may from time to time specify. If any securities now



                                       45
<PAGE>

owned or hereafter acquired by Borrower are uncertificated and are issued to
Borrower or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, Borrower shall
immediately notify lender thereof and shall as Lender may specify, either (i)
cause the issuer to agree to comply with instructions from Lender as to such
securities, without further consent of any of Borrower or such nominee, or (ii)

maintain any investment account, securities account, commodity account or any
other similar account (other than a deposit account) with any securities

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          COLLECTION AND ADMINISTRATION

         6.1 BORROWER'S LOAN ACCOUNT. Lender shall maintain one or more loan
account(s) on its books in which shall be recorded (a) all Loans, Letter of
Credit Accommodations and other Obligations and the Collateral, (b) all payments
made by or on behalf of Borrower and (c) all other appropriate debits and
credits as provided in this Agreement, including fees, charges, costs, expenses
and interest. All entries in the loan account(s) shall be made in accordance
with Lender's customary practices as in effect from time to time.

         6.2 STATEMENTS. Lender shall render to Borrower each month a statement
setting forth the balance in the Borrower's loan account(s) maintained by Lender
for Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, including principal,
interest, fees, costs and expenses. Each such statement shall be subject to
subsequent adjustment by Lender but shall, absent manifest errors or omissions,
be considered correct and deemed accepted by Borrowers and conclusively binding



                                       52
<PAGE>

upon Borrower as an account stated except to the extent that Lender receives a
written notice from Borrower of any specific exceptions of Borrower thereto
within thirty (30) days after the date such statement has been mailed by Lender.
Until such time as Lender shall have rendered to Borrower a written statement as
provided above, the balance in Borrower loan account(s) shall be presumptive
evidence of the amounts due and owing to Lender by Borrower.

         6.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS.

         (a) Borrowers shall establish and maintain, at its expense, blocked
accounts or lock boxes and related blocked accounts (in either case, "Blocked
Accounts"), as Lender may specify, with such banks as are acceptable to Lender
into which Borrowers shall promptly deposit and direct its account debtors to



                                       53
<PAGE>

directly remit all payments on Accounts and all payments constituting proceeds
of Inventory, Equipment or other Collateral in the identical form in which such
payments are made, whether by cash, check or other manner. The banks at which
the Blocked Accounts are established shall enter into an agreement, in form and
substance satisfactory to Lender, providing that all items received or deposited
in the Blocked Accounts are the property of Lender, that the depository bank has
no lien upon, or right to setoff against, the Blocked Accounts, the items
received for deposit therein, or the funds from time to time on deposit therein
and that the depository bank will wire, or otherwise transfer, in immediately
available funds, on a daily basis, all funds received or deposited into the
Blocked Accounts to such bank account of Lender as Lender may from time to time
designate for such purpose ("Payment Account"). Borrower agrees that all
payments made to such Blocked Accounts or other funds received and collected by
Lender, whether on the Accounts or as proceeds of Inventory, Equipment or other
Collateral or otherwise shall be the property of Lender.

         (b) For purposes of calculating the amount of the Loans available to
Borrower, such payments will be applied (conditional upon final collection) to
the Obligations on the business day of receipt by Lender of immediately
available funds in the Payment Account provided such payments and notice thereof
are received in accordance with Lender's usual and customary practices as in
effect from time to time and within sufficient time to credit Borrower's loan
account on such day, and if not, then on the next business day. For the purposes
of calculating interest on the Obligations, payments or other funds received



                                       54
<PAGE>

will be applied (conditional upon final collection) to the Obligations three (3)
business day(s) following the date of receipt of immediately available funds by
Lender in the Payment Account provided such payments or other funds and notice
thereof are received in accordance with Lender's usual and customary practices
as in effect from time to time and within sufficient time to credit Borrower's
loan account on such day, and if not, then on the next business day.

         (c) Borrower and all of its affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders,
directors, employees or agents shall, acting as trustee for Lender, receive, as
the property of Lender, any monies, checks, notes, drafts or any other payment
relating to and/or proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral which come into
their possession or under their control and immediately upon receipt thereof,
shall deposit or cause the same to be deposited in the Blocked Accounts, or
remit the same or cause the same to be remitted, in kind, to Lender. In no event
shall the same be commingled with Borrower's own funds. Borrower agrees to
reimburse Lender on demand for any amounts owed or paid to any bank at which a
Blocked Account is established or any other bank or person involved in the



                                       55
<PAGE>

transfer of funds to or from the Blocked Accounts arising out of Lender's
payments to or indemnification of such bank or person. The obligation of
Borrower to reimburse Lender for such amounts pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall
survive the termination or non-renewal of this Extension Agreement.

         (d) In addition to the account referred to in Section 6.3(a) hereof,
Borrower may establish and maintain, at its expense, deposit account
arrangements and merchant payment arrangements with the banks set forth on
Schedule 8.8 and after compliance with the provisions of Section 5.3(c) hereof,
such other banks as Borrower may hereafter select as are acceptable to Lender.
The banks set forth on Schedule 8.8 constitute all of the banks with whom
Borrower has deposit account arrangements and merchant payment arrangements as
of the date hereof and identifies each of the deposit accounts at such banks and
describes the nature of the use of such deposit account by Borrower. Borrower
shall deposit all proceeds from sales of Inventory in every form (including,
without limitation, cash, checks, credit card sales drafts, credit card sales or
charge slips or receipts and other forms of daily store receipts and the
collections and proceeds thereof in whatever form) from each store location of
Borrower and all proceeds of Collateral, on each business day into the deposit



                                       56
<PAGE>

accounts of Borrower used solely for such purpose and identified to each retail
store and location as set forth on Schedule 8.8. Borrower shall irrevocably
authorize and direct in writing, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender,
each of the banks into which proceeds from sales of Inventory from each store
location of Borrowers and any and all other proceeds of Collateral are at any
time deposited as provided above to send by wire transfer on a daily basis, to
an account or accounts designated by Lender, all funds deposited in such
account, and shall irrevocably authorize and direct in writing its account
debtors, Credit Card Issuers and Credit Card Processors to directly remit
payments on its Accounts, Credit Card Receivables and all other payments
constituting proceeds of Inventory and collections to the Blocked Accounts
described in Section 6.3(a) above.

         6.4 PAYMENTS. All Obligations shall be payable to the Payment Account
as provided in Section 6.3 or such other place as Lender may designate from time
to time. Lender may apply payments received or collected from Borrower or for
the account of Borrower (including the monetary proceeds of collections or of
realization upon any Collateral) to such of the Obligations, whether or not then
due, in such order and manner as Lender determines. At Lender's option, all


                                       57
<PAGE>

principal, interest, fees, costs, expenses and other charges provided for in
this Extension Agreement or the Credit Documents or the other Financing
Agreements may be charged directly to the loan account(s) of Borrower. Borrower
shall make all payments to Lender on the Obligations free and clear of, and
without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any setoff, counterclaim,
defense, duties, taxes, levies, imposts, fees, deductions, withholding,
restrictions or conditions of any kind. If after receipt of any payment of, or
proceeds of Collateral applied to the payment of, any of the Obligations, Lender
is required to surrender or return such payment or proceeds to any Person for
any reason, then the Obligations intended to be satisfied by such payment or
proceeds shall be reinstated and continue and this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by
Lender. Borrower shall be liable to pay to Lender, and does hereby indemnify and
hold Lender harmless for the amount of any payments or proceeds surrendered or
returned. This Section 6.4 shall remain effective notwithstanding any contrary
action which may be taken by Lender in reliance upon such payment or proceeds.
This Section 6.4 shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the
termination or non-renewal of this Extension Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower, NSC and Xtra hereby, jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Lender the following (which shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement), the truth and accuracy of which are a continuing condition
of the making of Loans and providing Letter of Credit Accommodations by Lender
to Borrower:

         8.1 CREDIT DOCUMENTS. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.1 hereto all
representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement or in any of
the other Credit Documents are true and correct as of the date hereof, except
when made as of a specified date and as to any such representation and
warranties same were true and correct as of the date specified.

         8.2 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. All financial
statements relating to the Borrower, NSC and any other Credit Party which have

accordance with GAAP and fairly present the financial condition and the results



                                       76
<PAGE>

of operation of Borrower and such Person as at the dates and for the periods set
forth therein. Except as disclosed in any interim financial statements furnished
by Borrower to Lender prior to the date of this Extension Agreement, there has
been no material adverse change in the assets, liabilities, properties and
condition, financial or otherwise, of Borrower, NSC or any other Credit Party,
since the date of the most recent audited financial statements furnished by

The Information Certificate correctly identifies any of such locations which are

priority liens and security interests in and upon the Collateral subject only to
those non material liens indicated on Part 1 of Schedule 8.4 hereto the
existence of which has previously been approved, in writing by Lender. Borrower
has good and marketable title to all of its properties and assets subject to no
liens, mortgages, pledges, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any
kind, except those granted the Banks and to Lender and such others as are
specifically listed on Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 8.4 hereto.

                                       78
<PAGE>

to Lender). All information in such tax returns, reports and declarations is
complete and accurate in all material respects. Borrower has paid or caused to
be paid all taxes due and payable or claimed due and payable in any assessment
received by it, except taxes the validity of which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and available to Borrower
and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside on its books.

Federal, State, Commonwealth, county, local, foreign and other taxes whether or
not yet due and payable and whether or not disputed.

         8.6 LITIGATION. Except as set forth on the Information Certificate,
there is no present investigation by any governmental agency pending, or to the
best of Borrower's knowledge threatened, against or affecting Borrower, its
assets or business and there is no action, suit, proceeding or claim by any
Person pending, or to the best of Borrower's knowledge threatened, against
Borrower or its assets or goodwill, or against or affecting any transactions

<PAGE>

prospects of Borrower or would impair the ability of Borrower to perform its
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Financing Agreements to which it
is a party or of Lender to enforce any Obligations or realize upon any
Collateral.

         8.7 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER AGREEMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAWS. Except in
respect of the Interest Payment Defaults, the Financial Covenant Defaults, the

bound and Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
provisions of laws, rules, regulations, licenses, permits, approvals and orders
of any foreign, Federal, State or local governmental authority.

Agreements or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, including all
information on the Information Certificate is true and correct in all material
respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified and does

warranties contained in this Extension Agreement or any of the other Financing
Agreements or any of the Credit Documents shall survive the execution and

standing under the laws of its state of incorporation, and Pueblo is a limited

state of organization and each is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or
limited liability company and in good standing in all states or other

adverse effect on a Borrower's or NSC's financial condition, results of
operation or business or the rights of Lender in or to any of the Collateral.

                                      108
<PAGE>

rights and remedies may be exercised without notice to or consent by Borrower or
any other Credit Party, except as such notice or consent is expressly provided
for hereunder or required by applicable law. All rights, remedies and powers
granted to Lender hereunder, under any of the other Financing Agreements, the
Credit Documents, the Consent Agreement, the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable law, are cumulative, not exclusive and enforceable, in Lender's
discretion, alternatively, successively, or concurrently on any one or more
occasions, and shall include, without limitation, the right to apply to a court
of equity for an injunction to restrain a breach or threatened breach by
Borrower or NSC of this Extension Agreement or any of the other Financing

<PAGE>

judicial process or the aid or assistance of others, enter upon any premises on
or in which any of the Collateral may be located and take possession of the
Collateral or complete processing, manufacturing and repair of all or any
portion of the Collateral, (iii) require Borrower, at Borrower expense, to
assemble and make available to Lender any part or all of the Collateral at any
place and time designated by Lender, (iv) collect, foreclose, receive,
appropriate, setoff and realize upon any and all Collateral, (v) remove any or
all of the Collateral from any premises on or in which the same may be located
for the purpose of effecting the sale, foreclosure or other disposition thereof
or for any other purpose, (vi) sell, lease, transfer, assign, deliver or
otherwise dispose of any and all Collateral (including entering into contracts
with respect thereto, public or private sales at any exchange, broker's board,
at any office of Lender or elsewhere) at such prices or terms as Lender may deem
reasonable, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, with the Lender having
the right to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral at any such public



                                      110
<PAGE>

sale, all of the foregoing being free from any right or equity of redemption of
Borrower, which right or equity of redemption is hereby expressly waived and
released by Borrower and all other Credit Parties and/or (vii) terminate this
Extension Agreement. If any of the Collateral is sold or leased by Lender upon
credit terms or for future delivery, the Obligations shall not be reduced as a
result thereof until payment therefor is finally collected by Lender. If notice
of disposition of Collateral is required by law, five (5) days prior notice by
Lender to Borrower designating the time and place of any public sale or the time
after which any private sale or other intended disposition of Collateral is to
be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable notice thereof and Borrower waive any
other notice. In the event Lender institutes an action to recover any Collateral
or seeks recovery of any Collateral by way of prejudgment remedy, Borrower
waives the posting of any bond which might otherwise be required.

         (c) Lender may apply the cash proceeds of Collateral actually received
by Lender from any sale, lease, foreclosure or other disposition of the
Collateral to payment of the Obligations, in whole or in part and in such order
as Lender may elect, whether or not then due. Borrower shall remain liable to
Lender for the payment of any deficiency with interest at the highest rate

                                      111

provided for herein and all costs and expenses of collection or enforcement,
including attorneys' fees and legal expenses.

         (d) Without limiting the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or an event which with notice or passage of time or both would
constitute an Event of Default, Lender may, at its option, without notice, (i)
cease making Loans or providing Letter of Credit Accommodations or reduce the
lending formulas or amounts of Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit
Accommodations available to Borrower and/or (ii) terminate any provision of this
Extension Agreement providing for any future Loans or Letter of Credit
Accommodations to be made or provided by Lender to Borrower.

following event shall be an additional "Event of Default":

         (i) Any condition precedent specified in Section 9.1 hereof, the

the rebuttable presumption that it acted in good faith and with the exercise of
ordinary care in the performance by it of the terms of this Agreement.

matters under this Section. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of
the Obligations and the termination or non-renewal of this Extension Agreement.

<PAGE>


Real Estate Security or (B) the release, spill or discharge, threatened or

         (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, whenever Lender
reasonably determines that there is non-compliance, or any condition which
requires any action by or on behalf of Borrower or NSC with respect to any Real
Estate Security, in order to avoid any material non-compliance, with any
Environmental Law, Borrower shall, at Lender's request and Borrower's expense:
(i) cause an independent environmental engineer acceptable to Lender to conduct
such tests of the site where Borrower's or NSC's non-compliance or alleged
non-compliance with such Environmental Laws has occurred as to such non-
compliance and prepare and deliver to Lender a report as to such non-compliance
setting forth the results of such tests, a proposed plan for responding to any



                                      188

indirectly arising out of or attributable to the use, generation, manufacture,

necessary repair, cleanup or other remedial work with respect to any property of
Borrower or NSC or any Real Estate Security given by any of them and the
preparation and implementation of any closure, remedial or other required plans.
All representations, warranties, covenants and indemnifications in this Section
15.27 shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination or
non-renewal of this Agreement.

         15.27 CHAPTER 11 PLAN. The principal economic terms of NSC's tentative
proposed Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Case is set forth on Exhibit C



                                      189
<PAGE>

hereto. NSC shall keep Lender appraised of the status of such Plan and advise
Lender of any changes, modifications or alterations thereto. The principal
economic terms of the primary plan with respect to the Senior Note Claims (as
defined therein) is acceptable to Lender; but the Alternative Plan (as defined
therein) is not acceptable to Lender. NSC shall not make any material change (as
determined solely by Lender) to such proposed Plan or submit any Plan of
Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Case not previously approved by Lender.
Lender's acceptance of such proposed Plan is conditioned on and subject to(a)
restructuring the security under the Credit Documents so that under the
Definitive Loan Agreement and Definitive Financing Agreements(i) the Liens and
security interests in the Collateral currently pledged to NSC are granted to
Lender directly by the owners of such Collateral rather than first to NSC and
then by NSC to Lender and (ii) NSC is granted a security interest therein,
junior, subject and fully subordinate to the Liens and security interests of
Lender therein; all in form and substance satisfactory to Lender and (b) the
Alternate Plan not becoming operative. Lender has not reviewed or approved NSC's
draft "Reorganization Plan of Nutritional Sourcing Corporation".

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lender and Borrowers and NSC have caused these
presents to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
