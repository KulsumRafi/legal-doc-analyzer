                    mandatory reductions in the amount of the Facility available
                    for drawing required pursuant to this Clause will be made in
                    the  amounts and at the times  specified  (subject to Clause
                    2.4.2) whether or not the Maximum Facility Amount is reduced
                    pursuant to Clause 2.4.3, Clause 6.6 or Clause 17.8.

          2.4.2     The Borrower  may  voluntarily  reduce the Maximum  Facility
                    Amount  in  whole  or in part in  multiples  of two  million
                    Dollars ($2,000,000),  where applicable provided that it has
                    first  given to the Agent not fewer than three (3)  Business
                    Days' prior written notice expiring on a Business Day of its
                    desire to  reduce  the  Maximum  Facility  Amount.  Any such
                    reduction  in  the  Maximum  Facility  Amount  shall  not be
                    reversed.  Any voluntary  reduction in the Maximum  Facility
                    Amount  pursuant  to this  Clause  shall be  applied  to the
                    remaining  mandatory  reductions under Clause 2.4.1 on a pro
                    rata basis.

          2.4.3     In the event of a sale or disposal  of a Vessel  (subject to
                    the  penultimate  sentence  contained in Clause 12.2.21) the
                    Maximum  Facility  Amount shall reduce by an amount equal to
                    the  proportion  that a current  Valuation  for such  Vessel
                    bears  to  the   aggregate   total  amount  of  the  current
                    Valuations  for the remaining  Vessel and the Vessel sold or
                    disposed of pursuant to this Clause.

          2.4.4     To the extent that  repayments  or  prepayments  made by the
                    Borrower  to the Agent in  accordance  with  this  Agreement
                    reduce the  Facility  Outstandings  to less than the Maximum
                    Facility  Amount,  the  Borrower  shall again be entitled to
                    make Drawings in accordance with and subject to the terms of

          2.4.5     Simultaneously  with each reduction of the Maximum  Facility
                    Amount in  accordance  with Clause  2.4.1,  Clause  2.4.2 or
                    Clause  2.4.3 (as the case may be), the  Commitment  of each
                    Bank  will  reduce so that the  Commitments  of the Banks in
                    respect of the reduced  Maximum  Facility  Amount  remain in
                    accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares.

     2.5  Restrictions on Drawings   The  Borrower shall not be entitled to make
          more than three Drawings on any Business Day and no more than ten (10)
          Drawings  may be  outstanding  at any one  time  during  the  Facility
          Period.  Each  Drawing  shall be of an  amount  of not less  than five
          million  Dollars  ($5,000,000)  or the Equivalent  Amount in any other
          Permitted  Currency.  If at any time  during the  Facility  Period the
          Original  Dollar  Amount  exceeds  the  Maximum  Facility  Amount then
          available or if a proposed  Drawing when added to the Original  Dollar
          Amount would result in the Maximum Facility Amount being exceeded then
          the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent on behalf of the Banks
          such amount as will ensure that the Original Dollar Amount is equal to
          or less than the Maximum Facility Amount then available.

     2.6  Termination   Date  No Bank shall be under any  obligation  to advance
          all or any part of its Commitment after the Termination Date.

     2.7  Several   obligations   The   obligations  of  the  Banks  under  this
          Agreement  are  several.   The  failure  of  a  Bank  to  perform  its
          obligations  under this Agreement  shall not affect the obligations of
          the  Borrower  to any  Finance  Party nor shall any  Finance  Party be
          liable  for  the  failure  of  another  Bank  to  perform  any  of its
          obligations under or in connection with this Agreement.

     2.8  Application of Facility   Without  prejudice to the obligations of the
          Borrower  under this  Agreement,  no Finance Party shall be obliged to
          concern itself with the application of the Facility by the Borrower.

     2.9  Loan facility and control  accounts   The Agent will open and maintain
          such loan facility account or such other control accounts as the Agent
          shall in its discretion  consider necessary or desirable in connection
          with the Facility.

     2.10 Additional   Restriction  on   Drawings   It  is  hereby  agreed  that
          notwithstanding  the provisions of this Clause 2 that the Borrower may
          not borrow more than

                                       20

          shall be available  to the  Borrower for drawing  subject to the terms
          and conditions contained in this Agreement.

          Borrower  shall be contained in the  Drawdown  Notice  relating to the
          Drawing in question. Once a Permitted Currency in respect of a Drawing
          is selected such Drawing shall remain  denominated  in such  Permitted

<PAGE>

          available to any of the Banks in the normal  course of business in the
          London Interbank market on the relevant date, or if the Borrower fails
          to specify a Permitted  Currency for a Drawing,  that Drawing shall be
          denominated  in Dollars  for the  duration  of the  relevant  Interest
          Period.

     5.4  Repayment   During  each  Interest   Period  in  which  a  Drawing  is
          denominated in a Permitted Currency other than Dollars, the obligation
          of the Borrower to repay the Drawing and to pay  interest  shall be an
          obligation  to repay that  Drawing and to pay interest on that Drawing
          in the  Permitted  Currency in which the Drawing is then  denominated,
          whether or not the Facility  Outstandings  or any part  thereof  shall
          have become repayable by acceleration or otherwise.

     5.5  Further assurance  The Borrower shall execute or procure the execution
          of such  further  documents as the Agent may  reasonably  require from

          Security   Documents  as  full  security  for  the  repayment  of  the
          Indebtedness.

     5.6  Currency  Fluctuations  If on the last day of an  Interest  Period the
          Agent shall determine that the Equivalent  Amount of any Drawing after
          repayment  is greater  than 100% of the Original  Dollar  Amount,  the
          Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent, on behalf of the Banks an
          amount in the relevant  Permitted Currency equal to the excess of such
          Equivalent Amount over the Original Dollar Amount.

6    Repayment and Prepayment

     6.1  Repayment Each Drawing shall be repaid by the Borrower to the Agent on
          behalf of the Banks on the last day of its Interest  Period unless the
          Borrower  selects  a  further  Interest  Period  for that  Drawing  in
          accordance  with Clause 7,  provided  that the  Borrower  shall not be
          permitted  to  select  such  further  Interest  Period  if an Event of
          Default or  Potential  Event of Default has occurred and shall then be
          obliged  to repay  such  Drawing  on the last day of its then  current
          Interest  Period.  In addition,  the Borrower  shall from time to time
          repay to the Agent as agent for the Banks such amounts of the Facility
          Outstandings  as will ensure that the Original  Dollar Amount does not
          exceed the Maximum Facility Amount then available.  The Borrower shall
          on the Termination  Date repay to the Agent as agent for the Banks all
          Facility Outstandings.

                                       31
<PAGE>

     6.2  Prepayment  The Borrower may prepay the Facility Outstandings in whole
          or in part in multiples of two million  Dollars  ($2,000,000),  or its
          Equivalent  Amount in a Permitted  Currency where  applicable,  (or as
          otherwise may be agreed by the Agent) provided that it has first given
          to the Agent not fewer  than five (5)  Business  Days'  prior  written
          notice  expiring  on a  Business  Day of its  intention  to do so. Any
          notice pursuant to this Clause 6.2 once given shall be irrevocable and
          shall  oblige the Borrower to make the  prepayment  referred to in the
          notice on the Business Day specified in the notice,  together with all
          interest  accrued  on the  amount  prepaid  up to and  including  that
          Business Day.

     6.3  Prepayment indemnity  If the Borrower shall,  subject always to Clause
          6.2, make a prepayment on a Business Day other than the last day of an
          Interest Period,  it shall pay to the Agent on behalf of the Banks any
          amount which is necessary to compensate  the Banks for any Break Costs
          incurred  by  the  Agent  or  any  of the  Banks  as a  result  of the
          prepayment in question.

     6.4  Application of  prepayments  Any prepayment in an amount less than the
          Indebtedness  shall be applied in  satisfaction  or reduction first of
          any costs and other  expenses  outstanding;  secondly of all  interest
          accrued  with respect to the  outstanding  Drawings in the currency in
          which  the  prepayment  is to be  made;  thirdly  of  the  outstanding
          Drawings  in the  currency  in which the  prepayment  is to be made in
          inverse order of maturity, fourthly of all other interest accrued; and
          fifthly  of  all  other  outstanding  Drawings  in  inverse  order  of
          maturity.

     6.5  Reborrowing  of  prepayments  Any  amount  prepaid  pursuant  to  this
          Agreement  may be  reborrowed  in  accordance  with  Clause  2.4.4 and
          subject to compliance with Clause 12.2.2.

     6.6  Total Loss  In the event that either Vessel  becomes a Total Loss,  on
          the date of such Total Loss  occurring,  the Maximum  Facility  Amount
          shall reduce by the Pro Rata Insurance  Proceeds  Amount in respect of
          such Vessel.  Any such reductions in the Maximum Facility Amount shall
          not be  reversed.  If, as a result  of any  reduction  in the  Maximum
          Facility  Amount  pursuant to this Clause the Original  Dollar  Amount
          exceeds  the Maximum  Facility  Amount,  the  Borrower  shall,  on the
          earlier to occur of (a) the one  hundred and  eightieth  day after the
          date of such  Total  Loss  occurring  and (b) the  date on  which  the
          Shipowning  Guarantor receives the proceeds of such Total Loss, prepay
          such  amount of the  Original

                                       32
<PAGE>

          Dollar  Amount as will ensure that the Original  Dollar  Amount is not
          greater than the Maximum  Facility  Amount.  Any such prepayment shall
          not be reborrowed, and Clause 6.3 shall apply to any such prepayment.

          outstanding   pursuant  to  this  Agreement   shall  be  divided  into

          Mandatory Cost for the remainder of the Facility Period, determined in
          each case, at or about 11.00 a.m. on the second  Business Day prior to
          the beginning of the Interest Period relating to that Drawing.

     7.4  Accrual and payment of interest  During the Facility  Period, interest
          shall accrue from day to day,  shall be  calculated  on the basis of a
          360 day  year  and the  actual  number  of days  elapsed  (or,  in any
          circumstance  where market  practice  differs,  in accordance with the
          prevailing  market  practice) and shall be paid by the Borrower to the
          Agent on behalf of the Banks on the last day of each  Interest  Period
          and  additionally,  during any Interest Period exceeding three months,

<PAGE>

          last day of each successive  three month period after the beginning of
          that Interest Period.

     7.5  Ending of Interest Periods  If any Interest  Period would end on a day
          which is not a Business  Day,  that  Interest  Period shall end on the
          next succeeding  Business Day (unless the next succeeding Business Day
          falls in the next calendar  month,  in which event the Interest Period
          in question shall end on the next preceding Business Day).

     7.6  Default Rate  If an Event of  Default  shall  occur,  the whole of the
          Indebtedness  shall,  from the date of the  occurrence of the Event of
          Default,  bear interest up to the date of actual  payment (both before
          and after judgment) at the Default Rate,  compounded at such intervals
          as the  Agent  shall in its  reasonable  discretion  determine,  which
          interest  shall be payable  from time to time by the  Borrower  to the
          Agent on behalf of the Banks on demand.

     7.7  Determinations conclusive  Each determination of an interest rate made
          by the Agent in  accordance  with  Clause 7 shall (save in the case of
          manifest error or on any question of law) be final and conclusive.

          of or amalgamation by any Finance Party in or with any other entity or
          the acquisition of all or any part of the assets or undertaking of any

     8.3  Preservation of Guarantor's Liability

          8.3.1     The Banks may  without the  Guarantor's  consent and without
                    notice to the  Guarantor and without in any way releasing or
                    reducing the Guarantor's Liabilities:-

                    (a)  amend, novate,  supplement or replace all or any of the
                         Borrower's Security Documents;

                    (b)  increase  or reduce the amount of the  Facility or vary
                         the  terms  and   conditions   for  its   repayment  or

                         and/or method of calculation of interest payable on the
                         Facility);

                    (c)  allow to the  Borrower or to any other  person any time

                         now or in the future hold from the Borrower or from any
                         other person;

                    (e)  compound with the Borrower or any other person;

                    (f)  enter  into,   renew,   vary  or  terminate  any  other

                         neglect  to do  anything  which  might,  but  for  this
                         provision,  operate to release or reduce the  liability
                         of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

          8.3.2     The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not
                    be affected by:-

                    (a)  the absence of or any defective, excessive or irregular
                         exercise of any of the powers of the Borrower or of any

                    (b)  any  security  given  or  payment  made to the  Finance
                         Parties  or any of them by the  Borrower  or any  other
                         person being  avoided or reduced under any law (whether
                         English  or   foreign)   relating  to   bankruptcy   or
                         insolvency or analogous circumstance in force from time
                         to time;

                    (c)  the   liquidation,   administration,   receivership  or

                    (d)  any other  security,  guarantee or indemnity  now or in
                         the future held by the  Finance  Parties or any of them
                         being defective, void or unenforceable,  or the failure
                         of  the  any  Finance   Party  to  take  any  security,
                         guarantee or indemnity;

                    (e)  any compromise or arrangement  under Part I or Part VII

                         Companies  Act 1985 (or any statutory  modification  or
                         re-enactment  of either  of them for the time  being in
                         force) or under any analogous  provision of any foreign
                         law;

                    (f)  the novation of any of the Borrower's Obligations;

                    (g)  anything  which would not have  released or reduced the
                         liability of the  Guarantor to the Finance  Parties had
                         the liability of the Guarantor  under Clause 8.1.1 been
                         as a principal debtor of the Finance Parties and not as
                         a guarantor.

     8.4  Preservation of Banks' Rights

          8.4.1     The  Guarantee  is  in  addition  to  any  other   security,
                    guarantee  or  indemnity  now or in the  future  held by the
                    Finance  Parties in respect of the  Borrower's  Obligations,
                    whether  from  the  Borrower,  the  Guarantor  or any  other
                    person, and shall not merge with, prejudice or be prejudiced
                    by  any  such  security,   guarantee  or  indemnity  or  any
                    contractual or legal right of each Finance Party.

          8.4.2     Any release,  settlement,  discharge or arrangement relating
                    to the  liabilities  of the  Guarantor  under the  Guarantee
                    shall be  conditional  on no payment,  assurance or security
                    received by the Finance Parties in respect of the Borrower's
                    Obligations  being avoided or reduced under any law (whether
                    English or foreign)  in force from time to time  relating to
                    bankruptcy,  insolvency or any (in the opinion of the Agent)
                    analogous  circumstance  and  after  any such  avoidance  or
                    reduction the Finance  Parties shall be entitled to exercise
                    all of their rights, powers,  discretions and remedies under
                    or  pursuant  to the  Guarantee  and/or  any  other  rights,
                    powers,  discretions or remedies which they would  otherwise
                    have  been   entitled  to   exercise,   as  if  no  release,
                    settlement, discharge or arrangement had taken place.

          8.4.3     Following the discharge of the Borrower's  Obligations,  the
                    Finance  Parties  shall be entitled  to retain any  security
                    which  they may hold for the  liabilities  of the  Guarantor
                    under the Guarantee  until the Finance Parties are satisfied
                    in their  reasonable  discretion  that they will not have to
                    make any payment under any law referred to in Clause 8.4.2.

          8.4.4     Until all  claims of the  Finance  Parties in respect of the
                    Borrower's  Obligations  have been  discharged in full:-

                    (a)  the Guarantor  shall not be entitled to  participate in
                         any security held or sums received by any Finance Party
                         in  respect  of  all  or any  part  of  the  Borrower's
                         Obligations;

                    (b)  the  Guarantor  shall  not stand in the place of, or be
                         subrogated  for, any of the Finance  Parties in respect
                         of any  security nor take any

                         step to enforce any claim  against the  Borrower or any
                         Surety (or the  estate or  effects of any such  person)
                         nor  claim  or  exercise   any  right  of  set  off  or
                         counterclaim  against  the  Borrower  or any Surety nor
                         make any claim in the  bankruptcy or liquidation of the
                         Borrower  or any  Surety in respect of any sums paid by
                         the Guarantor to the Finance  Parties or any of them or
                         in respect of any sum which  includes  the  proceeds of
                         realisation  of any  security  at any time  held by the
                         Finance Parties or any of them in respect of all or any
                         part of the Guarantor's Liabilities; and

                    (c)  the  Guarantor  shall not take any steps to enforce any
                         claim  which it may have  against  the  Borrower or any
                         Security Party without the prior written consent of the
                         Agent,  and then only on such terms and subject to such
                         conditions as the Agent may impose.

          8.4.5     The  Guarantor's  Liabilities  shall be  continuing  for all
                    purposes  (including  Interest) and every sum of money which
                    may now or in the  future be or  become  due or owing to the
                    Finance Parties by the Borrower under the Security Documents
                    to which the Borrower is a party (or which would have become
                    due or owing had it not been for the bankruptcy, liquidation
                    or insolvency  of the Borrower)  shall be deemed to continue
                    due and owing to the Finance  Parties by the Borrower  until
                    such  sum  is  actually  repaid  to  the  Finance   Parties,
                    notwithstanding the bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency of
                    the Borrower.

          8.4.6     The Finance Parties may, but shall not be obliged to, resort
                    for their own  benefit to any other  means of payment at any
                    time and in any order they think fit  without  releasing  or
                    reducing the Guarantor's Liabilities.

          8.4.7     The Finance Parties may enforce the Guarantee  either before
                    or  after  resorting  to  any  other  means  of  payment  or
                    enforcement and, in the latter case,  without  entitling the
                    Guarantor  to any  benefit  from or share in any such  other
                    means of payment for so long as the  Borrower's  Obligations
                    have not been discharged in full.

     8.5  Other Security

          The Guarantor confirms that it has not taken and will not take without
          the prior  written  consent  of the Agent (and then only on such terms
          and subject to such  conditions  as the Agent may impose) any security
          from the Borrower or from any Surety in connection  with the Guarantee
          and any  security  taken  by the  Guarantor  in  connection  with  the
          Guarantee  notwithstanding  this Clause shall be held by the Guarantor
          in trust for the Agent on behalf of the Finance Parties  absolutely as
          a continuing security for the Guarantor's Liabilities.

9    Fees

     9.1  The  Borrower  shall  pay to or to the  order of the  Agent  the fees,
          commissions  and  other  sums  referred  to in the Fee  Letter  in the

     9.2  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent  Commitment  Commission in Dollars
          at the  rate  equal to forty  five  per cent  (45%) of the  applicable
          Margin  per  annum  on any  undrawn  part of the  Facility  after  the
          Execution Date. The Commitment  Commission will accrue from day to day
          on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual  number of days  elapsed
          and shall be paid  quarterly in arrears from the Execution  Date until
          the Termination  Date based upon the Margin in effect for the previous
          quarter with the first such payment  being due and payable on the date
          falling three months after the Execution  Date.  Where any  Commitment
          Commission  is due and  payable  prior to the first  Advance  Date the
          applicable  Margin  shall be the Margin that would have applied to the
          Facility if all or any part of the  Facility had been  advanced  under
          this Agreement.

10   Security Documents

     As security for the  repayment  of the  Indebtedness,  the  Borrower  shall

          purpose of administering  the Facility and the Security  Documents and
          authorises the Agent and its directors, officers, employees and agents
          acting on the instructions from time to time of an Instructing  Group,
          and  subject  to  Clauses  11.4 and 11.19,  to  execute  the  Security
          Documents  on  its  behalf  and  to  exercise   all  rights,   powers,

          those  expressly  conferred on it by the Security  Documents and shall
          not be obliged to act on any  instructions  if to do so would,  in the
          opinion of the Agent,  be contrary to any  provision  of the  Security
          Documents  or to any law,  or would  expose the Agent to any actual or
          potential liability to any third party.

     11.3 Trust  The  Agent  agrees  and   declares,   and  each  of  the  Banks
          acknowledges,  that,  subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of this

                    against all  liabilities,  costs,  fees,  damages,  charges,
                    losses and  expenses  sustained  or incurred by it or him in
                    relation  to the  taking  or  holding  of  any of the  Trust
                    Property or in  connection  with the  exercise or  purported
                    exercise  of the  rights,  trusts,  powers  and  discretions
                    vested in the Agent or any other such  person by or pursuant
                    to the  Security  Documents  or in respect of anything  else
                    done  or  omitted  to be done  in any  way  relating  to the
                    Security Documents; and

          11.3.2    the  Banks  acknowledge  that  the  Agent  shall be under no
                    obligation  to insure any  property nor to require any other
                    person to insure any property  and shall not be  responsible
                    for any loss which may be suffered by any person as a result
                    of the lack or insufficiency of any insurance; and

          11.3.3    the Agent and the Banks  agree  that the  perpetuity  period
                    applicable to the trusts declared by this Agreement shall be

                    of the Agent to induce it to enter into any of the  Security
                    Documents;

          11.6.2    it has made and will  continue to make  without  reliance on
                    the Agent, and based on such documents and other evidence as

                    relating  to  any  of  the  Security   Parties  unless  that
                    information is received by the Agent pursuant to the express
                    terms of the Security Documents.

          the matters referred to in this Clause.

                    Security Documents;

          11.7.2    the financial condition of any of the Security Parties;

          11.7.3    the    completeness   or   accuracy   of   any   statements,
                    representations  or warranties made in or pursuant to any of
                    the  Security  Documents,  or in or pursuant to any document
                    delivered  pursuant  to or in  connection  with  any  of the

                    document executed or delivered  pursuant to or in connection

          11.8.1    assume that all representations or warranties made or deemed
                    repeated  by any of the  Security  Parties in or pursuant to
                    any of the Security Documents are true and complete, unless,
                    in  its  capacity  as the  Agent,  it  has  acquired  actual
                    knowledge to the contrary; and

          11.8.2    assume  that no  Event  of  Default  or  Potential  Event of
                    Default has occurred  unless,  in its capacity as the Agent,
                    it has acquired actual knowledge to the contrary; and

                                       42
<PAGE>

          11.8.3    rely on any document or  Communication  believed by it to be
                    genuine; and

          11.8.4    rely as to legal or other  professional  matters on opinions

                    selected or approved by it; and

          11.8.5    rely as to any factual  matters  which might  reasonably  be

                    Parties  on a  certificate  signed  by or on  behalf of that
                    Security Party; and

          11.8.6    refrain from  exercising  any right,  power,  discretion  or
                    remedy  unless and until  instructed to exercise that right,
                    power,  discretion  or  remedy  and as to the  manner of its
                    exercise  by  the  Banks  (or,  where   applicable,   by  an
                    Instructing  Group)  and  unless  and  until  the  Agent has
                    received  from the  Banks  any  payment  which the Agent may
                    require on account of, or any  security  which the Agent may
                    require for, any costs,  claims,  expenses  (including legal
                    and  other  professional  fees)  and  liabilities  which  it
                    considers  it may incur or sustain in  complying  with those
                    instructions.

     11.9 The Agent's duties The Agent shall:-

          11.9.1    if requested in writing to do so by a Bank, make enquiry and
                    advise the Banks as to the  performance or observance of any
                    of the  provisions  of the Security  Documents by any of the
                    Security  Parties  or as to the  existence  of an  Event  of
                    Default; and

          11.9.2    inform the Banks  promptly  of any Event of Default of which
                    the Agent has actual knowledge; and

          11.9.3    inform  the Banks  promptly  of any  disclosures  in writing
                    received by the Agent pursuant to Clause 4.7.

    11.10 No  deemed  knowledge  The Agent  shall  not be deemed to have  actual
          knowledge of the falsehood or incompleteness of any  representation or
          warranty  made or deemed  repeated by any of the  Security  Parties or
          actual  knowledge  of  the

                                       43
<PAGE>

          occurrence  of any Event of  Default  or  Potential  Event of  Default
          unless a Bank or any of the Security  Parties shall have given written
          notice thereof to the Agent.

    11.11 Other business The Agent may,  without any liability to account to the
          Banks,  generally engage in any kind of banking or trust business with
          any of the Security Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
          associated companies or with a Bank as if it were not the Agent.

    11.12 Indemnity The Banks shall, promptly on the Agent's request,  reimburse
          the Agent in their respective  Proportionate Shares, for, and keep the
          Agent fully indemnified in respect of:-

          11.12.1   all amounts payable by the Borrower to the Agent pursuant to
                    Clause 19 to the extent  that those  amounts are not paid by
                    the Borrower;

          11.12.2   all  liabilities,  damages,  costs and claims  sustained  or
                    incurred  by the  Agent  in  connection  with  the  Security
                    Documents, or the performance of its duties and obligations,
                    or  the  exercise  of its  rights,  powers,  discretions  or
                    remedies under or pursuant to any of the Security Documents;
                    or in  connection  with any  action  taken or omitted by the
                    Agent under or pursuant  to any of the  Security  Documents,
                    unless  in any case  those  liabilities,  damages,  costs or
                    claims arise solely from the Agent's  wilful  misconduct  or
                    gross negligence.

    11.13 Employment  of agents In  performing  its  duties and  exercising  its
          rights,  powers,  discretions  and  remedies  under or pursuant to the
          Security  Documents,  the Agent  shall be  entitled  to employ and pay
          agents to do  anything  which the  Agent is  empowered  to do under or
          pursuant to the Security Documents (including the receipt of money and
          documents  and the payment of money) and to act or refrain from taking
          action in  reliance  on the  opinion  of,  or  advice  or  information
          obtained from, any lawyer, banker, broker,  accountant,  valuer or any
          other  person  believed by the Agent in good faith to be  competent to
          give such opinion, advice or information.

    11.14 Distribution  of payments The Agent shall pay promptly to the order of
          each of the  Banks  that  Bank's  Proportionate  Share of every sum of
          money received by the Agent pursuant to the Security  Documents or the
          Mortgagees'  Insurances  (with

                                       44
<PAGE>


          the exception of any amounts payable pursuant to Clause 9.1 and/or the
          Fee  Letter  and any  amounts  which,  by the  terms  of the  Security
          Documents, are paid to the Agent for the account of the Agent alone or
          specifically  for the  account of one or more Banks) and until so paid
          such amount  shall be held by the Agent on trust  absolutely  for that
          Bank.

    11.15 Reimbursement  The Agent shall have no  liability  to pay any sum to a
          Bank until it has itself  received  payment of that sum. If,  however,
          the  Agent  does  pay  any  sum to a Bank  on  account  of any  amount
          prospectively  due to it pursuant to Clause 11.14 before it has itself
          received  payment  of that  amount,  and the  Agent  does  not in fact
          receive payment within five Business Days after the date on which that
          payment was required to be made by the terms of the Security Documents
          or the  Mortgagees'  Insurances,  the recipient will, on demand by the
          Agent,  refund to the Agent an amount equal to the amount  received by
          it, together with an amount  sufficient to reimburse the Agent for any
          amount which the Agent may certify that it has been required to pay by
          way of  interest  on money  borrowed  to fund the  amount in  question
          during  the  period  beginning  on the date on which  that  amount was
          required  to be paid by the  terms of the  Security  Documents  or the
          Mortgagees'  Insurances  and  ending  on the date on which  the  Agent
          receives reimbursement.

    11.16 Redistribution of payments Unless otherwise agreed between the Finance
          Parties, if at any time a Bank receives or recovers by way of set-off,
          the exercise of any lien or otherwise (other than from any assignee or
          transferee of or sub-participant in that Bank's Commitment), an amount
          greater than that Bank's  Proportionate  Share of any sum due from any
          of the Security  Parties under the Security  Documents  (the amount of
          the excess  being  referred to in this Clause as the "Excess  Amount")
          then:-

          11.16.1   that Bank  shall  promptly  notify  the Agent  (which  shall
                    promptly notify each other Bank);

          11.16.2   that Bank  shall  pay to the  Agent an  amount  equal to the
                    Excess  Amount within ten days of its receipt or recovery of
                    the Excess Amount; and

          11.16.3   the Agent shall  treat that  payment as if it were a payment
                    by the Security Party in question on account of the sum owed
                    to the Banks as

                                       45
<PAGE>

                    aforesaid  and shall  account to the Banks in respect of the
                    Excess  Amount in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this
                    Clause.

          However, if a Bank has commenced any Proceedings to recover sums owing
          to it  under  the  Security  Documents  and,  as a  result  of,  or in
          connection with, those Proceedings has received an Excess Amount,  the
          Agent shall not distribute any of that Excess Amount to any other Bank
          which had been notified of the Proceedings and had the legal right to,
          but did  not,  join  those  Proceedings  or  commence  and  diligently
          prosecute  separate  Proceedings  to enforce its rights in the same or
          another court.

    11.17 Rescission of Excess Amount If all or any part of any Excess Amount is
          rescinded or must otherwise be restored to any of the Security Parties
          or to any other third party, the Banks which have received any part of
          that Excess Amount by way of  distribution  from the Agent pursuant to
          this Clause shall repay to the Agent for the account of the Bank which
          originally  received or recovered the Excess Amount,  the amount which
          shall  be  necessary  to  ensure  that the  Banks  share  rateably  in
          accordance  with  their  Proportionate  Shares  in the  amount  of the
          receipt or payment retained,  together with interest on that amount at
          a rate  equivalent  to that (if any)  paid by the  Bank  receiving  or
          recovering the Excess Amount to the person to whom that Bank is liable
          to make payment in respect of such amount,  and Clause  11.16.3  shall
          apply only to the retained amount.

    11.18 Proceedings  Each of the Finance  Parties  shall notify one another of
          the proposed commencement of any Proceedings under any of the Security
          Documents  prior to their  commencement.  No such  Proceedings  may be
          commenced without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group.

    11.19 Instructions  Where  the Agent is  authorised  or  directed  to act or
          refrain from acting in accordance  with the  instructions of the Banks
          or of an  Instructing  Group each of the Banks shall provide the Agent
          with  instructions  within five Business  Days of the Agent's  request
          (which  request may be made orally or in writing).  If a Bank does not
          provide the Agent with instructions  within that period, (i) that Bank
          shall be bound by the decision of the Agent, (ii) that Bank shall have
          no vote  for the  purposes  of this  Clause  and  (iii)  the  combined
          Proportionate Shares of the other Banks who provided such instructions
          shall be deemed to contribute 100%. Nothing in this Clause shall limit
          the right of the Agent to take,  or refrain

                                       46
<PAGE>

          from taking,  any action  without  obtaining the  instructions  of the
          Banks  if the  Agent  in its  discretion  considers  it  necessary  or
          appropriate  to take, or refrain from taking,  such action in order to
          preserve  the  rights of the  Banks  under or in  connection  with the
          Security Documents.  In that event, the Agent will notify the Banks of
          the  action  taken by it as soon as  reasonably  practicable,  and the
          Banks agree to ratify any action  taken by the Agent  pursuant to this
          Clause.

    11.20 Communications  Any  Communication  under this Clause  shall be given,
          delivered,  made or served,  in the case of the Agent (in its capacity
          as Agent or as one of the Banks),  and in the case of the other Banks,
          at the  address  indicated  in Schedule 1 or such other  addresses  as
          shall be duly notified in writing to the Agent on behalf of the Banks.

    11.21 Payments All amounts payable to a Bank under this Clause shall be paid
          to such account at such bank as that Bank may from time to time direct
          in writing to the Agent.

    11.22 Retirement  Subject to a successor  being appointed in accordance with
          this Clause,  the Agent may retire as agent and/or security trustee at
          any time  without  assigning  any reason by giving to the Borrower and
          the other Finance  Parties  notice of its intention to do so, in which
          event the following shall apply:-

          11.22.1   with the  consent of the  Borrower,  not to be  unreasonably
                    withheld,  the other Finance  Parties may within thirty days
                    after the date of the Agent's  notice appoint a successor to
                    act as agent and/or security  trustee or, if they fail to do
                    so with the consent of the Borrower,  not to be unreasonably
                    withheld,  the Agent may appoint any other bank or financial
                    institution as its successor;

          11.22.2   the   resignation   of   the   Agent   shall   take   effect
                    simultaneously  with the  appointment  of its  successor  on
                    written  notice  of  that  appointment  being  given  to the
                    Borrower and the other Finance Parties;

          11.22.3   the Agent shall  thereupon  be  discharged  from all further
                    obligations  as agent  and/or  security  trustee  but  shall
                    remain  entitled  to the benefit of the  provisions  of this
                    Clause;

                                       47
<PAGE>

          11.22.4   the Agent's  successor and each of the other parties to this
                    Agreement shall have the same rights and obligations amongst
                    themselves as they would have had if that successor had been
                    a party to this Agreement.

    11.23 No  fiduciary  relationship  Except as  provided  in Clauses  11.3 and
          11.14, the Agent shall not have any fiduciary  relationship with or be
          deemed to be a trustee of or for a Bank and nothing  contained  in any
          of the Security  Documents shall constitute a partnership  between any

                    (c)  prepay the amount of the Indebtedness which will ensure
                         that the  aggregate  of the  Valuations  of the Vessels

                    For the purpose of  determining  the value of a Vessel under
                    this Clause,  where such Vessel constitutes a Total Loss its
                    value  shall  be  deemed  to be the  lesser  of (i) the last

                    any  additional  security  provided  pursuant to this Clause
                    shall be determined by the Agent in its discretion. Provided
                    that,  where the Borrower has provided  additional  security
                    pursuant to this  Clause,  the Borrower may request that the
                    Agent  obtain new  Valuations  on a date falling not earlier
                    than six months after the date such additional  security was
                    provided.  Where  requested  by the  Borrower  to obtain new
                    Valuations  pursuant to this  Clause the Agent shall  obtain
                    such new Valuations at the cost and expense of the Borrower.
                    If the  aggregate of the new  Valuations of the Vessels plus
                    the value of any additional  security (other than cash) (the
                    "New  Security  Amount")  is greater  than one  hundred  and
                    twenty per cent (120%) of the Original  Dollar  Amount (less
                    the  amount of any cash  deposited  as  additional  security
                    pursuant to this Clause) (the "Security Maintenance Amount")
                    provided  that no  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
                    continuing, the Agent (provided that the Agent shall firstly
                    release any cash  collateral  deposited  with it pursuant to
                    this  Clause)  shall  release  to  the  Borrower,  upon  the
                    Borrower's  written  request and at the Borrower's  expense,
                    any such additional security as the Agent selects, such that
                    after its release the New  Security  Amount will at least be
                    equal to the Security Maintenance Amount, provided, however,
                    that the value of such  security  to be released is not less
                    than  five  hundred  thousand  Dollars  ($500,000).  For the
                    purposes  of this Clause the  Borrower  shall at its expense
                    throughout  the  Facility  Period  deliver  to the  Agent  a
                    Valuation  in respect of each  Vessel (i) at least  annually
                    after  the  Execution  Date and (ii) at any time  reasonably
                    requested by the Agent.

          provision of the Security Documents benefiting that Bank.

     16.4 Transfer Certificates If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its
          Commitment  as  contemplated  in Clause 16.1 then such transfer may be
          effected  by the  delivery to the Agent of a duly  completed  and duly
          executed  Transfer  Certificate  in which  event,  on the later of the

                    further  obligations towards each other under this Agreement
                    and their  respective  rights  against  each other  shall be
                    cancelled  other than existing  claims against such Bank for
                    breach  of  this  Agreement   (such  rights,   benefits  and
                    obligations  being  referred  to  in  this  Clause  16.4  as
                    "discharged rights and obligations");

          16.4.2    the Borrower  and the  Transferee  which is a party  thereto
                    shall assume obligations  towards one another and/or acquire
                    rights against one another which differ from such discharged
                    rights and obligations only insofar as the Borrower and such
                    Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of
                    the Borrower and such Bank; and

          16.4.3    the Agent,  the Transferee and the other Banks shall acquire
                    the same rights and benefits and assume the same obligations
                    between  themselves  as they would have acquired and assumed
                    had such Transferee been an original party to this Agreement
                    as a Bank  with  the  rights,  benefits  and/or  obligations
                    acquired or assumed by it as a result of such transfer.

     16.5 Power of Attorney In order to give effect to each Transfer Certificate
          the Finance  Parties and the  Borrower  each  hereby  irrevocably  and
          unconditionally appoint the Agent as its true and lawful attorney with
          full power to  execute  on their  respective  behalves  each  Transfer
          Certificate delivered to the Agent pursuant to Clause 16.4 without the
          Agent being under any obligation to take any further instructions from
          or give any prior notice to, any of the Finance Parties or, subject to
          the Borrower's  rights under Clause 16.1, the Borrower before doing so
          and the Agent  shall so  execute  each such  Transfer  Certificate  on
          behalf of the other Finance  Parties and the Borrower  immediately  on
          its receipt of the same pursuant to Clause 16.4.

     16.6 Notification  The  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  the  other  Finance
          Parties, the Transferee and the Borrower on the execution by it of any
          Transfer  Certificate together with details of the amount transferred,
          the Transfer Date and the parties to such transfer.

17   Payments, Mandatory Prepayment, Reserve Requirements and Illegality

     17.1 Payments All amounts  payable by the Borrower and the Guarantor  under
          or pursuant  to any of the  Security  Documents  shall be paid to such
          accounts  at such  banks as the Agent may from time to time  direct to
          the  Borrower  or the  Guarantor  (as the case may  be),  and  (unless
          payable in any other  Currency of Account) shall be paid in Dollars in
          same day funds (or such funds as are  required by the  authorities  in
          the United States of America for settlement of international  payments
          for immediate  value).  Payments shall be deemed to have been received
          by the  Agent on the date on which the  Agent  receives  authenticated
          advice of  receipt,  unless  that advice is received by the Agent on a
          day  other  than a  Business  Day or at a time  of day  (whether  on a
          Business  Day or not)  when  the  Agent in its  reasonable  discretion
          considers  that it is  impossible  or  impracticable  for the Agent to
          utilise  the amount  received  for value that same day, in which event
          the payment in question  shall be deemed to have been  received by the
          Agent on the Business Day next following the date of receipt of advice
          by the Agent.

     17.2 No deductions or  withholdings  All payments  (whether of principal or
          interest or otherwise) to be made by the Borrower and/or the Guarantor
          pursuant to the Security Documents shall, subject only to Clause 17.3,
          be made free and clear of and without  deduction  for or on account of
          any Taxes or other deductions, withholdings,  restrictions, conditions
          or  counterclaims  of any nature,  and neither  the  Borrower  nor the
          Guarantor  will claim any equity in respect of any payment due from it
          to the  Banks  or to the  Agent  under  or in  relation  to any of the
          Security Documents.

     17.3 Grossing-up  If at any time any law  requires  (or is  interpreted  to
          require)  the  Borrower  or the  Guarantor  to make any  deduction  or
          withholding from any payment, or to change the rate or manner in which
          any required  deduction or  withholding  is made,  the Borrower or the
          Guarantor  (as the case may be) will  promptly  notify  the Agent and,
          simultaneously  with  making  that  payment,  will  pay to  the  Agent
          whatever  additional  amount (after taking into account any additional
          Taxes on, or  deductions or  withholdings  from,  or  restrictions  or
          conditions  on, that  additional  amount) is necessary to ensure that,
          after  making the  deduction or  withholding,  the Agent and the Banks
          receive a net sum equal to the sum which they would have  received had
          no deduction or withholding been made.

                                       68

     17.4 Evidence  of  deductions  If at any time  either the  Borrower  or the
          Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding from
          any  payment  to be  made  by it  pursuant  to  any  of  the  Security
          Documents, the Borrower or the Guarantor (as the case may be) will pay
          the  amount  required  to be  deducted  or  withheld  to the  relevant
          authority  within the time allowed under the  applicable law and will,
          no later than thirty days after  making that  payment,  deliver to the
          Agent an original receipt issued by the relevant  authority,  or other
          evidence reasonably acceptable to the Banks, evidencing the payment to
          that authority of all amounts required to be deducted or withheld.  If
          the Borrower makes any deduction or withholding from any payment under
          or pursuant to any of the Security Documents,  and a Bank subsequently
          receives a refund or allowance from any tax authority  which that Bank
          identifies as being referable to that deduction or  withholding,  that
          Bank  shall,   as  soon  as   reasonably   practicable,   but  without
          substantially interfering with the businesses operations of that Bank,
          pay to the  Borrower  an amount  equal to the  amount of the refund or
          allowance  received,  if and to the  extent  that it may do so without
          prejudicing  its right to retain that refund or allowance  and without
          putting itself in any worse  financial  position than that in which it
          would have been had the deduction or withholding  not been required to
          have  been  made.  Nothing  in this  Clause  shall be  interpreted  as
          imposing any  obligation on any Bank unless  requested by the Borrower
          to apply for any refund or allowance nor as restricting in any way the
          manner in which any Bank organises its tax affairs, nor as imposing on
          any Bank any  obligation  to disclose to the Borrower any  information
          regarding its tax affairs or tax computations.  All costs and expenses
          incurred  by any Bank in  obtaining  or  seeking to obtain a refund or
          allowance from any tax authority  pursuant to this Clause shall be for
          the Borrower's account.

     17.5 Adjustment  of due dates If any  payment  to be made  under any of the
          Security Documents,  other than a payment of interest on the Facility,
          shall be due on a day which is not a Business  Day, that payment shall
          be  made  on  the  next  succeeding  Business  Day  (unless  the  next
          succeeding  Business  Day  falls in the next  calendar  month in which
          event the payment shall be made on the next  preceding  Business Day).
          Any such  variation  of time shall be taken into  account in computing
          any interest in respect of that payment.

                                       69

     17.6 Change in law If, by reason  of the  introduction  of any law,  or any
          change in any law, or the interpretation or administration of any law,
          or in compliance with any request or requirement from any central bank
          or any fiscal, monetary or other authority:-

          17.6.1    any  Finance  Party (or the  holding  company of any Finance
                    Party)  shall be subject to any Tax with respect to payments
                    of all or any part of the Indebtedness; or

          17.6.2    the basis of Taxation  of  payments to any Finance  Party in
                    respect  of all or any  part of the  Indebtedness  shall  be
                    changed; or

          17.6.3    any  reserve  requirements  shall be  imposed,  modified  or
                    deemed  applicable  against assets held by or deposits in or
                    for the  account  of or loans by any  branch of any  Finance
                    Party or its direct or indirect holding company; or

          17.6.4    any ratio  (whether  cash,  capital  adequacy,  liquidity or
                    otherwise) which any Finance Party or its direct or indirect
                    holding  company is required or requested to maintain  shall
                    be affected; or

          17.6.5    there is imposed on any  Finance  Party (or on the direct or
                    indirect  holding  company of any  Finance  Party) any other
                    condition  in relation to the  Indebtedness  or the Security
                    Documents;

          and the result of any of the above  shall be to  increase  the cost to
          any Bank (or to the direct or indirect holding company of any Bank) of
          that Bank making or maintaining  its Commitment or its Drawing,  or to
          cause  any  Finance  Party to suffer  (in its  reasonable  opinion)  a
          material  reduction in the rate of return on its overall capital below
          the  level  which  it  reasonably  anticipated  at the  date  of  this
          Agreement  and which it would  have been able to  achieve  but for its
          entering into this Agreement and/or  performing its obligations  under
          this Agreement, the Finance Party affected shall notify the Agent and,
          on demand to the Borrower by the Agent,  the Borrower  shall from time
          to time pay to the Agent for the account of the Finance Party affected
          the amount which shall  compensate that Finance Party or the Agent (or
          the  relevant  holding  company) for such  additional  cost or reduced
          return. A certificate  signed by an authorised  signatory of the Agent
          or of

                                       70
<PAGE>

          the Finance Party affected  setting out the amount of that payment and
          the basis of its  calculation  shall be  submitted to the Borrower and
          shall be conclusive evidence of such amount save for manifest error or
          on any question of law.

     17.7 Illegality and  impracticality  Notwithstanding  anything contained in
          the  Security  Documents,  the  obligations  of a Bank to  advance  or
          maintain  the Facility  shall  terminate in the event that a change in
          any law or in the  interpretation  of any law by any authority charged
          with its  administration  shall  make it  unlawful  for  that  Bank to
          advance or maintain its  Commitment.  In such event the Bank  affected
          shall notify the Agent and the Agent shall,  by written  notice to the
          Borrower, declare the Banks' obligations to be immediately terminated.
          If all or any part of the  Facility  shall have been  advanced  by the
          Banks  to  the  Borrower,  the  Indebtedness  (including  all  accrued
          interest)  shall be prepaid  within  thirty days from the date of such
          notice.  Clause 6.3 shall apply to that  prepayment if it is made on a
          day other than the last day of an Interest Period. During that period,
          the affected  Bank shall  negotiate in good faith with the Borrower to
          find an  alternative  method or lending  base in order to maintain the
          Facility.

     17.8 Changes  in  market  circumstances  If at any  time a Bank  determines
          (which  determination shall be final and conclusive and binding on the
          Borrower)  that, by reason of changes  affecting the London  Interbank
          market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate
          of  interest  on the  Facility  or any part  thereof  pursuant to this
          Agreement:-

          17.8.1    that Bank shall give notice to the Agent and the Agent shall
                    give notice to the Borrower of the occurrence of such event;
                    and

          17.8.2    the Agent shall as soon as reasonably practicable certify to
                    the Borrower in writing the  effective  cost to that Bank of
                    maintaining  its Commitment for such further period as shall
                    be selected by that Bank and the rate of interest payable by
                    the Borrower for that period;  or, if that is not acceptable
                    to the Borrower,

          17.8.3    the Agent in accordance with instructions from that Bank and
                    subject to that Bank's approval of any agreement between the
                    Agent and the Borrower,  will negotiate with the Borrower in
                    good  faith  with a view  to  modifying  this  Agreement  to
                    provide a substitute basis for that Bank's

                                       71
<PAGE>

                    Commitment which is financially a substantial  equivalent to
                    the basis provided for in this Agreement.

          If,  within  thirty  days of the giving of the notice  referred  to in
          Clause 17.8.1,  the Borrower and the Agent fail to agree in writing on
          a  substitute  basis for such  Bank's  Commitment  the  Borrower  will
          immediately  prepay in the relevant  Permitted  Currency or Currencies
          the amount of such Bank's  Commitment and the Maximum  Facility Amount
          will automatically  decrease by the amount of such Commitment and such
          decrease  shall  not be  reversed.  Clause  6.3  shall  apply  to that
          prepayment  if it is made  on a day  other  than  the  last  day of an
          Interest Period.

     17.9 Non-availability  of currency  Subject to the  procedure  set forth in
          Clause  5.3, if a Bank is for any reason  unable to obtain  Dollars or
          any other Permitted Currency in the London Interbank market and is, as
          a result, or as a result of any other contingency affecting the London
          Interbank  market,  unable to advance or maintain  its  Commitment  in
          Dollars  or in any other  Permitted  Currency,  that Bank  shall  give
          notice to the Agent and the Agent  shall give  notice to the  Borrower
          and that  Bank's  obligations  to make the  Facility  available  shall
          immediately  cease.  In that event, if all or any part of the Facility
          shall have been  advanced by that Bank to the  Borrower,  the Agent in
          accordance with instructions from that Bank and subject to that Bank's
          approval of any  agreement  between the Agent and the  Borrower,  will
          negotiate with the Borrower in good faith with a view to  establishing
          a mutually  acceptable basis for funding the Facility or relevant part
          thereof from an alternative source and/or in an alternative  Permitted
          Currency.  If the  Agent  and the  Borrower  have  failed  to agree in
          writing on a basis for funding the  Facility or relevant  part thereof
          from an alternative source and/or in an alternative Permitted Currency
          by 11.00 a.m. on the second  Business Day prior to the end of the then
          current relevant Interest Period, the Borrower will (without prejudice
          to  its  other  obligations  under  or  pursuant  to  this  Agreement,
          including,  without limitation,  its obligation to pay interest on the
          Facility,  arising on the expiry of the then relevant Interest Period)
          prepay  the  Indebtedness  to the  Agent on behalf of that Bank on the
          expiry of the then current relevant Interest Period.

          amount payable under any of the Security Documents in a currency other
          than the Currency of Account,  and if the amount received or recovered
          is  insufficient  when  converted  into the Currency of Account at the
          date of receipt to satisfy in full the amount due, the Borrower and/or
          the  Guarantor  (as the case may be)  shall,  on the  Agent's  written

                    Security Documents (whether or not completed);

          19.2.3    any other documents which may at any time be required by any
                    Finance  Party  to  give  effect  to  any  of  the  Security
                    Documents or which any Finance Party is entitled to call for
                    or  obtain  pursuant  to  any  of  the  Security   Documents
                    (including,  without limitation, all premiums and other sums
                    from time to time  payable by the Agent in  relation  to the
                    Mortgagees' Insurances); and

                    Documents.

     19.3 Events  of  Default  Each  of the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor  shall
          indemnify the Finance  Parties from time to time on demand against all

          or sustained  by any Finance  Party as a  consequence  of any Event of
          Default, including (without limitation) any Break Costs.

     19.4 Funding costs Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor  shall  indemnify
          the Finance Parties from time to time on demand against all losses and
          costs  incurred or sustained  by any Finance  Party if, for any reason
          due to a default or other action by the  Borrower,  any Drawing is not
          advanced to the Borrower after the relevant  Drawdown  Notice has been
          given to the Agent, or is advanced on a date other than that requested
          in the  Drawdown  Notice,  including  (without  limitation)  any Break
          Costs.

     19.5 Protection  and  enforcement  Each of the Borrower  and the  Guarantor
          shall  indemnify  the  Finance  Parties  from  time to time on  demand
          against all losses,  costs and liabilities which any Finance Party may
          from time to time sustain,  incur or become liable for in or about the
          protection,  maintenance or enforcement of the rights conferred on the
          Finance Parties by the Security  Documents or in or about the exercise
          or  purported  exercise by the  Finance  Parties of any of the rights,
          powers, discretions or remedies vested in them under or arising out of
          the Security  Documents,  including  (without  limitation) any losses,
          costs and  liabilities  which any Finance  Party may from time to time
          sustain,  incur or become  liable for by reason of any  Finance  Party
          being mortgagees of any Vessel and/or a lender to the Borrower,  or by
          reason of any Finance  Party being deemed by any court or authority to
          be an operator or controller, or in any way concerned in the operation
          or  control,  of any  Vessel.  No such  indemnity  will be  given to a
          Finance Party where any such loss,  cost or liability has occurred due
          to gross  negligence or wilful  misconduct on the part of that Finance
          Party  however  this shall not  affect the right of any other  Finance
          Party to receive any such indemnity.

     19.6 Liabilities of Finance  Parties Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor
          will from time to time reimburse the Finance Parties on demand for all
          sums which any Finance Party may pay on account of any of the Security
          Parties or in connection  with any Vessel (whether alone or jointly or
          jointly  and  severally  with any  other  person)  including  (without
          limitation)  all sums which any  Finance  Party may pay or  guarantees
          which any  Finance  Party may give in respect of the  Insurances,  any
          expenses  incurred  by  any  Finance  Party  in  connection  with  the
          maintenance or repair of any Vessel or in discharging  any lien,  bond
          or other claim  relating in any

                                       75
<PAGE>

          way to any  Vessel,  and any sums which any  Finance  Party may pay or
          guarantees  which they may give to procure  the  release of any Vessel
          from arrest or detention.

     19.7 Taxes Each of the  Borrower and the  Guarantor  shall pay all Taxes to
          which  all or any  part  of the  Indebtedness  or any of the  Security
          Documents  may be at any time subject and shall  indemnify the Finance
          Parties on demand against all liabilities,  costs, claims and expenses
          resulting  from any omission to pay or delay in paying any such Taxes.
          The indemnity  contained in this Clause shall survive the repayment of
          the Indebtedness.

20   Miscellaneous

     20.1 Waivers No failure  or delay on the part of the any  Finance  Party in
          exercising any right, power, discretion or remedy under or pursuant to
          any of the  Security  Documents,  nor any actual or alleged  course of
          dealing  between any Finance  Party and any of the  Security  Parties,
          shall operate as a waiver of, or  acquiescence  in, any default on the
          part  of any  Security  Party,  unless  expressly  agreed  to do so in
          writing by the Agent,  nor shall any single or partial exercise by any
          Finance Party of any right,  power,  discretion or remedy preclude any
          other or further exercise of that right, power,  discretion or remedy,
          or the  exercise  by a  Finance  Party  of  any  other  right,  power,
          discretion or remedy.

     20.2 No oral  variations  No  variation or amendment of any of the Security
          Documents shall be valid unless in writing and signed on behalf of the
          Finance Parties and the relevant Security Party.

     20.3 Severability  If at any  time  any  provision  of any of the  Security
          Documents  is invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable  in any respect that
          provision  shall be  severed  from  the  remainder  and the  validity,
          legality and  enforceability of the remaining  provisions shall not be
          affected or impaired in any way.

     20.4 Successors  etc.  The  Security  Documents  shall  be  binding  on the
          Security Parties and on their successors and permitted transferees and
          assignees,  and shall inure to the benefit of the Finance  Parties and
          their respective  successors,  transferees and assignees.  Neither the
          Borrower nor the Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or
          duties under or pursuant to any of the Security  Documents without the
          prior written consent of the Banks.

                                       76
<PAGE>

     20.5 Further assurance If any provision of the Security  Documents shall be
          invalid or  unenforceable in whole or in part by reason of any present
          or future law or any decision of any court, or if the documents at any
          time held by the Finance Parties on their behalf are considered by the
          Banks  for any  reason  insufficient  to carry  out the  terms of this
          Agreement,  then from time to time the Borrower  and/or the  Guarantor
          (as the case may be) will promptly, on demand by the Agent, execute or
          procure the execution of such further  documents as in the  reasonable
          opinion of the Banks are  necessary to provide  adequate  security for
          the repayment of the Indebtedness.

     20.6 Other arrangements The Finance Parties may, without prejudice to their
          rights  under or pursuant to the Security  Documents,  at any time and
          from time to time,  on such terms and  conditions as they may in their
          discretion determine, and without notice to either the Borrower or the
          Guarantor,  grant time or other  indulgence  to, or compound with, any
          other person liable  (actually or contingently) to the Finance Parties
          or any of them in respect of all or any part of the Indebtedness,  and
          may  release  or renew  negotiable  instruments  and take and  release
          securities and hold funds on realisation or suspense  account  without
          affecting the liabilities of the Borrower and/or the Guarantor (as the
          case may be) or the rights of the Finance Parties under or pursuant to
          the Security Documents.

     20.7 Advisers The  Borrower and the  Guarantor  irrevocably  authorise  the
          Agent,  at any time and from time to time during the Facility  Period,
          to  consult  insurance   advisers  on  any  matters  relating  to  the
          Insurances, including, without limitation, the collection of insurance
          claims,  and  from  time to time to  consult  or  retain  advisers  or
          consultants  to monitor or advise on any other claims  relating to the
          Vessels. The Borrower and the Guarantor will provide such advisers and
          consultants  with all  information  and documents  which they may from
          time to time reasonably require and will reimburse the Agent on demand
          for all  reasonable  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by the  Agent  in
          connection  with the  consultation  or retention  of such  advisers or
          consultants.

     20.8 Delegation  The Finance  Parties may at any time and from time to time
          delegate to any person any of their rights,  powers,  discretions  and
          remedies  pursuant  to  the  Security  Documents,  other  than  rights
          relating to actions to be taken by an

                                       77
<PAGE>

          Instructing  Group or the  Banks as a group on such  terms as they may
          consider appropriate (including the power to sub-delegate).

     20.9 Rights etc.  cumulative  Every  right,  power,  discretion  and remedy
          conferred  on the Finance  Parties  under or pursuant to the  Security
          Documents  shall be  cumulative  and in addition to every other right,
          power,  discretion or remedy to which they may at any time be entitled
          by law or in equity.  The Finance  Parties may exercise  each of their
          rights, powers, discretions and remedies as often and in such order as
          they deem  appropriate  subject to obtaining the prior written consent
          of an Instructing Group. The exercise or the beginning of the exercise
          of any right, power,  discretion or remedy shall not be interpreted as
          a waiver of the right to exercise any other right,  power,  discretion
          or remedy either simultaneously or subsequently.

    20.10 No enquiry  The Finance Parties shall not be concerned to enquire into
          the powers of the Security Parties or of any person  purporting to act
          on behalf of any of the Security Parties,  even if any of the Security
          Parties or any such person  shall have acted in excess of their powers
          or if their actions shall have been irregular,  defective or informal,
          whether or not any Finance Parties had notice thereof.

    20.11 Continuing security The security constituted by the Security Documents
          shall be  continuing  and shall not be satisfied  by any  intermediate
          payment or satisfaction  until the Indebtedness shall have been repaid
          in full and none of the  Finance  Parties  shall be under any  further
          actual or  contingent  liability to any third party in relation to the
          Vessels, the Insurances,  Earnings or Requisition  Compensation or any
          other matter referred to in the Security Documents.

    20.12 Security cumulative The security constituted by the Security Documents
          shall be in addition to any other  security  now or in the future held
          by the Finance  Parties or any of them for or in respect of all or any
          part of the Indebtedness,  and shall not merge with or prejudice or be
          prejudiced  by any such  security  or any other  contractual  or legal
          rights  of  any  of  the  Finance   Parties,   nor   affected  by  any
          irregularity,  defect or informality,  or by any release,  exchange or
          variation of any such security.  Section 93 of the Law of Property Act
          1925 and all provisions  which the Agent considers  analogous  thereto
          under the law of any other  relevant  jurisdiction  shall not apply to
          the security constituted by the Security Documents.

                                       78
<PAGE>

    20.13 Re-instatement If any Finance Party takes any steps to exercise any of
          its rights,  powers,  remedies or discretions pursuant to the Security
          Documents and the result shall be adverse to the Finance Parties,  the
          Borrower,  the Guarantor and the Finance  Parties shall be restored to
          their former positions as if no such steps had been taken.

    20.14 No liability None of the Finance Parties, nor any agent or employee of
          any Finance Party,  nor any receiver  and/or manager  appointed by the
          Agent,  shall be  liable  for any  losses  or any  special,  indirect,
          consequential  or punitive  damages which may be incurred  under or in
          connection   with  the   Security   Documents   or  the   transactions
          contemplated thereunder, nor liable as mortgagee in possession for any
          loss on  realisation  or for any  neglect or default of any nature for
          which a mortgagee in possession  might otherwise be liable unless such
          Finance  Party's  action   constitutes   gross  negligence  or  wilful
          misconduct.  Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor  waives,  releases
          and agrees (for itself and on behalf of its  Subsidiaries)  not to sue
          on any such  claim  for any such  losses  or  damages  whether  or not
          accrued  and  whether or not known or expected to exist in its favour,
          except in the event that such party alleges gross negligence or wilful
          misconduct.

    20.15 Rescission of payments etc. Any discharge,  release or reassignment by
          any of the Finance  Parties of any of the security  constituted by, or
          any of the  obligations of any Security Party contained in, any of the
          Security  Documents  shall be (and be deemed always to have been) void
          if any act (including, without limitation, any payment) as a result of
          which such  discharge,  release or  reassignment  was given or made is
          subsequently  wholly or partially rescinded or avoided by operation of
          any  law,  unless  such  Finance  Party's  action   constitutes  gross
          negligence or wilful misconduct.

    20.16 Subsequent Encumbrances If the Agent receives notice of any subsequent
          Encumbrance (other than any Encumbrance permitted by the terms of this
          Agreement)  affecting  either  Vessel,  or  all  or  any  part  of the
          Insurances, Earnings or Requisition Compensation, the Agent may open a
          new account in its books for the Borrower.  If the Agent does not open
          a new account,  then (unless the Encumbrance is permitted by the terms
          of this Agreement or the Agent gives written notice to the contrary to
          the  Borrower)  as from the time of  receipt by the Agent of notice of
          such subsequent  Encumbrance,  all payments made to the

                                       79
<PAGE>

          Agent shall be treated as having been credited to a new account of the
          Borrower   and  not  as  having  been  applied  in  reduction  of  the
          Indebtedness.

    20.17 Releases  If any  Finance  Party  shall at any time in its  discretion
          release  any  party  from  all or  any  part  of  any of the  Security
          Documents or from any term, covenant,  clause, condition or obligation
          contained in any of the Security Documents, the liability of any other
          party to the Security Documents shall not be varied or diminished.

    20.18 Certificates  Any  certificate  or statement  signed by an  authorised
          signatory  of  the  Agent   purporting  to  show  the  amount  of  the
          Indebtedness  (or any part of the  Indebtedness)  or any other  amount
          referred to in any of the Security  Documents shall, save for manifest
          error or on any question of law, be conclusive evidence as against the
          Borrower or the Guarantor (as the case may be) of that amount.

    20.19 Survival of  representations  and warranties The  representations  and
          warranties  on the  part  of each of the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor
          contained  in this  Agreement  shall  survive  the  execution  of this
          Agreement and the advance of the facility or any part thereof.

    20.20 Counterparts   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of
          counterparts  each of which shall be original but which shall together
          constitute the same.

    20.21 Third Party Rights  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of the Contracts
          (Rights  of Third  Parties)  Act 1999,  no term of this  Agreement  is
          enforceable by a person who is not a party to it.

21   Law and Jurisdiction

     21.1 Governing law This Agreement  shall in all respects be governed by and
          interpreted in accordance with English law.

     21.2 Jurisdiction  For the exclusive  benefit of the Finance  Parties,  the
          parties to this Agreement irrevocably agree that the courts of England
          are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of
          or in connection  with this Agreement and that any  Proceedings may be
          brought  in  those  courts.  Each of the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor
          irrevocably  waives  any  objection  which it may now or in the future
          have to the  laying  of the  venue  of any  Proceedings  in any  court
          referred to

                                       80
<PAGE>

          in this Clause, and any claim that those Proceedings have been brought
          in an inconvenient or inappropriate forum.

     21.3 Alternative jurisdictions Nothing contained in this Clause shall limit
          the right of the Finance Parties to commence any  Proceedings  against
          either the  Borrower or the  Guarantor in any other court of competent
          jurisdiction  nor shall the  commencement of any  Proceedings  against
          either the  Borrower  or the  Guarantor  in one or more  jurisdictions
          preclude   the   commencement   of  any   Proceedings   in  any  other
          jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not.

     21.4 Service  of  process  Without  prejudice  to the right of the  Finance
          Parties to use any other method of service  permitted by law,  each of
          the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor  irrevocably  agrees  that any writ,
          notice,  judgment or other legal process shall be sufficiently  served
          on it if  addressed  to it and left at or sent by post to the  Address
          for Service,  and in that event shall be  conclusively  deemed to have
          been served at the time of leaving or, if posted,  at 9.00 a.m. on the
          third  Business Day after  posting by prepaid  first class  registered
          post.

IN WITNESS of which the parties to this  Agreement  have executed this Agreement
the day and year first before written.
