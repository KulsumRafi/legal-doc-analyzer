       1.     The Purchase  Price  provided for in Section 2.1 is  predicated on
total  revenues  generated  solely from the sale(s) of sports and  entertainment
memorabilia from the Company inventory as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 5.3.

       The  parties  agree  that  additional  revenues  on a net basis  shall be
credited  towards the revenue  requirements  set forth in Section 2.1. By way of
example, in the event the Purchaser  Subsidiary arranges for a guest appearance;
by an athlete,  then the  difference  between  the amount paid by the  Purchaser
Subsidiary  for the  athlete's  appearance  and the amount paid to the Purchaser
Subsidiary for the appearance shall be credited to the revenue targets.

remains as drafted and has not been changed or modified.
