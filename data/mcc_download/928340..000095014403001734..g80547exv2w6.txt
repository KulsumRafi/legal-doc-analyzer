                AGREEMENT TO AMEND SHARE SALE AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT TO AMEND SHARE SALE AGREEMENT is made this 29th day of November
2002,

BETWEEN:

1.       CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD., formerly Cayman Water Company Limited, of
         Trafalgar Place, West Bay Road, P.O. Box 1114 GT, Grand Cayman
         (hereinafter "the Purchaser") of the first part; and

2.       NORTH-AMERICAN MORTGAGE & FINANCE CORPORATION OF Elizabethan Square,
         George Town, Grand Cayman (hereinafter "NAMF") and TRANSCONTINENTAL
         FINANCE CORPORATION LIMITED, OF Elizabethan Square, George Town, Grand
         Cayman, (hereinafter "TCF") (together the "Vendors") of the second
         part.

WHEREAS:

The parties hereto entered into a Share Sale Agreement dated October 4, 2002
(the "Share Sale Agreement").

The Share Sale Agreement provided at Clause 8.8 that the Share Sale Agreement
could be modified by an instrument in writing signed by the duly authorised
representatives of the parties.

The completion of the Share Sale Agreement was made conditional on the happening
of certain events on or before November 29, 2002, and the parties have agreed
that the conditions precedent to the Share Sale Agreement are unlikely to be
satisfied by that date and accordingly the parties have agreed to enter into
this amending agreement to provide for a later completion date and the
consequences thereof.

 NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

1.       Clause 3.3 of the Share Sale Agreement is amended by the addition of
         the following:

         a)       after the end of Clause 3.3.1.2:

                           "3.3.1.3 US$6,559,000.00 if Completion is on or
                                    between 1st and 31st December, 2002."

         b)       after the end of Clause 3.3.2.2:

                           "3.3.2.3 US$7,166,000.00 if Completion is on or
                                    before 1st and 31st December, 2002."

2.       Clauses 4.2, 4.3 and 5.1 of the Share Sale Agreement are amended by
         deleting "November 29, 2002" wherever it appears, and substituting
         therefor "December 31, 2002".

3.       The Share Sale Agreement is amended by adding the following clauses
         after clause 3.6:

         "3.7     Only in the event that the "Actual Gross Equity of OCC" and
                  the "Actual Gross Equity of OCBVI" have not been agreed or
                  determined pursuant to clause 3.2 within 2 Business Days prior
                  to Completion, then the amount of cash payable at Completion
                  by the Purchaser to TCP shall be an initial payment (the
                  "Initial Payment") being the Cash Consideration that would
                  have been payable had Completion taken place on 29st November,
                  2002.

          3.8     In the event that clause 3.7 becomes applicable, within 5
                  Business Days after the "Actual Gross Equity of OCC" and the
                  "Actual Gross Equity of OCBVI" have been determined by OCC's
                  Auditors and OCBVI's Auditors respectively pursuant to clause
                  3.2 or otherwise agreed between the parties an adjusting
                  payment, calculated as the Cash Consideration less the
                  Initial Payment (the "Adjusting Payment"), shall be made by
                  the Purchaser to TCF, if the Adjusting Payment is a positive
                  amount, or by the Vendors to the Purchaser, if the Adjusting
                  Payment is a negative amount. OCC's Auditors and OCBVI's
                  Auditors shall determine "Actual Gross Equity of OCC" and the
                  "Actual Gross Equity of OCBVI" respectively within 60 days of
                  Completion unless the parties have already agreed the amounts
                  of "Actual Gross Equity of OCC" and the "Actual Gross Equity
                  of OCBVI" between themselves."

4.       The Share Sale Agreement is amended by inserting in clause 5.9.1 after
         "Cash Consideration" the words "or the Initial Payment as calculated
         pursuant to clause 3.7, if applicable"

5.       Except as expressly modified by this Agreement, the Share Sale
         Agreement continues in full force and effect according to its terms.
