Remaining Shareholder in accordance with Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Agreement.

                  1.10   "Remaining Shareholders" - The Shareholders, other than

who wishes to sell, give, contribute, assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise in
any manner whatsoever dispose of any of the Shares which he/she or it now owns
or hereafter at any time shall acquire, may only do so after first offering all
such Shares for sale to Corporation and then to the Remaining Shareholders upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein. Every such Offer shall be made in
writing and shall state (i) the number of the Shares which the Offering
Shareholder desires to sell, give, contribute, assign, transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose, (ii) the purchase price for the Shares, (iii) terms of
payment, (iv) the amount of deposit required, and (v) the terms of any guaranty

Remaining Shareholders.

                                       2

<PAGE>

                  (b) Transfers to Permitted Transferees. The first right of
offer set forth in this Section 2 shall not apply to an inter vivos or
testamentary gift or other transfer of Shares by a Shareholder to a Permitted
Transferee, provided such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as the Shareholders are bound
hereby, or to any change in control of a Shareholder other than a natural person
so long as the controlling person is a Permitted Transferee. In the event that
any Permitted Transferee fails to agree in writing to be bound by this
Agreement, the proposed transfer shall be null and void absent compliance with
the terms of this Agreement as if such person were not a Permitted Transferee.
An involuntary seizure of Shares owned by a Shareholder shall be deemed to
constitute an offer by such Shareholder to sell his/her/its Shares.

         3. Purchase Option of Corporation. Corporation shall have a period of
thirty (30) days after receipt by it of an Offer within which to accept or
reject such Offer, provided that the Corporation must, in writing,
unconditionally accept all of the Shares so offered, including the purchase
price for which the Shares are offered and the terms of such offer, and any
attempted conditional or partial acceptance of the Offer shall constitute a
rejection. The Offering Shareholder, and any Permitted Transferee of the
Offering Shareholder, shall not participate in any way in the making of the
decision as the whether Corporation shall accept or reject such Offer. Failure
on the part of Corporation to take action within such period shall constitute a
rejection of the Offer.

         4. Purchase Option of Remaining Shareholders. Should Corporation reject
an Offer, the Remaining Shareholders shall have an additional period of thirty
(30) days within which to accept or reject such Offer; provided that the
Remaining Shareholders, individually or collectively, must, in writing,
unconditionally accept all of the Shares so offered, including the purchase
price for which the Shares are offered and the terms of such offer, and any
attempted conditional or partial acceptance of the Offer shall constitute a
rejection.. Failure on the part of the Remaining Shareholders to take action
within the period specified shall constitute a rejection of the Offer. In the
event that more than one of the Remaining Shareholders wish to exercise its or
their option and in the aggregate they wish to purchase more Shares than those
available under the Offer, they shall do so in proportion to their ownership of
Shares.

         5. Sales Following Rejection of Offer. In the event that Corporation or
the Remaining Shareholders fail to accept the Offer made by the Offering
Shareholder in whole, and then only during the period of one hundred eighty
(180) days following the rejection by the Remaining Shareholders, the Offering
Shareholder may sell, give contribute, assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise
in any manner whatsoever dispose of the Shares not purchased by Corporation
and/or the Remaining Shareholders in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Notice of Offer. If the Seller wishes to sell such Shares at a price which is
less than that set forth in the Notice of Offer, upon terms less favorable to
the Seller than those set forth in the Notice of Offer or more than 180 days
after the rejection of the Offer as to such Shares by Corporation and the
Remaining Shareholders (the "Revised Offer"), then such Shares must be offered
again to Corporation and the Remaining Shareholders on the terms and conditions
in the Revised Offer, and in accordance with the procedures and time periods set
forth above.

         6. Endorsement of Stock. All Certificates owned by the Shareholders
shall have endorsed thereon the following statement:

            "The shares of stock represented by this certificate are
            held  subject  to the terms and  conditions  of a Second
            Amended and Restated Shareholders  Agreement dated as of
            the  21st  day  of  February,  2003  by  and  among  the
            Corporation  and  certain  of  its  Shareholders,  which
            Agreement    contains    provisions    restricting   the
            Shareholder's  right to  transfer  the  shares  of stock
            represented by this certificate. A copy of the Agreement
            is on file at the office of the Corporation."

         All Certificates representing additional Shares of stock of Corporation
acquired by any of the Shareholders shall be similarly endorsed.

         7. Covenants of the Corporation. Corporation shall use its best efforts
to cause the legend specified in Paragraph 6 hereof to be placed on all
Certificates in respect of Shares which are subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and shall also institute a stop transfer order with the transfer agent
for such Shares. Corporation shall retain a copy of this Agreement and copies of
all amendments thereto which it receives on file at the office of Corporation.
Corporation shall have no liability as a result of its failure to perform its
obligations under this Paragraph 7, unless such failure is willful. In carrying
out its obligations hereunder, Corporation shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on any notice believed by Corporation to have been signed by the
Shareholders or their authorized representatives.

         8. Securities Law Compliance. Corporation shall have no obligation to
issue Certificates in connection with any transfer of Shares unless satisfied
that there has been compliance with the requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 and applicable state securities laws and all rules and regulations
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and such state securities laws.

         9. Stock Splits, Dividends, Etc. Whenever a specific number of Shares
or the Purchase Price is to be computed hereunder such number or amount shall be
adjusted for subsequent stock splits, stock dividends or other capital
adjustments of the Corporation.

         10. Rights, Obligations and Remedies. Shareholders agree that their
rights and obligations under, and the remedies to enforce, this Agreement are
joint and several and each Shareholder shall be completely free to enforce any
or all of the rights or obligations under this Agreement against the other
Shareholder with or without the concurrence or joinder of the other Shareholder
or Corporation. The Shares are unique, and recognizing that the remedy at law
for any breach or threatened breach by a Shareholder of the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement would be inadequate and that any such
breach or threatened breach would cause such immediate and permanent damage as
would be irreparable and the exact amount of which would be impossible to
ascertain, the Shareholders agree that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach of nay such covenant or agreement, in addition to any and all other legal
and equitable remedies which may be available, any Shareholder may specifically
enforce the terms of this Agreement and may obtain temporary and/or permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage by reason of
any breach or threatened breach hereof and, to the extent permissible under the
applicable statutes and rules of procedure, a temporary injunction may be
granted immediately upon the commencement of any such suit and without notice.

                  (a) Indulgences, Etc. Neither the failure nor any delay on the
part of any party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further

unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in

shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement another provision or term
