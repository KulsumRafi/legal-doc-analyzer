supplemental pension benefit from the Company equal to 6% of the
Executive&#146;s &#147;Final Average Compensation&#148; (as defined below) for each full
year (with fractional credit for partial years) that the Executive serves
as an employee of the Company, up to a maximum of 60% of the Executive&#146;s
Final Average Compensation. This annual benefit shall be reduced by (1)
any amounts payable to the Executive under the Pension Plan and the
Pension Excess Plan or any other additional, successor or replacement
pension plan of the Company, (2)&nbsp;any pension benefits payable to the
Executive by the entity that employed the Executive as of November&nbsp;3,
2002 (the &#147;Previous Employer&#148;) or any of its affiliates, and (3)&nbsp;the
Executive&#146;s primary Social Security benefit as determined by the Company.
For purposes of determining the discount (if any) for early commencement
of payments, the column in Table I of Section&nbsp;3.2 of the Pension Plan
under the heading &#147;At Least 25 Years&#148; shall be applied to the gross SERP
benefit prior to the application of any offsets. For purposes of
determining Pension SERP benefits payable in the form of a joint and
survivor annuity, the factors contained in Table A (&#147;Subsidized&#148;) of the
Pension Plan shall be used. &#147;Final Average Compensation&#148; shall mean the
annualized average of the Executive&#146;s &#147;SERP Compensation&#148; (as hereinafter
defined) during the highest-paid five calendar years out of the last ten
calendar years of the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, or the
final 60&nbsp;months of the Executive&#146;s employment with the
Company if higher, or if the Executive has been employed by the
Company less than 60 months, the total number of months of the
Executive&#146;s employment.
&#147;SERP Compensation&#148; shall mean the sum of (x)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s Annual
Base Salary paid under Section&nbsp;3(b)(i), (y)&nbsp;Annual Bonus paid under
Section&nbsp;3(b)(ii) and (z)&nbsp;profit-sharing payments made under the Profit
Sharing Plan, disregarding in each case any amount deferred for any
reason. The Pension SERP benefit shall be payable in accordance with the
payment option elected by the Executive, in accordance with the election
procedures set forth in the Pension Excess Plan. Except as specifically
provided in this Agreement, the other terms and conditions of the Pension
SERP shall be governed by the terms of the Pension Excess Plan as if the
benefits under the Pension SERP were paid from the Pension Excess Plan.</FONT></TD>

560,099 options to purchase the Previous Employer&#146;s common stock (the &#147;Previous
Employer Options&#148;), as disclosed previously to the Company, the Company shall
grant to the Executive as of the date immediately following the Effective Date
(the &#147;Grant Date&#148;) a stock option (the &#147;Replacement Option&#148;) under The Chubb
Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) with a Black-Scholes
value equal to the Black-Scholes value of the Previous Employer&#146;s Options as of
the last trading date prior to the Grant Date. The Black-Scholes values to be
calculated under this Section&nbsp;3(b)(v) shall be determined as soon as reasonably
practicable following the last trading date prior to the Grant Date in a manner
consistent with the methodology used by Mercer Human Resources Consulting (the
&#147;Firm&#148;) for valuing stock options granted to employees of its publicly-traded
clients during the year 2002 through the Grant Date. The Replacement Option
shall have a ten-year term and shall vest and become exercisable in three equal
installments on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, the second anniversary
of the Grant Date and the third anniversary of the Effective Date, provided
that, the Executive remains in the employ of the Company through each such
date. The exercise price per share of the Replacement Option shall be the
average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Company&#146;s common stock,
par value $1.00 per share (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;) reported for consolidated
trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the date on which the award is
granted, or, if the Common Stock shall not have been traded on such date, the
average of such highest and lowest sales prices on the first day prior thereto
on which the Common Stock was so traded (the &#147;Fair Market Value&#148;). Except as
specifically set forth herein, the Replacement Option shall have the same terms
and conditions as similar grants made by the Company to senior executives
generally in 2002, as such terms are set forth in the award agreement attached
as Exhibit&nbsp;A. Any amounts payable by or on behalf of the Previous Employer
with respect to, or in the cancellation of, the Previous Employer Options (or
any reduction in the actual number of the forfeited stock options from the
Previous Employer to less than 560,099) shall reduce (but not below zero) on a
dollar-for-dollar basis the Black-Scholes value of the Replacement Option.

performance awards for the 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 award cycles at the Previous
Employer, the Company shall grant to the Executive on the Grant Date a number
of restricted shares of Common Stock under the Plan with a Fair Market Value of
$3.6&nbsp;million as of the Grant Date (the &#147;Restricted Stock&#148;). The restrictions
with respect to the Restricted Stock shall lapse 50% per year beginning on the
first anniversary of the Effective Date, provided that, the Executive remains
in the employ of the Company through each such date. Except as specifically
set forth herein, the Restricted Stock shall have the same terms and conditions
as similar grants made by the Company to senior executives generally in 2002 as
such terms are set forth in the award agreement attached as Exhibit&nbsp;B. Any
amounts payable by or on behalf of the Previous Employer with respect to, or in
cancellation of, the Previous Employer&#146;s performance awards referenced in this
Section&nbsp;3(b)(vi) shall reduce (but not below zero) on a dollar-for-dollar basis
the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock to be granted to the Executive.

granted an option to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock under the
Plan, and such option shall have a Black-Scholes value equal to $6,000,000 (the
&#147;Option&#148;). The Black-Scholes value to be calculated under this Section
3(b)(vii) shall be determined on or as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Grant Date in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Firm for
valuing stock options granted to employees of its publicly traded clients
during the year 2002 through the Grant Date. Except as specifically set forth
herein, the Option shall have the same terms and conditions as similar grants
that have been made by the Company to senior executives generally in 2002, as
such terms are set forth in the award agreement attached as Exhibit&nbsp;C.
One-half of the Black-Scholes value of the Option (i.e., $3&nbsp;million) shall be
granted to the Executive in the form of an option to purchase shares with an
exercise price per share equal to the Fair Market Value and the other half of
the Black-Scholes value of the Option (i.e., $3&nbsp;million) shall be granted to

price per share equal to the product of (A)&nbsp;1.25 and (B)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value.

executives generally a performance share award with respect to the 2003 &#150; 2005

including, without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any
interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the

Section&nbsp;8(a)) (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;). For the purposes of this Section

damages, and (y)&nbsp;if the Company elects to prevent the Executive from breaching
such provisions by obtaining an injunction against the Executive, there is a
reasonable probability of the Company&#146;s eventual success on the merits. The
Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive commits any such breach or
threatens to commit any breach, the Company shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without
posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual
damage, in addition to, and not in lieu of, such other remedies as may be

(D)&nbsp;the use of New Jersey law provides certainty to the Parties in any covenant
litigation in the United States, and (E)&nbsp;enforcement of the provision of this
Section&nbsp;8 would not violate any fundamental public policy of New Jersey or any
other jurisdiction. If any of the provisions of Section&nbsp;8 are determined to be
wholly or partially unenforceable, the Executive hereby agrees that this
Agreement or any provision hereof may be reformed so that it is enforceable to
the maximum extent permitted by law. If any of the provisions of this Section
8 are determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
such determination shall not be a bar to or in any way diminish the Company&#146;s
right to enforce any such covenant in any other jurisdiction.

discharge the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions and their
respective, current and former, trustees, officers, directors, partners,
shareholders, agents, employees, consultants, independent contractors and

particular including any claim for discrimination based upon race, color,
ethnicity, sex, age (including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
