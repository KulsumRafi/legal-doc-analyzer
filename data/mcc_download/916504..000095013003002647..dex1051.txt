otherwise permitted by law.

         5. That, I, Robert Euritt, warrant that except as expressly set forth
herein, no representations of any kind or character have been made to me by the
Company or any of the Company's agents, representatives, employees or attorneys

         6. That, I, Robert Euritt, acknowledge and agree that this Separation
Agreement and General Release of All Claims and the consideration given
hereunder is not to be construed as an admission by the Company or as an
admission of any act or fact whatsoever.

         7. The consideration set forth in the Agreement exceeds any amount
and/or consideration to which I would otherwise be entitled under the Company's
standard operating policies, practices, or as required by law. All amounts to
which I would be entitled under the Company's policies, practices and/or as
required by law have been tendered to me and are hereby acknowledged. Therefore,
