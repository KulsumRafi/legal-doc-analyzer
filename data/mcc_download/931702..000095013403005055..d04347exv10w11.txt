         the requested Revolving Loans will then be made available to the
         Borrower by the Administrative Agent either by (A) crediting the
         account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with
         the amount of such funds or (B) wire transfer of such funds, in each

         acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.

                  (d) Reductions of Revolving Committed Amount. Upon at least
         three Business Days' notice, the Borrower shall have the right to
         permanently terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the
         Revolving Committed Amount at any time or from time to time; provided
         that (i) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount at
         least equal to $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 above
         such amount and (ii) no reduction shall be made which would reduce the
         Revolving Committed Amount to an amount less than the sum of the
         aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the
         aggregate principal amount of outstanding L/C Obligations. Any
         reduction in (or termination of) the Revolving Committed Amount shall
         be permanent and may not be reinstated.

                  (e) Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans made by each Lender
         shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower
         to such Lender in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.1(e).

         2.2 LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

                  (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

                           (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
                  herein and other terms and conditions that the L/C Issuer may
                  reasonably require, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance
                  upon the agreements of the Revolving Lenders set forth in this
                  Section 2.2, from time to time on any Business Day during the
                  period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit
                  Expiration Date, to issue standby Letters of Credit in Dollars
                  for the account of the Borrower or, subject to the terms of
                  Section 2.2(k), certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower, and to
                  amend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in each case
                  in accordance with subsection (b) below and (B) the Revolving
                  Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit
                  issued for the account of the Borrower or, subject to the
                  terms of Section 2.2(k), certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower;
                  provided, however, that after giving effect to the issuance of
                  any Letter of Credit (1) the sum of the aggregate principal
                  amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate
                  principal amount of outstanding L/C Obligations shall not
                  exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, (2) with respect to
                  each individual Lender, the sum of the aggregate principal
                  amount of outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lender plus the
                  aggregate principal amount of outstanding L/C Obligations of
                  such Lender shall not exceed such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
                  the Revolving Committed Amount and (3) the aggregate principal
                  amount of outstanding L/C Obligations shall not at any time
                  exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing
                  limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
                  Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of
                  Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that
                  have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

                           (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue or amend any
                  Letter of Credit if:

                                    (A) any order, judgment or decree of any
                           Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its
                           terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer
                           from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
                           Requirement of Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or
                           any request or directive (whether or not having the
                           force of law) from any Governmental Authority with
                           jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or
                           request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the
                           issuance of letters of credit generally or such
                           Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon
                           the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit
                           any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
                           which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated
                           hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
                           shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed
                           loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the
                           Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith
                           deems material to it;

                                    (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter
                           of Credit would occur more than twelve months after
                           the date of issuance, unless the Required Lenders
                           have approved such expiry date;

                                    (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter
                           of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit
                           Expiration Date, unless all the Revolving Lenders
                           have approved such expiry date;

                                    (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit
                           would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer;
                           or

                                    (E) such Letter of Credit is in an initial
                           amount less than $100,000 (unless otherwise agreed to
                           by the L/C Issuer), is to be used for a purpose other
                           than as permitted by Section 7.11, or is denominated
                           in a currency other than Dollars.

                           (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to
                  amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no
                  obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
                  amended form under the terms hereof or (B) the beneficiary of
                  such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment
                  to such Letter of Credit.

                  (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of
         Credit.

                           (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended,
                  as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered
                  to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in
                  the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately
                  completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.
                  The Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
                  Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
                  at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the
                  L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
                  discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
                  amendment, as applicable. In the case of a request for an
                  initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
                  Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
                  the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the
                  requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day),
                  (B) the amount thereof, (C) the expiry date thereof, (D) the
                  name and address of the beneficiary thereof, (E) the documents
                  to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
                  thereunder, (F) the full text of any certificate to be
                  presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
                  thereunder and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may
                  require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any
                  outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
                  Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
                  the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended, (2) the
                  proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business
                  Day), (3) the nature of the proposed amendment and (4) such
                  other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.

                           (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
                  Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the
                  Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
                  Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of
                  Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C
                  Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
                  thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from
                  the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or
                  amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof,
                  then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C
                  Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
                  for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable
                  amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with
                  the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business practices.

                           (iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of
                  Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising
                  bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the
                  L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter
                  of Credit or amendment.

                  (c) Participations.

                           (i) On the Closing Date, each Revolving Lender shall
                  be deemed to have purchased without recourse a risk
                  participation from the L/C Issuer in each Existing Letter of
                  Credit and the obligations arising thereunder and any
                  collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal
                  to its Pro Rata Share of the obligations under such Existing
                  Letter of Credit, and shall absolutely, unconditionally and
                  irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and
                  be obligated to pay to the L/C Issuer therefor and discharge
                  when due, its Pro Rata Share of the obligations arising under
                  such Existing Letter of Credit.

                           (ii) Each Revolving Lender, upon issuance of a Letter
                  of Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse
                  a risk participation from the L/C Issuer in such Letter of
                  Credit and the obligations arising thereunder and any
                  collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal
                  to its Pro Rata Share of the obligations under such Letter of
                  Credit, and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
                  assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and be obligated
                  to pay to the L/C Issuer therefor and discharge when due, its
                  Pro Rata Share of the obligations arising under such Letter of
                  Credit.

                  (d) Reimbursement.

                           (i) In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
                  Credit, the L/C Issuer will promptly notify the Borrower in
                  writing. The Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer on the
                  day of drawing under any Letter of Credit either with the
                  proceeds of a Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise
                  in immediately available funds. If the Borrower shall fail to
                  reimburse the L/C Issuer as provided hereinabove, the
                  unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at a
                  per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus two
                  percent (2%).

                           (ii) Subsequent to a drawing under any Letter of
                  Credit, unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the L/C
                  Issuer of its intent to otherwise reimburse the L/C Issuer,
                  the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving
                  Loan at the Adjusted Base Rate in the amount of the drawing as
                  described herein, the proceeds of which will be used to
                  satisfy the reimbursement obligations. On any day on which the
                  Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan
                  borrowing to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
                  Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Revolving
                  Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been deemed requested in
                  connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which
                  case a Revolving Loan borrowing comprised solely of Base Rate
                  Loans (each such borrowing, a "Mandatory Borrowing") shall be
                  immediately made from all Revolving Lenders (without giving
                  effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to
                  Section 9.2 or otherwise) pro rata based on each Revolving
                  Lender's respective Pro Rata Share and the proceeds thereof
                  shall be paid directly to the L/C Issuer for application to
                  the respective L/C Obligations. Each Revolving Lender hereby
                  irrevocably agrees to make such Revolving Loans immediately
                  upon any such request or deemed request on account of each
                  such Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner
                  specified in the preceding sentence and on the same such date
                  notwithstanding (A) the amount of Mandatory Borrowing may not
                  comply with the minimum amount for borrowings of Revolving
                  Loans otherwise required hereunder, (B) the failure of any
                  conditions specified in Section 5.2 to have been satisfied,
                  (C) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (D) the
                  failure of any such request or deemed request for Revolving
                  Loans to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder, (E)
                  the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (F) any reduction in
                  the Revolving Committed Amount or any termination of the
                  Commitments.

                           (iii) In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing
                  cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required
                  above (including, without limitation, as a result of the
                  commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with
                  respect to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each
                  Revolving Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith fund
                  (as of the date the


                                       25
<PAGE>

                  Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but
                  adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or
                  after such date and prior to such purchase) its Pro Rata Share
                  in the outstanding L/C Obligations; provided, that in the
                  event any Revolving Lender shall fail to fund its Pro Rata
                  Share on the day the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have
                  occurred, then the amount of such Revolving Lender's unfunded
                  participation interest therein shall bear interest payable to
                  the L/C Issuer upon demand, at the rate equal to, if paid
                  within two Business Days of such date, the Federal Funds Rate,
                  and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.
                  Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by a
                  Revolving Lender to the L/C Issuer, such Revolving Lender
                  shall, automatically and without any further action on the
                  part of the L/C Issuer or such Revolving Lender, acquire a
                  participation in an amount equal to such payment (excluding
                  the portion of such payment constituting interest owing to the
                  L/C Issuer) in the related unreimbursed drawing portion of the
                  L/C Obligation and in the interest thereon and shall have a
                  claim against the Borrower and the other Credit Parties with
                  respect thereto. Any payment by the Lenders pursuant to this
                  clause (iii) shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
                  obligations of the Borrower or any Credit Party to reimburse
                  the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit.

                  (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
         reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit
         shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
         strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under
         all circumstances, including the following:

                           (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such
                  Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other
                  agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                           (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim,
                  set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at
                  any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such
                  Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary
                  or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any
                  other Person, whether in connection with this Credit
                  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
                  Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                           (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other
                  document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be
                  forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
                  any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
                  of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
                  Letter of Credit;

                           (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter
                  of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that
                  does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
                  Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such
                  Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
                  bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of
                  creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or
                  successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter
                  of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
                  proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                           (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
                  whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any
                  other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
                  available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
         each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any
         claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other
         irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The
         Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim
         against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is
         given as aforesaid.


                                       26

                  (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower
         agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C
         Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other
         than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by
         the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or
         accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing
         or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any
         Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
         participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any
         Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at
         the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the
         Required Lenders, as applicable, (ii) any action taken or omitted in
         the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or (iii) the due
         execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
         instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
         Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or
         omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of
         any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not
         intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such
         rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
         transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer,
         any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents,
         participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or
         responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v)
         of Section 2.2(e). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
         foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their
         face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation
         and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or
         sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting
         to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
         thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
         be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

                  (g) Cash Collateral. If, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration
         Date, any Letter of Credit for any reason remains outstanding and
         partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall immediately Cash
         Collateralize the then aggregate principal amount of all L/C
         Obligations (in an amount equal to such aggregate principal amount
         determined as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date). The Borrower
         hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
         Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit
         accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.
         Cash collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing
         deposit accounts at Bank of America.

                  (h) Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
         agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is
         issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter
         of Credit), the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998"
         published by the Institute of International Banking Requirement of Law
         & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the
         time of issuance) and the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
         Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International
         Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the
         ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking Technique and
         Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single currency
         (euro)) shall apply to each Letter of Credit.

                  (i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges
         Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
         Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter
         of Credit in an amount equal to 0.125% times the daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (the "L/C Fronting
         Fee"). The L/C Fronting Fee shall be computed on a quarterly basis in
         arrears and shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each
         fiscal quarter of the Borrower (as well as on the Letter of Credit
         Expiration Date) for the fiscal quarter (or portion thereof) then
         ending, beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the
         issuance of such Letter of Credit. In addition, the Borrower shall pay
         directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance,
         presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
         costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as
         from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and
         charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

                  (j) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event
         of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of
         Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control.

                  (k) Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit
         Agreement, a Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement
         to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a
         Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that notwithstanding such
         statement, the Borrower shall be the actual account party for all
         purposes of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such
         statement shall not affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations
         hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

                  (l) Indemnification of L/C Issuer.

                           (i) In addition to its other obligations under this
                  Credit Agreement, the Credit Parties hereby agree to protect,
                  indemnify, pay and hold the L/C Issuer harmless from and
                  against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages,
                  losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) that the L/C Issuer may incur or be subject
                  to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance
                  of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of the L/C Issuer
                  to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present
                  or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental
                  Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called
                  "Government Acts").

                           (ii) As between the Credit Parties and the L/C
                  Issuer, the Credit Parties shall assume all risks of the acts,
                  omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
                  thereof. In the absence of gross negligence or willful
                  misconduct, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for: (A)
                  the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
                  legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
                  connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter
                  of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
                  respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or
                  forged; (B) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
                  transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign
                  any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
                  proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be
                  invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) failure of the
                  beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply fully with
                  conditions required in order to draw upon a Letter of Credit;
                  (D) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission
                  or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex
                  or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (E) errors in
                  interpretation of technical terms; (F) any loss or delay in
                  the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
                  order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the
                  proceeds thereof; and (G) any consequences arising from causes
                  beyond the control of the L/C Issuer, including, without
                  limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall
                  affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the L/C Issuer's
                  rights or powers hereunder.

                           (iii) In furtherance and extension and not in
                  limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth,
                  any action taken or omitted by the L/C Issuer, under or in
                  connection with any Letter of Credit or the related
                  certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put
                  the L/ C Issuer under any resulting liability to the Borrower
                  or any other Credit Party. It is the intention of the parties
                  that this Credit Agreement shall be construed and applied to
                  protect and indemnify the L/C Issuer against any and all risks
                  involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of
                  which risks are hereby assumed by the Credit Parties,
                  including, without limitation, any and all risks of the acts
                  or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or
                  future Government Acts. The L/C Issuer shall not, in any way,
                  be liable for any failure by the L/C Issuer or anyone else to
                  pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of the
                  L/C Issuer.

                           (iv) Nothing in this subsection (l) is intended to
                  limit the reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained
                  in this Section 2.2. The obligations of the Borrower under
                  this subsection (l) shall survive the termination of this
                  Credit Agreement. No act or omission of any current or prior
                  beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or
                  impair the rights of the L/C Issuer to enforce any right,
                  power or benefit under this Credit Agreement.

                  (m) Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified, all
         references herein to the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall
         be deemed to mean the maximum face amount of such Letter of Credit
         after giving effect to all increases thereof contemplated by such
         Letter of Credit or the Letter of Credit Application therefor, whether
         or not such maximum face amount is in effect at such time.

         2.3 TERM LOANS.

                  (a) Term Loan Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
         set forth herein, each Term Loan Lender severally agrees, on the
         Closing Date, to make a term loan (each a "Term Loan" and collectively
         the "Term Loans") to the Borrower in Dollars in an amount equal to such
         Term Loan Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan Committed Amount;
         provided that the aggregate amount of Term Loans made on the Closing
         Date shall not exceed the Term Loan Committed Amount. Once repaid, Term
         Loans may not be reborrowed.

                  (b) Funding of Term Loans. On or before 1:00 p.m. on the
         Closing Date, each Term Loan Lender will make its Pro Rata Share of the
         Term Loan Committed Amount available to the Administrative Agent by
         deposit, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, at the
         Administrative Agent's Office. The amount of the Term Loans will then
         be made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent either by
         (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the
         Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) by wire
         transfer of such funds, in each case to the extent the amount of such
         Term Loans are made available to the Administrative Agent. All Term
         Loans on the Closing Date shall be Base Rate Loans. Thereafter, all or
         any portion of the Term Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans in
         accordance with the terms of Section 2.4.

                  (c) Amortization. The principal amount of the Term Loans shall
         be repaid in quarterly installments as follows, unless accelerated
         sooner pursuant to Section 9.2:

                  (d) Term Notes. The Term Loan made by each Lender shall be

         Lender in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.3(d).

         2.4 CONTINUATIONS AND CONVERSIONS.

         Subject to the terms below, the Borrower shall have the option, on any
Business Day prior to the Maturity Date, to continue existing Eurodollar Loans
for a subsequent Interest Period, to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar
Loans or to convert Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans. By no later than
11:00 a.m. (a) on the date of the requested conversion of a Eurodollar Loan to a
Base Rate Loan and (b) three Business Days prior to the date of the requested
continuation of a Eurodollar Loan or conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a
Eurodollar Loan, the Borrower shall provide telephonic notice to the
Administrative Agent, followed promptly by a written Notice of
Continuation/Conversion in the form of Exhibit 2.4, setting forth whether the
Borrower wishes to continue or convert such Loans. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) except as provided in Section 3.11, Eurodollar Loans
may only be continued or converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may not be continued
nor may Base Rate Loans be converted into Eurodollar Loans during the existence
and continuation of a Default or an Event of Default and (iii) any request to
continue a Eurodollar Loan that fails to comply with the terms hereof or any
failure to request a continuation of a Eurodollar Loan at the end of an Interest
Period shall be deemed a request to convert such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate
Loan on the last day of the applicable Interest Period; provided that any
failure by the Borrower to adequately continue a Eurodollar Loan that is subject
to an Alternative Rate Agreement shall, on the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, be deemed to have been irrevocably requested by the Borrower to
be continued for an Interest Period of like duration (or such shorter duration
if it would exceed the applicable Alternative Rate Period) unless the
Alternative Rate Lender shall have notified the Administrative Agent that the
Alternative Rate Agreement is no longer in effect for such Eurodollar Loan.

         2.5 MINIMUM AMOUNTS.

         Each request for a Loan and each conversion or continuation thereof
shall be subject to the requirements that (a) each Eurodollar Loan shall be in a
minimum amount of $3,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof, (b) each Base Rate Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000 and in
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining amount of
outstanding Revolving Loans), and (c) no more than seven Eurodollar Loans shall
be outstanding hereunder at any one time. For the purposes of this Section 2.5,
separate Eurodollar Loans that begin and end on the same date, as well as
Eurodollar Loans that begin and end on different dates, shall all be considered
as separate Eurodollar Loans.

         2.6 ALTERNATIVE RATE.

         The Borrower may irrevocably request an Alternative Rate Agreement for
all or any portion of a Loan (including continuations thereof during the
Alternative Rate Period) in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof by delivering a Request for Alternative Rate to
the Alternative Rate Lender not later than 10:00 a.m. (a) three Business Days
preceding the first Business Day of a calendar month for a Base Rate Loan, and
(b) five Business Days prior to the first day of the initial Interest Period
during which the Alternative Rate is to apply for a Eurodollar Loan. The
Alternative Rate Lender shall have no obligation to agree to a Request for
Alternative Rate and no Request for Alternative Rate shall be deemed to be
accepted by the Alternative Rate Lender until the Request for Alternative Rate
is accepted in writing by the Alternative Rate Lender. Any Alternative Rate
Agreement will become effective (i) for a Base Rate Loan, on the first Business
Day of a month and (ii) for a Eurodollar Loan, on the first day of the Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Loan within the applicable Alternative Rate Period,
and shall continue in effect, unless earlier terminated as herein provided, for
the Alternative Rate Period applicable thereto.

                                    SECTION 3

                          GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE
                                    TO LOANS

         3.1 INTEREST.

                  (a) Interest Rate. Subject to Sections 3.1(b) and (c), (i) all
         Base Rate Loans shall accrue interest at the Adjusted Base Rate and
         (ii) all Eurodollar Loans shall accrue interest at the Adjusted
         Eurodollar Rate.

                  (b) Default Rate of Interest. After the occurrence, and during
         the continuation, of an Event of Default, the principal of and, to the
         extent permitted by Law, interest on the Loans and any other amounts
         owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including without
         limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand,
         at the Default Rate.

                  (c) Alternative Rate Interest. Upon the written acceptance of
         a Request for Alternative Rate by the Alternative Rate Lender with
         respect to a Loan or any portion thereof (including continuations
         thereof), the Borrower shall pay interest to the Alternative Rate
         Lender for its account on the unpaid principal amount of such Loan or
         relevant portion thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Alternative
         Rate from the effective date of the Alternative Rate Agreement on each
         Interest Payment Date occurring prior to the end of (and including the
         last day of) the Alternative Rate Period for such Loan or earlier
         termination of the Alternative Rate pursuant to the terms of the
         Alternative Rate Agreement or this Credit Agreement (each such payment
         to be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than
         12:00 noon; provided, however, that each Lender other than the
         Alternative Rate Lender shall continue to receive from the
         Administrative Agent (after its receipt of payment from the Alternative
         Rate Lender as set forth in the immediately following sentence) its Pro
         Rata Share of interest on such Loan determined pursuant to Section
         3.1(a)). The Lenders agree that to the extent that the Borrower pays
         the Alternative Rate on an Interest Payment Date for a Loan or relevant
         portion thereof to the Alternative Rate Lender, the Borrower's
         obligation to pay interest on such Revolving Loan on such Interest
         Payment Date shall have been satisfied and it shall be the
         responsibility of the Alternative Rate Lender to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the other Lenders the interest
         due on such Revolving Loan determined pursuant to Section 3.1(a) on
         such Interest Payment Date. The Borrower and Lenders acknowledge and
         agree that (i) the Alternative Rate Lender may, in its sole discretion,
         at any time upon the occurrence of any event or condition described in
         Section 3.14(b), by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent, terminate the Alternative Rate Agreement and cause the
         Alternative Rate applicable to a Revolving Loan to revert to (A) the
         interest rate otherwise applicable to such Revolving Loan determined
         pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the "Original Rate") or (B) the Default
         Rate if it would then be applicable to such Loan pursuant to Section
         3.1(b), (ii) if, with respect to a Loan as to which an Alternative Rate
         is then applicable, the Lenders (other than the Alternative Rate
         Lender) shall fail to receive the Original Rate or, if applicable, the
         Default Rate for such Loan from the Administrative Agent, the
         Alternative Rate shall automatically revert to the Original Rate or, if
         applicable, the Default Rate for such Loan and the Alternative Rate
         Agreement applicable to such Loan shall, at the discretion of the
         Alternative Rate Lender, terminate and (iii) no Lender shall have any
         right to any payment or performance from the Alternative Rate Lender
         hereunder or otherwise in respect of any Alternative Rate Agreement
         other than as provided in the second sentence of this Section 3.1(c).
         The Borrower and the Lenders further acknowledge and agree that
         notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Default Rate shall
         at any time apply to a Loan as to which an Alternative Rate Agreement
         remains in effect, the Borrower shall be solely responsible for the
         full and timely payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of
         the Lenders (including the Alternative Rate Lender) of the amount by
         which such Default Rate exceeds the Original Rate.

                  (d) Interest Payments. Interest on Loans shall be due and
         payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.

         3.2 PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

                  (a) No Deductions; Place and Time of Payments. All payments to
         be made by the Credit Parties shall be made without condition or
         deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except
         as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Credit
         Parties hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
         account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the
         Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available
         funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The
         Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro
         Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such
         payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's
         Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after
         2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day
         and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

                  (b) Payment Dates. Subject to the definition of "Interest
         Period," if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a
         day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
         following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected
         in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

                  (c) Advances by Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower, the
         Alternative Rate Lender or any Lender has notified the Administrative
         Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to
         the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower, the Alternative
         Rate Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
         payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower, the
         Alternative Rate Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely
         made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in
         reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person
         entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in
         fact made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars and in immediately
         available funds, then:

                           (i) if the Borrower or Alternative Rate Lender failed
                  to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand
                  repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed
                  payment that was made available to such Lender in Dollars and
                  in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon
                  in respect of each day from and including the date such amount
                  was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender
                  to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent
                  in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from
                  time to time in effect; and

                           (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
                  Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative
                  Agent the amount thereof in Dollars and in immediately
                  available funds, together with interest thereon for the period
                  from the date such amount was made available by the
                  Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount
                  is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation
                  Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
                  from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount
                  to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute
                  such Lender's Revolving Loan included in the applicable
                  Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
                  upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the
                  Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
                  Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the
                  Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the
                  Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of
                  interest applicable to such Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be
                  deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill
                  its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
                  Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any
                  Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
         respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be
         conclusive, absent manifest error.


                                       32

                  (d) Several Obligations. The obligations of the Lenders
         hereunder to make Loans and to fund or purchase Participation Interest
         are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan
         or to fund or purchase any Participation Interest on any date required
         hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
         obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible
         for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or fund its
         Participation Interest.

                  (e) Funding Offices. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
         obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular
         place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it
         has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular
         place or manner.

         3.3 PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right
         to prepay the Loans in whole or in part from time to time without
         premium or penalty; provided, however, that (i) all prepayments under
         this Section 3.3(a) shall be subject to Section 3.14, (ii) Eurodollar
         Loans may only be prepaid on three Business Days' prior written notice
         to the Administrative Agent, (iii) each such partial prepayment of
         Eurodollar Loans shall be in the minimum principal amount of $1,000,000
         and integral multiples of $500,000 and (iv) each such partial
         prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in the minimum principal amount
         of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 or, in the case of
         clauses (iii) and (iv), if less than such minimum amounts, the entire
         principal amount thereof then outstanding. Amounts prepaid pursuant to
         this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect based on
         the Lenders' Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, if the Borrower fails
         to specify, such prepayment shall be applied by the Administrative
         Agent, subject to Section 3.7, in such manner as it deems reasonably
         appropriate.

                  (b) Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i) Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time (A)
                  the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
                  outstanding plus the aggregate principal amount of L/C
                  Obligations outstanding exceeds the Revolving Committed Amount
                  or (B) the aggregate principal amount of L/C Obligations
                  outstanding exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the
                  Borrower shall immediately make a principal payment to the
                  Administrative Agent and/or Cash Collateralize outstanding L/C
                  Obligations in a manner and in an amount to be in compliance
                  with Sections 2.1 and 2.2, as applicable, and as directed by
                  the Administrative Agent (any such prepayment with respect to
                  clause (A) above to be applied as set forth in Section 3.3(c)
                  below).

                           (ii) Asset Disposition. Immediately upon receipt by a
                  Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from any
                  Asset Disposition, the Borrower shall forward an amount equal
                  to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Disposition to
                  the Administrative Agent (all such prepayments to be applied
                  as set forth in Section 3.3(c) below); provided, however, the
                  Borrower shall not be required to forward such Net Cash
                  Proceeds to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds are reinvested
                  in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(g).

                           (iii) Equity Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by a
                  Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from any
                  Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall forward an amount equal to
                  50% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance to the
                  Administrative Agent (all such prepayments to be applied as
                  set forth in Section 3.3(c) below).

                           (iv) Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by a
                  Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from any
                  Debt Issuance, the Borrower shall forward an amount equal to
                  100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance to the
                  Administrative Agent (all such prepayments to be applied as
                  set forth in Section 3.3(c) below).

                           (v) Service Agreement Buy-Outs of Litigating ORAL
                  Affiliated Practices. Immediately upon receipt by a Credit
                  Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from any Service



                                       33
<PAGE>

                  Agreement Buy-Out with respect to a Litigating ORAL Affiliated
                  Practice, the Borrower shall forward an amount equal to 35% of
                  all cash proceeds of any such Service Agreement Buy-Out when
                  received (whether received at the time of any buy-out or
                  settlement or subsequently in connection with any sale,
                  disposition or payment under any promissory note, instrument
                  or other non-cash consideration) to the Administrative Agent
                  (all such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section
                  3.3(c)).

                  (c) Application of Prepayments. All amounts required to be
         prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(A) shall be applied first to
         Revolving Loans and second to Cash Collateralize outstanding L/C
         Obligations. All amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to Sections
         3.3(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall be applied first to Principal
         Amortization Payments in inverse order of maturity, second to Revolving
         Loans and third to Cash Collateralize outstanding L/C Obligations.
         Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments
         shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and second to Eurodollar
         Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments
         pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall be subject to Section 3.14 and shall
         be accompanied by the interest on the principal amount prepaid through
         the date of prepayment.

         3.4 FEES.

                  (a) Commitment Fees. In consideration of the Revolving
         Committed Amount being made available by the Lenders hereunder, the
         Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the pro rata
         benefit of each Revolving Lender based on its Pro Rata Share of the
         Revolving Committed Amount, a per annum fee equal to the daily average
         sum of the Applicable Percentage for Commitment Fees for each day
         during the period of determination multiplied by the Unused Revolving
         Commitment for each such day (the "Commitment Fees"). The Commitment
         Fees shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall be due and
         payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of
         the Borrower (as well as on the Maturity Date and on any date that the
         Revolving Committed Amount is reduced) for the fiscal quarter (or
         portion thereof) then ending, beginning with the first of such dates to
         occur after the Closing Date.

                  (b) L/C Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
         Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its
         Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Committed Amount a fee for each
         outstanding Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Percentage for L/C
         Fees times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
         Letter of Credit (the "L/C Fees"). The L/C Fees shall be computed on a
         quarterly basis in arrears and shall be due and payable on the last
         Business Day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower (as well as on the
         Letter of Credit Expiration Date) for the fiscal quarter (or portion
         thereof) then ending, beginning with the first of such dates to occur
         after the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

                  (c) Administrative Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent, for its own account, an annual fee as agreed to
         between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (the "Administrative
         Fees") in the Fee Letter.

         3.5 PAYMENT IN FULL AT MATURITY.

         On the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal balance of all
Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all fees and other sums
owing under the Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all Credit
Party Obligations shall be due and payable in full, unless accelerated sooner
pursuant to Section 9.2; provided that if the Maturity Date is not a Business
Day, then such principal, interest, fees and other sums shall be due and payable
in full on the next preceding Business Day.

         3.6 COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES.

                  (a) Calculation of Interest. Except for Base Rate Loans that
         are based upon the Prime Rate, in which case interest shall be computed
         on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or


                                       34
<PAGE>

         366 days, as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees
         hereunder (including calculation of the Alternative Rate) shall be made
         on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
         days. Interest shall accrue from and including the Closing Date or from
         the first date of Borrowing (or from any continuation or conversion
         thereof) to but excluding the last day occurring in the period for
         which such interest is payable.

                  (b) Usury. It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit
         Parties to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable
         usury Law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the
         Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of
         this subsection which shall override and control all such agreements,
         whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral.
         In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited
         to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Credit Party
         Obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for,
         charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or
         otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under
         applicable Law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit
         Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in
         excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall
         be subject to the provisions of this subsection and such documents
         shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount
         permitted under applicable Law, without the necessity of execution of
         any amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive
         anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under
         applicable Law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess
         of the maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which
         would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied
         to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to
         the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor
         thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been
         excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right
         to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by
         any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to accelerate
         the payment of any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date
         of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any
         unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or
         agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to
         the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized, prorated,
         allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any
         renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on
         account of the Loans does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount
         permitted by applicable Law.

         3.7 PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, each Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan, each L/C Credit
Extension, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Term Loan, each
payment of interest (other than with respect to the Alternative Rate Lender),
each payment of fees (other than administrative fees paid to the Administrative
Agent and fronting, documentary and processing fees paid to the L/C Issuer),
each conversion or continuation of any Loans and each reduction in the Revolving
Committed Amount, shall be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided that, if any Lender shall have
failed to pay its Pro Rata Share of any Loan or purchase or fund its
Participation Interest, then any amount to which such Lender would otherwise be
entitled pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall instead be payable to the
Administrative Agent until the share of such Loan or such Participation Interest
not purchased or funded by such Lender has been repaid. In the event any
principal, interest, fee or other amount paid to any Lender pursuant to this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the Administrative Agent, (a) such principal, interest, fee or other
amount that had been satisfied by such payment shall be revived, reinstated and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not occurred and (b)
such Lender shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, repay to the
Administrative Agent the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the
period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Administrative
Agent until the date the Administrative Agent receives such repayment at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate if repaid within two (2) Business Days
after such request and thereafter the Base Rate.

         3.8 SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, except to the extent otherwise
provided herein, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of
any Revolving Loan, any Term Loan, any L/C Obligations or any other obligation
owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right
of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from,
or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable
Debtor Relief Law or other similar Law or otherwise, or by any other means, in
excess of its Pro Rata Share of such payment as provided for in this Credit
Agreement, such Lender shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the other
Lenders a participation in such Loans, L/C Obligations and other obligations in
such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be
equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with
their Pro Rata Shares. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if
payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of
setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be
rescinded or must otherwise be returned, each Lender which shall have shared the
benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a
participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with
its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender
whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise returned. The Borrower
agrees that (a) any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all rights of payment, including
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, L/C Obligations or other
obligation in the amount of such participation and (b) the Credit Party
Obligations that have been satisfied by a payment that has been rescinded or
otherwise returned shall be revived, reinstated and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment had not occurred. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent
shall fail to remit to any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent to such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on
the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with
interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date
such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable Debtor Relief
Law or other similar Law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a
setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent
practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the
benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         3.9 CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         If any Lender reasonably determines that the introduction after the
Closing Date of any Law, rule or regulation or other Requirement of Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital or assets of
such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such
Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with
respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then
from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for any such reduction actually incurred.

         3.10 EURODOLLAR PROVISIONS.

         If the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) in connection with any
request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that
(a) deposits in Dollars are not being offered to banks in the applicable
offshore interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such
Eurodollar Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for
such Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke
any pending Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion with
respect to Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted
such request into a request for a


                                       36
<PAGE>

Borrowing of or, to the extent permitted hereunder, conversion into a Base Rate
Loan in the amount specified therein.

         3.11 ILLEGALITY.

         If any Lender reasonably determines that any Requirement of Law has
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or
fund Eurodollar Loans in Dollars, or materially restricts the authority of such
Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable
interbank market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand to the Borrower from
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the
last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may
not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay interest on the amount so
prepaid or converted, together with any amounts due with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 3.14.

         3.12 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW; RESERVES ON EURODOLLAR LOANS.

                  (a) Changes in Law. If any Lender reasonably determines that
         as a result of the introduction of or any change in, or in the
         interpretation of, any Requirement of Law, or such Lender's compliance
         therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
         agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, or
         a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in
         connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this
         Section 3.12 any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting
         from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.13 shall govern)
         and (ii) reserve requirements contemplated by subsection (b) below),
         then from time to time, upon demand of such Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
         additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
         cost or reduction in yield.

                  (b) Reserves. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender (to the
         extent such Lender has not otherwise been compensated therefor
         hereunder), as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain
         reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
         including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
         "eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid
         principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan equal to the actual costs of
         such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by
         such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive
         absent demonstrable error), which shall be due and payable on each date
         on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided that the Borrower
         shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If
         a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest
         Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days
         from receipt of such notice.

         3.13 TAXES.

                  (a) Payment of Taxes. Any and all payments by a Credit Party
         to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under
         any Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without
         deduction for any and all present or future income, stamp or other
         taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
         withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect
         thereto, but excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent and
         each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and
         franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the
         jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of
         which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
         organized or maintains its Lending Office (all such non-excluded
         present or future income, stamp or other taxes,


                                       37
<PAGE>

         duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
         similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
         "Taxes"). If a Credit Party shall be required by any Requirement of Law
         to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any
         Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum
         payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
         required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
         payable under this Section 3.13(a)), the Administrative Agent or such
         Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it
         would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit
         Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the
         full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
         Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of
         Law, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such
         Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall
         forward the same to such Lender, if applicable) the original or a
         certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, to the extent
         such receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment
         thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (b) Additional Taxes. In addition, each Credit Party agrees to
         pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and
         any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which
         arise from any payment made under any Credit Document or from the
         execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or
         otherwise with respect to, any Credit Document (hereinafter referred to
         as "Other Taxes").

                  (c) No Deduction for Taxes. If a Credit Party shall be
         required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect
         of any sum payable under any Credit Document to the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender, such Credit Party shall also pay to the
         Administrative Agent (for the account of such Lender) or to such
         Lender, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such
         Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after
         factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net
         income) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes
         had not been imposed.

                  (d) Indemnification. Each Credit Party agrees to indemnify the
         Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes
         and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted
         by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.13(d)) paid
         by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, and (ii) any liability
         (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
         respect thereto.

                  (e) Exemption from Taxes. In the case of any payment hereunder
         or under any other Credit Document by or on behalf of a Credit Party
         through an account or branch outside the United States, or on behalf of
         a Credit Party by a payor that is not a United States person, if such
         Credit Party determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof,
         such Credit Party shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish,
         to the Administrative Agent, an opinion of counsel reasonably
         acceptable to the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is
         exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (e), the terms
         "United States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings
         specified in Section 7701 of the Code.

                  (f) Foreign Lenders. Each Lender that is a foreign
         corporation, foreign partnership or foreign trust within the meaning of
         the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of
         any payment subject to withholding under the Code, two duly signed
         completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
         (relating to such Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or
         reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Lender
         by the Credit Parties pursuant to this Credit Agreement), as
         appropriate, or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to
         all payments to be made to such Lender by a Credit Party pursuant to
         this Credit Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Lender is entitled to
         an exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax.
         Thereafter and from time to time, each such Lender shall (i) promptly
         submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and
         signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be
         adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing
         authorities), as appropriate, as may reasonably be requested by the
         Borrower or the Administrative Agent and then be available under then
         current United States Laws and regulations to avoid,


                                       38
<PAGE>


         or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of,
         United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made
         to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement, (ii)
         promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances
         which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
         reduction, and (iii) take such steps as shall not be materially
         disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and
         as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its
         Lending Office) to avoid any Requirement of Law that the Credit Parties
         make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to
         such Lender. If the forms or other evidence provided by such Lender at
         the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Credit Agreement
         indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of
         zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from
         Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms
         certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at
         such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for
         periods governed by such forms; provided, however, that, if at the date
         of any assignment pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this
         Credit Agreement, the assignor Lender was entitled to payments under
         Section 3.13(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with
         respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term
         Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be
         imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes)
         United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the
         assignee Lender on such date. If such Lender fails to deliver the above
         forms or other evidence, then the Administrative Agent may withhold
         from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equal to the
         applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the
         Code, without reduction. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
         Administrative Agent did not properly withhold any tax or other amount
         from payments made in respect of such Lender, such Lender shall
         indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties
         and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
         payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section 3.13(f), and
         costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal
         counsel) of the Administrative Agent. For any period with respect to
         which a Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with the above forms
         or other evidence (other than if such failure is due to a change in the
         applicable Law, or in the interpretation or application thereof,
         occurring after the date on which such form or other evidence
         originally was required to be provided or if such form or other
         evidence otherwise is not required), such Lender shall not be entitled
         to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of this Section 3.13
         with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such
         failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to
         Taxes because of its failure to deliver such form or other evidence
         required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender
         shall reasonably request to assist such Lender in recovering such
         Taxes. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section 3.13(f) shall
         survive the payment of all Credit Party Obligations and the resignation
         or replacement of the Administrative Agent.

                  (g) Reimbursement. In the event that an additional payment is
         made under Section 3.13(a) or (c) for the account of any Lender and
         such Lender, in its reasonable judgment, determines that it has finally
         and irrevocably received or been granted a credit against or release or
         remission for, or repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in
         respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding
         giving rise to such payment, such Lender shall, to the extent that it
         determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the
         amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the
         Borrower such amount as such Lender shall, in its reasonable judgment,
         have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and
         which will leave such Lender (after such payment) in no worse position
         than it would have been in if the Borrower had not been required to
         make such deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall
         interfere with the right of a Lender to arrange its tax affairs in
         whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender to claim any tax
         credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or
         any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender to do
         anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other
         credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.

         3.14 COMPENSATION / ALTERNATIVE RATE BREAKAGE AMOUNT.

         (a) Eurodollar Loans. Upon the written demand of any Lender, the Credit
Parties shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless
from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

                  (i) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any
         Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period
         for such Eurodollar Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
         reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or

                  (ii) any failure by a Borrower (for a reason other than the
         failure of such Lender to make a Eurodollar Loan) to prepay, borrow,
         continue or convert any Eurodollar Loan on the date or in the amount
         previously requested by such Borrower.

The amount each such Lender shall be compensated pursuant to this Section
3.14(a) shall include, without limitation, (A) any loss incurred by such Lender
in connection with the re-employment of funds prepaid, repaid, not borrowed or
paid, as the case may be, (B) any foreign exchange loss and (C) any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) incurred and reasonably attributable thereto.

         For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the
Lenders under this Section 3.14(a), (A) each Lender shall be deemed to have
funded each Eurodollar Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore interbank market
for Dollars for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not
such Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded and (B) each Lender shall calculate
such amounts in a manner that is customary for such Lender with respect to other
borrowers of such Lender.

         (b) Alternative Rate Breakage Costs. Upon demand of the Alternative
Rate Lender from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate the
Alternative Rate Lender for and hold the Alternative Rate Lender harmless from
any Alternative Rate Breakage Amount incurred by it as a result of any of the
following, whether such events or failures are voluntary by the Borrower or are
mandatory, involuntary or automatic occurrences pursuant to the terms of this
Credit Agreement or otherwise:

                  (i) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any
         Loan (or portion thereof) during an Alternative Rate Period applicable
         to such Loan other than continuation to successive Interest Periods as
         permitted hereunder;

                  (ii) any failure to consummate an Alternative Rate Agreement,
         or to borrow the Loan described in the Alternative Rate Agreement, on
         the date notified by Borrower;

                  (iii) any Loan (or portion thereof) as to which an Alternative
         Rate Agreement is in effect not being continued to successive Interest
         Periods of like duration during the applicable Alternative Rate Period;

                  (iv) the occurrence of any event or condition described in
         Sections 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 which causes a change in, or
         suspension or termination of, the Original Rate otherwise applicable to
         any Loan subject to an Alternative Rate Agreement; or

                  (v) the occurrence of any Event of Default which shall not
         have been waived.

         3.15 DETERMINATION AND SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS.

                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1 GUARANTY OF PAYMENT.

         Subject to Section 4.7 below, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly
and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Lender, each Affiliate of a
Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement and the Administrative Agent the
prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) and
the timely performance of all other obligations under the Credit Documents and
such Hedging Agreements. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection and is a continuing guaranty and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

         4.2 OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or the Hedging Agreements, or any
other agreement or instrument referred to therein, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty may be enforced by
the Lenders without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any
other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having
recourse to the Revolving Notes, the Term Notes or any other of the Credit
Documents or any collateral, if any, hereafter securing the Credit Party
Obligations or otherwise and each Guarantor hereby waives the right to require
the Lenders to proceed against the Borrower or any other Person (including a
co-guarantor) or to require the Lenders to pursue any other remedy or enforce
any other right. Each Guarantor further agrees that it shall have no right of
subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor of the Credit Party Obligations for amounts paid under this
Guaranty until such time as the Lenders (and any Affiliates of Lenders entering
into Hedging Agreements) have been paid in full and all Commitments under the
Credit Agreement have been terminated. Each Guarantor further agrees that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
from exercising remedies hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents or
any of the Hedging Agreements, or foreclosing their security interest in or Lien
on the Collateral securing the Credit Party Obligations, or from exercising any
other rights available to them under this Credit Agreement, the Revolving Notes,
the Term Notes, any other of the Credit Documents, or any other instrument of
security, if any, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the
completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of
any Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it being the purpose and intent of each
Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and
unconditional under any and all circumstances. Neither any Guarantor's
obligations under this Guaranty nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall
be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an
impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of the
Borrower or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Borrower. Each
Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or
accrual of any of the Credit Party Obligations and notice of or proof of
reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guaranty or
acceptance of this Guaranty. The Credit Party Obligations, and any of them,
shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or
renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guaranty. All
dealings between the Borrower and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be
conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this
Guaranty. The Guarantors further agree to all rights of set-off as set forth in
Section 11.2 and agree that their obligations are secured pursuant to the
Collateral Documents.


                                       41
<PAGE>


         4.3 MODIFICATIONS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that (a) all or any part of the Collateral, if
any, now or hereafter held for the Credit Party Obligations, may be exchanged,
compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) the Lenders shall not have any
obligation to protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security interests,
Liens or encumbrances now or hereafter held, if any, for the Credit Party
Obligations or the Properties subject thereto; (c) the time or place of payment
of the Credit Party Obligations may be changed or extended, in whole or in part,
to a time certain or otherwise, and may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or
in part; (d) the Borrower and any other party liable for payment under the
Credit Documents may be granted indulgences generally; (e) any of the provisions
of the Revolving Notes, the Term Notes or any of the other Credit Documents may
be modified, amended or waived; (f) any party (including any co-guarantor)
liable for the payment thereof may be granted indulgences or be released; and
(g) any deposit balance for the credit of the Borrower or any other party liable
for the payment of the Credit Party Obligations or liable upon any security
therefor may be released, in whole or in part, at, before or after the stated,
extended or accelerated maturity of the Credit Party Obligations, all without
notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon,
notwithstanding any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal,
acceleration, modification, indulgence or release.

         4.4 WAIVER OF RIGHTS.

         Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders and of all Revolving Loans and Term Loans made to the
Borrower by the Lenders; (b) presentment and demand for payment or performance
of any of the Credit Party Obligations; (c) protest and notice of dishonor or of
default (except as specifically required in the Credit Agreement) with respect
to the Credit Party Obligations or with respect to any security therefor; (d)
notice of the Lenders obtaining, amending, substituting for, releasing, waiving
or modifying any security interest, Lien or encumbrance, if any, hereafter
securing the Credit Party Obligations, or the Lenders' subordinating,
compromising, discharging or releasing such security interests, Liens or
encumbrances, if any; and (e) all other notices to which such Guarantor might
otherwise be entitled.

         4.5 REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred
by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Law.

         4.6 REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand,
and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit
Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in
Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in
the circumstances provided in Section 9.2) notwithstanding any stay, injunction
or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing such Credit
Party Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any
other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or such Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors.

         4.7 LIMITATION OF GUARANTY.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any of the other Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of any
Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason
(including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal Law
relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible
under applicable Law (whether federal or state or otherwise and including,
without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).

         4.8 RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Credit Parties agree among themselves that, in connection with
payments made hereunder, each Credit Party shall have contribution rights
against the other Credit Parties as permitted under applicable Law. Such
contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the
obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Documents and no Credit Party
shall exercise such rights of contribution until all Credit Party Obligations
have been paid in full and the Commitments terminated.

                                    SECTION 5

         To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Credit
Agreement and to induce the Lenders to provide the Credit Extensions, each of
the Credit Parties represents and warrants to the Agents and the Lenders as
follows:

         6.1 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION AND POWER.

         Each of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries (other than any De
Minimis Subsidiary) (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has
the full corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the
Credit Documents to which it is or will be a party, to own and hold its property
and to engage in its business as presently conducted, and (c) is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership of its properties
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be in good standing
or to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.2 AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY.

         Each of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries has taken all
necessary corporate action to execute, deliver and perform each of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and has validly executed and delivered each of
the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each of the Credit Documents

accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by
principles of good faith and fair dealing. To ensure the legality, validity,
enforceability or admissibility in evidence of each such Credit Document in such
jurisdiction, it is not necessary that any such Credit Document or any other
document be filed or recorded with any court or other authority of such

encumbrance that restricts or limits its ability to make dividend payments or
other distributions in respect of its Capital Stock, to repay Indebtedness owed
to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, to make loans or advances to the
Borrower or any other Subsidiary, or to transfer any of its assets or properties
to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, in each case other than such

         6.4 GOVERNMENTAL AND THIRD-PARTY AUTHORIZATION; PERMITS.

                  (a) Consents. No consent, approval, authorization or other

                  (b) Permits/Licenses. Each of the Credit Parties and their
         Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Credit Parties, each
         Affiliated Practice, has, and is in good standing with respect to, all
         governmental approvals, permits and other Licenses and (to the extent
         applicable) all Reimbursement Approvals necessary to conduct its
         business as presently conducted and to own or lease and operate its
         properties, except for those the failure to obtain which would not be
         reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
         Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Credit
         Parties, threatened Limitation of any such approval, permit or other
         License or Reimbursement Approval of any Credit Party or any Subsidiary

         its business. To the knowledge of the Credit Parties, no Affiliated
         Practice is required to have entered into any Medicare provider
         agreement for the operation of its business. To the knowledge of the
         Credit Parties, each Affiliated Practice that participates in Medicaid
         is in good standing with respect to such participation and its provider
         agreement is in full force and effect.

         6.5 LITIGATION.

         furnished to the Administrative Agent copies of (i) the audited
         consolidated balance sheets of the Credit Parties and their
         Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related
         statements of income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the
         fiscal years then ended, together with the opinion of Ernst & Young LLP
         thereon, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
         Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2002, and the
         related statements of income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for
         the nine-month period then ended. Such financial statements have been
         prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject, with respect to the
         unaudited financial statements, to the absence of footnotes required by
         GAAP and to normal year-end adjustments) and present fairly the
         financial condition of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries on a
         consolidated basis as of the respective dates thereof and the
         consolidated results of operations of the Credit Parties and their
         Subsidiaries for the respective periods then ended. Except as fully
         reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to above and
         the footnotes thereto, there are no material liabilities or obligations
         with respect to the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries of any nature

         the transactions contemplated by this Credit Agreement, the initial
         extensions of credit hereunder, and the payment of transaction fees and
         expenses related to the foregoing (the "Projections"). In the opinion
         of management of the Borrower, the assumptions used in the preparation
         of the Projections were fair and reasonable when made and continue to
         be fair and reasonable as of the date hereof. The Projections have been
         prepared in good faith by the executive and financial personnel of the
         Borrower and represent a reasonable estimate of the future performance
         and financial condition of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries,

         projections.

                  (c) Ongoing Financial Statements. The financial statements

         of any proposed Acquisition with respect to which the Acquisition
         Amount equals or exceeds either $2,500,000 (to the extent paid or
         payable in cash) or $5,000,000 (regardless of the form of
         consideration), the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative

                  each Person or business that is the subject of such

                           (ii) historical financial statements of the Target

                  fiscal years available and, if available, for any interim
                  periods since the most recent fiscal year-end;


                                       58

                           (iii) consolidated projected income statements of the
                  Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries (giving effect to such
                  Acquisition and the consolidation with the Credit Party of
                  each relevant Target) for the period from the consummation of
                  such Acquisition until the Maturity Date, in each case in
                  reasonable detail, together with any appropriate statement of
                  assumptions and pro forma adjustments; and

                  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by a
                  Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth the
                  Acquisition Amount and further to the effect that, to the best
                  of such Financial Officer's knowledge, (A) the consummation of
                  such Acquisition will not result in a violation of any
                  provision of this Section 7.9, and after giving effect to such
                  Acquisition and any Borrowings made in connection therewith,
                  the Credit Parties will be in compliance with the financial
                  covenants contained in Section 8.14, such compliance
                  determined with regard to calculations made on a Pro Forma
                  Basis in accordance with GAAP as if each Target had been
                  consolidated with a Credit Party for those periods applicable
                  to such covenants (such calculations to be attached to the
                  certificate), (B) the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries
                  will continue to comply with the financial covenants contained
                  in Section 8.14 for a period of one year following the date of
                  the consummation of such Acquisition, and (C) after giving
                  effect to such Acquisition and any Borrowings in connection
                  therewith, the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries will have
                  sufficient funds available to meet its ongoing working capital
                  requirements.

                  (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the consummation
         of any Permitted Acquisition, if requested by the Administrative Agent,
         the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a
         copy of the fully executed acquisition agreement (including schedules
         and exhibits thereto) and other material documents and closing papers
         delivered in connection therewith.

                  (d) The consummation of each Permitted Acquisition shall be
         deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrower that (except
         as shall have been approved in writing by the Required Lenders) all
         conditions thereto set forth in this Section and in the description
         furnished under clause (i) of subsection (b) above (if applicable) have
         been satisfied, that the same is permitted in accordance with the terms
         of this Credit Agreement, and that the matters certified to by the
         Financial Officer of the Borrower in the certificate referred to in
         clause (iv) of subsection (b) above (if applicable) are, to the best of
         such Financial Officer's knowledge, true and correct in all material
         respects as of the date such certificate is given, which representation
         and warranty shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty as of
         the date thereof for all purposes hereunder, including, without
         limitation, for purposes of Sections 5.2 and 9.1.

         7.10 CREATION OR ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES.

         Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.9 and 8.5, the Credit Parties
or their Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may from time to time create or acquire new
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries in connection with Permitted Acquisitions or
otherwise, provided that:

                  (a) Concurrently with (and in any event within ten Business
         Days thereafter) the creation or acquisition by any Credit Party of any
         new Domestic Subsidiary (other than a De Minimis Subsidiary), (i) such
         Credit Party will cause such Domestic Subsidiary to execute and deliver
         to the Collateral Agent a Joinder Agreement, pursuant to which such new
         Domestic Subsidiary shall become a party hereto and shall guarantee the
         payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations under this Credit
         Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (ii) such Credit Party and/or
         any applicable Subsidiary will execute and deliver to the Collateral
         Agent a Pledge and Security Agreement or an amendment or supplement to
         an existing Pledge and Security Agreement pursuant to which all of the
         Capital Stock of such new Domestic Subsidiary shall be pledged to the
         Collateral Agent, together with the certificates evidencing such
         Capital Stock and undated stock powers duly executed in blank and (iii)
         such Credit Party or applicable Subsidiary will execute and deliver
         Intercompany Notes, as appropriate, and such Intercompany Notes shall
         be delivered to the


                                       59
<PAGE>

         Collateral Agent, together with duly executed allonges in form and
         substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

                  (b) Concurrently with (and in any event within ten Business
         Days thereafter) the creation or direct or indirect acquisition by any
         Credit Party of any new first-tier Foreign Subsidiary (other than a De
         Minimis Subsidiary), such Credit Party will execute and deliver to the
         Collateral Agent a Pledge and Security Agreement or an amendment or
         supplement to an existing Pledge and Security Agreement pursuant to
         which all of the Capital Stock of such new Foreign Subsidiary shall be
         pledged to the Collateral Agent, together with the certificates
         evidencing such Capital Stock and undated stock powers duly executed in
         blank (or such other documents, instruments and other evidence as the
         Collateral Agent shall require in order to perfect its security
         interest (or the equivalent thereof under applicable Law of the
         relevant foreign jurisdiction) in such Capital Stock); provided that no
         more than 65% of the Capital Stock of any Foreign Subsidiary shall be
         required to be pledged to the Collateral Agent if the pledge of more
         than 65% thereof would, in the good faith judgment of the Borrower,
         result in adverse tax consequences to the Borrower or would be unlawful
         for such Foreign Subsidiary.

                  (c) As promptly as reasonably possible, the Credit Parties and
         their Subsidiaries will deliver any such other documents, certificates
         and opinions (including opinions of local counsel in the jurisdiction
         of organization of each such new Subsidiary, including any new Foreign
         Subsidiary, if applicable and requested), in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as the
         Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection therewith and
         will take such other action as either Agent may reasonably request to
         create in favor of the Collateral Agent a perfected security interest
         in the Collateral being pledged pursuant to the documents described
         above. Nothing contained in this Section, however, shall be deemed to
         permit the creation or acquisition by any Credit Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of any Subsidiary not expressly
         permitted under Section 8.5.

         7.11 USE OF PROCEEDS.

obligations), contingent or otherwise, of the Credit Parties and their
Subsidiaries.

         7.12 FURTHER ASSURANCES.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make, execute, endorse, acknowledge and deliver any amendments,
modifications or supplements hereto and restatements hereof and any other
agreements, instruments or documents, and take any and all such other actions,
as may from time to time be reasonably requested by either Agent or the Required
Lenders to perfect and maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the
Liens granted pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement and to effect,
confirm or further assure or protect and preserve the interests, rights and
remedies of the Agents and the Lenders under this Credit Agreement and the other
Credit Documents.

                  (a) If at any time (i) the aggregate book value of all assets
         of the De Minimis Subsidiaries shall exceed $1,000,000 or (ii) the
         aggregate annual revenues of the De Minimis Subsidiaries shall exceed
         $500,000 (which such revenues, in the case of a newly acquired or
         formed Subsidiary, shall be calculated (x) on an annualized basis as of
         the end of each of the first three complete fiscal quarters following
         the acquisition or formation of such Subsidiary and (y) thereafter on a
         rolling four fiscal quarter basis as of the end of each fiscal
         quarter), the Credit Parties will, as promptly as reasonably possible

<PAGE>

         within thirty (30) days thereafter (or such longer period of times
         agreed to by the Administrative Agent), take any or all of the
         following actions to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess: (A)
         cause one or more De Minimis Subsidiaries to transfer assets to one or
         more Guarantors, (B) merge one or more De Minimis Subsidiaries with and
         into one or more Guarantors, or (C) cause one or more De Minimis
         Subsidiaries to become Guarantors in accordance with Section 7.10.

                  (b) If at any time a Domestic Subsidiary that at one time met
         the conditions to satisfy the definition to be a De Minimis Subsidiary
         no longer meets such conditions, the Credit Parties and such Domestic
         Subsidiary shall comply with the terms of Section 7.10 as if it was a
         newly acquired Subsidiary.

                                    SECTION 8

         9.1 EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         An event of default shall exist upon the occurrence, and during the

                  through 8.14, inclusive.

                           (ii) Any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
                  shall fail to observe, perform or comply with any condition,
                  covenant or agreement contained in this Credit Agreement or
                  any of the other Credit Documents other than those enumerated
                  in subsections (a) and (b)(i) above, and such failure shall
                  continue unremedied for any grace period specifically
                  applicable thereto or, if no such grace period is applicable,
                  for a period of (A) five days in the case of the covenants set
                  forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than 7.2(e)(i)) and (B)
                  thirty days in all other instances, in each case under clauses
                  (A) and (B) above after the earlier of (x) the date on which a
                  Responsible Officer of the Credit Party or such Subsidiary
                  acquires or should have acquired knowledge thereof and (y) the
                  date on which written notice thereof is delivered by the
                  Administrative Agent or any Lender to the Borrower.

                  (c) Representations. Any representation or warranty made or
         deemed made by or on behalf of any Credit Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries in this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit
         Documents or in any certificate, instrument, report or other document
         furnished in connection herewith or therewith or in


                                       68
<PAGE>

         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall
         prove to have been false or misleading in any material respect as of
         the time made, deemed made or furnished.

         instrument evidencing or relating to any such Indebtedness, or any
         other event shall occur or condition exist in respect thereof, and the
         effect of such failure, event or condition is to cause, or permit, the
         holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on its or
         their behalf) to cause (with the giving of notice, lapse of time, or
         both), such Indebtedness to become due, or to be prepaid, redeemed,
         purchased or defeased, prior to its stated maturity.

                  (e) Voluntary Bankruptcy. Any Credit Party or any of its

         debts as they become due, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit
         of creditors or (vi) take any corporate action to authorize or approve
         any of the foregoing.

                  (f) Involuntary Bankruptcy. Any involuntary petition or case
         shall be filed or commenced against any Credit Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries (other than a De Minimis Subsidiary) seeking liquidation,
         winding-up, reorganization, dissolution, arrangement, readjustment of
         debts, the appointment of a custodian, trustee, receiver or similar
         official for it or all or a substantial part of its Properties or any
         other relief under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other Debtor Relief
         Law hereafter in effect, and such petition or case shall continue
         undismissed and unstayed for a period of sixty days or an order,
         judgment or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be
         entered in any such proceeding.

                  (g) Judgments. Any one or more money judgments, writs or
         warrants of attachment, executions or similar processes involving an
         aggregate amount (exclusive of amounts fully bonded or covered by
         insurance as to which the surety or insurer, as the case may be, has
         acknowledged its liability in writing and that carry a deductible not
         exceeding $10,000 in the aggregate) in excess of $2,500,000 shall be
         entered or filed against any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
         any of their respective Properties and the same shall not be dismissed,

         than five days prior to the date of any proposed sale thereunder.

                  (h) Credit Documents. (i) Any Credit Document shall fail to be
         in full force and effect or any Credit Party shall so assert, (ii) any
         Collateral Document shall for any reason fail to give the Collateral
         Agent a valid and perfected security interest in and Lien upon the
         Collateral purported to be covered thereby, subject to no Liens other
         than Permitted Liens (or any Credit Party shall so assert), in each
         case unless any such failure is due to any act or failure to act on the
         part of the Collateral Agent or any Lender, or (iii) any Guarantor or
         any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor shall deny or
         disaffirm its obligations under the Guaranty.

                  (i) ERISA. Any ERISA Event or any other event or condition

         together with all other ERISA Events and other events or conditions
         then existing, the Credit Parties, their Subsidiaries and the ERISA
         Affiliates have incurred or


                                       69
<PAGE>

         would be reasonably likely to incur liability to any one or more Plans

                  (j) Limitation on Licenses or Reimbursement Approvals. There
         shall occur (i) a Limitation with respect to any one or more Licenses
         or Reimbursement Approvals of any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries
         or any Affiliated Practice, or any other action shall be taken by any
         Governmental Authority or other Person in response to any alleged
         failure by such Credit Party, such Subsidiary or such Affiliated
         Practice to be in compliance with applicable Requirements of Law, and
         such Limitation or other action, individually or in the aggregate, has
         had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
         (ii) any introduction of or change in any Requirement of Law (or in the
         interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority)
         governing or affecting any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
         Affiliated Practice, and such introduction or change, individually or

         contracts to which any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a
         party shall be terminated or shall, for any other reason, fail to be in
         full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and
         such event or condition, together with all other such events or
         conditions, if any, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (l) Casualty Loss. There shall occur (i) any uninsured damage
         to, or loss, theft or destruction of, any Collateral or other

         aggregate fair market value in excess of $2,500,000 or (ii) any labor
         dispute, act of God or other casualty that has had or would be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (m) Change of Control. Any of the following shall occur: (i)
         any Person or group of Persons acting in concert as a partnership or
         other group shall, as a result of a tender or exchange offer, open
         market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, have
         become, after the date hereof, the "beneficial owner" (within the
         meaning of such term under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
         Capital Stock of the Borrower representing 30% or more of the combined
         voting power of the then outstanding Capital Stock of the Borrower
         ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special circumstances)
         having the right to vote in the election of directors or (ii) the Board
         of Directors of the Borrower shall cease to consist of a majority of
         the individuals (A) who constituted the Board of Directors as of the
         Closing Date or (B) who shall have become a member thereof subsequent
         to the Closing Date after having been nominated, or otherwise approved
         in writing, by at least a majority of individuals who constituted the
         Board of Directors of the Borrower as of the Closing Date (or their
         replacements approved as herein required).

         9.2 ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
the Administrative Agent may or, upon the request and direction of the Required
Lenders, shall take the following actions without prejudice to the rights of any
Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against the Credit Parties, except as
otherwise specifically provided for herein:

                  (a) Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments and
         the obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions
         terminated whereupon the Commitments and the obligation of the L/C
         Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b) Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal of and
         any accrued interest in respect of all Loans, all L/C Obligations and
         any and all other Credit Party Obligations of any and every kind owing
         by a Credit Party to any of the Agents or Lenders under the Credit
         Documents to be due, whereupon the same shall be immediately due and
         payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
         kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.



                                       70
<PAGE>

                  (c) Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to Cash Collateralize
         (and the Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or upon the
         occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(e) or (f), it will
         immediately Cash Collateralize) L/C Obligations in respect of
         subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an
         amount equal to the then outstanding principal amount of L/C
         Obligations.

                  (d) Enforcement of Rights. To the extent permitted by Law,
         enforce (and direct the Collateral Agent to enforce) any and all rights
         and interests created and existing under applicable Law and under the
         Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all rights and
         remedies existing under the Collateral Documents, all rights and
         remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of set-off.

                  (e) Alternative Rate Agreements. At any time following the
         occurrence of an Event of Default, the Alternative Rate Lender may, in
         its sole discretion, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent, terminate the Alternative Rate Agreement and cause the
         Alternative Rate applicable to any Loan or any portion thereof to
         revert to the Original Rate or, if applicable, the Default Rate for
         such Loan; it being understood that (i) interest on any unpaid
         Alternative Rate Loan after the last Interest Payment Date to occur
         prior to the Event of Default shall accrue at the Original Rate and
         (ii) the Borrower shall be liable to the Alternative Rate Lender for
         any Alternative Rate Breakage Amount.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section
9.1(e) or (f) shall occur, then the Commitments and any obligation of the L/C
Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate and all
Loans, all L/C Obligations, all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued
and unpaid fees and other Credit Party Obligations owing to the Agents and the
Lenders hereunder shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of
any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which
notice or other action is expressly waived by the Credit Parties.

Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily with the
Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by Law, a
separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor" holding
a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other insolvency statute.

         9.3 ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, all amounts
collected or received by any Agent or any Lender on account of amounts
outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or delivered as
follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal
         counsel) of the Agents, the L/C Issuer, the Alternative Rate Lender or
         any of the Lenders in connection with enforcing the rights of the
         Agents, the Alternative Rate Lender, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders
         under the Credit Documents, ratably among them in proportion to the
         amounts described in this clause "FIRST" payable to them;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agents, the
         Alternative Rate Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, ratably among
         them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause "SECOND"
         payable to them;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all accrued interest payable to the
         Lenders, the Alternative Rate Lender and the L/C Issuer hereunder,
         ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this
         clause "THIRD" payable to them;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Loans and L/C Obligations and to any principal amounts outstanding
         under Hedging Agreements between a Credit Party and a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender, ratably among them in proportion to the amounts
         described in this clause "FOURTH" payable to them;


                                       71
<PAGE>


                  FIFTH, to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the L/C
         Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of the L/C Obligations
         comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit;

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations which shall have
         become due and payable under the Credit Documents and not repaid
         pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above, ratably among the
         holders of such Credit Party Obligations in proportion to the amounts
         described in this clause "SIXTH" payable to them; and

                  SEVENTH, the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

Amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of
Credit pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above shall be applied to satisfy drawings
under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as
cash collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or
expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Credit Party
Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                                   SECTION 10

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         10.1 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF AGENTS.

                  (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
         authorizes each of the Agents to take such action on its behalf under
         the provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document
         and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
         delegated to it by the terms of this Credit Agreement or any other
         Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
         thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
         elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the Agents shall not
         have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
         herein, nor shall the Agents have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
         relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
         functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
         be read into this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or
         otherwise exist against the Agents. Without limiting the generality of
         the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the
         other Credit Documents with reference to either Agent is not intended
         to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
         arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Requirement of Law.
         Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
         intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
         between independent contracting parties.

                  (b) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with
         respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
         associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits
         and immunities (i) provided to the Agents in this Section 10 with
         respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in
         connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued
         by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit
         pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agents"
         as used in this Section 10 and in the definition of "Agent-Related
         Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions,
         and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
         Issuer.

         10.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         Each of the Agents may execute any of its duties under this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other
consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. No
Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct.


                                       72
<PAGE>


         10.3 LIABILITY OF AGENTS.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any
other Credit Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by an Agent under or in
connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for any failure of any Credit
Party or any other party to any Credit Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation
to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.4 RELIANCE BY AGENTS.

                  (a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
         protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
         resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic
         mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by
         it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
         the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal
         counsel (including counsel to any Credit Party), independent
         accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent shall
         be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
         Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
         concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
         so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
         Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
         by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Each
         Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
         from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or
         such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in
         any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act
         pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

                  (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
         specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this Credit
         Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or
         to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder
         to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a
         Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
         such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection
         thereto.

         10.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless such Agent shall
have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this
Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." Each Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. Each of the Agents shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the Required
Lenders in accordance with Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until
such Agent has received any such direction, such Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.

         10.6 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY AGENTS.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by an Agent hereafter taken,
including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the

                                       73
<PAGE>


affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Agents
that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other
regulatory Requirement of Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and made its own decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and to extend
credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

         10.7 INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENTS.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Credit Party to do so), on a pro rata basis, and hold harmless
each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided further, however,
that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders
shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for
purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall
reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any
document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the
Commitments, the payment of all Credit Party Obligations and the resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

         10.8 AGENTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Alternative Rate Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including information
that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Credit Party
or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agents shall be under no obligation
to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America
shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit Agreement as any other
Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Alternative Rate Lender or the
L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

         10.9 SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of
America shall also constitute its resignation as Collateral Agent and as L/C
Issuer and may, at the option of Bank of America, constitute its resignation as
Alternative Rate Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Credit
Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor
Administrative Agent for the Lenders, which successor Administrative Agent shall
be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of
an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If no successor Administrative Agent is appointed prior to
the effective date of the resignation of the retiring Administrative Agent, the
retiring Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and
the Borrower, a successor Administrative Agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor Administrative Agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, the retiring
Collateral Agent, the retiring L/C Issuer and, if applicable, the retiring
Alternative Rate Lender, and the respective terms "Administrative Agent", "L/C
Issuer" and, if applicable, "Alternative Rate Lender", shall mean such successor
Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, and, if applicable, Alternative Rate Lender
and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring Collateral Agent's,
the retiring L/C Issuer's and, if applicable, the retiring Alternative Rate
Lender's rights, powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any
other or further act or deed on the part of the retiring Collateral Agent, the
retiring L/C Issuer and, if applicable, the retiring Alternative Rate Lender, or
any other Lender, other than (a) the obligation of the retiring Collateral Agent
to deliver any Collateral in its possession to the successor Collateral Agent,
(b) the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit in
substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer
to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to
such Letters of Credit and (c) the obligation of the successor Alternative Rate
Lender to enter into Alternative Rate Agreements with the Borrower in
substitution for the Alternative Rate Agreements, if any, existing at the time
of such succession. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as an
Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an
Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor Administrative Agent has
accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above.

         10.10 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise:

                  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Credit Party Obligations that are owing and
         unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
         advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Agents
         (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
         disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Agents and their
         respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and
         the Agents under Sections 3.4 and 11.5) allowed in such judicial
         proceeding; and

                  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the


                                       75
<PAGE>

event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 3.4 and 11.5.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Credit Party Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

         10.11 COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS.

         The Lenders irrevocably authorize each of the Agents, at its option and
in its discretion,

                  (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by
         such Agent under any Credit Document (i) upon termination of the
         Commitments and payment in full of all Credit Party Obligations (other
         than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or
         termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be sold
         as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or under
         any other Credit Document, or (iii) subject to Section 11.6, if
         approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders or
         the Lenders, as applicable;

                  (b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held
         by such Agent under any Credit Document to the holder of any Lien on
         such property that is permitted by Section 8.3; and

                  (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
         Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
         transaction permitted hereunder.

         Upon request by any Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will
confirm in writing such Agent's authority to release or subordinate its interest
in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its
obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 10.11.

         10.12 OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Credit Agreement as a "syndication agent,"
"documentation agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead manager," "arranger,"
"lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Credit Agreement other than, in the
case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting
the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or
be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or
other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement or

                           (i) if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
                  Collateral Agent or the L/C Issuer, to the address, facsimile
                  number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified
                  for such Person on Schedule 11.1 or to such other address,
                  facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number
                  as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the other
                  parties; and

                           (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address,
                  facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number
                  specified in its Administrative Questionnaire or to such other
                  address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or
                  telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a
                  notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
                  Collateral Agent and the L/C Issuer.

         All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given
         or made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant
         party hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when

         to Section 2 shall not be effective until actually received by such
         Person. In no event shall a voicemail message be effective as a notice,
         communication or confirmation hereunder.

                  (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures.
         Credit Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The
         effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to

         manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Credit Parties,
         the Agents and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also require
         that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
         manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure
         to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any
         facsimile document or signature.

                  (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and
         Internet and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine
         communications, such as financial statements and other information as
         provided in Section 7.1 and 7.2, and to distribute Credit Documents for
         execution by the parties thereto, and may not be used for any other
         purpose.

                  (d) Reliance by Agents and Lenders. The Agents and the Lenders
         shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including
         telephonic Notices of Borrowing) purportedly given by or on behalf of
         the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner
         specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by
         any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof,
         as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.
         The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender
         from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
         reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on
         behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other
         communications with an Agent may be recorded by such Agent, and each of
         the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

         11.2 RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable Law
or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default and the commencement of remedies described in
Section 9.2, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind (all of which
rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to appropriate and apply
any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time
held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation, branches, agencies
or Affiliates of such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit or the
account of any Credit Party against obligations and liabilities of the Credit
Parties to the Lenders hereunder, under the Notes, the other Credit Documents or
otherwise, irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall
have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations, liabilities or
claims, or any of them, may be contingent or


                                       77
<PAGE>

unmatured, and any such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default even though such charge is made or
entered on the books of such Lender subsequent thereto. The Credit Parties
hereby agree that any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans and
Commitments hereunder pursuant to Sections 3.8 or 11.3(e) may exercise all
rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as fully as if such
Person were a Lender hereunder. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
acknowledges that a portion of the deposits and other funds of the Credit
Parties and their Subsidiaries held in accounts with the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, if any, may consist of funds owned by one or more Affiliated
Practices but held by the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries on behalf of
such Affiliated Practice(s).

         11.3 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a) The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding
         upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
         Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
         and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
         with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
         participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of
         this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security

         Section, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of
         subsection (g) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
         transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this
         Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
         upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
         successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
         provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
         contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right,
         remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.

                  (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
         Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
         Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the
         Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b) Participation
         Interests in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that
         (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount
         of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
         it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a
         Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this
         Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the
         Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
         thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date
         the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
         delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified
         in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be
         less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so
         long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans
         or the Commitment assigned, (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must
         be approved by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer unless the
         Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not
         the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee);
         and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
         the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
         processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and
         recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection
         (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
         each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall
         be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest
         assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and
         obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning
         Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
         Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
         Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
         covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
         this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
         shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.12,
         3.13, 3.14, and 11.5(b) with respect to facts and circumstances
         occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
         request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note
         to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
         rights or obligations


                                       78
<PAGE>


         under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection
         shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by
         such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
         accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose
         as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
         Agent's Office located in Charlotte, North Carolina a copy of each
         Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
         Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations
         owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
         (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
         the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each
         Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
         hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
         and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
         notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
         participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the
         Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
         "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or
         obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations
         in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
         obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
         such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
         for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
         solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
         rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or
         instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall
         provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
         Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
         of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement
         or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
         consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other
         modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.6 that
         directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
         Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
         the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 to the same extent as
         if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
         pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
         Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
         3.7 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
         subject to Section 3.8 as though it were a Lender.

                  (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment under Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 than the applicable
         Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
         participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
         participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
         written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it
         were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.13
         unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
         Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
         Borrower, to comply with Section 3.13(f) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
         interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
         Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of
         such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
         to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
         shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
         substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
         hereto.

                  (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
         any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding
         vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
         Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the
         option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender
         would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Credit Agreement;
         provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any
         SPC to fund any


                                       79
<PAGE>
         Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or
         otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting
         Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms
         hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (A) neither the grant to
         any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the
         costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of
         the Borrower under this Credit Agreement (including its obligations
         under Sections 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14), (B) no SPC shall be liable
         for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Credit
         Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (C) the Granting
         Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment,
         waiver or other modification of any provision of any Credit Document,
         remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPC
         hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the
         same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In
         furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
         agreement shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement) that,
         prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in
         full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any
         SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in
         instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization,
         arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the Laws of
         the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without
         prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without
         paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or any portion of its
         right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting
         Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
         information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency,
         commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or
         credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
         any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any
         portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to
         the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by
         such Fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided that
         unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance
         with the other provisions of this Section 11.3, (i) no such pledge
         shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the
         Credit Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to
         exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Credit Documents even
         though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to
         the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
         if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans
         pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may upon 30 days'
         notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the
         event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be
         entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer
         hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to
         appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of
         America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it
         shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder
         with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective
         date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with
         respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make
         Loans or fund risk participations pursuant to Section 2.2.

         11.4 NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other Credit Party
and any Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under
any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The
rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which any Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice
to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to
any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agents or the Lenders to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5 ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES, TAXES AND INDEMNIFICATION BY CREDIT
         PARTIES.

                  (a) The Credit Parties agree (i) to pay or reimburse the
         Agents and the Arranger for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
         in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and
         execution of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and
         any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions
         hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
         or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of
         the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all
         reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, and (ii) to pay or
         reimburse each Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses
         incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or
         preservation of any rights or remedies under this Credit Agreement or
         the other Credit Documents (including all such costs and expenses
         incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Credit
         Party Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any
         proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all reasonable fees
         and expenses of legal counsel. The foregoing costs and expenses shall
         include all search, filing, recording, and appraisal charges and fees
         and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
         the Agents and the Arranger and the cost of independent public
         accountants and other outside experts retained by either Agent, the
         Arranger or any Lender. Other than costs and expenses payable in
         connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
         Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 11.5(a) (which shall be payable on
         the Closing Date unless otherwise agreed by the Agents and the
         Arranger), all amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable
         within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this
         Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments and repayment
         of all other Credit Party Obligations.

                  (b) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
         consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each
         Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates,
         directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact
         (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
         liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands,
         actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including
         the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any kind or
         nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or
         asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising
         out of or in connection with (i) the execution, delivery, enforcement,
         performance or administration of any Credit Document or any other
         agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the
         transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Commitment, Loan or Letter
         of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom
         (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment
         under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with
         such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
         Credit), or (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
         Hazardous Substances on or from any property currently or formerly
         owned or operated by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Credit
         Party, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to the Borrower,
         any Subsidiary or any other Credit Party, or (iv) any actual or
         prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
         any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
         theory (including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of
         any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or
         proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto
         (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), in
         all cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part,
         out of the negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity
         shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
         liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands,
         actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
         nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable
         for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or
         other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
         information transmission systems in connection with this Credit
         Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect
         or consequential damages relating to this Credit Agreement or any other
         Credit Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith
         or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date). All amounts
         due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable within ten Business Days
         after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
         resignation of the either Agent, the replacement of any


                                       81
<PAGE>

         Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment,
         satisfaction or discharge of all the other Credit Party Obligations.

         11.6 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of
the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing and signed by the Required Lenders and the then Credit Parties; provided
that no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination shall, without
the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby:

                  (a) extend the Maturity Date;

                  (b) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
         (other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any
         post-default increase in interest rates or as a result of waiving any
         mandatory prepayment required by Section 3.3(b)) on the Loans or fees
         hereunder;

                  (c) reduce or waive the principal amount of any Loan or extend
         the time of payment thereof (other than as a result of waiving any
         mandatory prepayment required by Section 3.3(b));

                  (d) increase or extend the Commitment of a Lender (it being
         understood and agreed that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default
         or a waiver of any mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not
         constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Lender);

                  (e) release the Borrower from its obligations or consent to
         the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and
         obligations under (or in respect of) the Credit Documents, release all
         or substantially all of the Guarantors from their respective
         obligations under the Credit Documents or release all or substantially
         all of the Collateral; provided that the Collateral Agent shall have
         the authority to release Collateral sold, transferred or otherwise
         disposed of pursuant to an asset disposition permitted under Section
         8.4 without the consent of any Lender;

                  (f) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 11.6
         or Sections 3.7, 3.8, 9.1(a), 11.2, 11.3 or 11.5; or

                  (g) reduce any percentage specified in, or otherwise modify,
         the definition of Required Lenders.

         Notwithstanding the above, (i) no provision of Section 3.4(c) may be
amended or modified without the consent of the Administrative Agent, (ii) no
provision of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document that addresses
the rights or obligations of either Agent (including, without limitation,
Section 10) may be amended or modified without prior written consent of such
Agent, (iii) no provision of Sections 2.2 or 3.4(b)and no other provision of
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document that addresses the rights or
obligations of the L/C Issuer may be amended or modified without the prior
written consent of the L/C Issuer, (iv) no amendment, waiver or consent shall
affect the rights or duties of the Alternative Rate Lender under this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document unless in writing and signed by the
Alternative Rate Lender and (v) any Alternative Rate Agreement (including the
Alternative Rate payable by the Borrower thereunder) and Section 3.14(b) may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only
by the Borrower and the Alternative Rate Lender.

         Each Lender understands and agrees that if such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender then, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11.6, it shall not
be entitled to vote on any matter requiring the consent of the Required Lenders
or to object to any matter requiring the consent of all the Lenders; provided,
however, that all other benefits and obligations under the Credit Documents
shall apply to such Defaulting Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (A) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any reorganization plan that affects
the Credit Party Obligation, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the


                                       82
<PAGE>

unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (B) the Required Lenders may
consent to allow a Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

         11.7 COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         11.8 HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of
any provision of this Credit Agreement.

         11.9 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

                  (a) Survival of Indemnification. All indemnities set forth
         herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Credit
         Agreement, the making of any Credit Extension and the repayment of the
         Loans and other Credit Party Obligations and the termination of the
         Commitments hereunder.

                  (b) Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
         representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Credit
         Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in
         connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and
         delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have
         been or will be relied upon by the Agents and each Lender, regardless
         of any investigation made by either Agent or any Lender or on their
         behalf and notwithstanding that either Agent or any Lender may have had
         notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of
         any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as
         long as any Loan or any other Credit Party Obligation hereunder shall
         remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain
         outstanding.

         11.10 GOVERNING LAW; VENUE; JURISDICTION.

                  (a) THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND
         THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER
         SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
         THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402
         OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, BUT EXCLUDING ALL OTHER CHOICE
         OF LAW AND CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES). Any legal action or proceeding with
         respect to this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document may be
         brought in the courts of the State of North Carolina or of the United
         States for the Western District of North Carolina, and, by execution
         and delivery of this Credit Agreement, each Credit Party hereby
         irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its Property,
         generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts. Each
         Credit Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
         action or proceeding with respect to this Credit Agreement or any other
         Credit Document by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or
         certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at the address for notices
         pursuant to Section 11.1, such service to become effective ten days
         after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of a Lender
         to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law or to commence
         legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against a Credit Party in any
         other jurisdiction. Each Credit Party agrees that a final judgment in
         any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
         other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
         provided by Law; provided that nothing in this Section 11.10(a) is
         intended to impair a Credit Party's right under applicable Law to
         appeal or seek a stay of any judgment.

                  (b) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection
         which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
         aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document in the courts
         referred to in subsection (a) above and


                                       83
<PAGE>

         hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in
         any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such
         court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         11.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

         EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY. Each of the parties to this
Credit Agreement agrees not to assert any claim against any other party hereto,
Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out
of or otherwise relating to any of the transactions contemplated herein and in
the other Credit Documents.

         11.12 SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of any of the Credit Documents is determined to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions.

         11.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES.

         The Credit Parties agree, upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
to promptly take such actions, as reasonably requested, as is necessary to carry
out the intent of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
including without limitation such actions as are necessary or desirable in
connection with the creation, perfection and maintenance of the security
interests of the Lenders in the Collateral.

         11.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to keep
confidential any non-public information from time to time supplied to it under
any Credit Document; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the
disclosure of any such information to (a) the extent a Lender in good faith
believes such disclosure is required by Law or judicial process, (b) counsel for
a Lender or to its accountants, (c) bank examiners or auditors or comparable
Persons, (d) any Affiliate of a Lender, (e) any other Lender, or any assignee,
transferee or Participant, or any potential assignee, transferee or Participant,
of all or any portion of any Lender's rights under this Credit Agreement who is
notified of the confidential nature of such information or (f) any other Person
in connection with (i) any litigation to which any one or more of the Lenders is
a party if required by a court of Law of competent jurisdiction or (ii) any
proceeding to enforce such Lender's rights hereunder, under any other Credit
Document or under any Hedging Agreement. No Lender shall have any obligation
under this Section 11.14 to the extent any such information becomes available on
a non-confidential basis from a source other than a Credit Party or that any
information becomes publicly available other than by a breach of this Section
11.14 by any Lender or representative thereof.

         11.15 ENTIRETY.

         This Credit Agreement together with the other Credit Documents and the
Fee Letter represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any,
including any commitment letters or correspondence relating to the Credit
Documents or the transactions contemplated herein and therein.

         11.16 BINDING EFFECT; CONTINUING AGREEMENT.

                  (a) This Credit Agreement shall become effective at such time
         when all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been satisfied
         or waived by the Lenders and it shall have been executed by the
         Borrower, the Guarantors and the Administrative Agent, and the
         Administrative Agent shall have received

         copies hereof (telefaxed or otherwise) which, when taken together, bear
         the signatures of each Lender, and thereafter this Credit Agreement
         shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
         Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their
         respective successors and assigns.

                  (b) This Credit Agreement shall be a continuing agreement and
         shall remain in full force and effect until all Loans, interest, fees
         and other Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and all
         Letters of Credit and Commitments have been terminated. Upon
         termination, the Credit Parties shall have no further obligations
         (other than the indemnification provisions and other provisions that by
         their terms survive) under the Credit Documents; provided that should
         any payment, in whole or in part, of the Credit Party Obligations be
         rescinded or otherwise required to be restored or returned by the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether as a result of any
         proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, then the
         Credit Documents shall automatically be reinstated and all amounts
         required to be restored or returned and all costs and expenses incurred
         by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection therewith shall
         be deemed included as part of the Credit Party Obligations.
