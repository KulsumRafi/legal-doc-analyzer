shall perform for Employer the executive, administrative and technical duties
customarily associated with such position, as well as such other duties

appropriate to a senior executive of a corporation and consistent with
Executive&#146;s experience, education and background.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, (i)&nbsp;Executive shall
devote his full time and efforts during normal business days and hours to the
performance of this Employment Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;Executive shall not engage in

affiliates (collectively, &#147;Ivy&#148;) as Executive deems reasonably necessary; so
long as, in either case, the devotion of such time and effort does not conflict
(without independent committee review) or interfere with Executive&#146;s
performance of his duties as Executive Vice President of Presidential and in
fact Executive does diligently perform his duties as Executive Vice President
of Presidential to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors of Employer.
During the term of this Employment Agreement, Employer will permit Executive,

the end of such Bonus Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the bonus in any
Bonus Year shall not exceed 33-1/3% of the salary compensation set forth in

of Replacement Automobile.</B> Upon the request of Executive made
subsequent to April&nbsp;1, 2003 Employer shall make available to Executive a new
automobile for Executive&#146;s use, said automobile to be of a make and model
reasonably acceptable to Executive. Said automobile shall, at Employer&#146;s
option, be either leased by Employer or purchased by Employer (title to remain
in Employer&#146;s name). The purchase price of said automobile (exclusive of
taxes), regardless of whether said automobile is purchased or leased by
Employer, shall not exceed $47,000 during the term of this contract; provided,
however, that Executive may select a car costing more than $47,000 if Executive
pays for the increased costs to purchase or lease such automobile. Employer
shall be responsible for all costs of ownership attributable to said vehicle,
including but not limited to insurance, gas, oil, maintenance, repairs, etc.
On the termination of Executive&#146;s employment, if Employer has purchased the
vehicle, Executive may at any time within three (3)&nbsp;weeks following the
effective date of termination purchase the vehicle from Employer at a price
equal to the then &#147;blue book&#148; value of the vehicle times a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount paid for said vehicle by Employer, including
sales tax, &#147;dealer prep&#148;, etc., but excluding any contributions made by

earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the aforementioned three (3)&nbsp;week period, or

pay to Executive the &#147;blue book value&#148; of the vehicle, times a fraction, the

If (i)&nbsp;Executive does not timely purchase the vehicle, and (ii)&nbsp;Employer does
not desire to retain ownership and Executive has contributed towards the
purchase thereof, Employer shall promptly sell the vehicle and the parties
shall divide the actual net sales proceeds (after sales taxes and advertising
costs, if any), with Executive receiving a fraction (being the same fraction
described in the immediately preceding sentence) thereof and Employer receiving
